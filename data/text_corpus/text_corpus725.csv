3625,the effects of inlet configurations in sediment retention ponds srps have been widely investigated by several researchers however when considering temperature differentials in the ponds where density and buoyancy change with temperature the challenges associated with the proper inlet design still exist the buoyancy forces are generated due to the differences in temperature potentially changing the flow in the pond by forming density currents this study evaluates the effects of different inlet width ratios iwrs on the flow pattern and residence time in a sediment retention pond when inflow is colder or hotter than the water in the pond in this research an innovative experimental setup was used to create the temperature differentials the results in the present study show that when the inflow temperature is colder than the water temperature in the pond increasing the inlet width to the full pond width can effectively increase the pond s performance likewise when the inflow temperature is hotter than the water temperature in the pond decreasing the inlet width to 30 of the pond width can successfully improve the performance of the pond keywords sediment retention ponds hydraulic performance temperature differential buoyancy driven flow inlet width ratio bulk densimetric froude number entrainment ratio 1 introduction land disturbing activities and transported sediments to the receiving environment is of concern and finding effective measures to control the adverse effects of them need special monitoring to quantify its sources hicks et al 2011 in particular transported suspended sediment will contaminate streams rivers lakes and reservoirs and cause water pollution because they increase water turbidity and carry nutrients and other pollutants barrett et al 1992 grecay targett 1996 special strategies and technologies are needed to minimise the adverse effects of suspended sediments one of the possible control devices is a sediment retention pond that can be effective in reducing loads of sediment discharged to receiving environments although the sediment retention ponds are effective in reducing sediment discharge to receiving environment their performance needs to be carefully assessed to avoid low sediment removal efficiency in the ponds inflow residence time in the pond is one of the main parameters that can be effective in improving the hydraulic performance of the ponds on the other hand the insufficient residence time of suspended sediment in the retention ponds will cause the fine particles of sediments to exit the pond without proper treatment the governing flow pattern in the pond can significantly affect the residence time the flow pattern comprises of several streamlines which sometimes form dead zones and short circuiting in the pond several parameters can be effective for changing the flow pattern and consequently the hydraulic efficiencies in ponds and wetlands these parameters can be physical and environmental mangelson watters 1972 the hydrodynamics of the ponds can be influenced by the physical parameters such as pond layout persson 2000 length to width ratios persson wittgren 2003 different inlet and outlet configurations holland et al 2004 shilton 2005 deflector islands and floating treatment wetlands khan et al 2013 khan et al 2011 persson wittgren 2003 configuration of baffles farjood et al 2015 khan 2012 persson wittgren 2003 effect of island topographies guzman et al 2018 khan 2012 studied the hydrodynamics of the retention ponds by conducting a laboratory investigation on residence time and short circuiting in sediment retention ponds using a 1 10 scale physical model of an operational sediment retention pond located at the alpurt b2 motorway construction site north of auckland in this study the effects of different baffles configurations deflector island and floating treatment wetland on the performance of a modelled retention pond were examined farjood 2016 also conducted several tracer studies on the the same modelled pond used by khan 2012 in order to investigate the hydraulic efficiency of the pond this study evaluated some of the commonly used hydraulic performance indices together with a new short circuiting index to select the appropriate indices that show low coefficients of variation and high precision for all the experiments moreover the effects of forebay spread inlet and decant outlet on the pond performance were also experimentally investigated in this research in order to compare the performance of the pond with the conventioanl point inlet and outlet design systems apart from the physical parameters environmental parameters such as density can affect the performance of the pond generally an inflow entering a receiving body of water has a different density to that of the receiving water depending on the density of the inflow the inflow will flow on the surface sink to the bottom or migrate to the intermediate layer of the receiving water inflow floating on the surface of the receiving water is known as being positively buoyant or buoyant while inflow sinking to the bottom of the receiving environment is known as being negatively buoyant or non buoyant this phenomenon is referred to as the density current if the density of the inflow equals that of the receiving water the inflow will migrate to the intermediate layer which is also known as interflow lee yu 1997 the main sources of creating density currents are turbidity salinity and temperature alavian et al 1992 inflow temperature usually differs from the temperature of the receiving ambient water therefore the buoyancy of the surrounding fluid reduces the gravity force due to the density difference between the inflow and the ambient water in the pond the buoyancy force affects the trajectory of the inflow and forms the density currents maccready et al 1999 three dimensional numerical modelling has been used by adamsson and bergdahl 2006 to investigate the temperature difference of inflow and the ambient water in a detention tank temperature has also been investigated in waste stabilization ponds by using a physical laboratory model of the existing ponds in the logan pond system in usa mangelson watters 1972 mangelson and watters 1972 used salt water to create the required density difference and simulate stratified flow situations the results of this study showed that the densimetric froude number f r d u m g d where um mean flow velocity d height of the flow and g π reduced gravity was important in modelling the density stratified flows however using salt water to give the necessary density difference was found to be ineffective as it couldn t preserve the densimetric froude number between model and prototype in the real world application cases macdonald and ernst 1986 performed a tracer study in two maturation ponds the findings showed that the median detention times were significantly less than the nominal residence time short circuiting resulting from thermal stratification was assumed to be the main reason for the low detention times of the maturation ponds lightbody et al 2009 also performed a tracer study on a treatment wetland in augusta georgia and identified flow paths that caused short circuiting sc within wetlands the velocity measurements in this study showed that the area averaged velocity of these flow paths was 10 times the velocity observed where water passed through vegetation the main reason for the high velocity variations was temperature differences between shallow vegetated and deep open water zones there is very limited research that investigates the effect of temperature and the buoyancy driven flows experimentally using temperature difference instead of creating density difference using fluids with different densities hendi et al 2018 investigated the effect of temperature on the performance of the retention ponds using a state of the art system to change the temperature of water for creating density difference instead of using two solutions with different densities more recently hosseini et al 2021 investigated the density current flow pattern using physical modelling in this study the entrainment ratio was considered to be a function of the richardson number and it was shown that the entrainment ratio of the currents decreased with an increase in the richardson number however more comprehensive studies can help to illuminate these debates by investigating density currents and their impact on the physical parameters of the ponds various configurations such as design and the position of the inlet and outlet can significantly influence the flow pattern in the ponds therefore the inlet and the outlet design has been widely investigated in a number of studies to identify the best configuration agunwamba 2006 bajcar et al 2011 de oliveira et al 2011 the challenges associated with the proper inlet and outlet design such as inlet and outlet size and location still exist when considering temperature differences between the inflow and the water in the pond since the source of the temperature difference arises from the inlet changing outlet configurations may not solve the issues associated with temperature induced density currents while the careful design of the inlet is a determining factor crittenden et al 2012 therefore a well designed inlet can minimize temperature effects agunwamba 2006 shih et al 2017 ta brignal 1998 no previous study has investigated the impacts of different temperatures of inflow to the pond water on the criteria for selecting the best inlet width this study examines the effect of various inlet width ratios on the performance of the sediment retention pond when temperature differentials exist the experiments are carried out using tracer studies for different temperature scenarios moreover the potential changes in velocity vectors were also investigated using velocity measurements of the middle longitudinal section of the pond 2 materials and methods the physical model is a trapezoidal pond made from transparent acrylic sheets fitted on a steel frame with top dimensions of 4 1 1 6 m 0 3 m deep and a bank slope of 2 1 the pond is preceded by a rectangular tank of 0 3 1 6 0 2 m serving as the sediment forebay fig 1 farjood et al 2015 khan et al 2011 see figs 2 4 investigation of the effects of temperature on the performance of sediment retention ponds was the core of this research to do that several temperature differentials needed to be created in the system in which the water temperature at the inlet was higher or lower than the temperature of the water in the pond therefore it was not possible to use laboratory tap water for each experiment as the temperature of the laboratory tap water was not controlled thus a plastic water tank with a volume of 10 000 l was used to provide the required inflow to the pond as the experiments were performed in 1 l s and 2 l s inflow rates approximately 8000 l of water were required to do each experiment changing the temperature of this amount of water would be a daunting task as it requires 33520 kj energy to increase the temperature of 8000 l of water by 1 c this challenging task has been resolved by designing a state of the art system comprised of two separate recirculating systems each system was composed of one heat pump in which the 11 kw unit was used to change the temperature of water in the pond and the 21 kw unit was used to change the temperature of water in the tank to be used as inflow before starting the experiments the water in the tank was pumped to the forebay and over a level spreader into the retention pond the effluent at this stage was carried by a 40 mm pipe to the waste after ensuring steady flow conditions in the pond with the volume of water in the pond remaining constant the effluent in the pond and the water in the tank recirculated in two different systems after changing the temperature of the water the direction of the motorised valves was changed using a switch to pump the water in the tank to the pond the motorised valves were used to prevent changing the velocity fields within the pond as all the valves were automatically rotated at the same time 2 1 tracer studies hydraulic residence time hrt is a key factor in investigating the sediment treatment efficiency of ponds and wetlands the hydraulic residence time is a measure of the time a parcel of water spends within a system and it depends on the streamline of each particle nix 1985 thackston et al 1987 since each particle of water pursues a particular path there is a specific hrt for each of the water parcels these variations in hrt can be explained by generating the residence time distribution rtd curves which represent the temporal probability distribution of non reacting tracer particles within the system van de vusse 1959 the tracer such as the cation lithium kadlec 1994 the anion bromide grismer et al 2001 or the fluorescent dyes khan 2012 can be added to the system inlet as an impulse or a step change werner kadlec 1996 to create rtd curves in this study rhodamine wt rwt was selected as the tracer dye due to the numerous advantages over the other tracers such as being readily soluble in water highly detectable by fluorometers mostly unaffected by background fluorescence minimally degradable in short times harmless in low concentrations wilson et al 1968 and cost effective 2 2 hydraulic performance indices the hydraulic performance of ponds can be evaluated by analysing the residence time distribution rtd curve in this study the hydraulic performance of the pond was assessed using the hydraulic indices recommended by farjood et al 2015 which are t 5 for short circuiting sc the moment index mi for the hydraulic efficiency and the invert morril index mo 1 for mixing the index t 5 is the normalised time for passage of the 5 of added tracer through the outlet the lower t5 sc indicates lower time required for passage of the 5 of added tracer through the outlet and consequently shows a high likelihood of short circuiting in the pond the invert morril index mo 1 is defined as t10 t90 where t10 and t90 are the times for 10 and 90 of the added tracer to exit the system respectively the higher mo 1 indicates higher mixing occurring within the pond the moment index proposed by wahl et al 2010 is defined as 1 mi 1 0 1 1 t c t d t where c c c 0 c is the concentration of the tracer c0 is the amount of tracer added to the pond divided by the pond volume t t t n is the normalised time which is the measured time divided by the nominal residence time and mi is bounded from zero to one with mi 1 described as maximum hydraulic efficiency 2 3 entrainment and buoyancy inflow density typically differs from the density of the receiving ambient water therefore the buoyancy of the surrounding fluid reduces the gravity force by calculating net force due to density difference as follows mangelson watters 1972 2 reduced gravity g œÅ 1 œÅ 2 œÅ 1 g where œÅ 2 denotes the inflow density and œÅ 1 indicates the density of the receiving ambient water accordingly the buoyancy force not only affects the trajectory of the inflow but also predicts the behaviour of density currents maccready et al 1999 the influence of density differences can be quantified by measuring the bulk densimetric froude number frd 0 as follows mangelson watters 1972 3 f r d u m g d where um denotes the mean flow velocity which is calculated using the continuity equation i e um q a and d indicates the height of the flow at a selected cross section a higher frd indicates lower density differences therefore the frd becomes infinity when the flow is not stratified global buoyancy decays over time in which the preferential flow patterns become weaker and eventually disappears the magnitude of this decay is largely determined by the amount of interfacial mixing or entrainment that occurs between these density currents and the lighter overlying water masses wells et al 2010 therefore another important characteristic of density current is the amount of interfacial mixing or entrainment that occurs between the layers with different densities the interfacial turbulence that occurs on the interface line between fluids with varying densities can significantly affect the flow dynamics these effects were quantified using the entrainment hypothesis proposed by taylor 1946 as follows 4 e w u m where e is the entrainment ratio w is the entrainment velocity and um is the downstream mean velocity therefore a higher entrainment ratio delineates higher entrainment velocity that interferes with the main flow path of buoyant flow and changes the efficiency of the pond it is noted that the aforementioned parameter is known as turner 1986 entrainment parameterisation in the literature 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 tracer measurements the hydraulic performance of the pond is directly related to the hydraulic residence time of the inflow particles into the pond therefore tracer investigations have been done in this study to quantify the residence time of the inflow particles using a chemically inactive tracer to investigate the temperature effects on the hydrodynamics of the model pond the tracer experiments were conducted in this study and the results from the tracer study were used to compare the different temperature configurations alongside the effective countermeasures to attenuate the negative effects of temperature differentials the hydraulic residence time of the inflow particles was analysed by developing the rtd curves from the tracer experiments rhodamine wt fluorescent dye was used as the tracer for all the experiments as recommended in previous research adamsson bergdahl 2006 farjood 2016 khan 2012 shilton 2005 rhodamine wt has several advantages over other tracers which make it one of the most suitable dyes to be used in tracer studies these advantages include low detection limit negligible background interference low cost and minimal effects of dissolved solids on its performance headley tanner 2012 khan 2012 as the temperature differentials are the main focus of this study it was important to make sure that the rhodamine wt followed the same flow pattern of inflow water therefore as the rhodamine wt has a specific gravity of 1 2 the tracer was diluted with water to avoid sinking to the bottom of the pond the water used for diluting the tracer has the same temperature of inflow to maintain consistency rhodamine wt consists of 20 pure substance and 80 carrier which is water in this study a 30 ml amount of the solution of 1g l of rhodamine wt and water was typically used to do the experiments however the amount of the solution varied based on the detection level of the fluorometer for example in some test cases a 30 ml amount of the solution produced a low concentration at the outlet which was close to the lower excitation limit of the probe therefore it created a noisy output in contrast in some test cases a 30 ml amount of the solution produced a high concentration at the outlet which was close to the upper excitation limit of the probe similarly it created a noisy output therefore in some test cases it was necessary to adjust the amount of the solution to get a high signal to noise ratio it is to be noted that the variations in the tracer concentration did not affect the results because the final rtds were normalised to the mass of tracer recovered therefore the desired amount of 1g l solution of rhodamine wt which varied in each configuration due to the excitation limit of the sensor was poured into the plastic caps equally and then by rotating the bar the pulsed addition of tracer was achieved fig 5 the injection time was small enough to ensure that the concentration remains the same during the chosen increment which is less than five seconds in this study and similar to the previous study of fogler 2010 this is known as the pulse input tracer injection method which is a widely used technique farjood 2016 khan 2012 persson 2000 the concentration of rhodamine wt solutions was measured using a fluorimeter cyclops 7 rhodamine manufactured by turner designs the submersible cyclops sensor is a detector that delivers an output voltage representing the concentration of the rhodamine wt fig 6 to convert the voltage output to the concentration of the tracer the sensor was calibrated by creating a graph that was composed of two axes representing the known concentration and its corresponding voltage as shown in fig 7 the linear trend line equation of the calibration graph was used to calibrate the experiments of this study 2 rhodamine wt concentration recorded signal 0 0257 0 0094 the recorded output signals were then translated to the concentration values by using the calibration curve shown in fig 7 the produced curve at this stage is normalised using the mass of the recovered tracer and nominal residence time for normalising the recorded concentration and time respectively to create the rtd curves the rtd curves were used to show the overall performance of the pond as several hydraulic parameters can be inferred from them such as short circuiting indices hydraulic efficiency indices and mixing indices through these parameters the most important phenomena in the pond were assessed to evaluate the overall performance of the pond 2 4 2 temperature measurements before the start of the experiments the temperature measurements were performed at the inlet outlet and the middle section of the pond to ensure the consistency of the temperature within the pond although the temperature was regulated using two heat exchanger units it was necessary to measure the temperature of water within the pond and forebay by using a thermometer the thermometer used in the present study was capable of measuring the temperature in four different locations therefore the probes were located at the top of the forebay outlet riser and the top and bottom of the middle cross section of the pond the reason for placing one of the probes on top of the forebay was to measure the temperature of inflow upon entering the pond the rationale behind placing the two of the probes on top and bottom of the middle cross section of the pond was to measure the temperature of the top one third and bottom one third of the water depth in the pond to ensure the uniformity of the temperature distribution throughout the water column finally the outlet riser temperature probe was placed in the outlet riser to check the outflow temperature after the start of the experiments the temperature measurements were performed using the thermistor embedded in the velocimeter probe the thermistor can measure and report the temperature in degrees celsius therefore the temperature measurements were performed at each velocity point location the temperature measurements within the pond were then used to illustrate the thermal structure of the pond 2 4 3 velocity measurements it is expected to observe different flow patterns in the pond in various temperature configurations such as isothermal cold influent and hot influent test cases since the cold influent tends to sink to the bottom and the hot influent tends to flow on the top of the pond the preferential flow patterns formed on the top and bottom of the pond therefore velocity measurements were performed to evaluate the flow pattern and the velocity distribution in the pond useful to shed light on dissimilarities between the isothermal case and thermal variation cases in the isothermal temperature configuration it is relatively quick to measure the velocity at the required location in this flow condition the probe is located at the required point to measure the velocity and it can be moved to the other point for the next measurement without any adjustment this occurs due to the steady state flow condition in the system in which the velocity at each point is not going to change during the velocity measurement however the temperature difference between the inflow and the water in the pond in each experiment resulted in changing the steady state flow condition of isothermal experiments to a transient flow condition therefore the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow such as velocity and density changed during the experiments furthermore for continuous inflow as the time elapsed increases the temperature difference decreases the velocity decreases and the bottom or top preferential flow becomes weaker and the flow tends to return to its isothermal form therefore in transient flow condition it was required to measure the velocity at each point for a period equal to the time required for the whole amount of tracer to be recovered at the outlet following the measurement of the first point the temperature configuration required to be reset and then the next velocity measurement could be performed furthermore it was required to repeat the velocity measurements for checking the validity of the results this made the velocity measurements extremely time consuming therefore it was decided to measure the velocity on the middle longitudinal section of the pond a vectrino ii velocimeter was used to measure the velocity in various locations the vectrino ii consists of four receiving transducers and a transmitting transducer see fig 8 the centre transducer transmits a pulse and the reflected pulses resulted from the impact of the pulse and the suspended particles in the water are received by the receive transducers therefore the doppler effect provides the opportunity to measure the velocity by measuring the changes in the frequency of the receiving echoes the velocimeter is capable of measuring the three velocity components for a range with a sampling rate of up to 100 hz the vectrino ii velocimeter was mounted on the stable steel structure which was vertically and horizontally adjustable fig 8 the velocity measurements at each point produced a time series of the recorded velocities and by analysing the results it was possible to capture the velocities at the required time intervals therefore the filtered velocities were averaged throughout 10 second periods i e from 95sec to 105sec to obtain the velocity at 100sec at each point the velocity measurements were performed in the middle longitudinal section of the pond as a representative section fig 9 several measurement points were identified in the middle longitudinal section as shown in fig 9 this arrangement of points helped in identifying the most prominent flow field in each temperature configuration and was useful to find the stagnation and recirculation parts 3 results and discussion 3 1 the test cases several inlet width ratios were examined to find the best configuration in two different temperature configurations colder influent and hotter influent fig 10 the inlet width ratio iwr is the ratio of opening width to the pond width the iwr was changed from 1 0 full width inlet to 0 3 centre inlet to check the sensitivity of the hydraulic performance indices to the opening width of the inlet this reduction has been done by using acrylic sheets with 10 mm thickness it is noted that iwr 1 0 was the highest possible iwr and iwr 0 3 was the lowest possible practical ratio an iwr below 0 3 caused the forebay to overflow and an iwr above 1 0 was impractical during all tests the dimensions of the forebay remained unchanged in all experiments the inflow temperature was the same 16 c and the temperature of the water in the pond was hotter or colder than the inflow water depending on the adjusted temperature of the pond water to test the effect of temperature variations on the performance of the pond in the selected iwrs two conditions were selected in the first condition the temperature of water in the pond was hotter than the influent and in the second condition the temperature of water in the pond was colder than the influent from the results of densimetric froude numbers presented by hendi et al 2018 we can see that even a temperature difference of 0 5 c can change the expected flow pattern however in this study 4 c was selected for the temperature differences between the pond and inflow to examine the effect of various iwrs on the performance of the pond when temperature differentials exist the flow rate used in this set of experiments was 1 l s 3 2 effect of iwr variations on rtd curves since the cold influent tends to sink to the bottom and the hot influent tends to flow on the top of the pond the inlet width plays a critical role in changing the flow pattern as it changes the initial velocity of the inflow particles the relationship between the iwrs and the hydraulic performance indices is graphically shown in fig 11 as can be seen in this figure in the cold influent test cases all of the hydraulic indices were reduced when iwr was reduced while the reverse is true for hot influent test cases in iwrs of lower than 0 65 the mi index was slightly increased by about 1 in hot influent test cases a significant increase in mi was observed in the transition from the inlet width ratio of 0 65 to 0 9 in hot influent test cases in cold influent test cases the trends were more uniform indicating a gradual increase of mi with increasing iwr from 0 3 to 1 0 overall the mi index increased by about 11 with iwr increased from 0 3 to 1 0 for cold influent test cases and it increased by about 12 with iwr decreased from 1 0 to 0 3 for hot influent test cases similar trends were also observed in the short circuiting index trendlines except for the cold influent test cases that sc slightly increased by about 1 with increasing the iwr from 0 3 to 0 65 the sc index was increased by about 9 in cold influent test cases with iwr increased from 0 3 to 1 0 in the hot influent test cases sc increased by about 10 therefore the inlet width can be changed to reduce the short circuiting issues in the pond when dealing with temperature differentials mo 1 was also observed to follow the similar trends of mi and sc index emphasizing the fact that mixing was also improved when changing the inlet width in different configurations however the improvements made by changing iwr was not as significant as the improvements in mi and sc index this implies that changing the inlet width cannot be considered as the main option to improve mixing in the ponds and other options such as baffles need to be included to be more effective 3 3 the effect of bulk densimetric froude number on hydraulic performance indices as discussed in section 2 3 in a free surface flow the gravitational and the inertia forces are important for effectively modelling the hydrodynamics of flow furthermore the temperature differences between the inflow and the water in the pond can significantly change the flow pattern due to the buoyancy effects created by density differences between the inflow and existing water in the pond therefore to investigate the importance of inertial and density gravity forces it is essential to compare the hydraulic index values with the corresponding frd which is the ratio of gravity to inertia forces since the selected cross section is the inlet the inlet bulk densimetric froude number frd 0 is used in this study the entrainment ratio was compared with the corresponding frd 0 at six points at the top and bottom of the pond fig 12 figs 13 18 provide the results obtained from the comparison of the entrainment ratio and the inlet frd 0 in these graphs the presented trendlines are representative of various elapsed times from the start of the experiments for a given temperature and flow rate configuration furthermore the temperature difference is similar in all test cases of this study therefore higher inlet frd 0 delineates on a shorter inlet width and vice versa the results shown in figs 13 18 illustrate the contrasting behaviour of cold and hot influent test cases with different iwrs in hot influent test cases the entrainment ratio increases alongside increasing the inlet frd 0 at location points p1 p3 and p5 the aforementioned points were located close to the water s surface conversely the results of the bottom points showed a different trend in which the entrainment ratio decreased with an increased inlet frd 0 therefore a shorter inlet width provides a higher entrainment ratio at the top of the pond and a lower entrainment ratio at the bottom of the pond according to equation 4 the entrainment ratio is the ratio of entrainment velocity to the downstream mean velocity therefore a higher entrainment ratio delineates a higher entrainment velocity while a lower entrainment ratio indicates a lower entrainment velocity the shortest inlet width i e iwr 0 30 creates a higher entrainment velocity at the top of the pond this interferes with the main flow path of buoyant flow particularly at p1 which shows the highest entrainment ratio in cold influent test cases the entrainment ratio increased with an increase in the inlet frd 0 at points p2 p4 and p6 the aforementioned points were located close to the bottom of the pond conversely the top points showed a different trend in which the entrainment ratio decreased with an increased inlet frd 0 therefore the widest inlet width i e iwr 1 00 creates higher entrainment velocity at the bottom of the pond and this subsequently interferes with the main flow path of the non buoyant flow these occurrences justify the increasing and decreasing trend in the hydraulic performance indices in the hot and the cold influent test cases respectively 4 effect of temperature on flow patterns with various inlet width ratios velocity vectors were measured in the middle longitudinal section of the pond from the inlet to the outlet riser three hundred equally spaced measurement points were used to investigate the governing flow pattern in the pond the longitudinal flow pattern was investigated using the velocity vectors to identify the circulation and stagnation zones the location of the cross section and the measurement points are shown in fig 9 the results presented here concern the two temperature configurations hot and cold influent in which four different iwrs were tested in each temperature configuration as shown in figs 19 and 20 in cold influent test cases with the increasing iwr the inflow particles generally need to follow longer flow paths this is mainly due to the circulation zones created by buoyancy forces as shown in fig 19 the cold inflow of iwr 0 3 must follow a straighter flow path to the outlet this is mainly due to the inflow momentum which pushes the streamlines to the bottom of the pond in 0 65 iwr 1 0 circulation zones were created that increased the flow path length that inflow particles needed to follow to exit the pond the circulation zones occurred due to an inadequate initial velocity which eventually forced the inflow to flow back to the inlet as the kinetic energy was insufficient to homogenise the flow at t tn 0 125 the flow pattern was changed due to the progressive isothermalisation that occurred in the pond as the elapsed time increased when iwr was 0 3 the flow pattern developed askew so that the effect of inlet velocity was no longer significant when iwr was 0 65 and 0 9 the isothermalisation led to a similar flow path without visible circulation zones while in iwr 1 0 the circulation zones still existed in the pond and lengthened the flow path required for inflow particles to exit the pond overall the widest inlet increased the hrt of the tracer this was because the influent needed to travel a longer distance to reach the pond outlet in the cold influent test cases the widest inlet also promoted mixing in the pond due to the circulation zones conversely in the hot influent test cases the shortest inlet width provided the best performance as shown in fig 20 the flow paths tended to remain on top of the pond initially in iwr 0 3 the inflow velocity was high enough to push the streamlines to the bottom of the pond thereafter since the density of hot influent was lower than the water in the pond it returned to the surface and formed a circulation zone this flow pattern was the same for other iwrs however in wider inlet widths the inlet velocity was not sufficient to force the inflow to reach the bottom of the pond or the circulation zones created closer to the inlet area as the elapsed time increased the circulation zones still existed in the pond for iwrs of 0 3 0 65 and 0 9 while for iwr 1 0 no circulation zone was observed and the flow path followed a straight line to the outlet therefore the shortest width encouraged a longer flow path in the pond followed by a circulation zone that became larger as the elapsed time increased the mixing also increased in the pond for the shortest inlet width as water needed to follow the askew flow path to return to the surface of the pond 5 conclusions the effect of inlet configurations on the performance of ponds has been widely investigated in many previous studies however temperature differences between the inflow and water in the pond can change the overall scenario to a more complicated context therefore two different temperature configurations hot and cold influent were investigated in this study to determine the differences between various iwrs when considering that temperature differentials existed in the pond four iwrs have been tested in this study ranged from 1 0 full width inlet to 0 3 centre inlet an iwr of 0 9 was previously recommended by farjood 2016 to avoid sc along the pond sides and to achieve the best performance in an isothermal condition however the results of the present study showed that in the cold influent test cases the wider inlet provided the best hydraulic efficiency and fewer sc issues along with better mixing in the pond conversely the results illustrated that in hot influent test cases the shortest inlet width produced the best performance in the pond the effect of the entrainment ratio was investigated in this study to highlight the relationship of the entrainment ratio against the inlet frd 0 the results underscored the contradictory behaviour of cold and holt influent test cases with different iwrs in the hot influent test cases the shortest inlet width i e iwr 0 30 provided a higher entrainment ratio at the top of the pond and a lower entrainment ratio at the bottom of the pond contrastingly in cold influent test cases the widest inlet width i e iwr 1 00 created higher entrainment velocity at the bottom of the pond which consequently interfered with the main flow path of the non buoyant flow the results of velocity measurements also highlighted dissimilarities by indicating the dominant flow path in the pond for various iwrs in cold influent test cases iwr 1 0 was found to deliver better performance due to the longer flow path that inflow particles needed to follow to reach the outlet this was also accompanied by circulation zones which had been created at the start of the experiments due to the domination of buoyancy forces resulting from lower inlet velocity interestingly in the hot influent test cases the shortest inlet width provided the best performance this was because the flow path in this case needed to remain on the surface of the pond and the shortest inlet width forced the streamlines to reach the bottom of the pond due to the higher inlet velocity as a result the inflow returned to the top of the pond and formed a circulation flow path this pattern was also the same for the other iwr test cases however in wider iwrs the circulation zones were closer to the inlet the findings of this study suggested several courses of action to consider the effect of temperature on hydraulic performance of urban retention ponds furthermore this study suggested using the shorter inlet width when dealing with an inflow hotter than the water in the pond and wider inlet width when the inflow is colder than the water in the pond therefore depending on the temperature configurations a design engineer needs to choose different inlet widths suitable for the practical climate condition of the srps future investigation and experimentation into the effect of the heat transfer by convection at the wall boundaries can enable a better understanding of the effect of heat dissipation through the solid walls furthermore the effect of baffles in the ponds can be

3625,the effects of inlet configurations in sediment retention ponds srps have been widely investigated by several researchers however when considering temperature differentials in the ponds where density and buoyancy change with temperature the challenges associated with the proper inlet design still exist the buoyancy forces are generated due to the differences in temperature potentially changing the flow in the pond by forming density currents this study evaluates the effects of different inlet width ratios iwrs on the flow pattern and residence time in a sediment retention pond when inflow is colder or hotter than the water in the pond in this research an innovative experimental setup was used to create the temperature differentials the results in the present study show that when the inflow temperature is colder than the water temperature in the pond increasing the inlet width to the full pond width can effectively increase the pond s performance likewise when the inflow temperature is hotter than the water temperature in the pond decreasing the inlet width to 30 of the pond width can successfully improve the performance of the pond keywords sediment retention ponds hydraulic performance temperature differential buoyancy driven flow inlet width ratio bulk densimetric froude number entrainment ratio 1 introduction land disturbing activities and transported sediments to the receiving environment is of concern and finding effective measures to control the adverse effects of them need special monitoring to quantify its sources hicks et al 2011 in particular transported suspended sediment will contaminate streams rivers lakes and reservoirs and cause water pollution because they increase water turbidity and carry nutrients and other pollutants barrett et al 1992 grecay targett 1996 special strategies and technologies are needed to minimise the adverse effects of suspended sediments one of the possible control devices is a sediment retention pond that can be effective in reducing loads of sediment discharged to receiving environments although the sediment retention ponds are effective in reducing sediment discharge to receiving environment their performance needs to be carefully assessed to avoid low sediment removal efficiency in the ponds inflow residence time in the pond is one of the main parameters that can be effective in improving the hydraulic performance of the ponds on the other hand the insufficient residence time of suspended sediment in the retention ponds will cause the fine particles of sediments to exit the pond without proper treatment the governing flow pattern in the pond can significantly affect the residence time the flow pattern comprises of several streamlines which sometimes form dead zones and short circuiting in the pond several parameters can be effective for changing the flow pattern and consequently the hydraulic efficiencies in ponds and wetlands these parameters can be physical and environmental mangelson watters 1972 the hydrodynamics of the ponds can be influenced by the physical parameters such as pond layout persson 2000 length to width ratios persson wittgren 2003 different inlet and outlet configurations holland et al 2004 shilton 2005 deflector islands and floating treatment wetlands khan et al 2013 khan et al 2011 persson wittgren 2003 configuration of baffles farjood et al 2015 khan 2012 persson wittgren 2003 effect of island topographies guzman et al 2018 khan 2012 studied the hydrodynamics of the retention ponds by conducting a laboratory investigation on residence time and short circuiting in sediment retention ponds using a 1 10 scale physical model of an operational sediment retention pond located at the alpurt b2 motorway construction site north of auckland in this study the effects of different baffles configurations deflector island and floating treatment wetland on the performance of a modelled retention pond were examined farjood 2016 also conducted several tracer studies on the the same modelled pond used by khan 2012 in order to investigate the hydraulic efficiency of the pond this study evaluated some of the commonly used hydraulic performance indices together with a new short circuiting index to select the appropriate indices that show low coefficients of variation and high precision for all the experiments moreover the effects of forebay spread inlet and decant outlet on the pond performance were also experimentally investigated in this research in order to compare the performance of the pond with the conventioanl point inlet and outlet design systems apart from the physical parameters environmental parameters such as density can affect the performance of the pond generally an inflow entering a receiving body of water has a different density to that of the receiving water depending on the density of the inflow the inflow will flow on the surface sink to the bottom or migrate to the intermediate layer of the receiving water inflow floating on the surface of the receiving water is known as being positively buoyant or buoyant while inflow sinking to the bottom of the receiving environment is known as being negatively buoyant or non buoyant this phenomenon is referred to as the density current if the density of the inflow equals that of the receiving water the inflow will migrate to the intermediate layer which is also known as interflow lee yu 1997 the main sources of creating density currents are turbidity salinity and temperature alavian et al 1992 inflow temperature usually differs from the temperature of the receiving ambient water therefore the buoyancy of the surrounding fluid reduces the gravity force due to the density difference between the inflow and the ambient water in the pond the buoyancy force affects the trajectory of the inflow and forms the density currents maccready et al 1999 three dimensional numerical modelling has been used by adamsson and bergdahl 2006 to investigate the temperature difference of inflow and the ambient water in a detention tank temperature has also been investigated in waste stabilization ponds by using a physical laboratory model of the existing ponds in the logan pond system in usa mangelson watters 1972 mangelson and watters 1972 used salt water to create the required density difference and simulate stratified flow situations the results of this study showed that the densimetric froude number f r d u m g d where um mean flow velocity d height of the flow and g π reduced gravity was important in modelling the density stratified flows however using salt water to give the necessary density difference was found to be ineffective as it couldn t preserve the densimetric froude number between model and prototype in the real world application cases macdonald and ernst 1986 performed a tracer study in two maturation ponds the findings showed that the median detention times were significantly less than the nominal residence time short circuiting resulting from thermal stratification was assumed to be the main reason for the low detention times of the maturation ponds lightbody et al 2009 also performed a tracer study on a treatment wetland in augusta georgia and identified flow paths that caused short circuiting sc within wetlands the velocity measurements in this study showed that the area averaged velocity of these flow paths was 10 times the velocity observed where water passed through vegetation the main reason for the high velocity variations was temperature differences between shallow vegetated and deep open water zones there is very limited research that investigates the effect of temperature and the buoyancy driven flows experimentally using temperature difference instead of creating density difference using fluids with different densities hendi et al 2018 investigated the effect of temperature on the performance of the retention ponds using a state of the art system to change the temperature of water for creating density difference instead of using two solutions with different densities more recently hosseini et al 2021 investigated the density current flow pattern using physical modelling in this study the entrainment ratio was considered to be a function of the richardson number and it was shown that the entrainment ratio of the currents decreased with an increase in the richardson number however more comprehensive studies can help to illuminate these debates by investigating density currents and their impact on the physical parameters of the ponds various configurations such as design and the position of the inlet and outlet can significantly influence the flow pattern in the ponds therefore the inlet and the outlet design has been widely investigated in a number of studies to identify the best configuration agunwamba 2006 bajcar et al 2011 de oliveira et al 2011 the challenges associated with the proper inlet and outlet design such as inlet and outlet size and location still exist when considering temperature differences between the inflow and the water in the pond since the source of the temperature difference arises from the inlet changing outlet configurations may not solve the issues associated with temperature induced density currents while the careful design of the inlet is a determining factor crittenden et al 2012 therefore a well designed inlet can minimize temperature effects agunwamba 2006 shih et al 2017 ta brignal 1998 no previous study has investigated the impacts of different temperatures of inflow to the pond water on the criteria for selecting the best inlet width this study examines the effect of various inlet width ratios on the performance of the sediment retention pond when temperature differentials exist the experiments are carried out using tracer studies for different temperature scenarios moreover the potential changes in velocity vectors were also investigated using velocity measurements of the middle longitudinal section of the pond 2 materials and methods the physical model is a trapezoidal pond made from transparent acrylic sheets fitted on a steel frame with top dimensions of 4 1 1 6 m 0 3 m deep and a bank slope of 2 1 the pond is preceded by a rectangular tank of 0 3 1 6 0 2 m serving as the sediment forebay fig 1 farjood et al 2015 khan et al 2011 see figs 2 4 investigation of the effects of temperature on the performance of sediment retention ponds was the core of this research to do that several temperature differentials needed to be created in the system in which the water temperature at the inlet was higher or lower than the temperature of the water in the pond therefore it was not possible to use laboratory tap water for each experiment as the temperature of the laboratory tap water was not controlled thus a plastic water tank with a volume of 10 000 l was used to provide the required inflow to the pond as the experiments were performed in 1 l s and 2 l s inflow rates approximately 8000 l of water were required to do each experiment changing the temperature of this amount of water would be a daunting task as it requires 33520 kj energy to increase the temperature of 8000 l of water by 1 c this challenging task has been resolved by designing a state of the art system comprised of two separate recirculating systems each system was composed of one heat pump in which the 11 kw unit was used to change the temperature of water in the pond and the 21 kw unit was used to change the temperature of water in the tank to be used as inflow before starting the experiments the water in the tank was pumped to the forebay and over a level spreader into the retention pond the effluent at this stage was carried by a 40 mm pipe to the waste after ensuring steady flow conditions in the pond with the volume of water in the pond remaining constant the effluent in the pond and the water in the tank recirculated in two different systems after changing the temperature of the water the direction of the motorised valves was changed using a switch to pump the water in the tank to the pond the motorised valves were used to prevent changing the velocity fields within the pond as all the valves were automatically rotated at the same time 2 1 tracer studies hydraulic residence time hrt is a key factor in investigating the sediment treatment efficiency of ponds and wetlands the hydraulic residence time is a measure of the time a parcel of water spends within a system and it depends on the streamline of each particle nix 1985 thackston et al 1987 since each particle of water pursues a particular path there is a specific hrt for each of the water parcels these variations in hrt can be explained by generating the residence time distribution rtd curves which represent the temporal probability distribution of non reacting tracer particles within the system van de vusse 1959 the tracer such as the cation lithium kadlec 1994 the anion bromide grismer et al 2001 or the fluorescent dyes khan 2012 can be added to the system inlet as an impulse or a step change werner kadlec 1996 to create rtd curves in this study rhodamine wt rwt was selected as the tracer dye due to the numerous advantages over the other tracers such as being readily soluble in water highly detectable by fluorometers mostly unaffected by background fluorescence minimally degradable in short times harmless in low concentrations wilson et al 1968 and cost effective 2 2 hydraulic performance indices the hydraulic performance of ponds can be evaluated by analysing the residence time distribution rtd curve in this study the hydraulic performance of the pond was assessed using the hydraulic indices recommended by farjood et al 2015 which are t 5 for short circuiting sc the moment index mi for the hydraulic efficiency and the invert morril index mo 1 for mixing the index t 5 is the normalised time for passage of the 5 of added tracer through the outlet the lower t5 sc indicates lower time required for passage of the 5 of added tracer through the outlet and consequently shows a high likelihood of short circuiting in the pond the invert morril index mo 1 is defined as t10 t90 where t10 and t90 are the times for 10 and 90 of the added tracer to exit the system respectively the higher mo 1 indicates higher mixing occurring within the pond the moment index proposed by wahl et al 2010 is defined as 1 mi 1 0 1 1 t c t d t where c c c 0 c is the concentration of the tracer c0 is the amount of tracer added to the pond divided by the pond volume t t t n is the normalised time which is the measured time divided by the nominal residence time and mi is bounded from zero to one with mi 1 described as maximum hydraulic efficiency 2 3 entrainment and buoyancy inflow density typically differs from the density of the receiving ambient water therefore the buoyancy of the surrounding fluid reduces the gravity force by calculating net force due to density difference as follows mangelson watters 1972 2 reduced gravity g œÅ 1 œÅ 2 œÅ 1 g where œÅ 2 denotes the inflow density and œÅ 1 indicates the density of the receiving ambient water accordingly the buoyancy force not only affects the trajectory of the inflow but also predicts the behaviour of density currents maccready et al 1999 the influence of density differences can be quantified by measuring the bulk densimetric froude number frd 0 as follows mangelson watters 1972 3 f r d u m g d where um denotes the mean flow velocity which is calculated using the continuity equation i e um q a and d indicates the height of the flow at a selected cross section a higher frd indicates lower density differences therefore the frd becomes infinity when the flow is not stratified global buoyancy decays over time in which the preferential flow patterns become weaker and eventually disappears the magnitude of this decay is largely determined by the amount of interfacial mixing or entrainment that occurs between these density currents and the lighter overlying water masses wells et al 2010 therefore another important characteristic of density current is the amount of interfacial mixing or entrainment that occurs between the layers with different densities the interfacial turbulence that occurs on the interface line between fluids with varying densities can significantly affect the flow dynamics these effects were quantified using the entrainment hypothesis proposed by taylor 1946 as follows 4 e w u m where e is the entrainment ratio w is the entrainment velocity and um is the downstream mean velocity therefore a higher entrainment ratio delineates higher entrainment velocity that interferes with the main flow path of buoyant flow and changes the efficiency of the pond it is noted that the aforementioned parameter is known as turner 1986 entrainment parameterisation in the literature 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 tracer measurements the hydraulic performance of the pond is directly related to the hydraulic residence time of the inflow particles into the pond therefore tracer investigations have been done in this study to quantify the residence time of the inflow particles using a chemically inactive tracer to investigate the temperature effects on the hydrodynamics of the model pond the tracer experiments were conducted in this study and the results from the tracer study were used to compare the different temperature configurations alongside the effective countermeasures to attenuate the negative effects of temperature differentials the hydraulic residence time of the inflow particles was analysed by developing the rtd curves from the tracer experiments rhodamine wt fluorescent dye was used as the tracer for all the experiments as recommended in previous research adamsson bergdahl 2006 farjood 2016 khan 2012 shilton 2005 rhodamine wt has several advantages over other tracers which make it one of the most suitable dyes to be used in tracer studies these advantages include low detection limit negligible background interference low cost and minimal effects of dissolved solids on its performance headley tanner 2012 khan 2012 as the temperature differentials are the main focus of this study it was important to make sure that the rhodamine wt followed the same flow pattern of inflow water therefore as the rhodamine wt has a specific gravity of 1 2 the tracer was diluted with water to avoid sinking to the bottom of the pond the water used for diluting the tracer has the same temperature of inflow to maintain consistency rhodamine wt consists of 20 pure substance and 80 carrier which is water in this study a 30 ml amount of the solution of 1g l of rhodamine wt and water was typically used to do the experiments however the amount of the solution varied based on the detection level of the fluorometer for example in some test cases a 30 ml amount of the solution produced a low concentration at the outlet which was close to the lower excitation limit of the probe therefore it created a noisy output in contrast in some test cases a 30 ml amount of the solution produced a high concentration at the outlet which was close to the upper excitation limit of the probe similarly it created a noisy output therefore in some test cases it was necessary to adjust the amount of the solution to get a high signal to noise ratio it is to be noted that the variations in the tracer concentration did not affect the results because the final rtds were normalised to the mass of tracer recovered therefore the desired amount of 1g l solution of rhodamine wt which varied in each configuration due to the excitation limit of the sensor was poured into the plastic caps equally and then by rotating the bar the pulsed addition of tracer was achieved fig 5 the injection time was small enough to ensure that the concentration remains the same during the chosen increment which is less than five seconds in this study and similar to the previous study of fogler 2010 this is known as the pulse input tracer injection method which is a widely used technique farjood 2016 khan 2012 persson 2000 the concentration of rhodamine wt solutions was measured using a fluorimeter cyclops 7 rhodamine manufactured by turner designs the submersible cyclops sensor is a detector that delivers an output voltage representing the concentration of the rhodamine wt fig 6 to convert the voltage output to the concentration of the tracer the sensor was calibrated by creating a graph that was composed of two axes representing the known concentration and its corresponding voltage as shown in fig 7 the linear trend line equation of the calibration graph was used to calibrate the experiments of this study 2 rhodamine wt concentration recorded signal 0 0257 0 0094 the recorded output signals were then translated to the concentration values by using the calibration curve shown in fig 7 the produced curve at this stage is normalised using the mass of the recovered tracer and nominal residence time for normalising the recorded concentration and time respectively to create the rtd curves the rtd curves were used to show the overall performance of the pond as several hydraulic parameters can be inferred from them such as short circuiting indices hydraulic efficiency indices and mixing indices through these parameters the most important phenomena in the pond were assessed to evaluate the overall performance of the pond 2 4 2 temperature measurements before the start of the experiments the temperature measurements were performed at the inlet outlet and the middle section of the pond to ensure the consistency of the temperature within the pond although the temperature was regulated using two heat exchanger units it was necessary to measure the temperature of water within the pond and forebay by using a thermometer the thermometer used in the present study was capable of measuring the temperature in four different locations therefore the probes were located at the top of the forebay outlet riser and the top and bottom of the middle cross section of the pond the reason for placing one of the probes on top of the forebay was to measure the temperature of inflow upon entering the pond the rationale behind placing the two of the probes on top and bottom of the middle cross section of the pond was to measure the temperature of the top one third and bottom one third of the water depth in the pond to ensure the uniformity of the temperature distribution throughout the water column finally the outlet riser temperature probe was placed in the outlet riser to check the outflow temperature after the start of the experiments the temperature measurements were performed using the thermistor embedded in the velocimeter probe the thermistor can measure and report the temperature in degrees celsius therefore the temperature measurements were performed at each velocity point location the temperature measurements within the pond were then used to illustrate the thermal structure of the pond 2 4 3 velocity measurements it is expected to observe different flow patterns in the pond in various temperature configurations such as isothermal cold influent and hot influent test cases since the cold influent tends to sink to the bottom and the hot influent tends to flow on the top of the pond the preferential flow patterns formed on the top and bottom of the pond therefore velocity measurements were performed to evaluate the flow pattern and the velocity distribution in the pond useful to shed light on dissimilarities between the isothermal case and thermal variation cases in the isothermal temperature configuration it is relatively quick to measure the velocity at the required location in this flow condition the probe is located at the required point to measure the velocity and it can be moved to the other point for the next measurement without any adjustment this occurs due to the steady state flow condition in the system in which the velocity at each point is not going to change during the velocity measurement however the temperature difference between the inflow and the water in the pond in each experiment resulted in changing the steady state flow condition of isothermal experiments to a transient flow condition therefore the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow such as velocity and density changed during the experiments furthermore for continuous inflow as the time elapsed increases the temperature difference decreases the velocity decreases and the bottom or top preferential flow becomes weaker and the flow tends to return to its isothermal form therefore in transient flow condition it was required to measure the velocity at each point for a period equal to the time required for the whole amount of tracer to be recovered at the outlet following the measurement of the first point the temperature configuration required to be reset and then the next velocity measurement could be performed furthermore it was required to repeat the velocity measurements for checking the validity of the results this made the velocity measurements extremely time consuming therefore it was decided to measure the velocity on the middle longitudinal section of the pond a vectrino ii velocimeter was used to measure the velocity in various locations the vectrino ii consists of four receiving transducers and a transmitting transducer see fig 8 the centre transducer transmits a pulse and the reflected pulses resulted from the impact of the pulse and the suspended particles in the water are received by the receive transducers therefore the doppler effect provides the opportunity to measure the velocity by measuring the changes in the frequency of the receiving echoes the velocimeter is capable of measuring the three velocity components for a range with a sampling rate of up to 100 hz the vectrino ii velocimeter was mounted on the stable steel structure which was vertically and horizontally adjustable fig 8 the velocity measurements at each point produced a time series of the recorded velocities and by analysing the results it was possible to capture the velocities at the required time intervals therefore the filtered velocities were averaged throughout 10 second periods i e from 95sec to 105sec to obtain the velocity at 100sec at each point the velocity measurements were performed in the middle longitudinal section of the pond as a representative section fig 9 several measurement points were identified in the middle longitudinal section as shown in fig 9 this arrangement of points helped in identifying the most prominent flow field in each temperature configuration and was useful to find the stagnation and recirculation parts 3 results and discussion 3 1 the test cases several inlet width ratios were examined to find the best configuration in two different temperature configurations colder influent and hotter influent fig 10 the inlet width ratio iwr is the ratio of opening width to the pond width the iwr was changed from 1 0 full width inlet to 0 3 centre inlet to check the sensitivity of the hydraulic performance indices to the opening width of the inlet this reduction has been done by using acrylic sheets with 10 mm thickness it is noted that iwr 1 0 was the highest possible iwr and iwr 0 3 was the lowest possible practical ratio an iwr below 0 3 caused the forebay to overflow and an iwr above 1 0 was impractical during all tests the dimensions of the forebay remained unchanged in all experiments the inflow temperature was the same 16 c and the temperature of the water in the pond was hotter or colder than the inflow water depending on the adjusted temperature of the pond water to test the effect of temperature variations on the performance of the pond in the selected iwrs two conditions were selected in the first condition the temperature of water in the pond was hotter than the influent and in the second condition the temperature of water in the pond was colder than the influent from the results of densimetric froude numbers presented by hendi et al 2018 we can see that even a temperature difference of 0 5 c can change the expected flow pattern however in this study 4 c was selected for the temperature differences between the pond and inflow to examine the effect of various iwrs on the performance of the pond when temperature differentials exist the flow rate used in this set of experiments was 1 l s 3 2 effect of iwr variations on rtd curves since the cold influent tends to sink to the bottom and the hot influent tends to flow on the top of the pond the inlet width plays a critical role in changing the flow pattern as it changes the initial velocity of the inflow particles the relationship between the iwrs and the hydraulic performance indices is graphically shown in fig 11 as can be seen in this figure in the cold influent test cases all of the hydraulic indices were reduced when iwr was reduced while the reverse is true for hot influent test cases in iwrs of lower than 0 65 the mi index was slightly increased by about 1 in hot influent test cases a significant increase in mi was observed in the transition from the inlet width ratio of 0 65 to 0 9 in hot influent test cases in cold influent test cases the trends were more uniform indicating a gradual increase of mi with increasing iwr from 0 3 to 1 0 overall the mi index increased by about 11 with iwr increased from 0 3 to 1 0 for cold influent test cases and it increased by about 12 with iwr decreased from 1 0 to 0 3 for hot influent test cases similar trends were also observed in the short circuiting index trendlines except for the cold influent test cases that sc slightly increased by about 1 with increasing the iwr from 0 3 to 0 65 the sc index was increased by about 9 in cold influent test cases with iwr increased from 0 3 to 1 0 in the hot influent test cases sc increased by about 10 therefore the inlet width can be changed to reduce the short circuiting issues in the pond when dealing with temperature differentials mo 1 was also observed to follow the similar trends of mi and sc index emphasizing the fact that mixing was also improved when changing the inlet width in different configurations however the improvements made by changing iwr was not as significant as the improvements in mi and sc index this implies that changing the inlet width cannot be considered as the main option to improve mixing in the ponds and other options such as baffles need to be included to be more effective 3 3 the effect of bulk densimetric froude number on hydraulic performance indices as discussed in section 2 3 in a free surface flow the gravitational and the inertia forces are important for effectively modelling the hydrodynamics of flow furthermore the temperature differences between the inflow and the water in the pond can significantly change the flow pattern due to the buoyancy effects created by density differences between the inflow and existing water in the pond therefore to investigate the importance of inertial and density gravity forces it is essential to compare the hydraulic index values with the corresponding frd which is the ratio of gravity to inertia forces since the selected cross section is the inlet the inlet bulk densimetric froude number frd 0 is used in this study the entrainment ratio was compared with the corresponding frd 0 at six points at the top and bottom of the pond fig 12 figs 13 18 provide the results obtained from the comparison of the entrainment ratio and the inlet frd 0 in these graphs the presented trendlines are representative of various elapsed times from the start of the experiments for a given temperature and flow rate configuration furthermore the temperature difference is similar in all test cases of this study therefore higher inlet frd 0 delineates on a shorter inlet width and vice versa the results shown in figs 13 18 illustrate the contrasting behaviour of cold and hot influent test cases with different iwrs in hot influent test cases the entrainment ratio increases alongside increasing the inlet frd 0 at location points p1 p3 and p5 the aforementioned points were located close to the water s surface conversely the results of the bottom points showed a different trend in which the entrainment ratio decreased with an increased inlet frd 0 therefore a shorter inlet width provides a higher entrainment ratio at the top of the pond and a lower entrainment ratio at the bottom of the pond according to equation 4 the entrainment ratio is the ratio of entrainment velocity to the downstream mean velocity therefore a higher entrainment ratio delineates a higher entrainment velocity while a lower entrainment ratio indicates a lower entrainment velocity the shortest inlet width i e iwr 0 30 creates a higher entrainment velocity at the top of the pond this interferes with the main flow path of buoyant flow particularly at p1 which shows the highest entrainment ratio in cold influent test cases the entrainment ratio increased with an increase in the inlet frd 0 at points p2 p4 and p6 the aforementioned points were located close to the bottom of the pond conversely the top points showed a different trend in which the entrainment ratio decreased with an increased inlet frd 0 therefore the widest inlet width i e iwr 1 00 creates higher entrainment velocity at the bottom of the pond and this subsequently interferes with the main flow path of the non buoyant flow these occurrences justify the increasing and decreasing trend in the hydraulic performance indices in the hot and the cold influent test cases respectively 4 effect of temperature on flow patterns with various inlet width ratios velocity vectors were measured in the middle longitudinal section of the pond from the inlet to the outlet riser three hundred equally spaced measurement points were used to investigate the governing flow pattern in the pond the longitudinal flow pattern was investigated using the velocity vectors to identify the circulation and stagnation zones the location of the cross section and the measurement points are shown in fig 9 the results presented here concern the two temperature configurations hot and cold influent in which four different iwrs were tested in each temperature configuration as shown in figs 19 and 20 in cold influent test cases with the increasing iwr the inflow particles generally need to follow longer flow paths this is mainly due to the circulation zones created by buoyancy forces as shown in fig 19 the cold inflow of iwr 0 3 must follow a straighter flow path to the outlet this is mainly due to the inflow momentum which pushes the streamlines to the bottom of the pond in 0 65 iwr 1 0 circulation zones were created that increased the flow path length that inflow particles needed to follow to exit the pond the circulation zones occurred due to an inadequate initial velocity which eventually forced the inflow to flow back to the inlet as the kinetic energy was insufficient to homogenise the flow at t tn 0 125 the flow pattern was changed due to the progressive isothermalisation that occurred in the pond as the elapsed time increased when iwr was 0 3 the flow pattern developed askew so that the effect of inlet velocity was no longer significant when iwr was 0 65 and 0 9 the isothermalisation led to a similar flow path without visible circulation zones while in iwr 1 0 the circulation zones still existed in the pond and lengthened the flow path required for inflow particles to exit the pond overall the widest inlet increased the hrt of the tracer this was because the influent needed to travel a longer distance to reach the pond outlet in the cold influent test cases the widest inlet also promoted mixing in the pond due to the circulation zones conversely in the hot influent test cases the shortest inlet width provided the best performance as shown in fig 20 the flow paths tended to remain on top of the pond initially in iwr 0 3 the inflow velocity was high enough to push the streamlines to the bottom of the pond thereafter since the density of hot influent was lower than the water in the pond it returned to the surface and formed a circulation zone this flow pattern was the same for other iwrs however in wider inlet widths the inlet velocity was not sufficient to force the inflow to reach the bottom of the pond or the circulation zones created closer to the inlet area as the elapsed time increased the circulation zones still existed in the pond for iwrs of 0 3 0 65 and 0 9 while for iwr 1 0 no circulation zone was observed and the flow path followed a straight line to the outlet therefore the shortest width encouraged a longer flow path in the pond followed by a circulation zone that became larger as the elapsed time increased the mixing also increased in the pond for the shortest inlet width as water needed to follow the askew flow path to return to the surface of the pond 5 conclusions the effect of inlet configurations on the performance of ponds has been widely investigated in many previous studies however temperature differences between the inflow and water in the pond can change the overall scenario to a more complicated context therefore two different temperature configurations hot and cold influent were investigated in this study to determine the differences between various iwrs when considering that temperature differentials existed in the pond four iwrs have been tested in this study ranged from 1 0 full width inlet to 0 3 centre inlet an iwr of 0 9 was previously recommended by farjood 2016 to avoid sc along the pond sides and to achieve the best performance in an isothermal condition however the results of the present study showed that in the cold influent test cases the wider inlet provided the best hydraulic efficiency and fewer sc issues along with better mixing in the pond conversely the results illustrated that in hot influent test cases the shortest inlet width produced the best performance in the pond the effect of the entrainment ratio was investigated in this study to highlight the relationship of the entrainment ratio against the inlet frd 0 the results underscored the contradictory behaviour of cold and holt influent test cases with different iwrs in the hot influent test cases the shortest inlet width i e iwr 0 30 provided a higher entrainment ratio at the top of the pond and a lower entrainment ratio at the bottom of the pond contrastingly in cold influent test cases the widest inlet width i e iwr 1 00 created higher entrainment velocity at the bottom of the pond which consequently interfered with the main flow path of the non buoyant flow the results of velocity measurements also highlighted dissimilarities by indicating the dominant flow path in the pond for various iwrs in cold influent test cases iwr 1 0 was found to deliver better performance due to the longer flow path that inflow particles needed to follow to reach the outlet this was also accompanied by circulation zones which had been created at the start of the experiments due to the domination of buoyancy forces resulting from lower inlet velocity interestingly in the hot influent test cases the shortest inlet width provided the best performance this was because the flow path in this case needed to remain on the surface of the pond and the shortest inlet width forced the streamlines to reach the bottom of the pond due to the higher inlet velocity as a result the inflow returned to the top of the pond and formed a circulation flow path this pattern was also the same for the other iwr test cases however in wider iwrs the circulation zones were closer to the inlet the findings of this study suggested several courses of action to consider the effect of temperature on hydraulic performance of urban retention ponds furthermore this study suggested using the shorter inlet width when dealing with an inflow hotter than the water in the pond and wider inlet width when the inflow is colder than the water in the pond therefore depending on the temperature configurations a design engineer needs to choose different inlet widths suitable for the practical climate condition of the srps future investigation and experimentation into the effect of the heat transfer by convection at the wall boundaries can enable a better understanding of the effect of heat dissipation through the solid walls furthermore the effect of baffles in the ponds can be investigated to enhance an understanding of how baffles impact the hydrodynamics of retention ponds in cold and hot influent test cases credit authorship contribution statement ehsan hendi

3626,hydrodynamic features of the confluence zone of large rivers are complicated because of their three dimensional flow structure the confluence between the rio negro and the rio solim√µes characterised by black and white waters respectively ranks among the largest river junctions on earth an entropy based investigation was carried out to assess the discharge and analyse the 2d structure of velocity distribution for large river flows relying on monitoring of near surface velocity only the estimated flow data where compared with in situ adcp data gathered across some transects of the negro and solim√µes rivers during both low and relatively high flow conditions results are illustrated through some transects at the confluence zone upstream and downstream of the zone and in the careiro channel comparisons highlight that the entropy based flow velocity in terms of depth averaged velocity cross sectional mean flow velocity and vertical velocity distributions starting from the measured surface velocity is in agreement with those determined by the adcp measurements with an error in mean flow velocity and discharge lower than 15 the research highlights the potential of the entropy method to estimate the discharge and velocity in very large rivers just relying on near surface velocities monitoring keywords mega rivers confluence entropy method velocity dip secondary currents 1 introduction river confluences are key features of every riverine system and represent interfaces with complex hydrodynamics and typical bed morphologies in fact they are characterized by a highly complex three dimensional flow structure with enhanced flow strength and secondary currents kenworthy and rhoads 1995 biron and lane 2008 mixing processes and hydrodynamic characteristics of flow at confluences have been investigated based either on field data rhoads and sukhodolov 2001 ram√≥n et al 2013 ram√≥n et al 2016 lewis and rhoads 2015 herrero et al 2018 gualtieri et al 2017 gualtieri et al 2019 lewis et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 or through laboratory experiments bryan and kuhn 2002 parsons et al 2007 ismail et al 2016 or by numerical simulations white and helfrich 2013 lyubimova et al 2014 zhong chao and ze yi 2011 constantinescu et al 2011 constantinescu et al 2016 ahadiyan et al 2018 regarding the confluence of negro and solim√µes rivers past studies laraque et al 2009 gualtieri et al 2018 ianniruberto et al 2018 gualtieri et al 2019 have demonstrated that a more dense and sediment laden flow from the solim√µes is entering the confluence with the negro giving origin to complex mixing processes that can be explained as a combination of the four hydrologic and morphologic processes difference in 1 velocity 2 density between the rivers 3 bed friction including form drag and 4 change in channel width along the confluence due to the adjustments of hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes immediately downstream of the junction the effects of differences in velocity and density on mixing are comparable while further downstream beyond the so called confluence hydrodynamic zone chz concept introduced by kenworthy and rhoads 1995 the latter is more important and the role of bed friction is significant gualtieri et al 2019 due to the difference in sediment load mixing processes can be tracked by acoustic backscatter intensity observed with adcp suggesting that mixing interface at the negro solim√µes confluence is tilted due to density difference furthermore it is found that the location of the mixing interface is closely related to the discharge ratios between the tributaries confirming the role of this parameter on mixing at large and small confluences lane et al 2008 lyubimova et al 2014 lewis and rhoads 2015 as most of the time the discharge in the solim√µes is much larger than that in the negro the mixing interface is usually closer to the negro bank based on the previous studies it is quite evident that the confluence of large rivers is a challenging hydrodynamic environment due to the complex factors that determine the flow characteristics so that robust datasets in terms of streamflow measurements are necessary for estimation of discharge mainly during high flow conditions when in situ measurements are more difficult due to the stronger currents in general measuring the flow characteristics in rivers is a key factor for understanding the hydrologic cycle flood forecasting water resources management and climate change issues for instance discharge is mentioned as one of the essential climate variables by the global climate observing system gcos gcos 2011 however measurements can be complicated especially during relatively high flow conditions because of difficulties related to boat manoeuvrability and operation of adcp along cross sections due to flow turbulence furthermore conventional monitoring procedures are costly time consuming and pose safety challenges for hydrographers requiring more efficient methodologies in this context moramarco et al 2017 moramarco et al 2019 developed an alternative non contact approach based on the entropy theory to estimate flow characteristics starting from measurements of the free surface velocity the entropy theory has been widely used by researchers to estimate the velocity distribution and other relevant parameters in open channels flow chiu 1989 chiu and said 1995 sterling and knight 2002 chiu et al 2005 moramarco and singh 2010 termini and moramarco 2017 singh et al 2017 ebtehaj et al 2018 recently termini and moramarco 2020 have also verified that the feedback effect of cross sectional flow on the longitudinal velocity distribution occurring in curved channel reaches could be qualitatively identified by applying the entropy concept and by analyzing the spatial distribution of the entropic parameter along with the location of dip that represents the location where the maximum flow velocity occurs below the water surface the present work aims to answer the question whether using only near surface velocity measurements the entropy based velocity distribution model can be used to predict the velocity field at confluences well enough to accurately estimate flow discharge despite the complex hydrodynamic settings the analysis could be also of support to identifying the complex dynamic of the flow just through the monitoring of surface velocity across the river the estimation was conducted using the near surface velocity first depth bin below blank depth based on adcp measurements across the rio negro and rio solim√µes confluence of the amazon river the proposed methodology could be of considerable interest to estimate discharge using surface velocities collected by either in situ measurements or by satellite observations such as those proposed by tarpanelli et al 2013 termini and di leonardo 2018 moramarco et al 2019 and termini 2021 the first part of the paper describes the available adcp field data collected across the rio negro and rio solim√µes river system as well as the statement of the mathematical model next the entropy based depth averaged velocity maps u dep ave m s for different simulated scenarios are presented and compared with those obtained by using the measured field data finally some significant observed and calculated vertical profiles are shown and discussed along with statistical analysis supplementary material is also provided for some other transects 2 field site and data collection the amazon river has a total length of 6400 km being the largest river and drainage system on the earth in terms of flow volume and basin area the annual average discharge is 206 000 m3 s with a catchment area of 7 million km2 for rio negro the basin area is 700 000 km2 callede et al 2010 the confluence between the negro and solim√µes rivers one of the largest river junctions on the earth is located near manaus in northern brazil where these rivers merge to form the amazon river approximately 1600 km upstream from its mouth at the atlantic ocean the river slope for the central part of the amazon river is on average 2 cm km leopoldo et al 1987 this confluence is also known as the meeting of waters portuguese encontro das √°guas for the meeting of the black and white waters of the negro and solim√µes rivers fig 1 as part of the clim amazon project a joint european and brazilian research project funded by the eu about climate and sedimentary processes of the amazon river basin two field studies were conducted in both low 28 31 october 2014 fs cns1 campaign and relatively high flow conditions 29 30 april 2015 fs cns2 campaign at the confluence zone during the field campaigns a teledyne rdi 600 khz rio grande acoustic doppler velocity profiling adcp was used to collect the flow velocity components along different cross sections to investigate key features of hydrodynamics mixing and sediment transport and morphodynamic in the confluence area fig 1 gualtieri et al 2019 these campaigns enabled identification of the characteristic hydrodynamics features typically observed in confluence studies such as stagnation zone velocity deflection and re alignment zone separation region with recirculation maximum velocity and flow recovery region best 1987 moreover it was observed that some features may adjust position and extension when discharge changed from low flow to relatively high flow conditions data based on measurements using similar equipment and repeated transects conducted by the geological survey of brazil in 2017 for careiro channel and jatuarana were used to further test the methodology to analyse the depth averaged velocity the resultant velocity sampled in all transects 16 and 19 transects for high and low flow conditions respectively was considered in the present paper to investigate the vertical and cross sectional distributions of flow velocity six transects were selected two transects cns3 and a6 in the middle and downstream of the confluence zone one transect n in rio negro one transect s in rio solim√µes one transect in jatuarana away from the confluence zone and one transect at careiro across the careiro channel table 1 the average ratio of channel widths rio negro rio solimoes upstream of the confluence zone is 0 92 the discharge ratios rio negro rio solimoes for low and relatively high flow conditions are 0 39 and 0 32 respectively while the momentum flux ratios were 0 10 and 0 07 3 theoretical methodology estimation of the velocity distribution u based on the entropy probability density function was first developed by chiu 1989 and then simplified by moramarco et al 2004 according to this approach the entropy based velocity profile along the verticals can be determined as u x i y u max v x i m ln 1 e m 1 y d x i h x i exp 1 y d x i h x i i 1 n v where u is the time averaged velocity umaxv xi is the maximum value of u along the ith vertical xi is the distance of the ith sampled vertical from the left bank h xi is the dip i e the depth of umaxv xi below the water surface d xi the flow depth y is the distance of the velocity point from the bed and nv is the number of verticals sampled across the river section m is the entropic parameter characteristic of the cross section that can be estimated based on mean and maximum flow velocity um and umax respectively using the linear entropic relation chiu 1989 u m e m e m 1 1 m u max œï m u max umax is assumed as the maximum value of umaxv xi sampled in the cross sectional flow area for a gauged river site œÜ m is constant for all flow conditions while for ungauged sites œÜ m can be estimated as moramarco and singh 2010 3 œï m 1 n r 1 6 g 1 k ln y max y o h y max ln h d where ymax is the location of umax from the bottom and yo is the datum where the velocity is equal to zero k is the von karman constant r is the hydraulic radius and d is the maximum flow depth whether at river site only surface velocities usurf xi d x i are available then umax xi can be estimated as fulton and ostrowski 2008 u maxv x i u surf x i d x i 1 m ln 1 e m 1 Œ¥ x i e 1 Œ¥ x i 4 where Œ¥ x i d x i d x i h x i specifically if h x i 0 it follows Œ¥ x i 1 and hence umaxv x i usurf x i d x i in this context to estimate Œ¥ x i the iterative procedure proposed by moramarco et al 2017 can be applied the procedure holds for sites where œÜ m is known it consists of assigning an initial dip h xi p 1 where the maximum surface velocity occurs p is the iteration herein based on this initial value of dip a laboratory distribution law of dip proposed by yang et al 2004 was applied across the river and the umaxv x i p 1 was assessed by eq 4 for all verticals umax p 1 was identified as the maximum of umaxv x i p 1 therefore once umaxv x i p 1 is replaced in eq 1 it enables estimation of the depth averaged velocities in the cross sectional flow area and for the first iteration the mean flow velocity um p 1 can be evaluated by the velocity area method as a consequence œÜ mcom p 1 can be computed by eq 2 using um p 1 and umax p 1 the iteration continues until the error of œÜ mcom p œÜ m reaches a magnitude less than 0 01 for more details the reader can refer to moramarco et al 2017 4 results and discussions 4 1 entropic parameter for the confluence of rio negro and rio solim√µes a value of m was obtained based on the observed data for both high and low flow conditions table 2 presents the magnitude of œÜ m and m for the selected transects for the adcp measurements campaigns fig 2 highlights the correlation between maximum and mean velocity magnitudes as a description of œÜ m where œÜ m u m u max eq 2 transects cns0 and cns3 are located at the beginning and middle of the confluence zone respectively and for this reason they are considered to belong to the same group as shown in fig 2a inspecting fig 2 and considering table 2 one can infer that for cns0 and cns3 œÜ m values are on average quite similar and equal to 0 413 this value is lower than the œÜ m for transects n s a6 careiro and jatuarana which on average yielded œÜ m 0 551 the difference can be ascribed to the mixing of two flows by a combination of different hydrologic and morphologic processes gualtieri et al 2019 the number of measurements in terms of pairs u m u max is not sufficient to establish a strong linear entropic relationship however the data provide information on flow dynamics indeed a high œÜ m value reflects diminished effects of banks and secondary currents on flow termini and moramarco 2020 4 2 comparison of predicted versus observed depth averaged velocity and discharge the entropy theory was applied to estimate the velocity distribution for both high and low flow conditions at the confluence of rio negro and rio solim√µes during the two campaigns of october 2014 relatively low flow and may 2015 relatively high flow the average velocity for rio solim√µes was 1 52 and 1 32 m s and for rio negro 0 4 and 0 39 m s for high and low flow conditions respectively adopting the observed m at each transect the patterns of the depth averaged velocity during high a and low b flow conditions were estimated by using the adcp measured data and the entropy based 2d model leveraging only the near surface velocities provided by adcp the pattern of the entropy based depth averaged velocities distribution was computed by minimizing the error on œÜ m by varying the dip location as proposed by moramarco et al 2017 based on the data of all transects 16 and 19 transects for high and low flow conditions respectively the comparison is shown in fig 3 and as it can be seen the patterns observed and computed are quite similar for both measured and calculated data the spatial spacing of 0 001 degrees was applied for interpolating the data with longitude range degree 59 93441773 59 78454208 and latitude range degree 3 150481462 3 048341513 based on the kriging tool available in surfer golden software llc fig 3 left for the adcp data conducted based on the same dataset is reported here to show the good agreement obtained by applying the entropy approach which correctly reproduces the same distribution of depth averaged velocity for the five hydrodynamic zones in the confluence area according to gualtieri et al 2019 a for the relatively high flow condition the last two transects at the downstream part are located outside the chz i e in the so called recovery zone b the discharge and velocity rates for the rio solim√µes were always greater than those for the rio negro during both field studies the difference in average velocity between the negro and the solim√µes at the junction corner was comparatively larger in relatively high flow conditions resulting in different rates of momentum transfer during the field studies gualtieri et al 2018 in terms of depth averaged velocity the normalized averaged error computed for all transects i e 16 and 19 transects for high and low flow conditions respectively was on average 8 4 for both flow conditions while in terms of discharge it was 6 9 and 6 3 for high and low flow conditions respectively table 3 presents the magnitudes of discharge together with the error percentage through some selected transects for relatively high flow conditions in terms of hydrodynamic characteristics both the observed and calculated depth averaged velocity data are in agreement with the descriptive model of hydrodynamic features at the confluence zone suggested by best 1987 best 1988 for both cases fives zones including stagnation zone at the upstream of chz velocity deflection separation region with recirculation and maximum velocity zone in the chz and flow recovery in the downstream of the chz are detected in the same locations of the confluence zone however adcp data available for this study for a few cross sections referred to one single transect while repeated transects were collected over a few days this condition limited the analysis of the confluence hydrodynamics features however the focus of the work is not to verify the robustness of adcp measurements for the discharge estimation as a function of passes but mainly to show how the entropy model is able to assess discharge and simulate velocity profiles starting from the near surface velocity observed by adcp therefore as regards rio negro and solim√µes we have assumed the adcp based spatial velocity distribution to be unbiased for two reasons first oberg and mueller 2007 found that the uncertainty associated with a discharge measurement is better characterized by the duration of the measurement than the number of transects included in the measurement in other words the uncertainty of the measured discharge is more dependent on the exposure time of the instrument than on the number of passes collected indeed using one pass they found the percentage error from mean discharge to be less than 10 and it decreases with the increase of exposure time notably for an exposure time greater than 1000 sec the uncertainty did not significantly change with the number of passes although our fluvial context is different from that investigated by oberg and mueller 2007 for rio negro and solim√µes the exposure time i e total time spent sampling the flow is over to 1800s moreover despax et al 2019 showed that exploring more cross sections is more efficient to reduce the uncertainty than staying at the same cross section and increasing the number of transects in our case we have some transects carried out on the same day that provides similar values of discharge as can be inferred by table 2 e g for measurements carried out on 28th october 2014 for cns0 and cns3 sites and on 30th april 2015 for cns3 and a6 for the location of sites see fig 1 the second reason refers to jatuarana and careiro river sites see fig 1 where three passes are available on the same day days and the comparison between the discharge observed by one pass with the averaged discharge from multiple passes did not indicate any significant deviation see supplementary material 4 3 comparison of predicted versus observed streamwise velocities to compare observed and calculated velocity profiles for the same transect velocity magnitudes were interpolated at regular intervals of 1 m the velocity data were interpolated by dplot hydesoft computing llc over the entire cross section notably there are two options for interpolation in dplot quadratic and planar interpolation the quadratic interpolation used in this study weights the result by the inverse of the square of the distance to the nearest control points quadratic interpolation in general produces a smoother surface than what is typically displayed with randomly spaced points in many cases the resulting grid is a more accurate representation of the input than the triangular mesh plot herein the results for transects cns3 and a6 are presented and discussed whereas the output graphs and evaluations for transects s through the solimoes river and transect n through the negro river are presented in the supplementary material sm file transect cns3 and a6 are located at the core and end of the confluence zone with a length of 2270 and 4280 m respectively to reduce the bias of the adcp velocity distribution profiles collected from moving boats different methods of smoothing were applied by researchers muste et al 2004a muste et al 2004b petrie and diplas 2016 herein with the aim to smooth the potential disturbances of measures and partially compensate for the lack of repeated passes the velocity magnitude was averaged across 20 m 20 pixels 1 m wide corresponding to a window of 21 verticals that is 10 verticals to the left and right side of each selected vertical for each transect three verticals were selected at 0 2b 0 5b and 0 8b where b m is the channel width corresponding to the given transect fig 4 for transect cns3 in x 0 2b and 0 8b and for transect a6 in x 0 5b the measured velocities close to the bed show higher values compared to computed velocities for different reasons that deserve a dedicated analysis beyond the scope of this work however some possible causes could be suggested a postprocessing on adcp raw data in terms of smoothing and identification of river bottom muste et al 2004a muste et al 2004b b secondary currents related to the density difference between the tributaries close to the bed within the chz bahmanpouri et al 2017 gualtieri et al 2019 gualtieri et al 2020 and c the dip formulation adopted in the entropy based model which is based on laboratory data moramarco et al 2004 flow dynamics at the confluence is also likely affected by the bed morphology ianniruberto et al 2018 table 4 presents the statistical analysis for these verticals indicating the relatively high determination coefficients and low rmse for jatuarana and careiro sites the analysis refers to the velocity distribution averaged along the three passes figs 5 and 6 compare the cross sectional velocity distribution for the adcp measurements and the velocities computed by eq 1 for transects cns3 and a6 respectively note that the calculated velocity is based on considering only the near surface velocity measurements and was interpolated with the cell size of 1 m as for adcp measurements according to figs 5 and 6 the largest percentage error between the adcp and calculated data is observed near the bed where velocities and volumetric water flux tend to be at a minimum so that there is no significant effect on estimating the depth averaged velocity and consequently on the total discharge for sake of clarity density scatterplots comparing observed and predicted velocities for high flow are shown in fig 7 a high percentage of data close to the centre suggests good results with r 0 83 and 0 85 for transects cns3 and a6 respectively fig 7a further the cumulative probability of percentage normalized error suggests that 75 of the total data 70487 out of 93983 have an error rate less than 30 for transect cns3 and that 80 of the data 68000 out of 84793 have an error rate of less than 22 for transect a6 fig 7b as a consequence for relatively high flow the computed discharge for cns3 and a6 transects was found not to exceed 12 as shown in table 3 fig 8 presents the density scatter plot of the adcp velocity data versus the estimated velocity data at ensembles averaged for 21 verticals with the transverse location of 0 2b 0 5b and 0 8b for all transects table 4 reports the statistical analysis for selected transects as can be seen regardless of transect location the coefficient of determination is larger than 0 6 and the root mean square error is less than 0 32 5 transects jatuarana careiro s and n supplementary material the results for transects jatuarana careiro s and n have been presented in the supplementary material sm file it is worth noting that for jatuarana and careiro sites three adcp passes were carried out along the transect on the same day for them we have compared the discharge estimated at each pass and as can be inferred from table s1 no significant deviation observed between the discharge averaged on three passes and that referring to a single pass moreover as can be seen from figs s1 and s4 results referring to shapes of the averaged entropy based velocity profiles are satisfactory for jatuarana and careiro respectively considering both single and multi passes cross sectional velocity distribution graphs demonstrate well estimated results by the entropy approach figs s2 s5 s8 s11 the statistical analysis for the vertical velocity ensembles based on averaged 21 windows highlights the correlation of coefficient of r larger than 0 95 0 88 0 93 and 0 83 for transects jatuarana careiro s and n respectively figs s1 s4 s7 s10 overall the results for these four transects show the correlation of coefficient of r 0 78 0 79 0 81 and 0 76 respectively figs s3a s6a s9a s12a the cumulative probability of error percentage reveals a high rate of accuracy for large rivers with transect lengths and depths up to approximately 5 km and 65 m respectively for example for transects jatuarana and careiro which are located out of the confluence zone 70 of data have an error percentage of less than 19 and 20 respectively figs s3b s6b even for these transects the difference in velocity ensembles for the three transects should be ascribed on one hand to raw data and topography and on the other hand to the complex dynamic of flow 6 discussion and conclusions the cross sectional velocity distribution along with the discharge assessment is investigated using only near surface velocities observed at the confluence of rio negro and rio solim√µes network system in the amazon river using adcp measurements herein an entropy based model as a first attempt is applied for this type of river system to predict 2d cross sectional flow velocity distribution relying on near surface velocity measurements recorded by adcp comparisons between measured and predicted velocity profiles show that the method provides results that might be of potential benefit in simplifying monitoring procedures in large rivers mainly for high flow conditions vertical and cross sectional distributions of flow velocity at different parts of the confluence zone as well as upstream and downstream of the chz and careiro channel are in accordance with the observed adcp data with the error percentage less than 15 suggesting acceptable results with the purpose of estimating discharge the large magnitudes of errors on cross sectional velocity distribution are mainly detected at the near bed area which considering the low values of velocity at the bottom has no notable impact on the total discharge calculation the difference between the observed and estimated ensembles especially near the bed could be associated with several factors such as the post processing on adcp raw data the secondary currents related to the density currents flow close to the bed from the solim√µes side to the negro side of confluence and the robustness of laboratory dip formulation used in the entropy model all these aspects are already objects of a work in progress the entropy based cross sectional velocity distributions are compared against the adcp data for different transects it should be noted that in transects located at the confluence area there are larger values of velocity at the right side which leads to transferring the momentum from the right side to the left side of the confluence zone rhoads et al 2009 and this can be inferred by visual inspection of the computed cross sectional velocity distribution for transects at rio solim√µes rio negro jatuarana where the flow completely recovered and also in careiro the entropy based velocities may deviate significantly from the ones observed at channel bottom however this result is somehow expected and in accordance with moramarco et al 2011 who found for gauged sites along the po river similar deviations in terms of velocity observed near the river bed nevertheless considering that in the lower portion of the flow area the velocity profiles tend to zero the impact of this discrepancy in the velocity computation has a limited influence on the estimation of cross sectional mean flow velocity and discharge indeed for all investigated transects more than 70 of values of velocity cells have an error lower than 30 and the error in estimated discharge did not exceed 15 see table 3 for ensembles at the transverse distance of 0 2b 0 5b and 0 8b of the six selected transects the statistical analysis shows a high level accuracy in computing the entropy based velocity profiles as reported in table 4 increasing the number of verticals ensembles to 40 a negligible impact on the entropy based model accuracy is found as can be inferred from table 4 for all transects the coefficient of determination r2 ranges between 0 62 transect cns3 0 98 transect s while the root mean square error does not exceed 0 32 therefore results suggest a reasonable level of accuracy for the entropy approach to estimate the velocity magnitude especially outside the confluence zone it is worth noting the analysis for the jatuarana and careiro sites where three passes were available on the same day shows that the number of passes does not significantly influence the velocity distribution at the three investigated distances of 0 2b 0 5b and 0 8b as can be inferred from figs s1 and s4 finally it is worth noting that remote sensing methodologies e g satellite observation based methods are getting more popular and commonly used to estimate flow discharge instead of costly and time consuming devices such as adcp moramarco et al 2019 demonstrated that discharge rate based on satellite observations led to an error percentage on average of about 30 by coupling modis and altimeter in addition fulton et al 2020 reported that estimating the discharge rate based on radar data qcam led to an error percentage of around 20 therefore satellite observations as input for the entropy model would be an interesting subject for future studies particularly for inland waters however using adcp data as input for entropy theory provides lower errors for discharge estimate lower than 15 supporting to invest in time consuming costly and labour intensive measurements overall the findings of the present research are of particular interest for the hydrodynamics of very large rivers as

3626,hydrodynamic features of the confluence zone of large rivers are complicated because of their three dimensional flow structure the confluence between the rio negro and the rio solim√µes characterised by black and white waters respectively ranks among the largest river junctions on earth an entropy based investigation was carried out to assess the discharge and analyse the 2d structure of velocity distribution for large river flows relying on monitoring of near surface velocity only the estimated flow data where compared with in situ adcp data gathered across some transects of the negro and solim√µes rivers during both low and relatively high flow conditions results are illustrated through some transects at the confluence zone upstream and downstream of the zone and in the careiro channel comparisons highlight that the entropy based flow velocity in terms of depth averaged velocity cross sectional mean flow velocity and vertical velocity distributions starting from the measured surface velocity is in agreement with those determined by the adcp measurements with an error in mean flow velocity and discharge lower than 15 the research highlights the

and helfrich 2013 lyubimova et al 2014 zhong chao and ze yi 2011 constantinescu et al 2011 constantinescu et al 2016 ahadiyan et al 2018 regarding the confluence of negro and solim√µes rivers past studies laraque et al 2009 gualtieri et al 2018 ianniruberto et al 2018 gualtieri et al 2019 have demonstrated that a more dense and sediment laden flow from the solim√µes is entering the confluence with the negro giving origin to complex mixing processes that can be explained as a combination of the four hydrologic and morphologic processes difference in 1 velocity 2 density between the rivers 3 bed friction including form drag and 4 change in channel width along the confluence due to the adjustments of hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes immediately downstream of the junction the effects of differences in velocity and density on mixing are comparable while further downstream beyond the so called confluence hydrodynamic zone chz concept introduced by kenworthy and rhoads 1995 the latter is more important and the role of bed friction is significant gualtieri et al 2019 due to the difference in sediment load mixing processes can be tracked by acoustic backscatter intensity observed with adcp suggesting that mixing interface at the negro solim√µes confluence is tilted due to density difference furthermore it is found that the location of the mixing interface is closely related to the discharge ratios between the tributaries confirming the role of this parameter on mixing at large and small confluences lane et al 2008 lyubimova et al 2014 lewis and rhoads 2015 as most of the time the discharge in the solim√µes is much larger than that in the negro the mixing interface is usually closer to the negro bank based on the previous studies it is quite evident that the confluence of large rivers is a challenging hydrodynamic environment due to the complex factors that determine the flow characteristics so that robust datasets in terms of streamflow measurements are necessary for estimation of discharge mainly during high flow conditions when in situ measurements are more difficult due to the stronger currents in general measuring the flow characteristics in rivers is a key factor for understanding the hydrologic cycle flood forecasting water resources management and climate change issues for instance discharge is mentioned as one of the essential climate variables by the global climate observing system gcos gcos 2011 however measurements can be complicated especially during relatively high flow conditions because of difficulties related to boat manoeuvrability and operation of adcp along cross sections due to flow turbulence furthermore conventional monitoring procedures are costly time consuming and pose safety challenges for hydrographers requiring more efficient methodologies in this context moramarco et al 2017 moramarco et al 2019 developed an alternative non contact approach based on the entropy theory to estimate flow characteristics starting from measurements of the free surface velocity the entropy theory has been widely used by researchers to estimate the velocity distribution and other relevant parameters in open channels flow chiu 1989 chiu and said 1995 sterling and knight 2002 chiu et al 2005 moramarco and singh 2010 termini and moramarco 2017 singh et al 2017 ebtehaj et al 2018 recently termini and moramarco 2020 have also verified that the feedback effect of cross sectional flow on the longitudinal velocity distribution occurring in curved channel reaches could be qualitatively identified by applying the entropy concept and by analyzing the spatial distribution of the entropic parameter along with the location of dip that represents the location where the maximum flow velocity occurs below the water surface the present work aims to answer the question whether using only near surface velocity measurements the entropy based velocity distribution model can be used to predict the velocity field at confluences well enough to accurately estimate flow discharge despite the complex hydrodynamic settings the analysis could be also of support to identifying the complex dynamic of the flow just through the monitoring of surface velocity across the river the estimation was conducted using the near surface velocity first depth bin below blank depth based on adcp measurements across the rio negro and rio solim√µes confluence of the amazon river the proposed methodology could be of considerable interest to estimate discharge using surface velocities collected by either in situ measurements or by satellite observations such as those proposed by tarpanelli et al 2013 termini and di leonardo 2018 moramarco et al 2019 and termini 2021 the first part of the paper describes the available adcp field data collected across the rio negro and rio solim√µes river system as well as the statement of the mathematical model next the entropy based depth averaged velocity maps u dep ave m s for different simulated scenarios are presented and compared with those obtained by using the measured field data finally some significant observed and calculated vertical profiles are shown and discussed along with statistical analysis supplementary material is also provided for some other transects 2 field site and data collection the amazon river has a total length of 6400 km being the largest river and drainage system on the earth in terms of flow volume and basin area the annual average discharge is 206 000 m3 s with a catchment area of 7 million km2 for rio negro the basin area is 700 000 km2 callede et al 2010 the confluence between the negro and solim√µes rivers one of the largest river junctions on the earth is located near manaus in northern brazil where these rivers merge to form the amazon river approximately 1600 km upstream from its mouth at the atlantic ocean the river slope for the central part of the amazon river is on average 2 cm km leopoldo et al 1987 this confluence is also known as the meeting of waters portuguese encontro das √°guas for the meeting of the black and white waters of the negro and solim√µes rivers fig 1 as part of the clim amazon project a joint european and brazilian research project funded by the eu about climate and sedimentary processes of the amazon river basin two field studies were conducted in both low 28 31 october 2014 fs cns1 campaign and relatively high flow conditions 29 30 april 2015 fs cns2 campaign at the confluence zone during the field campaigns a teledyne rdi 600 khz rio grande acoustic doppler velocity profiling adcp was used to collect the flow velocity components along different cross sections to investigate key features of hydrodynamics mixing and sediment transport and morphodynamic in the confluence area fig 1 gualtieri et al 2019 these campaigns enabled identification of the characteristic hydrodynamics features typically observed in confluence studies such as stagnation zone velocity deflection and re alignment zone separation region with recirculation maximum velocity and flow recovery region best 1987 moreover it was observed that some features may adjust position and extension when discharge changed from low flow to relatively high flow conditions data based on measurements using similar equipment and repeated transects conducted by the geological survey of brazil in 2017 for careiro channel and jatuarana were used to further test the methodology to analyse the depth averaged velocity the resultant velocity sampled in all transects 16 and 19 transects for high and low flow conditions respectively was considered in the present paper to investigate the vertical and cross sectional distributions of flow velocity six transects were selected two transects cns3 and a6 in the middle and downstream of the confluence zone one transect n in rio negro one transect s in rio solim√µes one transect in jatuarana away from the confluence zone and one transect at careiro across the careiro channel table 1 the average ratio of channel widths rio negro rio solimoes upstream of the confluence zone is 0 92 the discharge ratios rio negro rio solimoes for low and relatively high flow conditions are 0 39 and 0 32 respectively while the momentum flux ratios were 0 10 and 0 07 3 theoretical methodology estimation of the velocity distribution u based on the entropy probability density function was first developed by chiu 1989 and then simplified by moramarco et al 2004 according to this approach the entropy based velocity profile along the verticals can be determined as u x i y u max v x i m ln 1 e m 1 y d x i h x i exp 1 y d x i h x i i 1 n v where u is the time averaged velocity umaxv xi is the maximum value of u along the ith vertical xi is the distance of the ith sampled vertical from the left bank h xi is the dip i e the depth of umaxv xi below the water surface d xi the flow depth y is the distance of the velocity point from the bed and nv is the number of verticals sampled across the river section m is the entropic parameter characteristic of the cross section that can be estimated based on mean and maximum flow velocity um and umax respectively using the linear entropic relation chiu 1989 u m e m e m 1 1 m u max œï m u max umax is assumed as the maximum value of umaxv xi sampled in the cross sectional flow area for a gauged river site œÜ m is constant for all flow conditions while for ungauged sites œÜ m can be estimated as moramarco and singh 2010 3 œï m 1 n r 1 6 g 1 k ln y max y o h y max ln h d where ymax is the location of umax from the bottom and yo is the datum where the velocity is equal to zero k is the von karman constant r is the hydraulic radius and d is the maximum flow depth whether at river site only surface velocities usurf xi d x i are available then umax xi can be estimated as fulton and ostrowski 2008 u maxv x i u surf x i d x i 1 m ln 1 e m 1 Œ¥ x i e 1 Œ¥ x i 4 where Œ¥ x i d x i d x i h x i specifically if h x i 0 it follows Œ¥ x i 1 and hence umaxv x i usurf x i d x i in this context to estimate Œ¥ x i the iterative procedure proposed by moramarco et al 2017 can be applied the procedure holds for sites where œÜ m is known it consists of assigning an initial dip h xi p 1 where the maximum surface velocity occurs p is the iteration herein based on this initial value of dip a laboratory distribution law of dip proposed by yang et al 2004 was applied across the river and the umaxv x i p 1 was assessed by eq 4 for all verticals umax p 1 was identified as the maximum of umaxv x i p 1 therefore once umaxv x i p 1 is replaced in eq 1 it enables estimation of the depth averaged velocities in the cross sectional flow area and for the first iteration the mean flow velocity um p 1 can be evaluated by the velocity area method as a consequence œÜ mcom p 1 can be computed by eq 2 using um p 1 and umax p 1 the iteration continues until the error of œÜ mcom p œÜ m reaches a magnitude less than 0 01 for more details the reader can refer to moramarco et al 2017 4 results and discussions 4 1 entropic parameter for the confluence of rio negro and rio solim√µes a value of m was obtained based on the observed data for both high and low flow conditions table 2 presents the magnitude of œÜ m and m for the selected transects for the adcp measurements campaigns fig 2 highlights the correlation between maximum and mean velocity magnitudes as a description of œÜ m where œÜ m u m u max eq 2 transects cns0 and cns3 are located at the beginning and middle of the confluence zone respectively and for this reason they are considered to belong to the same group as shown in fig 2a inspecting fig 2 and considering table 2 one can infer that for cns0 and cns3 œÜ m values are on average quite similar and equal to 0 413 this value is lower than the œÜ m for transects n s a6 careiro and jatuarana which on average yielded œÜ m 0 551 the difference can be ascribed to the mixing of two flows by a combination of different hydrologic and morphologic processes gualtieri et al 2019 the number of measurements in terms of pairs u m u max is not sufficient to establish a strong linear entropic relationship however the data provide information on flow dynamics indeed a high œÜ m value reflects diminished effects of banks and secondary currents on flow termini and moramarco 2020 4 2 comparison of predicted versus observed depth averaged velocity and discharge the entropy theory was applied to estimate the velocity distribution for both high and low flow conditions at the confluence of rio negro and rio solim√µes during the two campaigns of october 2014 relatively low flow and may 2015 relatively high flow the average velocity for rio solim√µes was 1 52 and 1 32 m s and for rio negro 0 4 and 0 39 m s for high and low flow conditions respectively adopting the observed m at each transect the patterns of the depth averaged velocity during high a and low b flow conditions were estimated by using the adcp measured data and the entropy based 2d model leveraging only the near surface velocities provided by adcp the pattern of the entropy based depth averaged velocities distribution was computed by minimizing the error on œÜ m by varying the dip location as proposed by moramarco et al 2017 based on the data of all transects 16 and 19 transects for high and low flow conditions respectively the comparison is shown in fig 3 and as it can be seen the patterns observed and computed are quite similar for both measured and calculated data the spatial spacing of 0 001 degrees was applied for interpolating the data with longitude range degree 59 93441773 59 78454208 and latitude range degree 3 150481462 3 048341513 based on the kriging tool available in surfer golden software llc fig 3 left for the adcp data conducted based on the same dataset is reported here to show the good agreement obtained by applying the entropy approach which correctly reproduces the same distribution of depth averaged velocity for the five hydrodynamic zones in the confluence area according to gualtieri et al 2019 a for the relatively high flow condition the last two transects at the downstream part are located outside the chz i e in the so called recovery zone b the discharge and velocity rates for the rio solim√µes were always greater than those for the rio negro during both field studies the difference in average velocity between the negro and the solim√µes at the junction corner was comparatively larger in relatively high flow conditions resulting in different rates of momentum transfer during the field studies gualtieri et al 2018 in terms of depth averaged velocity the normalized averaged error computed for all transects i e 16 and 19 transects for high and low flow conditions respectively was on average 8 4 for both flow conditions while in terms of discharge it was 6 9 and 6 3 for high and low flow conditions respectively table 3 presents the magnitudes of discharge together with the error percentage through some selected transects for relatively high flow conditions in terms of hydrodynamic characteristics both the observed and calculated depth averaged velocity data are in agreement with the descriptive model of hydrodynamic features at the confluence zone suggested by best 1987 best 1988 for both cases fives zones including stagnation zone at the upstream of chz velocity deflection separation region with recirculation and maximum velocity zone in the chz and flow recovery in the downstream of the chz are detected in the same locations of the confluence zone however adcp data available for this study for a few cross sections referred to one single transect while repeated transects were collected over a few days this condition limited the analysis of the confluence hydrodynamics features however the focus of the work is not to verify the robustness of adcp measurements for the discharge estimation as a function of passes but mainly to show how the entropy model is able to assess discharge and simulate velocity profiles starting from the near surface velocity observed by adcp therefore as regards rio negro and solim√µes we have assumed the adcp based spatial velocity distribution to be unbiased for two reasons first oberg and mueller 2007 found that the uncertainty associated with a discharge measurement is better characterized by the duration of the measurement than the number of transects included in the measurement in other words the uncertainty of the measured discharge is more dependent on the exposure time of the instrument than on the number of passes collected indeed using one pass they found the percentage error from mean discharge to be less than 10 and it decreases with the increase of exposure time notably for an exposure time greater than 1000 sec the uncertainty did not significantly change with the number of passes although our fluvial context is different from that investigated by oberg and mueller 2007 for rio negro and solim√µes the exposure time i e total time spent sampling the flow is over to 1800s moreover despax et al 2019 showed that exploring more cross sections is more efficient to reduce the uncertainty than staying at the same cross section and increasing the number of transects in our case we have some transects carried out on the same day that provides similar values of discharge as can be inferred by table 2 e g for measurements carried out on 28th october 2014 for cns0 and cns3 sites and on 30th april 2015 for cns3 and a6 for the location of sites see fig 1 the second reason refers to jatuarana and careiro river sites see fig 1 where three passes are available on the same day days and the comparison between the discharge observed by one pass with the averaged discharge from multiple passes did not indicate any significant deviation see supplementary material 4 3 comparison of predicted versus observed streamwise velocities to compare observed and calculated velocity profiles for the same transect velocity magnitudes were interpolated at regular intervals of 1 m the velocity data were interpolated by dplot hydesoft computing llc over the entire cross section notably there are two options for interpolation in dplot quadratic and planar interpolation the quadratic interpolation used in this study weights the result by the inverse of the square of the distance to the nearest control points quadratic interpolation in general produces a smoother surface than what is typically displayed with randomly spaced points in many cases the resulting grid is a more accurate representation of the input than the triangular mesh plot herein the results for transects cns3 and a6 are presented and discussed whereas the output graphs and evaluations for transects s through the solimoes river and transect n through the negro river are presented in the supplementary material sm file transect cns3 and a6 are located at the core and end of the confluence zone with a length of 2270 and 4280 m respectively to reduce the bias of the adcp velocity distribution profiles collected from moving boats different methods of smoothing were applied by researchers muste et al 2004a muste et al 2004b petrie and diplas 2016 herein with the aim to smooth the potential disturbances of measures and partially compensate for the lack of repeated passes the velocity magnitude was averaged across 20 m 20 pixels 1 m wide corresponding to a window of 21 verticals that is 10 verticals to the left and right side of each selected vertical for each transect three verticals were selected at 0 2b 0 5b and 0 8b where b m is the channel width corresponding to the given transect fig 4 for transect cns3 in x 0 2b and 0 8b and for transect a6 in x 0 5b the measured velocities close to the bed show higher values compared to computed velocities for different reasons that deserve a dedicated analysis beyond the scope of this work however some possible causes could be suggested a postprocessing on adcp raw data in terms of smoothing and identification of river bottom muste et al 2004a muste et al 2004b b secondary currents related to the density difference between the tributaries close to the bed within the chz bahmanpouri et al 2017 gualtieri et al 2019 gualtieri et al 2020 and c the dip formulation adopted in the entropy based model which is based on laboratory data moramarco et al 2004 flow dynamics at the confluence is also likely affected by the bed morphology ianniruberto et al 2018 table 4 presents the statistical analysis for these verticals indicating the relatively high determination coefficients and low rmse for jatuarana and careiro sites the analysis refers to the velocity distribution averaged along the three passes figs 5 and 6 compare the cross sectional velocity distribution for the adcp measurements and the velocities computed by eq 1 for transects cns3 and a6 respectively note that the calculated velocity is based on considering only the near surface velocity measurements and was interpolated with the cell size of 1 m as for adcp measurements according to figs 5 and 6 the largest percentage error between the adcp and calculated data is observed near the bed where velocities and volumetric water flux tend to be at a minimum so that there is no significant effect on estimating the depth averaged velocity and consequently on the total discharge for sake of clarity density scatterplots comparing observed and predicted velocities for high flow are shown in fig 7 a high percentage of data close to the centre suggests good results with r 0 83 and 0 85 for transects cns3 and a6 respectively fig 7a further the cumulative probability of percentage normalized error suggests that 75 of the total data 70487 out of 93983 have an error rate less than 30 for transect cns3 and that 80 of the data 68000 out of 84793 have an error rate of less than 22 for transect a6 fig 7b as a consequence for relatively high flow the computed discharge for cns3 and a6 transects was found not to exceed 12 as shown in table 3 fig 8 presents the density scatter plot of the adcp velocity data versus the estimated velocity data at ensembles averaged for 21 verticals with the transverse location of 0 2b 0 5b and 0 8b for all transects table 4 reports the statistical analysis for selected transects as can be seen regardless of transect location the coefficient of determination is larger than 0 6 and the root mean square error is less than 0 32 5 transects jatuarana careiro s and n supplementary material the results for transects jatuarana careiro s and n have been presented in the supplementary material sm file it is worth noting that for jatuarana and careiro sites three adcp passes were carried out along the transect on the same day for them we have compared the discharge estimated at each pass and as can be inferred from table s1 no significant deviation observed between the discharge averaged on three passes and that referring to a single pass moreover as can be seen from figs s1 and s4 results referring to shapes of the averaged entropy based velocity profiles are satisfactory for jatuarana and careiro respectively considering both single and multi passes cross sectional velocity distribution graphs demonstrate well estimated results by the entropy approach figs s2 s5 s8 s11 the statistical analysis for the vertical velocity ensembles based on averaged 21 windows highlights the correlation of coefficient of r larger than 0 95 0 88 0 93 and 0 83 for transects jatuarana careiro s and n respectively figs s1 s4 s7 s10 overall the results for these four transects show the correlation of coefficient of r 0 78 0 79 0 81 and 0 76 respectively figs s3a s6a s9a s12a the cumulative probability of error percentage reveals a high rate of accuracy for large rivers with transect lengths and depths up to approximately 5 km and 65 m respectively for example for transects jatuarana and careiro which are located out of the confluence zone 70 of data have an error percentage of less than 19 and 20 respectively figs s3b s6b even for these transects the difference in velocity ensembles for the three transects should be ascribed on one hand to raw data and topography and on the other hand to the complex dynamic of flow 6 discussion and conclusions the cross sectional velocity distribution along with the discharge assessment is investigated using only near surface velocities observed at the confluence of rio negro and rio solim√µes network system in the amazon river using adcp measurements herein an entropy based model as a first attempt is applied for this type of river system to predict 2d cross sectional flow velocity distribution relying on near surface velocity measurements recorded by adcp comparisons between measured and predicted velocity profiles show that the method provides results that might be of potential benefit in simplifying monitoring procedures in large rivers mainly for high flow conditions vertical and cross sectional distributions of flow velocity at different parts of the confluence zone as well as upstream and downstream of the chz and careiro channel are in accordance with the observed adcp data with the error percentage less than 15 suggesting acceptable results with the purpose of estimating discharge the large magnitudes of errors on cross sectional velocity distribution are mainly detected at the near bed area which considering the low values of velocity at the bottom has no notable impact on the total discharge calculation the difference between the observed and estimated ensembles especially near the bed could be associated with several factors such as the post processing on adcp raw data the secondary currents related to the density currents flow close to the bed from the solim√µes side to the negro side of confluence and the robustness of laboratory dip formulation used in the entropy model all these aspects are already objects of a work in progress the entropy based cross sectional velocity distributions are compared against the adcp data for different transects it should be noted that in transects located at the confluence area there are larger values of velocity at the right side which leads to transferring the momentum from the right side to the left side of the confluence zone rhoads et al 2009 and this can be inferred by visual inspection of the computed cross sectional velocity distribution for transects at rio solim√µes rio negro jatuarana where the flow completely recovered and also in careiro the entropy based velocities may deviate significantly from the ones observed at channel bottom however this result is somehow expected and in accordance with moramarco et al 2011 who found for gauged sites along the po river similar deviations in terms of velocity observed near the river bed nevertheless considering that in the lower portion of the flow area the velocity profiles tend to zero the impact of this discrepancy in the velocity computation has a limited influence on the estimation of cross sectional mean flow velocity and discharge indeed for all investigated transects more than 70 of values of velocity cells have an error lower than 30 and the error in estimated discharge did not exceed 15 see table 3 for ensembles at the transverse distance of 0 2b 0 5b and 0 8b of the six selected transects the statistical analysis shows a high level accuracy in computing the entropy based velocity profiles as reported in table 4 increasing the number of verticals ensembles to 40 a negligible impact on the entropy based model accuracy is found as can be inferred from table 4 for all transects the coefficient of determination r2 ranges between 0 62 transect cns3 0 98 transect s while the root mean square error does not exceed 0 32 therefore results suggest a reasonable level of accuracy for the entropy approach to estimate the velocity magnitude especially outside the confluence zone it is worth noting the analysis for the jatuarana and careiro sites where three passes were available on the same day shows that the number of passes does not significantly influence the velocity distribution at the three investigated distances of 0 2b 0 5b and 0 8b as can be inferred from figs s1 and s4 finally it is worth noting that remote sensing methodologies e g satellite observation based methods are getting more popular and commonly used to estimate flow discharge instead of costly and time consuming devices such as adcp moramarco et al 2019 demonstrated that discharge rate based on satellite observations led to an error percentage on average of about 30 by coupling modis and altimeter in addition fulton et al 2020 reported that estimating the discharge rate based on radar data qcam led to an error percentage of around 20 therefore satellite observations as input for the entropy model would be an interesting subject for future studies particularly for inland waters however using adcp data as input for entropy theory provides lower errors for discharge estimate lower than 15 supporting to invest in time consuming costly and labour intensive measurements overall the findings of the present research are of particular interest for the hydrodynamics of very large rivers as

3627,while many analytical studies have been carried out to examine groundwater table fluctuations in tidally influenced coastal unconfined aquifers they generally focused on homogeneous aquifers and overlooked actual field situations with sound physical underpinnings taking the inelastic intergranular movement into account this study presented a new governing equation under the dupuit assumption in which the compressibility factor was considered to incorporate the vertical variations of both effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity an analytical solution was derived using taylor expansion and the perturbation method time varying groundwater table from the present model lies in between the homogeneous solutions predicted using grain parameters in the upper and bottom aquifer layers which is almost overlapped with the homogeneous solution if applying the grain parameters in the middle layer effects of depth varying hydraulic properties were further examined with respect to the total fluctuation range and phase shift of the groundwater table which quantitatively present the differences between the present solution and nielsen 1990 homogeneous solution such differences become significant for the large compressibility factor in addition it was mathematically proved that compressibility factor has no effect on the mean water surface as landward distance approaches infinity keywords groundwater table coastal aquifer taylor expansion perturbation method compressibility factor mean water surface 1 introduction in coastal unconfined aquifers groundwater table fluctuations are affected by natural and anthropogenic factors including tides waves and groundwater recharge and extraction a better understanding of groundwater table dynamics is significantly important to reveal physical mechanisms in sediment transport and groundwater circulation liu 2013 yang et al 2021 in addition it is also an important research topic in engineering practice a series of theoretical studies have been presented to investigate groundwater table fluctuations under the dupuit assumption in response to tidal forcing considering a very simple situation parlange et al 1984 derived a solution for the time varying groundwater table in a beach aquifer with a vertical boundary and under a small amplitude tidal condition using the perturbation method nielsen 1990 demonstrated the non linear effects of boussinesq equation nielsen 1990 also relaxed the sloping beach by fitting the boundary condition with the taylor expansion li et al 2000 applied a variable transformation that confines the moving boundary to a fixed coordinate an approximate analytical solution was then acquired adopting the perturbation method furthermore li et al 2000 presented a multiple spring neap tides condition demonstrating the interactions between two different frequency tides in addition effects of the super elevation rainfall as well as the steep sloping bottom on coastal groundwater table dynamics have been considered in other studies song et al 2007 kong et al 2011 hsieh et al 2015 the aforementioned theories are all for a single homogeneous coastal aquifer recently many efforts have been made to investigate the heterogeneity effect on groundwater table fluctuations jiao and tang 1999 presented a two aquifer system with a leaky layer but the overlying phreatic aquifer was considered to be a constant head to consider the tidal fluctuation in the overlying phreatic aquifer li et al 2001 adopted a new approximate method in which water heads and wave numbers were expanded to polynomials li and jiao 2002 considered both leaky layer s elastic storage and tidal wave interactions in addition guo et al 2010 divided the coastal aquifer into the coastal zone and inland zone where there exist two different hydraulic conductivities and effective porosities monachesi and guarracino 2011 considered a heterogeneous aquifer in which they assumed a linear increase of the hydraulic conductivity in the cross shore direction later asadi aghbolaghi et al 2012 developed a new analytical solution to predict the time varying groundwater table in a sloping leaky confined aquifer system with multiple layers based on the above literature review it is confirmed that most of previous studies neglect heterogeneity in coastal aquifers whereas others fail to recognize the depth varying distributions due to the compaction effect of sands themselves which does not reproduce the actual situation with sound physical underpinnings in addition constant grain parameters are always used to characterize the aquifer system in engineering practice yang et al 2020 especially using the grain parameters in the upper layer which are easy to be obtained in the field applicability and limitations of the homogeneous hypothesis using simple grain parameters rather than considering the actual heterogeneous aquifer have not been verified in previous studies therefore theoretical study of the heterogeneity affected groundwater table dynamics is needed the objective of this paper is to extend the previous studies by taking the compressibility factor into consideration under which the depth varying effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity are incorporated therefore a more realistic behavior of the groundwater table dynamics in coastal aquifers is presented in the present study the governing equation of the time varying groundwater table was re derived an approximate analytical solution of the time varying groundwater table under the tidal forcing system was then presented based on taylor expansion and the perturbation method in comparison with solutions of homogeneous aquifer behaviors of total fluctuation range phase shift and mean water surface were discussed to specify the heterogeneity effect on the groundwater table dynamics the paper is organized as follows the mathematical model considering the depth varying hydraulic properties is established in section 2 in section 3 analytical solution of the time varying groundwater table is derived using taylor expansion and the perturbation method section 4 qualitatively and quantitatively discusses the present groundwater table dynamics in section 5 validity of dupuit assumption under the heterogeneous aquifer condition is confirmed through numerical simulations effects of heterogeneity on total fluctuation range phase shift and mean water surface of the groundwater table are also specified finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 governing equation a sketch of the coastal unconfined aquifer with a finite depth is presented in fig 1 in which a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system is used with x representing the cross shore direction being positive landward and y being positive upward with y 0 at the still water level swl hereafter to focus on the effects of the heterogeneous aquifer and to analyze influences of the heterogeneous term on groundwater table fluctuations beach is assumed to be vertical in the present study which was also applied in li et al 2002 and monachesi and guarracino 2011 the capillary effect and seepage face are neglected following li et al 2000 in a tidal forcing system under the dupuit assumption the time varying horizontal seepage flow velocity u x y t in a heterogeneous coastal unconfined aquifer could be estimated from the darcy s law 1 u x y t k y h x t x where k y is the depth varying hydraulic conductivity and h x t d Œ∑ x t is the instantaneous groundwater table height in which d is the mean aquifer thickness and Œ∑ x t is the groundwater table fluctuation relative to the swl as illustrated in fig 1 validity of dupuit assumption under the heterogeneous aquifer condition will be further discussed in section 5 1 using a 2 d numerical simulation following nielsen 1990 the continuity equation can be derived as 2 d Œ∑ n y d y t x d Œ∑ u d y where n y is the depth varying effective porosity porous media are the combination of air water and particles under different external pressures the soil skeleton deforms resulting in different porosities bear 1972 it has been experimentally shown there exists an exponential function between the depth and porosity in which compressibility factor is the decisive parameter bear 1972 terzaghi et al 1996 accordingly the depth varying effective porosity can be modeled by 3 n y n 0 e Œ± y where n 0 is the effective porosity at the swl and Œ± is the compressibility factor the local compressibility factor can be determined by a simple laboratory compression test in the field the in situ compressibility factor can be acquired after knowing the depth varying effective porosity through a field drilling hydraulic conductivity k has been experimentally proved to be positively related with the effective porosity n bear 1972 there are various empirical k n relations with different forms such as krumbein and monk 1943 formulation and kozeny carman equation bear 1972 nevertheless these empirical relations cannot be used directly in theoretical analysis owing to their complicated expressions nevertheless a k n polynomial relation with suitable order can represent any of the above empirical k n relations from the mathematical viewpoint and it is also convenient to deal with the heterogeneous aquifer model with respect to theoretical analysis for simplification a quadratic polynomial relationship between k and n is applied in this study 4 k y c 1 n y c 2 n 2 y where c 1 and c 2 are scale factors if a higher order k

is diminished as x approaches infinity making the spatial gradient of the time varying groundwater table become zero because the sand beach has a finite depth and considering the magnitude of Œ± being

leads to vertically non uniform distributions of both effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity in sand beaches bear 1972 to investigate the effects of depth varying effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity on groundwater table fluctuations and to evaluate applicability and limitations of uniform grain parameters applied in an actual heterogeneous aquifer in engineering practice the present time varying groundwater table is compared with the non linear solution of nielsen 1990 for a homogeneous situation fig 2 shows the corresponding results effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity used in nielsen 1990 are specified using grain parameters at three different aquifer depths i e the upper layer at the tidal crest easy to be obtained in the field the middle layer at the swl and the bottom layer at the tidal trough in calculation tidal amplitude is fixed at 5 m tidal period is 12 h and the mean aquifer thickness is set as 10 m effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity in the upper layer y 5 m are 0 2 and 0 2 cm s after li et al 2000 in addition scale factors determining the hydraulic conductivity are assumed as c 1 0 4 c 2 3 in eq 4 these parameters are all kept the same in the following discussions in calculation the compressibility factor is set as Œ± 0 01 m 1 and the cross shore position is specified at x 100 m accordingly the effective porosity at the swl n 0 can be calculated as 0 19 using eq 3 comparing among these four solutions groundwater table predicted by the upper grain parameters has the most evident fluctuation magnitude but a least phase shift in contrast the groundwater table using the bottom layer grain parameters shows the least fluctuation magnitude and the most obvious phase shift fig 2 also shows the result of the present heterogeneous model lies in between the nielsen s solutions using the upper and bottom layer grain parameters which is almost overlapped with the homogeneous solution using the middle layer grain parameters the aforementioned discrepancy among different grain parameters can be explained with respect to eq 37 there exist different wave numbers k being 0 027 m 1 0 0274 m 1 and 0 0278 m 1 in the upper middle and bottom layer respectively within a limited area a large wave number leads to a more evident amplitude damping in addition eq 37 indicates that heterogeneity weakens high order harmonic components in comparison with nielsen 1990 for a representative condition i e Œ± d 2 the high order harmonic components are completely diminished this extreme situation cannot be achieved in the general case and eq 37 becomes 38 Œ∑ a e k x cos œâ t k x 1 4 a Œµ 1 e 2 k x 5 discussions 5 1 validity of dupuit assumption with numerical modeling in this section validity of dupuit assumption was verified using the numerical modeling under a general condition simulations were conducted using the finite element codes sutra which can simulate saturated unsaturated variable density fluid flow in the subsurface systems voss and provost 2008 the variably saturated pore water flow in a heterogeneous aquifer is governed by the richards equation as follows 39 n s w t k œà p œÅ g y where k œà is the relative hydraulic conductivity depending on the capillary pressure head œà s w is the soil water saturation and p is the pore water pressure the relationships between the hydraulic conductivity soil saturation and capillary pressure head are described by the van genuchten 1980 formulas as follows 40 s w s wres 1 s wres 1 1 Œ± œà Œ≤ Œ≤ 1 Œ≤ 41 k œà k s s w 1 2 1 1 s w Œ≤ Œ≤ 1 Œ≤

seaward and inland boundary conditions are the same as those of analytical model i e eqs 8 and 9 respectively the no flow condition was applied to both the bottom and the infinite inland boundaries the seaward boundary was prescribed by the hydrostatic pressure induced by of the instantaneous tidal level in calculation other parameters are the same as those in the section 4 the simulation was run till the numerical solutions reach a quasi steady state i e periodic solutions are unaffected by the initial condition in simulation the sutra code was run with a time step of 1 min the mesh has a size of 0 25 m 0 2 m in the x and y directions in which the depth varying hydraulic properties were assigned individually fig 3 shows the time varying hydraulic head p œÅ g y at four representative positions as shown in fig 3 hydraulic heads at different depths are almost overlapped with each other for the same x position indicating a negligible vertical seepage flow in the y direction in contrast a more evident difference in the hydraulic head is observed for different x positions revealing the horizontal seepage flow is much more predominant than the vertical seepage flow therefore dupuit assumption is still effective under the present heterogeneous aquifer condition 5 2 effects of the compressibility factor on the range of groundwater table fluctuation total fluctuation range is defined as the difference between the crest and trough values of the groundwater table to quantitatively present the heterogeneity effect difference of the total fluctuation range dtfr between nielsen 1990 solution and the present solutions nielsen present is shown in fig 4 the compressibility factor Œ± varies in the range of 0 0 01 m 1 representing the homogeneous condition and the high compacting grains such as clays and shales bear 1972 the cross shore calculation domain ranges from 0 to 250 m in x direction considering that the groundwater table fluctuation is almost diminished at x 250 m li et al 2000 dtfrs along both x and y axes are zero in fig 4 which is due to the fact that y axis with x 0 represents the shoreline and x axis with Œ± 0 represents the homogeneous situation making the present solution degenerate into nielsen 1990 solution fig 4 a shows applying the upper layer grain parameters dtfr of nielsen 1990 solution is always larger than that of the present solution while it is always smaller than the present solution if using the bottom layer grain parameters as shown in fig 4 c fig 4 b reveals that difference between the present solution and nielsen 1990 solution is negligible only in the order of 0 1 cm for all considered Œ± values when grain parameters at swl the middle layer are used in the homogeneous model nevertheless dtfr becomes more evident in fig 4 a and c whose magnitude is ten times as much as that in fig 4 b from the perspective of difference on the entire x Œ± domain fig 4 presents similar variation characteristics with an asymmetric semi arc contour line distribution fig 4 shows dtfr becomes greater with the larger compressibility factor however dtfr increases first and then decreases along the cross shore direction whose maximum values occur around x 40 m 40 m and 45 m using the upper middle and bottom grain parameters respectively the relative difference of the total fluctuation range rdtfr between nielsen 1990 solution and the present solution is also calculated difference of the total fluctuation range total fluctuation range of the present solution and the results are presented in fig 5 fig 5 b reveals that rdtfr is always negligible in the order of 0 1 for all considered Œ± values when grain parameters in the middle layer are used in the homogeneous model in contrast fig 5 a and c applying the upper and bottom layer grain parameters respectively shows more evident rdtfr whose magnitude is about two orders larger than that in fig 5 b within the calculation domain fig 5 a and c shows rdtfr increases with the cross shore inland distance and the compressibility factor whose value even reaches 10 indicating a significant difference between the homogeneous model and the actual heterogeneous situation 5 3 effects of the compressibility factor on phase shift to examine the effects of heterogeneity on the phase shift of groundwater table fluctuation phase difference in radians between nielsen 1990 solution and the present solution nielsen present is considered and the corresponding contour line distributions are shown in fig 6 with respect to the crest and trough phase respectively in consistent with the above discussions phase difference between nielsen 1990 solution and the present solution is negligible if the middle layer grain parameters are used but it cannot be neglected when applying the upper and bottom layer grain parameters fig 6 a and b shows the present solution demonstrates more evident phase shift than that in the homogeneous aquifer system if using the upper layer grain parameters however homogeneous groundwater table fluctuation predicted using the bottom layer grain parameters always lags behind the phase of the heterogeneous aquifer as shown in fig 6 e and f nevertheless if applying the middle layer grain parameters in nielsen 1990 solution phase difference between two solutions could be negligible as shown in fig 6 c and d these features can also be observed in fig 2 illustratedbythevariationfeature in the entire calculation domain phase differences in fig 6 a b e and f monotonically increase with the landward position and the compressibility factor 5 4 cross shore distribution of the mean water surface mean water surface mws is defined as time averaged groundwater table above the swl horn 2002 yang et al 2021 the cross shore distribution of mws from x 0 m to x 250 m is presented in fig 7 to show the relative relations among different solutions a close up view of the result in between x 50 m and x 100 m is also presented using an inset in fig 7 with the increase of the inland position mws first increases rapidly then approaches a constant value fig 7 shows the mwss of nielsen 1990 with grain parameters at different layers and the present solution are almost overlapped with each other with a negligible difference of 1 mm and all demonstrate evident groundwater table overheight above the swl difference among different solutions increases first and then decreases as x approaches inland mws predicted using the upper layer grain parameters in nielsen 1990 solution shows the smallest value for which the total fluctuation range of groundwater table however has the maximum magnitude as shown in fig 2 fig 7 shows these four solutions all become 62 5 cm when x reaches about 100 m this result can be theoretically proved using eq 37 from which the mws can be mathematically estimated as 42 0 t Œ∑ d t t 1 4 a Œµ 1 e 2 k x eq 40 shows the mws is related to the tidal amplitude a mean aquifer thickness d wave number k and cross shore position x which becomes 1 4 a Œµ when x approaches infinity i e 62 5 cm in the present setting li and jiao 2003 showed that as landward distance approached infinity mws becomes insensitive to depth varying hydraulic conductivity this study further demonstrates the depth varying effective porosity thus the compressibility factor also has no influence on the mws in the case that x approaches infinity 6 conclusions under the dupuit assumption a new governing equation for groundwater dynamics in a heterogeneous coastal unconfined aquifer with the depth varying hydraulic properties was derived based on the darcy s law and the continuity equation after applying the taylor expansion to the governing equation an analytical solution of the time varying groundwater table was presented using the perturbation method accordingly parametric studies were conducted to examine the difference between the present solution and nielsen 1990 solution for homogeneous aquifer with vertically uniform grain parameters at three specific depths as for the temporal variation of the groundwater table fluctuation the present solution lies in between the nielsen s solutions using the upper and bottom layer grain parameters which is almost overlapped with the homogeneous solution with the middle layer grain parameters subsequently effects of compressibility factor on the total fluctuation range phase shift and mean water surface of the groundwater table were further examined as for the total fluctuation range and phase shift of the time varying groundwater table difference between nielsen 1990 solution and the present solution is negligible if the middle layer grain parameters were used in the homogeneous model nevertheless difference between these two solutions becomes evident when grain parameters in the upper or bottom layers were used in nielsen 1990 such difference is positively correlated with the compressibility factor Œ± being significant for large Œ± in addition it is theoretically demonstrated that both depth varying effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity have no effects on the mean water surface as landward distance approaches infinity declaration of

3627,while many analytical studies have been carried out to examine groundwater table fluctuations in tidally influenced coastal unconfined aquifers they generally focused on homogeneous aquifers and overlooked actual field situations with sound physical underpinnings taking the inelastic intergranular movement into account this study presented a new governing equation under the dupuit assumption in which the compressibility factor was considered to incorporate the vertical variations of both effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity an analytical solution was derived using taylor expansion and the perturbation method time varying groundwater table from the present model lies in between the homogeneous solutions predicted using grain parameters in the upper and bottom aquifer layers which is almost overlapped with the homogeneous solution if applying the grain parameters in the middle layer effects of depth varying hydraulic properties were further examined with respect to the total fluctuation range and phase shift of the groundwater table which quantitatively present the differences between the present solution and nielsen 1990 homogeneous solution such differences become significant for the large compressibility factor in addition it was mathematically proved that compressibility factor has no effect on the mean water surface as landward distance approaches infinity keywords groundwater table coastal aquifer taylor expansion perturbation method compressibility factor mean water surface 1 introduction in coastal unconfined aquifers groundwater table fluctuations are affected by natural and anthropogenic factors including tides waves and groundwater recharge and extraction a better understanding of groundwater table dynamics is significantly important to reveal physical mechanisms in sediment transport and groundwater circulation liu 2013 yang et al 2021 in addition it is also an important research topic in engineering practice a series of theoretical studies have been presented to investigate groundwater table fluctuations under the dupuit assumption in response to tidal forcing considering a very simple situation parlange et al 1984 derived a solution for the time varying groundwater table in a beach aquifer with a vertical boundary and under a small amplitude tidal condition using the perturbation method nielsen 1990 demonstrated the non linear effects of boussinesq equation nielsen 1990 also relaxed the sloping beach by fitting the boundary condition with the taylor expansion li et al 2000 applied a variable transformation that confines the moving boundary to a fixed coordinate an approximate analytical solution was then acquired adopting the perturbation method furthermore li et al 2000 presented a multiple spring neap tides condition demonstrating the interactions between two different frequency tides in addition effects of the super elevation rainfall as well as the steep sloping bottom on coastal groundwater table dynamics have been considered in other studies song et al 2007 kong et al 2011 hsieh et al 2015 the aforementioned theories are all for a single homogeneous coastal aquifer recently many efforts have been made to investigate the heterogeneity effect on groundwater table fluctuations jiao and tang 1999 presented a two aquifer system with a leaky layer but the overlying phreatic aquifer was considered to be a constant head to consider the tidal fluctuation in the overlying phreatic aquifer li et al 2001 adopted a new approximate method in which water heads and wave numbers were expanded to polynomials li and jiao 2002 considered both leaky layer s elastic storage and tidal wave interactions in addition guo et al 2010 divided the coastal aquifer into the coastal zone and inland zone where there exist two different hydraulic conductivities and effective porosities monachesi and guarracino 2011 considered a heterogeneous aquifer in which they assumed a linear increase of the hydraulic conductivity in the cross shore direction later asadi aghbolaghi et al 2012 developed a new analytical solution to predict the time varying groundwater table in a sloping leaky confined aquifer system with multiple layers based on the above literature review it is confirmed that most of previous studies neglect heterogeneity in coastal aquifers whereas others fail to recognize the depth varying distributions due to the compaction effect of sands themselves which does not reproduce the actual situation with sound physical underpinnings in addition constant grain parameters are always used to characterize the aquifer system in engineering practice yang et al 2020 especially using the grain parameters in the upper layer which are easy to be obtained in the field applicability and limitations of the homogeneous hypothesis using simple grain parameters rather than considering the actual heterogeneous aquifer have not been verified in previous studies therefore theoretical study of the heterogeneity affected groundwater table dynamics is needed the objective of this paper is to extend the previous studies by taking the compressibility factor into consideration under which the depth varying effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity are incorporated therefore a more realistic behavior of the groundwater table dynamics in coastal aquifers is presented in the present study the governing equation of the time varying groundwater table was re derived an approximate analytical solution of the time varying groundwater table under the tidal forcing system was then presented based on taylor expansion and the perturbation method in comparison with solutions of homogeneous aquifer behaviors of total fluctuation range phase shift and mean water surface were discussed to specify the heterogeneity effect on the groundwater table dynamics the paper is organized as follows the mathematical model considering the depth varying hydraulic properties is established in section 2 in section 3 analytical solution of the time varying groundwater table is derived using taylor expansion and the perturbation method section 4 qualitatively and quantitatively discusses the present groundwater table dynamics in section 5 validity of dupuit assumption under the heterogeneous aquifer condition is confirmed through numerical simulations effects of heterogeneity on total fluctuation range phase shift and mean water surface of the groundwater table are also specified finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 governing equation a sketch of the coastal unconfined aquifer with a finite depth is presented in fig 1 in which a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system is used with x representing the cross shore direction being positive landward and y being positive upward with y 0 at the still water level swl hereafter to focus on the effects of the heterogeneous aquifer and to analyze influences of the heterogeneous term on groundwater table fluctuations beach is assumed to be vertical in the present study which was also applied in li et al 2002 and monachesi and guarracino 2011 the capillary effect and seepage face are neglected following li et al 2000 in a tidal forcing system under the dupuit assumption the time varying horizontal seepage flow velocity u x y t in a heterogeneous coastal unconfined aquifer could be estimated from the darcy s law 1 u x y t k y h x t x where k y is the depth varying hydraulic conductivity and h x t d Œ∑ x t is the instantaneous groundwater table height in which d is the mean aquifer thickness and Œ∑ x t is the groundwater table fluctuation relative to the swl as illustrated in fig 1 validity of dupuit assumption under the heterogeneous aquifer condition will be further discussed in section 5 1 using a 2 d numerical simulation following nielsen 1990 the continuity equation can be derived as 2 d Œ∑ n y d y t x d Œ∑ u d y where n y is the depth varying effective porosity porous media are the combination of air water and particles under different external pressures the soil skeleton deforms resulting in different porosities bear 1972 it has been experimentally shown there exists an exponential function between the depth and porosity in which compressibility factor is the decisive parameter bear 1972 terzaghi et al 1996 accordingly the depth varying effective porosity can be modeled by 3 n y n 0 e Œ± y where n 0 is the effective porosity at the swl and Œ± is the compressibility factor the local compressibility factor can be determined by a simple laboratory compression test in the field the in situ compressibility factor can be acquired after knowing the depth varying effective porosity through a field drilling hydraulic conductivity k has been experimentally proved to be positively related with the effective porosity n bear 1972 there are various empirical k n relations with different forms such as krumbein and monk 1943 formulation and kozeny carman equation bear 1972 nevertheless these empirical relations cannot be used directly in theoretical analysis owing to their complicated expressions nevertheless a k n polynomial relation with suitable order can represent any of the above empirical k n relations from the mathematical viewpoint and it is also convenient to deal with the heterogeneous aquifer model with respect to theoretical analysis for simplification a quadratic polynomial relationship between k and n is applied in this study 4 k y c 1 n y c 2 n 2 y where c 1 and c 2 are scale factors if a higher order k

leads to vertically non uniform distributions of both effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity in sand beaches bear 1972 to investigate the effects of depth varying effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity on groundwater table fluctuations and to evaluate applicability and limitations of uniform grain parameters applied in an actual heterogeneous aquifer in engineering practice the present time varying groundwater table is compared with the non linear solution of nielsen 1990 for a homogeneous situation fig 2 shows the corresponding results effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity used in nielsen 1990 are specified using grain parameters at three different aquifer depths i e the upper layer at the tidal crest easy to be obtained in the field the middle layer at the swl and the bottom layer at the tidal trough in calculation tidal amplitude is fixed at 5 m tidal period is 12 h and the mean aquifer thickness is set as 10 m effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity in the upper layer y 5 m are 0 2 and 0 2 cm s after li et al 2000 in addition scale factors determining the hydraulic conductivity are assumed as c 1 0 4 c 2 3 in eq 4 these parameters are all kept the same in the following discussions in calculation the compressibility factor is set as Œ± 0 01 m 1 and the cross shore position is specified at x 100 m accordingly the effective porosity at the swl n 0 can be calculated as 0 19 using eq 3 comparing among these four solutions groundwater table predicted by the upper grain parameters has the most evident fluctuation magnitude but a least phase shift in contrast the groundwater table using the bottom layer grain parameters shows the least fluctuation magnitude and the most obvious phase shift fig 2 also shows the result of the present heterogeneous model lies in between the nielsen s solutions using the upper and bottom layer grain parameters which is almost overlapped with the homogeneous solution using the middle layer grain parameters the aforementioned discrepancy among different grain parameters can be explained with respect to eq 37 there exist different wave numbers k being 0 027 m 1 0 0274 m 1 and 0 0278 m 1 in the upper middle and bottom layer respectively within a limited area a large wave number leads to a more evident amplitude damping in addition eq 37 indicates that heterogeneity weakens high order harmonic components in comparison with nielsen 1990 for a representative condition i e Œ± d 2 the high order harmonic components are completely diminished this extreme situation cannot be achieved in the general case and eq 37 becomes 38 Œ∑ a e k x cos œâ t k x 1 4 a Œµ 1 e 2 k x 5 discussions 5 1 validity of dupuit assumption with numerical modeling in this section validity of dupuit assumption was verified using the numerical modeling under a general condition simulations were conducted using the finite element codes sutra which can simulate saturated unsaturated variable density fluid flow in the subsurface systems voss and provost 2008 the variably saturated pore water flow in a heterogeneous aquifer is governed by the richards equation as follows 39 n s w t k œà p œÅ g y where k œà is the relative hydraulic conductivity depending on the capillary pressure head œà s w is the soil water saturation and p is the pore water pressure the relationships between the hydraulic conductivity soil saturation and capillary pressure head are described by the van genuchten 1980 formulas as follows 40 s w s wres 1 s wres 1 1 Œ± œà Œ≤ Œ≤ 1 Œ≤ 41 k œà k s s w 1 2 1 1 s w Œ≤ Œ≤ 1 Œ≤

seaward and inland boundary conditions are the same as those of analytical model i e eqs 8 and 9 respectively the no flow condition was applied to both the bottom and the infinite inland boundaries the seaward boundary was prescribed by the hydrostatic pressure induced by of the instantaneous tidal level in calculation other parameters are the same as those in the section 4 the simulation was run till the numerical solutions reach a quasi steady state i e periodic solutions are unaffected by the initial condition in simulation the sutra code was run with a time step of 1 min the mesh has a size of 0 25 m 0 2 m in the x and y directions in which the depth varying hydraulic properties were assigned individually fig 3 shows the time varying hydraulic head p œÅ g y at four representative positions as shown in fig 3 hydraulic heads at different depths are almost overlapped with each other for the same x position indicating a negligible vertical seepage flow in the y direction in contrast a more evident difference in the hydraulic head is observed for different x positions revealing the horizontal seepage flow is much more predominant than the vertical seepage flow therefore dupuit assumption is still effective under the present heterogeneous aquifer condition 5 2 effects of the compressibility factor on the range of groundwater table fluctuation total fluctuation range is defined as the difference between the crest and trough values of the groundwater table to quantitatively present the heterogeneity effect difference of the total fluctuation range dtfr between nielsen 1990 solution and the present solutions nielsen present is shown in fig 4 the compressibility factor Œ± varies in the range of 0 0 01 m 1 representing the homogeneous condition and the high compacting grains such as clays and shales bear 1972 the cross shore calculation domain ranges from 0 to 250 m in x direction considering that the groundwater table fluctuation is almost diminished at x 250 m li et al 2000 dtfrs along both x and y axes are zero in fig 4 which is due to the fact that y axis with x 0 represents the shoreline and x axis with Œ± 0 represents the homogeneous situation making the present solution degenerate into nielsen 1990 solution fig 4 a shows applying the upper layer grain parameters dtfr of nielsen 1990 solution is always larger than that of the present solution while it is always smaller than the present solution if using the bottom layer grain parameters as shown in fig 4 c fig 4 b reveals that difference between the present solution and nielsen 1990 solution is negligible only in the order of 0 1 cm for all considered Œ± values when grain parameters at swl the middle layer are used in the homogeneous model nevertheless dtfr becomes more evident in fig 4 a and c whose magnitude is ten times as much as that in fig 4 b from the perspective of difference on the entire x Œ± domain fig 4 presents similar variation characteristics with an asymmetric semi arc contour line distribution fig 4 shows dtfr becomes greater with the larger compressibility factor however dtfr increases first and then decreases along the cross shore direction whose maximum values occur around x 40 m 40 m and 45 m using the upper middle and bottom grain parameters respectively the relative difference of the total fluctuation range rdtfr between nielsen 1990 solution and the present solution is also calculated difference of the total fluctuation range total fluctuation range of the present solution and the results are presented in fig 5 fig 5 b reveals that rdtfr is always negligible in the order of 0 1 for all considered Œ± values when grain parameters in the middle layer are used in the homogeneous model in contrast fig 5 a and c applying the upper and bottom layer grain parameters respectively shows more evident rdtfr whose magnitude is about two orders larger than that in fig 5 b within the calculation domain fig 5 a and c shows rdtfr increases with the cross shore inland distance and the compressibility factor whose value even reaches 10 indicating a significant difference between the homogeneous model and the actual heterogeneous situation 5 3 effects of the compressibility factor on phase shift to examine the effects of heterogeneity on the phase shift of groundwater table fluctuation phase difference in radians between nielsen 1990 solution and the present solution nielsen present is considered and the corresponding contour line distributions are shown in fig 6 with respect to the crest and trough phase respectively in consistent with the above discussions phase difference between nielsen 1990 solution and the present solution is negligible if the middle layer grain parameters are used but it cannot be neglected when applying the upper and bottom layer grain parameters fig 6 a and b shows the present solution demonstrates more evident phase shift than that in the homogeneous aquifer system if using the upper layer grain parameters however homogeneous groundwater table fluctuation predicted using the bottom layer grain parameters always lags behind the phase of the heterogeneous aquifer as shown in fig 6 e and f nevertheless if applying the middle layer grain parameters in nielsen 1990 solution phase difference between two solutions could be negligible as shown in fig 6 c and d these features can also be observed in fig 2 illustratedbythevariationfeature in the entire calculation domain phase differences in fig 6 a b e and f monotonically increase with the landward position and the compressibility factor 5 4 cross shore distribution of the mean water surface mean water surface mws is defined as time averaged groundwater table above the swl horn 2002 yang et al 2021 the cross shore distribution of mws from x 0 m to x 250 m is presented in fig 7 to show the relative relations among different solutions a close up view of the result in between x 50 m and x 100 m is also presented using an inset in fig 7 with the increase of the inland position mws first increases rapidly then approaches a constant value fig 7 shows the mwss of nielsen 1990 with grain parameters at different layers and the present solution are almost overlapped with each other with a negligible difference of 1 mm and all demonstrate evident groundwater table overheight above the swl difference among different solutions increases first and then decreases as x approaches inland mws predicted using the upper layer grain parameters in nielsen 1990 solution shows the smallest value for which the total fluctuation range of groundwater table however has the maximum magnitude as shown in fig 2 fig 7 shows these four solutions all become 62 5 cm when x reaches about 100 m this result can be theoretically proved using eq 37 from which the mws can be mathematically estimated as 42 0 t Œ∑ d t t 1 4 a Œµ 1 e 2 k x eq 40 shows the mws is related to the tidal amplitude a mean aquifer thickness d wave number k and cross shore position x which becomes 1 4 a Œµ when x approaches infinity i e 62 5 cm in the present setting li and jiao 2003 showed that as landward distance approached infinity mws becomes insensitive to depth varying hydraulic conductivity this study further demonstrates the depth varying effective porosity thus the compressibility factor also has no influence on the mws in the case that x approaches infinity 6 conclusions under the dupuit assumption a new governing equation for groundwater dynamics in a heterogeneous coastal unconfined aquifer with the depth varying hydraulic properties was derived based on the darcy s law and the continuity equation after applying the taylor expansion to the governing equation an analytical solution of the time varying groundwater table was presented using the perturbation method accordingly parametric studies were conducted to examine the difference between the present solution and nielsen 1990 solution for homogeneous aquifer with vertically uniform grain parameters at three specific depths as for the temporal variation of the groundwater table fluctuation the present solution lies in between the nielsen s solutions using the upper and bottom layer grain parameters which is almost overlapped with the homogeneous solution with the middle layer grain parameters subsequently effects of compressibility factor on the total fluctuation range phase shift and mean water surface of the groundwater table were further examined as for the total fluctuation range and phase shift of the time varying groundwater table difference between nielsen 1990 solution and the present solution is negligible if the middle layer grain parameters were used in the homogeneous model nevertheless difference between these two solutions becomes evident when grain parameters in the upper or bottom layers were used in nielsen 1990 such difference is positively correlated with the compressibility factor Œ± being significant for large Œ± in addition it is theoretically demonstrated that both depth varying effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity have no effects on the mean water surface as landward distance approaches infinity declaration of

3628,coastal wetlands regulate nutrient fluxes from the continents to the oceans salt marshes are rapidly encroaching into mudflat area in mangrove wetlands shaping a mangrove salt marsh ecotone with unknown implications to coastal biogeochemical cycles here we hypothesized that nitrogen and phosphorus cycling varied in mangrove and salt marsh having significant implication on coastal waters we investigated a tidal creek with a marked mangrove salt marsh gradient in china using high frequency time series sampling of dissolved nutrients and observations of porewater exchange rate across the sediment water interface over a spring neap tidal cycle the nitrogen transformation rates and microbiological activities were also investigated to explain the variability in nitrogen concentrations the mangrove had net groundwater outflow rates of 3 6 4 3 mm d 1 while the salt marsh had net infiltration of surface water with rates of 0 5 2 9 mm d 1 salt marsh had less capacity for ammonium nh4 n production mineralization and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra than mangrove denitrification dominated nitrogen removal reaching 97 and 83 in mangrove and salt marsh respectively microbe distributions were consistent with nitrogen transformations with larger nirs and nrfa abundances for denitrification and dnra in the mangrove than salt marsh the mangrove had a net export of nh4 n but a net import of nox n sum of nitrate and nitrite and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip during the monitoring period in contrast the salt marsh had lower efflux of nutrient than influx leading to a net nutrient import during the monitoring period porewater released from the mangrove had a large din dip mole ratio 706 236 due to high nh4 n concentrations while nh4 n in the salt marsh were lower than in the mangrove overall this study revealed that mangrove salt marsh ecotone will push the native mangrove wetlands from being a source towards a sink of nh4 n to coastal waters by

mangrove 14 h was shorter than that in the salt marsh 20 h without a significant difference between neap and spring tides the direction and magnitude of pex across the swi were variable fig s5 the vertical hydraulic conductivity kv in the salt marsh was slightly larger than that in the mangrove table s2 the average outflow rates 0 75 and 0 41 mm h 1 during neap and spring tides respectively in the mangrove were larger than inflow rates 0 20 and 0 20 mm h 1 during both neap and spring tides fig s5 resulting in a net discharge of groundwater during both tides during spring tides the exchange between groundwater and surface water approached stagnation in salt marsh on comparison the exchange between groundwater and surface water became active during neap tides for example the inflow rate 0 26 mm h 1 of surface water was larger than outflow rate 0 15 mm h 1 of groundwater resulting in a net infiltration of surface water into marsh sediments this could be explained by the larger slope of creek bank in the mangrove steepness 4 6 than salt marsh steepness 3 6 leading to larger hydraulic gradient between tidal creek and monitoring sites in the mangrove and salt marsh fig 1 3 3 nutrient fluxes via pex the magnitude and direction of nutrient fluxes driven by pex varied with nutrient species and tidal types fig 3 fig 4 and table s4 in the mangrove nh4 n and don were exported from groundwater to surface water the net groundwater efflux of nh4 n during spring tides was almost twice than that during neap tides in contrast the net efflux of don during neap tides was two orders of magnitude larger than that during spring tides nox n was imported into groundwater from surface water overall tdn had net efflux during both neap 2 6 mmol m 2 d 1 and spring tides 1 1 mmol m 2 d 1 fig s5 in the salt marsh most forms of nitrogen were imported into sediments from surface water except don during neap tides and nh4 n during spring tides all forms of phosphorus had net influx but varied with ecosystems and tidal types the net influx of dip in the mangrove was 28 36 larger than that in the salt marsh in contrast dop had 31 51 larger net influx in the salt marsh than that in the mangrove the net influx of tdp in the mangrove 9 8 10 3 mmol m 2 d 1 was 11 smaller than that in the salt marsh 1 1 10 2 mmol m 2 d 1 during neap tides while 9 larger during spring tides 2 3 10 3 and 2 1 10 3 mmol m 2 d 1 fig s5 3 4 nitrogen transformation and functional gene abundance in sediments the potential rates of nitrogen transformations and associated functional gene abundance in sediments varied with ecosystems table s5 in mangrove sediments mineralization was the dominant process at 14 03 1 12 Œºmol kg 1h 1 followed by denitrification 7 49 0 71 Œºmol kg 1h 1 dnra 4 85 0 76 Œºmol kg 1h 1 nitrification 4 51 2 43 Œºmol kg 1h 1 and anammox 0 24 0 01 Œºmol kg 1h 1 the rates in salt marsh sediments were all smaller than those in mangrove except anammox at 1 03 0 09 Œºmol kg 1h 1 the potential rate of nitrification was undetectable in salt marsh sediments the dominant microbes for nitrification were ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in both mangrove 1 96 106 and 3 07 106 copies g 1 wet soil and salt marsh sediments 0 7 106 and 0 49 106 copies g 1 wet soil table s5 ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob was two orders of magnitude lower than aoa and nob in both the mangrove 7 90 104 copies g 1 wet soil and salt marsh sediments 1 60 104 copies g 1 wet soil nirs was the dominant gene for denitrification and the relative abundance in the mangrove 1 12 108 copies g 1 was larger than that in the salt marsh 0 15 108 copies g 1 narg another functional gene for denitrification was two orders of magnitude lower than nirs but the larger value also occurred in mangrove sediments 8 18 106 copies g 1 the gene abundance of hzsb for anamox and nrfa for dnra in mangrove sediments was about four times and seven times higher than that of the salt marsh the accumulation and removal of nitrogen and associated contributions of transformation processes varied in mangrove fig 5 a and salt marsh sediments fig 5b mineralization 84 was the main contributor to nh4 n production in the mangrove while in the salt marsh dnra 62 exceeded mineralization 38 nitrification was the major process for nh4 n consumption in mangrove sediments while anammox was greater in salt marsh sediments denitrification played a dominant role in no3 n removal compared to dnra the contribution of denitrification in mangrove sediments was slightly larger than that in salt marsh sediments considering the production and removal processes the net accumulation of nh4 n in mangrove sediments 14 3 Œºmol kg 1h 1 was larger than that in salt marsh sediments 7 1 Œºmol kg 1h 1 in contrast the removal of no3 n in salt marsh sediments was larger than that in mangrove sediments 4 discussion 4 1 hydro biogeochemical control on porewater nitrogen tides were the main factor driving the vertical pex the mangrove had net groundwater efflux while the salt marsh had net surface water influx during the monitoring period fig 3 the salt marsh had a smaller pex due to the smaller hydraulic gradient than mangrove this further indicated that the hydraulic gradient played a critical role in regulating pex when the similar hydraulic conductivity exited in two coastal habitats in addition the surface elevation of the salt marsh was about 15 cm lower than that of the mangrove resulting in longer water inundation period smaller differences in salinity between surface water and groundwater table 1 suggest a larger proportion of seawater in the groundwater in the salt marsh than in the mangrove all in all the different geological setting in two ecosystems led to different hydrology including water residence time and flow rate that control biogeochemical properties in sediments nitrogen cycling on intertidal sediments is highly dynamic with large temporal and spatial variability controlled by sediment permeability transport mechanisms tidal cycles vegetation types and microbial activities schutte et al 2019 mineralization and dnra are two major processes controlling nh4 n production while nitrification and anammox controlled nh4 n loss in sediments fig 5 toc was the substrate for mineralization and strong mineralization often results in high nh4 n in porewater lee et al 2008 wang et al 2019 higher toc contents explained larger rates of mineralization in mangrove 14 03 Œºmol kg 1h 1 than salt marsh 2 71 Œºmol kg 1h 1 table s5 functional gene abundances and potential nitrogen transformation rates had a significant positive correlation n 7 r2 0 58 p 0 05 fig s6 higher gene abundance of nrfa dnra gene was also observed in mangrove sediments than in the salt marsh table s5 explaining larger dnra in the mangrove all the above contents explained nh4 n concentrations in groundwater were larger in the mangrove than in the salt marsh while anaerobic conditions are expected in wetland sediments the mixing of groundwater low do and surface water high do enable nitrification in sediments xiao et al 2018 shorter residence time of groundwater and the longer unsubmerged time caused by higher elevation in the mangrove increased oxygen penetration leading to higher eh and nitrifying bacteria aoa aob and nob than in salt marsh sediments table s5 the previous study in the same study area showed water contents and salinity in salt marsh sediments were larger than in mangrove sediments gao et al 2019 larger water content blocks the penetration of oxygen resulting a prolonged anaerobic state of sediments and low nitrification potential study showed that nitrification process generally decreased with increasing salinity meng et al 2020 these above factors explained higher nitrification potential in the mangrove than in the salt marsh both gene abundance and activities of anammox microbes can have a positive correlation with the sediment organic carbon lisa et al 2014 mangrove has c3 photosynthesis and can retain its aboveground biomass in the whole year while salt marsh conducting c4 photosynthesis has to regrow after the senescence in winter mckee vervaeke 2018 the difference in photosynthesis lead to higher toc accumulation in mangrove sediments than in salt marsh sediments table s5 richer toc in mangrove explained higher gene abundance of hzsb than in salt marsh salinity water content redox potential and the concentration of no2 n in sediments also affect anammox bacteria activities dale et al 2009 shen et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 no2 n is an important oxidized substrate for anammox risgaard petersen et al 2003 nh4 n is usually plentiful in sediments while no2 n likely controls the gene abundance for anammox luvizott et al 2019 much lower no2 n in mangrove groundwater than that in marsh groundwater may lead to lower anammox potential in mangrove sediments there was a greater net accumulation of nh4 n in mangrove sediments than in the salt marsh fig 5a b taken together these lines of evidence help to explain higher nh4 n in groundwater than surface water and lower concentrations in marsh groundwater than in mangrove groundwater nox n in groundwater was lower compared to that in surface water fig 2 because denitrification anammox and dnra remove nox n in anaerobic conditions potential denitrification accounted for 97 and 83 of nitrogen removal in mangrove and marsh sediments respectively in line with our previous observations in another eutrophic chinese estuary invasive salt marshes can have higher denitrification rates than the unvegetated zone but lower rates than the native mangrove zone wang et al 2014 denitrification rates were correlated positively with functional genes as observed in other studies focused on estuarine wetlands in china and the u k gao et al 2017 smith et al 2015 here the gene abundance of narg and nirs in mangrove sediments were all higher than that in the salt marsh table s5 nox n can be reduced to n2 via denitrification we indeed observed higher dissolved nitrogen gas Œ¥n2 in mangrove groundwater than marsh groundwater over time series observation fig s7 compared with denitrification dnra played a less role in no3 n removal in both mangrove and salt marsh fig 5 the lower dnra rate in salt marsh sediments is consistent with earlier observation that the invasion of spartina alterniflora can minimize dnra gao et al 2019 water exchange across the swi has a negative correlation with groundwater residence time qu et al 2017 water residence time affects the duration and frequency of anaerobic aerobic conditions which then alters nitrogen cycling including aerobic nitrification and anaerobic denitrification pezeshki 2001 sharp et al 2021 overall longer groundwater residence time usually increases nitrogen removal sharp et al 2021 the lower exchange rates in the mangrove during spring tides than neap tides suggested longer groundwater residence time causing oxygen consumption and nox n removal via denitrification gonneea charette 2014 explaining lower nox n in groundwater during spring tides 4 2 contrasting nutrient fluxes via pex between mangrove and salt marsh our estimated pex rates and nutrient fluxes fell well within the wide range observed in other intertidal wetlands table 2 however our din fluxes were lower than most other investigations due to the lower nitrogen concentrations or pex rates with the exception in jiaozhou bay china for example average nh4 n and nox n in groundwater in dan ao estuary china was 200 and 350 Œºmol l 1 about 3 and 12 times greater than in our study combined with the two orders of magnitude larger pex much larger nutrient fluxes were estimated for dan ao estuary li et al 2018 though the nitrogen concentrations were 10 20 times higher in jiaozhou bay the pex was two orders of magnitude lower than this study driving lower nutrient fluxes qu et al 2017 the mangrove had a net export of nh4 n and a net import of nox n fig 4 this finding supports recent observations of nh4 n exports and nox n imports into mangrove creeks wadnerkar et al 2019 wang et al 2021 during neap tides the average water level is relatively low resulting in large hydraulic gradient between groundwater and surface water in the tidal creek leading to a greater efflux and explaining the stronger source of nitrogen during neap tides than spring tides net influx of nh4 n nox n din and tdn in the salt marsh signified the salt marsh served as a sink of nitrogen during our observations a smaller hydraulic gradient proximity to the sea and possibly longer water residence time than in mangrove drove nitrogen infiltration in the salt marsh a correlation analysis fig s8 implied that the net efflux or influx of din and tdn were controlled by pex however the high denitrification rates reducing nox n concentrations in groundwater played a more significant role in nox n fluxes than the magnitude of pex both the mangrove and salt marsh had a net import of dissolved phosphorus fig 4 the concentrations of dip and dop in surface water were all much greater than those in groundwater implying p retention in sediments phosphorus in sediments can be controlled by the immobilization of ca or fe species and adsorption or desorption of suspended particles ranjan et al 2011 smolders et al 2017 a previous study in the same study area showed that a large amount available phosphorus were utilized or transferred from the sediments to the plants leading to a decrease in phosphorus contents in sediments feng et al 2017 lower dip in groundwater than surface water in our study may be the result of strong uptake by plant roots and microorganisms physical absorption by sediment particles and chemical immobilization could also reduce dip in groundwater holmboe et al 2001 we hypothesized that the extensive removal activities in salt marsh sediments subsequently led the salt marsh to become a dip sink when surface water contains high nutrient concentration that infiltrates into sediments the larger difference in concentrations between surface water and groundwater indicated a larger net import of dip during neap tides than spring tides 4 3 uncertainty analysis organic matter degradation and nutrient cycling varied seasonally in intertidal groundwater due to the seasonal differences in rainfall temperature and plant periodicity growth steinmuller et al 2020 sullivan et al 2021 wang et al 2019 our previous study along the tidal creek in the same area showed that the nutrient concentrations at high tides were similar among seasons but the concentrations at low tides showed seasonal variations with the largest variation of 80 which were likely affected by the groundwater discharge wang et al 2019 we assumed that there were no significant seasonal variations of nutrient concentrations in surface water we set the seasonal variations of groundwater concentrations to 25 50 and 80 to analyze the nutrient fluxes across the swi fig s9 the results showed that in mangrove no3 n always had net influxes while nh4 n din and tdn always had net efflux during both neap and spring tides which were consistent with the results observed in this study in salt marsh the pattern of nitrogen fluxes were almost the same as that in this study with an exception of tdn fig s9 g patterns of phosphorus fluxes in mangrove and salt marsh were not affected by the alteration in concentrations during neap tides fig s10 a h during spring tides the influx of phosphorus in salt marsh shifted from less to larger than in mangrove when the concentrations in mangrove and salt marsh groundwater both increased by over 25 fig s10 l n overall the seasonal variations in nutrient concentrations caused by discrepancy in plant uptake and microbial activities could not change the vertical flux patterns in mangrove salt marsh ecotone previous study showed that the ratios of the vertical hydraulic conductivity kv to the horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh of the sediments were equal to 2 3 1 2 4 in the silty sand estuarine mud clayey sand and surface layer respectively hughes et al 1998 xiao et al 2017 the mean sd 2 1 of the above ratios of kv kh was used to conservatively estimate the horizontal fluxes of nutrients based on the hydraulic gradient between monitoring sites at mangrove salt marsh and tidal creek the results showed that all the nutrients had net horizontal effluxes from mangrove and salt marsh to tidal creek as summed in table s6 the horizontal fluxes were consistently much less than vertical fluxes with an exception of phosphorus fluxes in mangrove the total fluxes the sum of horizontal and vertical fluxes of nutrients suggested the same source sink pattern as the individual scenarios that only include vertical fluxes these results revealed that the horizontal fluxes played a much less role than vertical fluxes and supported the point in this study that salt marsh can retain high nitrogen loadings discharged from mangrove 4 4 ecological and environmental implications the fluxes across the swi in the mangrove differed from the salt marsh mainly due to 1 the steeper slope of creek bank and relatively lower water table in the mangrove and 2 the habitat specific differences in structures microbial activities nutrient cycling and storage different wetlands can provide similar ecological functions but the differences in physiological characteristics and structures likely alter these processes kelleway et al 2017 salt marshes are herbaceous with seasonal growth patterns granville et al 2021 finer roots of salt marshes increase the water content and change the redox environment altering the microbial communities and increasing nitrogen retention comeaux et al 2012 liu et al 2020 in contrast the more labile mangrove litter ultimately leads to much faster mineralization and higher nutrient production simpson et al 2020 here the mangrove was a source of nh4 n being exported to the coastal water nutrients promote the productivity of coastal waters and can drive harmful algal blooms beman et al 2005 mukhopadhyay et al 2006 the average din dip mole ratios in surface water were 33 6 in the mangrove and 57 32 in the salt marsh fig s4 well exceeded the redfield ratio 16 1 but still much lower than average groundwater ratios 497 323 observed in this study the discharge of groundwater during low tides may promote n associated eutrophication the salt marsh sediments served as a sink of nitrogen and had a smaller ratio of din dip than the mangrove hence the salt marsh can retain nitrogen especially nh4 n that discharged from mangrove attenuating the nitrogen surplus in the estuarine system as shown in fig 4d the similar influx of drp dop and tdp in these two habitats suggested that the salt marsh invasion had no significant effect on phosphorus flux patterns in mangroves p 0 05 nutrient fluxes particularly nitrogen to coastal waters have risen in recent decades in china resulting in widespread hypoxia and other ecological damages howarth et al 2011 our findings thus suggest that the invasive expansion of salt marsh may partially alter the nutrient stoichiometry of coastal water and relieve estuarine n associated eutrophication the combined study of hydro biogeochemical processes in china coastal wetlands advanced our knowledge about how the mangrove salt marsh ecotone influences estuarine ecosystems this study provides insights to environmental managers assessing the influences of salt marsh encroachment into mangroves in other parts of the world such as australia and the us mangroves are moving poleward and invading salt marsh areas krauss et al 2011 osland et al 2013 saintilan et al 2014 this encroachment affects key ecosystem services and function including increased pressure on salt marsh communities a greater potential to respond to increasing sea level changing nitrogen transformations process and enhanced ability for carbon storage and sequestration bianchi et al 2013 saintilan et al 2014 sullivan et al 2021 our investigation builds on this earlier work by showing how changing vegetation communities may influence the wetlands nitrogen cycle the ongoing mangrove salt marsh ecotone seemed to reduce ammonium nitrogen exports alter nutrient ratios and the source sink pattern of nh4 n and no3 n compared to the native mangrove wetlands we suggested the ecotone will result in potential shifts of nutrient supply and ratios modifying phytoplankton growth in coastal waters 5 conclusions our combination of microbiological hydrological and biogeochemical approaches revealed that porewater exchange drives the nitrogen source sink pattern in a mangrove salt marsh transition zone the mangrove acted as the net discharge area of groundwater while the salt marsh acted as the net infiltration area of surface water mineralization and dnra were the main processes for nh4 n production with higher rates in mangrove sediments denitrification dominated no3 n removal with the contribution of 97 and 83 in mangrove and salt marsh sediments respectively the distributions of functional microbial communities were consistent with the interpretation of nitrogen transformations and fluxes the mangrove had a net export of nh4 n and don to surface waters but a net import of nox n and phosphorus due to strong mineralization denitrification and absorption of phosphorus the salt marsh had a net import of all forms of nitrogen and phosphorus due to much larger surface water inflow than the groundwater outflow the mangrove groundwater had a large din dip mole ratio up to 706 236 due to high nh4 n concentration the salt marsh may consume surplus nh4 n that derived from mangrove groundwater discharge potentially reducing the nutrient transport to coastal waters through the mangrove salt marsh ecotone the observed contrasting pattern of porewater exchange and nitrogen cycling provides broader insights into the potential ecological implication of the ongoing mangrove salt marsh ecotone the ecotone will push these native mangroves from being a source towards a sink of ammonium nitrogen to coastal water by decreasing porewater exchange and modifying the nutrient stoichiometry in this study additional observations in other mangrove salt marsh transition zones are needed to build this view credit authorship contribution statement fenfang

3628,coastal wetlands regulate nutrient fluxes from the continents to the oceans salt marshes are rapidly encroaching into mudflat area in mangrove wetlands shaping a mangrove salt marsh ecotone with unknown implications to coastal biogeochemical cycles here we hypothesized that nitrogen and phosphorus cycling varied in mangrove and salt marsh having significant implication on coastal waters we investigated a tidal creek with a marked mangrove salt marsh gradient in china using high frequency time series sampling of dissolved nutrients and observations of porewater exchange rate across the sediment water interface over a spring neap tidal cycle the nitrogen transformation rates and microbiological activities were also investigated to explain the variability in nitrogen concentrations the mangrove had net groundwater outflow rates of 3 6 4 3 mm d 1 while the salt marsh had net infiltration of surface water with rates of 0 5 2 9 mm d 1 salt marsh had less capacity for ammonium nh4 n production mineralization and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra than mangrove denitrification dominated nitrogen removal reaching 97 and 83 in mangrove and salt marsh respectively microbe distributions were consistent with nitrogen transformations with larger nirs and nrfa abundances for denitrification and dnra in the mangrove than salt marsh the mangrove had a net export of nh4 n but a net import of nox n sum of nitrate and nitrite and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip during the monitoring period in contrast the salt marsh had lower efflux of nutrient than influx leading to a net nutrient import during the monitoring period porewater released from the mangrove had a large din dip mole ratio 706 236 due to high nh4 n concentrations while nh4 n in the salt marsh were lower than in the mangrove overall this study revealed that mangrove salt marsh ecotone will push the native mangrove wetlands from being a source towards a sink of nh4 n to coastal waters by decreasing porewater exchange modifying the nutrients stoichiometry and ultimately alleviating the potential of n associated eutrophication in nearby coastal waters keywords blue carbon system

of biological communities in nearshore waters tait et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 tides control pex and thus alter biogeochemical parameters such as salinity ph and redox potential robinson et al 2007 taniguchi 2002 these parameters can affect microbial communities which modify essential biogeochemical processes of nitrogen cycling such as nitrification of nh4 n to no3 n denitrification of no3 n to

traits of vegetation and the hydrological conditions cui et al 2021 steinlein 2013 studies showed that fine roots of herbaceous salt marsh plants are likely to increase the capacity to retain water liu et al 2020 affecting the hydraulic characteristics the differences in carbon quality between salt marsh c4 plant and mangrove c3 plant lead to variations in carbon and nitrogen storage mckee vervaeke 2018 yang et al 2013 functional gene abundance in sediments responsible for nitrogen transformations also varied leading to the difference in the nitrogen cycling between salt marsh and mangrove gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 however the interplay among pex tidal types and biochemical processes on nutrient source sink patterns remains poorly understood in the context of changing mangrove salt marsh ecotone here we hypothesized that salt marsh growth in mangrove dominated wetlands will modify pex and nutrient biogeochemistry we investigated pex nitrogen transformations and associated microbiological activities in a subtropical mangrove wetland being invaded by salt marshes in southeast china we carried out time series observations of nutrient concentrations in surface water and shallow groundwater i e porewater during a spring neap tide cycle the specific objectives of this study were 1 to estimate pex derived nutrient fluxes across the sediment water interface hereafter swi in the mangrove and salt marsh 2 to explore the hydro biogeochemical controls of the nutrient export or import patterns across swi and 3 to discuss the potential ecological and environmental implications of mangrove salt marsh ecotone to coastal waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study site the study site was in zhangjiang estuary national mangrove reserve zjenmr 117 24 117 30 e 23 53 23 56 n in southeast china fig 1 the mangrove wetland covers an area of 2 6 km2 and experiences a semidiurnal tide with a tidal range of 0 43 4 67 m 2 32 m on average zhu

avicennia marina and aegiceras corniculatum spartina alterniflora is invading into mudflat areas at the edge of mangroves the invasive area has increased to 1 4 km2 over the last 30 years dong et al 2020 2 2 monitoring and sampling campaigns field observations were conducted along a winding tidal creek forming a natural ecological continuum of mangrove salt marsh fig 1 the approach for quantifying pex rate relied on data from two paired wells installed along the creek edges of the mangrove and salt marsh fig s1 the paired wells 70 cm depth were equipped with inner œÜ 30 mm and outer œÜ 100 mm plexiglass pipes fig s1 two ctd diver loggers vanessen netherlands were installed in the inner pipes at the depths of 5 cm upper sensor and 65 cm lower sensor to record water temperature conductivity and pressure and one at the bottom of the creek to monitor tidal fluctuations to minimize the impact of sediment disturbance monitoring began two days after installation at a frequency of 30 min the monitoring occurred on two occasions including one day during neap tides on 10th october 2020 and a day during spring tides on 20th october 2020 surface water was collected hourly during

tides 51 0 12 0 Œºmol l 1 was similar to spring tides 49 8 6 5 Œºmol l 1 in mangrove surface water nox n concentration at low tides was 71 97 lower than that at high tides nox n concentration in mangrove groundwater was 55 and 97 lower than in surface water during neap and spring tides respectively the salt marsh and mangrove had similar nox n concentration in surface water 50 60 Œºmol l 1 don in surface water and groundwater of the mangrove and salt marsh were similar during spring tides 17 27 Œºmol l 1 but during neap tides don in surface water 3 7 11 7 Œºmol l 1 was much lower than that in groundwater 206 3 297 1 Œºmol l 1 in mangrove surface water drp during neap tides 2 6 0 4 Œºmol l 1 was higher than that during spring tides 2 1 0 4 Œºmol l 1 drp in mangrove groundwater had no obvious difference between spring and neap tides but was one order of magnitude lower than surface water in the salt marsh drp in surface water and groundwater were lower than that of the mangrove during neap tides table 1 drp concentration during spring tides was much higher than that during neap tides without obvious difference between surface and groundwater din dip mole ratios in groundwater were much larger than that in surface water both in the mangrove and salt marsh fig s4 din dip mole ratios in mangrove groundwater were 30 and 15 times larger than that in surface water during neap and spring tides respectively in salt marsh din dip mole ratios in groundwater were 6 and 3 times larger than in surface water during neap and spring tides respectively but both were much lower than that in mangrove groundwater 3 2 hydrodynamics and pex water depths varied from 0 85 m to 3 28 m during neap tides and 0 68 m to 3 93 m during spring tides the inundation time of the mangrove 14 h was shorter than that in the salt marsh 20 h without a significant difference between neap and spring tides the direction and magnitude of pex across the swi were variable fig s5 the vertical hydraulic conductivity kv in the salt marsh was slightly larger than that in the mangrove table s2 the average outflow rates 0 75 and 0 41 mm h 1 during neap and spring tides respectively in the mangrove were larger than inflow rates 0 20 and 0 20 mm h 1 during both neap and spring tides fig s5 resulting in a net discharge of groundwater during both tides during spring tides the exchange between groundwater and surface water approached stagnation in salt marsh on comparison the exchange between groundwater and surface water became active during neap tides for example the inflow rate 0 26 mm h 1 of surface water was larger than outflow rate 0 15 mm h 1 of groundwater resulting in a net infiltration of surface water into marsh sediments this could be explained by the larger slope of creek bank in the mangrove steepness 4 6 than salt marsh steepness 3 6 leading to larger hydraulic gradient between tidal creek and monitoring sites in the mangrove and salt marsh fig 1 3 3 nutrient fluxes via pex the magnitude and direction of nutrient fluxes driven by pex varied with nutrient species and tidal types fig 3 fig 4 and table s4 in the mangrove nh4 n and don were exported from groundwater to surface water the net groundwater efflux of nh4 n during spring tides was almost twice than that during neap tides in contrast the net efflux of don during neap tides was two orders of magnitude larger than that during spring tides nox n was imported into groundwater from surface water overall tdn had net efflux during both neap 2 6 mmol m 2 d 1 and spring tides 1 1 mmol m 2 d 1 fig s5 in the salt marsh most forms of nitrogen were imported into sediments from surface water except don during neap tides and nh4 n during spring tides all forms of phosphorus had net influx but varied with ecosystems and tidal types the net influx of dip in the mangrove was 28 36 larger than that in the salt marsh in contrast dop had 31 51 larger net influx in the salt marsh than that in the mangrove the net influx of tdp in the mangrove 9 8 10 3 mmol m 2 d 1 was 11 smaller than that in the salt marsh 1 1 10 2 mmol m 2 d 1 during neap tides while 9 larger during spring tides 2 3 10 3 and 2 1 10 3 mmol m 2 d 1 fig s5 3 4 nitrogen transformation and functional gene abundance in sediments the potential rates of nitrogen transformations and associated functional gene abundance in sediments varied with ecosystems table s5 in mangrove sediments mineralization was the dominant process at 14 03 1 12 Œºmol kg 1h 1 followed by denitrification 7 49 0 71 Œºmol kg 1h 1 dnra 4 85 0 76 Œºmol kg 1h 1 nitrification 4 51 2 43 Œºmol kg 1h 1 and anammox 0 24 0 01 Œºmol kg 1h 1 the rates in salt marsh sediments were all smaller than those in mangrove except anammox at 1 03 0 09 Œºmol kg 1h 1 the potential rate of nitrification was undetectable in salt marsh sediments the dominant microbes for nitrification were ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in both mangrove 1 96 106 and 3 07 106 copies g 1 wet soil and salt marsh sediments 0 7 106 and 0 49 106 copies g 1 wet soil table s5 ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob was two orders of magnitude lower than aoa and nob in both the mangrove 7 90 104 copies g 1 wet soil and salt marsh sediments 1 60 104 copies g 1 wet soil nirs was the dominant gene for denitrification and the relative abundance in the mangrove 1 12 108 copies g 1 was larger than that in the salt marsh 0 15 108 copies g 1 narg another functional gene for denitrification was two orders of magnitude lower than nirs but the larger value also occurred in mangrove sediments 8 18 106 copies g 1 the gene abundance of hzsb for anamox and nrfa for dnra in mangrove sediments was about four times and seven times higher than that of the salt marsh the accumulation and removal of nitrogen and associated contributions of transformation processes varied in mangrove fig 5 a and salt marsh sediments fig 5b mineralization 84 was the main contributor to nh4 n production in the mangrove while in the salt marsh dnra 62 exceeded mineralization 38 nitrification was the major process for nh4 n consumption in mangrove sediments while anammox was greater in salt marsh sediments denitrification played a dominant role in no3 n removal compared to dnra the contribution of denitrification in mangrove sediments was slightly larger than that in salt marsh sediments considering the production and removal processes the net accumulation of nh4 n in mangrove sediments 14 3 Œºmol kg 1h 1 was larger than that in salt marsh sediments 7 1 Œºmol kg 1h 1 in contrast the removal of no3 n in salt marsh sediments was larger than that in mangrove sediments 4 discussion 4 1 hydro biogeochemical control on porewater nitrogen tides were the main factor driving the vertical pex the mangrove had net groundwater efflux while the salt marsh had net surface water influx during the monitoring period fig 3 the salt marsh had a smaller pex due to the smaller hydraulic gradient than mangrove this further indicated that the hydraulic gradient played a critical role in regulating pex when the similar hydraulic conductivity exited in two coastal habitats in addition the surface elevation of the salt marsh was about 15 cm lower than that of the mangrove resulting in longer water inundation period smaller differences in salinity between surface water and groundwater table 1 suggest a larger proportion of seawater in the groundwater in the salt marsh than in the mangrove all in all the different geological setting in two ecosystems led to different hydrology including water residence time and flow rate that control biogeochemical properties in sediments nitrogen cycling on intertidal sediments is highly dynamic with large temporal and spatial variability controlled by sediment permeability transport mechanisms tidal cycles vegetation types and microbial activities schutte et al 2019 mineralization and dnra are two major processes controlling nh4 n production while nitrification and anammox controlled nh4 n loss in sediments fig 5 toc was the substrate for mineralization and strong mineralization often results in high nh4 n in porewater lee et al 2008 wang et al 2019 higher toc contents explained larger rates of mineralization in mangrove 14 03 Œºmol kg 1h 1 than salt marsh 2 71 Œºmol kg 1h 1 table s5 functional gene abundances and potential nitrogen transformation rates had a significant positive correlation n 7 r2 0 58 p 0 05 fig s6 higher gene abundance of nrfa dnra gene was also observed in mangrove sediments than in the salt marsh table s5 explaining larger dnra in the mangrove all the above contents explained nh4 n concentrations in groundwater were larger in the mangrove than in the salt marsh while anaerobic conditions are expected in wetland sediments the mixing of groundwater low do and surface water high do enable nitrification in sediments xiao et al 2018 shorter residence time of groundwater and the longer unsubmerged time caused by higher elevation in the mangrove increased oxygen penetration leading to higher eh and nitrifying bacteria aoa aob and nob than in salt marsh sediments table s5 the previous study in the same study area showed water contents and salinity in salt marsh sediments were larger than in mangrove sediments gao et al 2019 larger water content blocks the penetration of oxygen resulting a prolonged anaerobic state of sediments and low nitrification potential study showed that nitrification process generally decreased with increasing salinity meng et al 2020 these above factors explained higher nitrification potential in the mangrove than in the salt marsh both gene abundance and activities of anammox microbes can have a positive correlation with the sediment organic carbon lisa et al 2014 mangrove has c3 photosynthesis and can retain its aboveground biomass in the whole year while salt marsh conducting c4 photosynthesis has to regrow after the senescence in winter mckee vervaeke 2018 the difference in photosynthesis lead to higher toc accumulation in mangrove sediments than in salt marsh sediments table s5 richer toc in mangrove explained higher gene abundance of hzsb than in salt marsh salinity water content redox potential and the concentration of no2 n in sediments also affect anammox bacteria activities dale et al 2009 shen et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 no2 n is an important oxidized substrate for anammox risgaard petersen et al 2003 nh4 n is usually plentiful in sediments while no2 n likely controls the gene abundance for anammox luvizott et al 2019 much lower no2 n in mangrove groundwater than that in marsh groundwater may lead to lower anammox potential in mangrove sediments there was a greater net accumulation of nh4 n in mangrove sediments than in the salt marsh fig 5a b taken together these lines of evidence help to explain higher nh4 n in groundwater than surface water and lower concentrations in marsh groundwater than in mangrove groundwater nox n in groundwater was lower compared to that in surface water fig 2 because denitrification anammox and dnra remove nox n in anaerobic conditions potential denitrification accounted for 97 and 83 of nitrogen removal in mangrove and marsh sediments respectively in line with our previous observations in another eutrophic chinese estuary invasive salt marshes can have higher denitrification rates than the unvegetated zone but lower rates than the native mangrove zone wang et al 2014 denitrification rates were correlated positively with functional genes as observed in other studies focused on estuarine wetlands in china and the u k gao et al 2017 smith et al 2015 here the gene abundance of narg and nirs in mangrove sediments were all higher than that in the salt marsh table s5 nox n can be reduced to n2 via denitrification we indeed observed higher dissolved nitrogen gas Œ¥n2 in mangrove groundwater than marsh groundwater over time series observation fig s7 compared with denitrification dnra played a less role in no3 n removal in both mangrove and salt marsh fig 5 the lower dnra rate in salt marsh sediments is consistent with earlier observation that the invasion of spartina alterniflora can minimize dnra gao et al 2019 water exchange across the swi has a negative correlation with groundwater residence time qu et al 2017 water residence time affects the duration and frequency of anaerobic aerobic conditions which then alters nitrogen cycling including aerobic nitrification and anaerobic denitrification pezeshki 2001 sharp et al 2021 overall longer groundwater residence time usually increases nitrogen removal sharp et al 2021 the lower exchange rates in the mangrove during spring tides than neap tides suggested longer groundwater residence time causing oxygen consumption and nox n removal via denitrification gonneea charette 2014 explaining lower nox n in groundwater during spring tides 4 2 contrasting nutrient fluxes via pex between mangrove and salt marsh our estimated pex rates and nutrient fluxes fell well within the wide range observed in other intertidal wetlands table 2 however our din fluxes were lower than most other investigations due to the lower nitrogen concentrations or pex rates with the exception in jiaozhou bay china for example average nh4 n and nox n in groundwater in dan ao estuary china was 200 and 350 Œºmol l 1 about 3 and 12 times greater than in our study combined with the two orders of magnitude larger pex much larger nutrient fluxes were estimated for dan ao estuary li et al 2018 though the nitrogen concentrations were 10 20 times higher in jiaozhou bay the pex was two orders of magnitude lower than this study driving lower nutrient fluxes qu et al 2017 the mangrove had a net export of nh4 n and a net import of nox n fig 4 this finding supports recent observations of nh4 n exports and nox n imports into mangrove creeks wadnerkar et al 2019 wang et al 2021 during neap tides the average water level is relatively low resulting in large hydraulic gradient between groundwater and surface water in the tidal creek leading to a greater efflux and explaining the stronger source of nitrogen during neap tides than spring tides net influx of nh4 n nox n din and tdn in the salt marsh signified the salt marsh served as a sink of nitrogen during our observations a smaller hydraulic gradient proximity to the sea and possibly longer water residence time than in mangrove drove nitrogen infiltration in the salt marsh a correlation analysis fig s8 implied that the net efflux or influx of din and tdn were controlled by pex however the high denitrification rates reducing nox n concentrations in groundwater played a more significant role in nox n fluxes than the magnitude of pex both the mangrove and salt marsh had a net import of dissolved phosphorus fig 4 the concentrations of dip and dop in surface water were all much greater than those in groundwater implying p retention in sediments phosphorus in sediments can be controlled by the immobilization of ca or fe species and adsorption or desorption of suspended particles ranjan et al 2011 smolders et al 2017 a previous study in the same study area showed that a large amount available phosphorus were utilized or transferred from the sediments to the plants leading to a decrease in phosphorus contents in sediments feng et al 2017 lower dip in groundwater than surface water in our study may be the result of strong uptake by plant roots and microorganisms physical absorption by sediment particles and chemical immobilization could also reduce dip in groundwater holmboe et al 2001 we hypothesized that the extensive removal activities in salt marsh sediments subsequently led the salt marsh to become a dip sink when surface water contains high nutrient concentration that infiltrates into sediments the larger difference in concentrations between surface water and groundwater indicated a larger net import of dip during neap tides than spring tides 4 3 uncertainty analysis organic matter degradation and nutrient cycling varied seasonally in intertidal groundwater due to the seasonal differences in rainfall temperature and plant periodicity growth steinmuller et al 2020 sullivan et al 2021 wang et al 2019 our previous study along the tidal creek in the same area showed that the nutrient concentrations at high tides were similar among seasons but the concentrations at low tides showed seasonal variations with the largest variation of 80 which were likely affected by the groundwater discharge wang et al 2019 we assumed that there were no significant seasonal variations of nutrient concentrations in surface water we set the seasonal variations of groundwater concentrations to 25 50 and 80 to analyze the nutrient fluxes across the swi fig s9 the results showed that in mangrove no3 n always had net influxes while nh4 n din and tdn always had net efflux during both neap and spring tides which were consistent with the results observed in this study in salt marsh the pattern of nitrogen fluxes were almost the same as that in this study with an exception of tdn fig s9 g patterns of phosphorus fluxes in mangrove and salt marsh were not affected by the alteration in concentrations during neap tides fig s10 a h during spring tides the influx of phosphorus in salt marsh shifted from less to larger than in mangrove when the concentrations in mangrove and salt marsh groundwater both increased by over 25 fig s10 l n overall the seasonal variations in nutrient concentrations caused by discrepancy in plant uptake and microbial activities could not change the vertical flux patterns in mangrove salt marsh ecotone previous study showed that the ratios of the vertical hydraulic conductivity kv to the horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh of the sediments were equal to 2 3 1 2 4 in the silty sand estuarine mud clayey sand and surface layer respectively hughes et al 1998 xiao et al 2017 the mean sd 2 1 of the above ratios of kv kh was used to conservatively estimate the horizontal fluxes of nutrients based on the hydraulic gradient between monitoring sites at mangrove salt marsh and tidal creek the results showed that all the nutrients had net horizontal effluxes from mangrove and salt marsh to tidal creek as summed in table s6 the horizontal fluxes were consistently much less than vertical fluxes with an exception of phosphorus fluxes in mangrove the total fluxes the sum of horizontal and vertical fluxes of nutrients suggested the same source sink pattern as the individual scenarios that only include vertical fluxes these results revealed that the horizontal fluxes played a much less role than vertical fluxes and supported the point in this study that salt marsh can retain high nitrogen loadings discharged from mangrove 4 4 ecological and environmental implications the fluxes across the swi in the mangrove differed from the salt marsh mainly due to 1 the steeper slope of creek bank and relatively lower water table in the mangrove and 2 the habitat specific differences in structures microbial activities nutrient cycling and storage different wetlands can provide similar ecological functions but the differences in physiological characteristics and structures likely alter these processes kelleway et al 2017 salt marshes are herbaceous with seasonal growth patterns granville et al 2021 finer roots of salt marshes increase the water content and change the redox environment altering the microbial communities and increasing nitrogen retention comeaux et al 2012 liu et al 2020 in contrast the more labile mangrove litter ultimately leads to much faster mineralization and higher nutrient production simpson et al 2020 here the mangrove was a source of nh4 n being exported to the coastal water nutrients promote the productivity of coastal waters and can drive harmful algal blooms beman et al 2005 mukhopadhyay et al 2006 the average din dip mole ratios in surface water were 33 6 in the mangrove and 57 32 in the salt marsh fig s4 well exceeded the redfield ratio 16 1 but still much lower than average groundwater ratios 497 323 observed in this study the discharge of groundwater during low tides may promote n associated eutrophication the salt marsh sediments served as a sink of nitrogen and had a smaller ratio of din dip than the mangrove hence the salt marsh can retain nitrogen especially nh4 n that discharged from mangrove attenuating the nitrogen surplus in the estuarine system as shown in fig 4d the similar influx of drp dop and tdp in these two habitats suggested that the salt marsh invasion had no significant effect on phosphorus flux patterns in mangroves p 0 05 nutrient fluxes particularly nitrogen to coastal waters have risen in recent decades in china resulting in widespread hypoxia and other ecological damages howarth et al 2011 our findings thus suggest that the invasive expansion of salt marsh may partially alter the nutrient stoichiometry of coastal water and relieve estuarine n associated eutrophication the combined study of hydro biogeochemical processes in china coastal wetlands advanced our knowledge about how the mangrove salt marsh ecotone influences estuarine ecosystems this study provides insights to environmental managers assessing the influences of salt marsh encroachment into mangroves in other parts of the world such as australia and the us mangroves are moving poleward and invading salt marsh areas krauss et al 2011 osland et al 2013 saintilan et al 2014 this encroachment affects key ecosystem services and function including increased pressure on salt marsh communities a greater potential to respond to increasing sea level changing nitrogen transformations process and enhanced ability for carbon storage and sequestration bianchi et al 2013 saintilan et al 2014 sullivan et al 2021 our investigation builds on this earlier work by showing how changing vegetation communities may influence the wetlands nitrogen cycle the ongoing mangrove salt marsh ecotone seemed to reduce ammonium nitrogen exports alter nutrient ratios and the source sink pattern of nh4 n and no3 n compared to the native mangrove wetlands we suggested the ecotone will result in potential shifts of nutrient supply and ratios modifying phytoplankton growth in coastal waters 5 conclusions our combination of microbiological hydrological and biogeochemical approaches revealed that porewater exchange drives the nitrogen source sink pattern in a mangrove salt marsh transition zone the mangrove acted as the net discharge area of groundwater while the salt marsh acted as the net infiltration area of surface water mineralization and dnra were the main processes for nh4 n production with higher rates in mangrove sediments denitrification dominated no3 n removal with the contribution of 97 and 83 in mangrove and salt marsh sediments respectively the distributions of functional microbial communities were consistent with the interpretation of nitrogen transformations and fluxes the mangrove had a net export of nh4 n and don to surface waters but a net import of nox n and phosphorus due to strong mineralization denitrification and absorption of phosphorus the salt marsh had a net import of all forms of nitrogen and phosphorus due to much larger surface water inflow than the groundwater outflow the mangrove groundwater had a large din dip mole ratio up to 706 236 due to high nh4 n concentration the salt marsh may consume surplus nh4 n that derived from mangrove groundwater discharge potentially reducing the nutrient transport to coastal waters through the mangrove salt marsh ecotone the observed contrasting pattern of porewater exchange and nitrogen cycling provides broader insights into the potential ecological implication of the ongoing mangrove salt marsh ecotone the ecotone will push these native mangroves from being a source towards a sink of ammonium nitrogen to coastal water by decreasing porewater exchange and modifying the nutrient stoichiometry in this study additional observations in other mangrove salt marsh transition zones are needed to build this view credit authorship contribution statement fenfang

3629,interaction between capillary and viscous forces significantly affects the flow instability in immiscible displacement which is usually investigated by visualization of flow patterns in 2d porous micromodels or in 3d system equipped with x ray ct however in most practical applications visualization of flow in porous media is not possible and the pressure signal is often as one of the important sources of information core flooding experiments were implemented in this study to investigate the interplay of capillary and viscous effects by analysis of differential pressure water and crude oil were employed as defending fluid and different states of co2 were injected as invading fluid the inlet was set as the constant injection flow rate while the outlet as the constant pressure in viscous dominated displacement differential pressure evidently depends on the injection rate and the pressure decline curve is fitted by a power function the exponent of the function is found to be significantly larger at the crossover between capillary dominated and viscous dominated regions in capillary dominated displacement the pressure profile is characterized by a pressure jump at the beginning and intermittent fluctuations during the displacement further analysis by wavelet decomposition indicates a transition point existing in standard deviation of pressure fluctuations when the displacement is transformed from capillary dominated to viscous dominated the experimental results are finally verified by a macroscopic capillary number which characterizes the interaction between capillary and viscous forces at a critical value of n ca macro 1 agreeing well with the log nca log m phase diagram keywords co2 storage co2 enhanced oil recovery capillary force viscous force differential pressure macroscopic capillary number 1 introduction immiscible displacement in porous media is important in many applications of subsurface transports including co2 sequestration enhanced oil recovery eor and removal of nonaqueous phase liquids napls khudaida and das 2020 li and yu 2020 zhou et al 2020 the process where a nonwetting phase invades into the permeable media and displaces the wetting phase is named as drainage the instability in drainage process arises when a fluid displaces a more viscous fluid dynamics of instability is governed by the competition between viscous and capillary effects weitz et al 1987 fingering is usually encountered in unstable displacement and is one of the major reasons for the poor efficiency of recovery or remediation processes zhao et al 2016 during drainage non wetting phase invades the pore space with a series of cooperative pore filling events such as burst haines jump touch and overlap events on the microscale cieplak and robbins 1990 holtzman and segre 2015 primkulov et al 2019 the process is significantly affected by viscosity of fluids interfacial tension pore wettability flowrate of invading phase heterogeneity of pore structure etc abidoye and das 2020 goel et al 2016 lenormand et al 1988 characterized these effects into two dimensionless numbers the capillary number nca which is the ratio of viscous forces to capillary forces and the viscosity ratio m which is the ratio of invading to defending fluid viscosities different flow patterns defined as capillary fingering viscosity fingering and stable displacement were observed when the displacement processes were dominated either by capillary or viscous forces lenormand et al 1988 proposed a log nca log m phase diagram consisted of three domains corresponding to three different flow patterns and displacement mechanisms based on the value of nca and m though the boundaries of the domains in the diagram are affected by variation of pore size or pore distribution of networks the general shape of the diagram remains unchanged tsuji et al 2016 a similar phase diagram was obtained by zhang et al 2011 and the crossover regions between each of three domains were noticeably smaller than lenormand s by using a precision fabricated micromodel with smaller pore throats about 40 Œºm chen et al 2017 proposed a phase diagram for the displacement patterns in a rough fracture and the crossover region from capillary to viscous fingering is narrower than that in lenormand s and zhang s results due to the different flow geometry and smaller tortuosity in rough fractures the phase diagram has also been confirmed by two dimensional pore scale simulations either in uniform porous medium or random porous media networks amiri and hamouda 2014 leclaire et al 2017 in addition the phase diagram has been approved to be applicable to 3 d conditions by many 3 d simulations with natural sandstone leclaire et al 2017 tsuji et al 2016 yamabe et al 2015 and experiment with glass beads model hu et al 2020 patmonoaji et al 2020 tsuji et al 2016 compared the differences between two phase flow in 3d natural rock and that in 2d homogeneous models by two phase lattice boltzmann simulations the results revealed that the log nca log m diagram for 3d natural rock and for 2d homogeneous network are similar except the onset of capillary fingering in 3d natural rock at higher ca than that in 2d homogeneous models the simulation results are in accord with a recent 3 d glass beads porous media experiment hu et al 2020 which also demonstrated that rough location of three displacement patterns on the log nca log m diagrams was consistent with previous studies in 2d micromodel besides phase diagram fractal analysis by the box counting method to distinguish the displacement patterns has been employed extensively to study the transition from capillary invasion to viscous fingering by controlling the wettability of the invading fluid zhao et al 2016 observed a transition from capillary fingering d f 1 82 to viscous fingering d f 1 62 when nca increases in strong drainage in a two dimensional microfluidic flow cell which is consistent with the results from m√•l√∏y et al 1985 both phase diagram and fractal analysis require the direct visualization of displacement patterns and most of experiments are restricted in a two dimensional porous media network however visualization of flow in porous media in most practical applications is not possible and resolving the dynamics of pore scale processes by 3d imaging techniques like x ray computed tomography ct is still a demanding task which involves expensive equipment and time consuming data acquisition methods berejnov et al 2010 singh et al 2019b the pressure signal is often as one of the important sources of information primkulov et al 2019 developed a moving capacitor dynamic network model to study the relationship between displacement patterns and pressure signals and the results indicated that it is possible to infer the characteristics of the displacement purely from the pressure signals in drainage with high nca the pressure gradient is maintained mainly by viscous defending fluid and it decreases gradually when defending fluid is displaced zhao et al 2016 in slow capillary dominated displacement pressure field is virtually uniform in each fluid and it displays typical intermittent fluctuations in pressure signals knudsen and hansen 2002 zacharoudiou et al 2018 the fluctuations consisting of discrete negative pressure jumps which are identified as haines jumps have been observed both in experiments and simulations aker et al 2000 furuberg et al 1996 they are the result of bursts of fluid fluid interfaces by making a sudden and fast jump through the throat to the adjacent pores then halting at the next throat which has a higher threshold pressure singh et al 2019a this burst like invasion was found to be favourable for displacement efficiency in slow drainage while wetting films on the solid surfaces dominates the imbibition with high nca leading to incompact displacement zhao et al 2016 though numerous works have studied the interplay between capillary force and viscous force in fluid fluid displacement through phase diagram fractal analysis and pressure signals most of them are limited to simulations and two dimensional porous media network experiments in this study co2 water and co2 crude oil core flooding experiments are conducted respectively under various in situ conditions based on the log nca log m phase diagram the displacements are characterized by different mechanisms the behaviours of differential pressure are first compared in displacements dominated by different mechanisms by using wavelet decomposition analysis of pressure fluctuations the interplay between capillary and viscous effects is quantified from a pore scale perspective the experiment results are finally verified by a macroscopic capillary

60 mm and the measurement was performed at shear rates from 50 to 1000 s 1 with temperature increasing from 25 to 80 c asfig 1 shown in fig 2 a the independence of viscosity on shear rate shows the crude oil is a newtonian fluid in the temperature range george and qureshi 2013 the viscosity decreases obviously with the increase of temperature and the relationship is well fitted by the arrhenius

seen most pore throats are in the range of 1 0 to 30 0 ¬µm and median pore diameter calculated with volume and 4 v a algorithms are around 13 1 ¬µm and 5 2 ¬µm respectively the sandstone is originated from the upper jurassic fulmar sands of the north sea guillemot oil field deposited within a subsiding shallow marine basin as a sequence of shallow marine and deep water submarine fans banner et al 1992 johnson et al 1986 in thin section fig 3 the sandstone is primarily composed of fine grained sub angular well sorted quartz grains 70 and feldspar 27 most of the porosity is intergranular with notable intergranular porosity because of the dissolution of the albite microcline and orthoclase feldspars the bulk composition of the sandstone has been determined by x ray diffraction using a d8 advance bruker usa equipped with an energy dispersive detector sol x as shown in fig 4 three samples are measured to ensure representativity of the results the results for all samples can be seen in table 2 and confirm that the dominant mineralogy is quartz 70 wt with 14 4 wt albite 6 3 wt microcline and 5 7 wt orthoclase and minor less than 1 wt muscovite illite and pyrite among these minerals co2 water contact angle on quartz feldspar and calcite do not have significant change versus pressure while the water wettability of muscovite mica changed from strongly water wet to intermediate water wet with increasing pressure farokhpoor et al 2013 due to the small amount of muscovite 0 72 wt in the sample its effect on contact angle can be considered insignificant 2 3 experiment procedures drainage experiments were conducted under different reservoir conditions where co2 can be injected in different states the experiment system is shown in fig 5 the core sample was wrapped in a shrinkable rubber sleeve and placed in the horizontal core holder by neglecting the effect of gravity the confining pressure of 138 bar was built by the overburden pressure pump milton roy cm4000 and was always larger than the pore pressure which ensures the compact contact between the core sample and sleeve to prevent the flow from bypassing the core sample prior to displacement experiments the core holder was immersed in hot water bath grant instruments gd100 for 6 h to reach thermal equilibrium and then at least 30 pore volumes of defending fluid were injected by water oil pump isco syringe pump 100dm into the core sample at a high injection rate of 20 ml min to remove the gas in the system and to make the core sample fully saturated line 1 and 3 open line 2 and 4 closed after back pressure was built by injecting defending fluid into the outlet of the core sample by water oil pump co2 was injected into the core sample by co2 pump at a constant injection rate line 2 and 4 open line 1 and 3 closed during the drainage process the transient data of inlet pressure outlet pressure and effluent production was monitored the inlet and outlet pressures were measured by pressure transducers and automatically recorded every 6 s by labview the cumulative production of effluents was recorded very minute every displacement was ceased after injecting 2 pore volume of co2 and the core sample was taken out to be weighed by a sartorius scale with a resolution of 0 0001 g after experiment co2 breakthrough time was determined through replacing the water oil pump by a back pressure valve line 3 and 4 open line 1 and 2 closed 3 results and discussions the interplay between viscous and capillary force in immiscible displacement is related to viscosity of fluids interfacial tension wettability of fluids and pore surfaces flowrate of invading phase heterogeneity of pore structure etc which has been characterized into two dimensionless numbers nca and m lenormand et al 1988 1 nca Œº d v œÉ Œº d q œÉ a 2 m Œº i Œº d where œÉ is the interfacial tension v is superficial velocity q is the injection flowrate a is the cross section area of the core sample Œº i and Œº d are viscosity of invading and defending fluid respectively variation of nca was achieved by increasing the injection flowrate and variation of m was obtained by injecting different phases of co2 and by employing water and crude oil as defending fluid respectively the values of log nca are summarized in table 3 as a function of injection rate the log nca log m phase diagram composed of three displacement patterns is shown in fig 6 and the experiment conditions are included in the figure crossover areas exist between different displacement modes and the boundaries depends on the system especially on the geometry of the porous media lenormand et al 1988 yamabe et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 though the phase diagram is applicable both to 2d and 3d cases it is still independent on the pore structure and dimension assuming the core sample as a bundle of capillary channels with same radius average size of pore throats can be evaluated by kozeny equation kozeny 1927 3 d th 32 k œï 1 2 where d th is the average size of pore throat k and œï are the permeability and porosity of the core sample respectively the estimated pore throat size is about 4 ¬µm which is close to the median pore diameter calculated with 4 v a algorithms 5 2 ¬µm from pore size distribution it is also in accord with other studies which claims pore throat sizes are normally larger than 2 ¬µm in conventional reservoir rocks li et al 2017 nelson 2009 it can also see from the pore size distribution of the core sample fig 2 most pore throat are in the range of 1 to 30 ¬µm with median pore diameter around 13 ¬µm therefore boundaries from zhang s experiment micromodel zhang et al 2011 pore throats about 40 ¬µm is more suitable for interpreting the experimental results than using boundaries proposed by lenormand s numerical model with pore throats around 230 ¬µm lenormand et al 1988 or by hu s glass beads model with pore throats about 100 ¬µm hu et al 2020 based on boundaries proposed by zhang et al 2011 co2 crude oil displacements are almost situated in viscous force dominated region while co2 water displacements are located in capillary force dominated region it is needed to point out that the reynolds number re œÅ v d g Œº d œÅ is density of fluid d g is the median grain size of the porous media around 100 ¬µm in this study ranges from about 0 006 to 0 1 indicating that the immiscible displacements were carried out under laminar flow conditions 3 1 signatures of differential pressure in this section the behaviours of differential pressure are compared between viscous dominated co2 crude oil core flooding and capillary dominated co2 water core flooding the results have also been demonstrated by pore scale network experiment as shown in the supporting information 3 1 1 differential pressure in viscous dominated displacements the differential pressures for gco2 sco2 lco2 crude oil displacements are shown in fig 7 a c with injection rate ranging from 0 05 to 0 4 ml min the corresponding superficial velocity varies from 2 to 16 ¬µm s the inset figure indicates the evolutions of differential pressures before co2 breakthrough the displacements are dominated mainly by viscosity of crude oil and differential pressures are clearly dependent on the injection rates before co2 breakthrough differential pressures decrease sharply as co2 enters the core sample and pushes out crude oil resulting in reduction of the length of mobilizable cluster of crude oil l√∏voll et al 2011 primkulov et al 2019 after co2 breakthrough differential pressures vary slightly as most large crude oil cluster are drained out and the effect of viscous force becomes weak before co2 breakthrough the viscous differential pressure is almost a linear function of the distance from the outlet to the most advanced front and together with darcy s law can be estimated as l√∏voll et al 2011 4 Œ¥ p v u d q ka l x f where x f is the position of the most advanced front and l is the length of the core sample l√∏voll et al l√∏voll et al 2011 have proposed a relation for the most advanced front position x f as a function of invading fluid saturation sco2 capillary number nca and the length of the system by studying the morphology of the invading cluster in the transition from viscous to capillary fingering and the relation is simplify for the core sample as 5 x f m l s c o 2 n ca n where m and n are related to geometry of core sample and can be treated as constant numbers for a sample the production rate of crude oil can be estimated by the power law equation toth et al 2002 6 v t m t n where t is dimensionless time represented by the injected co2 pore volumes m and n are constant parameters and can be determined through cumulative crude oil production by assuming co2 saturation equals to the production of crude oil the position of most advanced front can be expressed as 7 x f m l n ca n v t d t n m 1 m l n ca n t m 1 and the viscous dominated differential pressure is 8 Œ¥ p v Œº d q l ka 1 n m 1 m n ca n t m 1 x 1 y t z where x Œº d q l k a y n m 1 m n ca n and z m 1 before co2 breakthrough the differential pressures are well fitted by eq 8 with a coefficient of determination r2 larger than 0 96 as shown in the inset of fig 7 the values of parameter z are indicated in fig 8 which is mainly related to the rates of reduction of the pressures most of parameter z varies between 0 4 and 0 9 except for two conditions where crude oil was displaced by lco2 with an injection rate smaller than 0 1 ml min marked in black dash rectangle these two conditions may fall into the crossover between capillary dominated and viscous dominated regions agreeing with the phase diagram which indicates viscous dominated displacements with larger mobility ratio can get into crossover region more easily with a decreasing injection rate besides the value of dimensionless time t is smaller than 1 before co2 breakthrough and the differential pressure is as power function of t which means a greater value of parameter z larger than 1 will cause smaller variation of the pressure this is because capillary force becomes considerable and can make up the viscous loss of the pressure when injection rate is decreased fig 9 3 1 2 differential pressure in capillary dominated displacements fig 9 a c show the differential pressures of gco2 sco2 lco2 water displacements with various co2 injection rates which indicates a typical of slow capillary dominated drainage with intermittent fluctuations primkulov et al 2019 the pressure profiles are all characterized by a jump at the beginning when co2 starts to enter the core sample because the pressure in co2 needs to be exceed the pressure caused by co2 water interfacial tension before its invasion cottin et al 2010 after co2 invades the core sample the pressure in co2 increases gradually to overcome the viscous resistance by water and invades the pores with smaller size leading to the rise of the pressure in fluctuations and the pressure fluctuations are mostly induced by pore filling events in pore throats such as haines jump primkulov et al 2019 at the end of the experiment the pressure fluctuates around the value of the jump the value of the pressure jump was observed to be close to the capillary displacement pressure p cd derived from the mercury injection curve by egermann et al egermann et al 2006 fig 10 indicates the capillary displacement pressure is the largest in gco2 water displacement and is almost independent of injection rate the displacement pressure is resulted from the meniscus formed by the interface between co2 and water and it can be described by the young laplace equation chalbaud et al 2007 9 p cd 2 œÉ c o 2 w c o s Œ∏ r throat max where œÉ c o 2 w is the interfacial tension between co2 and water Œ∏ is the contact angle around 78 7 for water r throat max is the largest connected pore throat since the interfacial tension between gco2 and water is usually larger than that between sco2 lco2 and water the displacement pressure in gco2 water displacement is greater than that in sco2 lco2 water displacement which is indicated by a more significant jump in the pressure profile combining kozeny equation eq 3 the value of the displacement pressure can be evaluated as 10 p cd œÉ c o 2 w c o s Œ∏ 2 k œï the estimated values are 0 077 0 060 and 0 057 bar for gco2 sco2 lco2 water displacement respectively and they are about 25 larger than the values of displacement pressure from experiments the reason for the overestimation of displacement pressure is that kozeny model takes the pore size as uniform for the core sample which is actually smaller than the size of largest pore throats 3 2 pore scale perspective of the interplay between capillary and viscous effects the inlet and outlet pressure are recorded every 6 s in the experiment and this temporal resolution has been proved to be sufficient to capture differences in fluid front configurations by directly imaging pore scale displacement events in porous rock in real time berg et al 2013 the fluctuations of pressure in the experiment are generally caused by the instability of pump and flow dynamics like reconfiguration of fluid fluid interface and variations in effective hydraulic conductance aker et al 1998 primkulov et al 2019 to get rid of the influence from pump pressure fluctuations of co2 under different phase states are measured as shown in fig s5 a when the syringe pump is running with constant pressure mode at equilibrium before experiment fig 11 a shows that the differential pressure profile is split into general trend and pressure fluctuations by using wavelet decomposition primkulov et al 2019 sygouni et al 2006 and the values of standard deviation of pressure fluctuations before co2 breakthrough are shown in fig 11 b it needs to be pointed out that the results in fig 11 b excludes the pressure fluctuations resulted from instability of pump in co2 water displacements with low nca the values of pressure fluctuations are almost independent of capillary number and pressure fluctuations are largely dominated by the reconfigurations of the fluid fluid menisci in pore throats when new pores are invaded m√•l√∏y et al 1992 the reason for why the differential pressures of co2 water displacements fluctuate greatly especially in lco2 core flooding is discussed in supporting information see fig s5 b in co2 crude oil displacements the values of pressure fluctuations have no relation with capillary number when log nca is smaller than 5 5 after which they increase obviously with growth of the capillary number and pressure fluctuations are controlled by variation in the effective hydraulic conductance of dominant flow channels primkulov et al 2019 the reconfiguration of fluid fluid interface is described by cieplak robbins model in capillary dominated displacement by introducing three modes of interface advance burst touch and overlap cieplak and robbins 1990 burst happens most frequently in slow drainage singh et al 2019b zhao et al 2016 taking pore scale perspective into consideration as shown in fig 12 to invade a single pore requires overcoming a capillary pressure p c at the pore throat which is expressed by the general form of young laplace equation 11 p c œÉ 1 h 1 a where a is the width of pore throat and h is the height assuming h is constant fluctuations of capillary pressure are mainly caused by variation of the width of pore throat a which yields primkulov et al 2019 12 Œ¥ p c œÉ a 2 Œ¥ a pressure fluctuations in viscous dominated displacements are affected by hydraulic diameter of the channel and the viscous pressure of invading through a pore throat is described by darcy weisbach equation primkulov et al 2019 13 p v 32 Œº u l h 2 1 h a 2 where u is the flow velocity through the pore throat and l is the distance between two pores taking variation of p v with a obtains 14 Œ¥ p v 64 Œº u l h a 2 1 h a Œ¥ a the magnitude of total pressure fluctuations is the sum of Œ¥ p v and Œ¥ p c and the ratio of Œ¥ p v to Œ¥ p c is 15 Œ¥ p v Œ¥ p c 64 Œº u l h œÉ 1 h a 64 l h 1 h a n c a when Œ¥ p v and Œ¥ p c are comparable that is Œ¥ p v Œ¥ p c 1 it yields a critical capillary number n ca 16 n ca h 64 l 1 h a the order of magnitude of pore throat size a is around 1 ¬µm for reservoir core samples li et al 2017 and assume h is comparable to a the magnitude of l is taken as the same order as the grain size which is about 100 ¬µm pini et al 2012 the n ca is estimated around 4 1 and is a bit different from the critical point log nca 5 5 in fig 11 b because the model does not take the effect of wettability and heterogeneity of the porous structure into consideration this model however explains the transition in standard deviation of pressure fluctuations when the displacement is transformed from capillary dominated into viscous dominated 3 3 displacement efficiency after each experiment the core sample was taken out from the core holder and was weighed the residual saturation s d r e s of defending phase thus can be calculated 17 s d r e s m 2 m 1 œÅ d v p where m 2 is the mass of the core sample after displacement m 1 is the mass of the dry core sample œÅ d the density of defending phase and v p is the pore volume of core sample the displacement efficiency Œ∑ equals 18 Œ∑ 1 s d r e s the relationship between displacement efficiency and log nca is displayed in fig 13 it shows similar trend for water and crude oil displacements they both exhibit a great increase in displacement efficiency with growing log nca at smaller log nca and this growth trend slows down at larger log nca in general the displacement efficiency increases with the increase of log nca though a small decline appears at the transition from co2 water displacement to co2 crude oil displacement for co2 water displacement controlled by capillary force the displacement efficiency grows notably when log nca is smaller than 6 7 because some water still remains in large pores after drainage with small capillary number and increasing viscous force could overcome the capillary force and push water out however it becomes harder to drive more water out at larger capillary number as unrecovered water mainly resides in smaller pores further increase in viscous force leads to little production of water nobakht et al 2007 for co2 crude oil displacement dominated by viscous force the rate of increase is obvious when log nca is smaller than 5 2 since invaded co2 is nonwetting and occupies the main channel to push more crude oil out with an increasing injection rate besides formation of additional viscous fingers was observed by increasing viscous force in porous media network zhang et al 2011 it is difficult to displace more crude oil with further increase of viscous force because the remaining crude oil sticks to the surface of the channel due to its affinity to the core sample zhao et al 2016 interesting to note a small reduction in displacement efficiency shows in fig 10 at the crossover from water to crude oil displacement similar behaviour also has been found in pore scale experiment wang et al 2013 and numerical simulation lenormand et al 1988 when the displacement changes from viscous fingering into capillary fingering the invading phase grows in all directions where the pressure in invade phase is larger than the capillary displacement pressure and more loops are formed as shown in case leading to an increase in displacement efficiency an et al 2020 wang et al 2013 this is in accord with the results from pore scale network by visualization of flow patterns fig s4 in supporting information 3 4 macroscopic capillary number the aforementioned nca is actually a definition of microscopic capillary number which is defined at fluid fluid interface by balancing the viscous stress to the interfacial stress leal 2007 in this definition the viscous and capillary forces are considered to be equal when nca is around between 10 7 and 10 5 and the exact value of nca is dependent on the type of tested core sample armstrong et al 2014 dullien 2012 this method therefore cannot predict the interplay between viscous and capillary forces in a universal condition the main problem of this definition is that it assumes the viscous and capillary forces act over the same scale and omits the topology of trapped wetting ganglia armstrong et al 2014 in fact the mobilization of ganglia caused by viscous shear can be extended to many pores ranging up to potentially greater than millimetres and the interfacial stress acts over the length scale of a pore throat which is typically on the order of a few micrometres armstrong et al 2014 hilfer et al proposed a macroscopic capillary number n ca macro which has been shown to correctly describe the mobilization of trapped wetting phase at n ca macro 1 hilfer and oren 1996 the microscopic and macroscopic capillary number are connected through a rigorous dimensional analysis and defined the macroscopic capillary number as hilfer and oren 1996 19 n ca macro l cl Œº d v k p b œÉ l cl k p b n ca where l cl is the cluster length consisted of connected mobilizable ganglia and p b is the breakthrough pressure from the capillary pressure curve defined as p b p c s w s b georgiadis et al 2013 hilfer and oren 1996 the dependence of cluster length on the nature of the sample fluid properties and experiment conditions can be expressed as l cl k n ca 0 5 d th based on weitz s study weitz et al 1987 k is the absolute permeability of the core sample and can be treated as constant and the dimensionless cluster length then can be represented as l cl d th n ca 0 5 fig 14 shows the data of cluster length from armstrong et al 2014 and fitted by the dimensionless cluster length equation l cl d th n ca 0 5 the maximum cluster length in the experiment is restricted by the length of the core sample fig 15 a shows the macroscopic capillary number calculated using the dimensionless cluster length while fig 15 b presents the macroscopic capillary number calculated by assuming l cl equals to the length of the core sample l the values of macroscopic capillary number for co2 water displacements are the same and smaller than 1 in these two calculations because they both have the maximum cluster length l the values of macro capillary numbers for co2 crude oil in these two estimations are a bit different assuming l cl equals to the length of the core sample obviously overestimates the macroscopic capillary number especially at larger log nca the analysis of macroscopic capillary number further demonstrates that co2 water core flooding is capillary force dominated and co2 crude oil displacement is controlled by viscous force it is also generally in accord with the phase diagram based on zhang s boundaries except few cases of co2 crude oil displacements at low injection rates they are located at the viscous fingering region but with macroscopic capillary number smaller than 1 the main reason for the difference could be the phase diagram was obtained using homogeneous micromodel but the core sample is heterogeneous which can be seen from the pore size distribution fig 2 4 conclusions a series of core flooding experiments were conducted to investigate the interplay of capillary and viscous forces in immiscible displacements water and crude oil were employed as defending fluid and different states of co2 were injected as invading fluid with various injection rates which obtains a range of capillary numbers and viscosity ratios the differential pressure in co2 crude oil displacement decreases obviously before co2 breakthrough and it is well fitted by a power function the dependency of pressure on the length of mobilizable cluster of crude oil indicates that the displacement is governed by the viscosity of crude oil the exponent of the power function z is around 0 4 to 0 9 in most viscous dominated co2 flooding but it becomes significantly larger at the crossover between capillary dominated and viscous dominated regions the differential pressure in co2 water displacement begins with an jump corresponding to the capillary displacement pressure and then fluctuates around the value of the jump the displacement pressure evaluated by a modified young laplace equation agrees well with the value of jump from the pressure profiles the displacement is dominated by the interfacial tension between co2 and water further analysis of the pressure fluctuations it is found the value of standard deviation of pressure fluctuations increases with nca in viscous dominated flow but is independent of nca in capillary dominated flow and the transition point is around log n ca 5 5 the displacement efficiency increases with an increasing injection rate both in capillary and viscous dominated displacements and the growth rate slows down at higher nca the interaction between capillary and viscous effects is verified by macroscopic capillary number with a critical value of n ca macro 1 which agrees well

3629,interaction between capillary and viscous forces significantly affects the flow instability in immiscible displacement which is usually investigated by visualization of flow patterns in 2d porous micromodels or in 3d system equipped with x ray ct however in most practical applications visualization of flow in porous media is not possible and the pressure signal is often as one of the important sources of information core flooding experiments were implemented in this study to investigate the interplay of capillary and viscous effects by analysis of differential pressure water and crude oil were employed as defending fluid and different states of co2 were injected as invading fluid the inlet was set as the constant injection flow rate while the outlet as the constant pressure in viscous dominated displacement differential pressure evidently depends on the injection rate and the pressure decline curve is fitted by a power function the exponent of the function is found to be significantly larger at the crossover between capillary dominated and viscous dominated regions in capillary dominated displacement the pressure profile is characterized by a pressure jump at the beginning and intermittent fluctuations during the displacement further analysis by wavelet decomposition indicates a transition point existing in standard deviation of pressure fluctuations when the displacement is transformed from capillary dominated to viscous dominated the experimental results are finally verified by a macroscopic capillary number which characterizes the interaction between capillary and viscous forces at a critical value of n ca macro 1 agreeing well with the log nca log m phase diagram keywords co2 storage co2 enhanced oil recovery capillary force viscous force differential pressure macroscopic capillary number 1 introduction immiscible displacement in porous media is important in many applications of subsurface transports including co2 sequestration enhanced oil recovery eor and removal of nonaqueous phase liquids napls khudaida and das 2020 li and yu 2020 zhou et al 2020 the process where a nonwetting phase invades into the permeable media and displaces the wetting phase is named as drainage the instability in drainage process arises when a fluid displaces a more viscous fluid dynamics of instability is governed by the competition between viscous and capillary effects weitz et al 1987 fingering is usually encountered in unstable displacement and is one of the major reasons for the poor efficiency of recovery or remediation processes zhao et al 2016 during drainage non wetting phase invades the pore space with a series of cooperative pore filling events such as burst haines jump touch and overlap events on the microscale cieplak and robbins 1990 holtzman and segre 2015 primkulov et al 2019 the process is significantly affected by viscosity of fluids interfacial tension pore wettability flowrate of invading phase heterogeneity of pore structure etc abidoye and das 2020 goel et al 2016 lenormand et al 1988 characterized these effects into two dimensionless numbers the capillary number nca which is the ratio of viscous forces to capillary forces and the viscosity ratio m which is the ratio of invading to defending fluid viscosities different flow patterns defined as capillary fingering viscosity fingering and stable displacement were observed when the displacement processes were dominated either by capillary or viscous forces lenormand et al 1988 proposed a log nca log m phase diagram consisted of three domains corresponding to three different flow patterns and displacement mechanisms based on the value of nca and m though the boundaries of the domains in the diagram are affected by variation of pore size or pore distribution of networks the general shape of the diagram remains unchanged tsuji et al 2016 a similar phase diagram was obtained by zhang et al 2011 and the crossover regions between each of three domains were noticeably smaller than lenormand s by using a precision fabricated micromodel with smaller pore throats about 40 Œºm chen et al 2017 proposed a phase diagram for the displacement patterns in a rough fracture and the crossover region from capillary to viscous fingering is narrower than that in lenormand s and zhang s results due to the different flow geometry and smaller tortuosity in rough fractures the phase diagram has also been confirmed by two dimensional pore scale simulations either in uniform porous medium or random porous media networks amiri and hamouda 2014 leclaire et al 2017 in addition the phase diagram has been approved to be applicable to 3 d conditions by many 3 d simulations with natural sandstone leclaire et al 2017 tsuji et al 2016 yamabe et al 2015 and experiment with glass beads model hu et al 2020 patmonoaji et al 2020 tsuji et al 2016 compared the differences between two phase flow in 3d natural rock and that in 2d homogeneous models by two phase lattice boltzmann simulations the results revealed that the log nca log m diagram for 3d natural rock and for 2d homogeneous network are similar except the onset of capillary fingering in 3d natural rock at higher ca than that in 2d homogeneous models the simulation results are in accord with a recent 3 d glass beads porous media experiment hu et al 2020 which also demonstrated that rough location of three displacement patterns on the log nca log m diagrams was consistent with previous studies in 2d micromodel besides phase diagram fractal analysis by the box counting method to distinguish the displacement patterns has been employed extensively to study the transition from capillary invasion to viscous fingering by controlling the wettability of the invading fluid zhao et al 2016 observed a transition from capillary fingering d f 1 82 to viscous fingering d f 1 62 when nca increases in strong drainage in a two dimensional microfluidic flow cell which is consistent with the results from m√•l√∏y et al 1985 both phase diagram and fractal analysis require the direct visualization of displacement patterns and most of experiments are restricted in a two dimensional porous media network however visualization of flow in porous media in most practical applications is not possible and resolving the dynamics of pore scale processes by 3d imaging techniques like x ray computed tomography ct is still a demanding task which involves expensive equipment and time consuming data acquisition methods berejnov et al 2010 singh et al 2019b the pressure signal is often as one of the important sources of information primkulov et al 2019 developed a moving capacitor dynamic network model to study the relationship between displacement patterns and pressure signals and the results indicated that it is possible to infer the characteristics of the displacement purely from the pressure signals in drainage with high nca the pressure gradient is maintained mainly by viscous defending fluid and it decreases gradually when defending fluid is displaced zhao et al 2016 in slow capillary dominated displacement pressure field is virtually uniform in each fluid and it displays typical intermittent fluctuations in pressure signals knudsen and hansen 2002 zacharoudiou et al 2018 the fluctuations consisting of discrete negative pressure jumps which are identified as haines jumps have been observed both in experiments and simulations aker et al 2000 furuberg et al 1996 they are the result of bursts of fluid fluid interfaces by making a sudden and fast jump through the throat to the adjacent pores then halting at the next throat which has a higher threshold pressure singh et al 2019a this burst like invasion was found to be favourable for displacement efficiency in slow drainage while wetting films on the solid surfaces dominates the imbibition with high nca leading to incompact displacement zhao et al 2016 though numerous works have studied the interplay between capillary force and viscous force in fluid fluid displacement through phase diagram fractal analysis and pressure signals most of them are limited to simulations and two dimensional porous media network experiments in this study co2 water and co2 crude oil core flooding experiments are conducted respectively under various in situ conditions based on the log nca log m phase diagram the displacements are characterized by different mechanisms the behaviours of differential pressure are first compared in displacements dominated by different mechanisms by using wavelet decomposition

porosity of 0 23 and a pore volume pv of 3 5 cm3 the absolute water permeability of the core sample was measured as 129 md at confining pressure of 138 bar 2000 psi the core sample is oil wet and intermediate water wet in air as shown in fig s1 the pore size distribution measurement was performed by an autopore iv 9500 mercury injection porosimeter micromeritics usa as shown in fig 2 it can be seen most pore throats are in the range of 1 0 to 30 0 ¬µm and median pore diameter calculated with volume and 4 v a algorithms are around 13 1 ¬µm and 5 2 ¬µm respectively the sandstone is originated from the upper jurassic fulmar sands of the north sea guillemot oil field deposited within a subsiding shallow marine basin as a sequence of shallow marine and deep water submarine fans banner et al 1992 johnson et al 1986 in thin section fig 3 the sandstone is primarily composed of fine grained sub angular well sorted quartz grains 70 and feldspar 27 most of the porosity is intergranular with notable intergranular porosity because of the dissolution of the albite microcline and orthoclase feldspars the bulk composition of the sandstone has been determined by x ray diffraction using a d8 advance bruker usa equipped with an energy dispersive detector sol x as shown in fig 4 three samples are measured to ensure representativity of the results the results for all samples can be seen in table 2 and confirm that the dominant mineralogy is quartz 70 wt with 14 4 wt albite 6 3 wt microcline and 5 7 wt orthoclase and minor less than 1 wt muscovite illite and pyrite among these minerals co2 water contact angle on quartz feldspar and calcite do not have significant change versus pressure while the water wettability of muscovite mica changed from strongly water wet to intermediate water wet with increasing pressure farokhpoor et al 2013 due to the small amount of muscovite 0 72 wt in the sample its effect on contact angle can be considered insignificant 2 3 experiment procedures drainage experiments were conducted under different reservoir conditions where co2 can be injected in different states the experiment system is shown in fig 5 the core sample was wrapped in a shrinkable rubber sleeve and placed in the horizontal core holder by neglecting the effect of gravity the confining pressure of 138 bar was built by the overburden pressure pump milton roy cm4000 and was always larger than the pore pressure which ensures the compact contact between the core sample and sleeve to prevent the flow from bypassing the core sample prior to displacement experiments the core holder was immersed in hot water bath grant instruments gd100 for 6 h to reach thermal equilibrium and then at least 30 pore volumes of defending fluid were injected by water oil pump isco syringe pump 100dm into the core sample at a high injection rate of 20 ml min to remove the gas in the system and to make the core sample fully saturated line 1 and 3 open line 2 and 4 closed after back pressure was built by injecting defending fluid into the outlet of the core sample by water oil pump co2 was injected into the core sample by co2 pump at a constant injection rate line 2 and 4 open line 1 and 3 closed during the drainage process the transient data of inlet pressure outlet pressure and effluent production was monitored the inlet and outlet pressures were measured by pressure transducers and automatically recorded every 6 s by labview the cumulative production of effluents was recorded very minute every displacement was ceased after injecting 2 pore volume of co2 and the core sample was taken out to be weighed by a sartorius scale with a resolution of 0 0001 g after experiment co2 breakthrough time was determined through replacing the water oil pump by a back pressure valve line 3 and 4 open line 1 and 2 closed 3 results and discussions the interplay between viscous and capillary force in immiscible displacement is related to viscosity of fluids interfacial tension wettability of fluids and pore surfaces flowrate of invading phase heterogeneity of pore structure etc which has been characterized into two dimensionless numbers nca and m lenormand et al 1988 1 nca Œº d v œÉ Œº d q œÉ a 2 m Œº i Œº d where œÉ is the interfacial tension v is superficial velocity q is the injection flowrate a is the cross section area of the core sample Œº i and Œº d are viscosity of invading and defending fluid respectively variation of nca was achieved by increasing the injection flowrate and variation of m was obtained by injecting different phases of co2 and by employing water and crude oil as defending fluid respectively the values of log nca are summarized in table 3 as a function of injection rate the log nca log m phase diagram composed of three displacement patterns is shown in fig 6 and the experiment conditions are included in the figure crossover areas exist between different displacement modes and the boundaries depends on the system especially on the geometry of the porous media lenormand et al 1988 yamabe et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 though the phase diagram is applicable both to 2d and 3d cases it is still independent on the pore structure and dimension assuming the core sample as a bundle of capillary channels with same radius average size of pore throats can be evaluated by kozeny equation kozeny 1927 3 d th 32 k œï 1 2 where d th is the average size of pore throat k and œï are the permeability and porosity of the core sample respectively the estimated pore throat size is about 4 ¬µm which is close to the median pore diameter calculated with 4 v a algorithms 5 2 ¬µm from pore size distribution it is also in accord with other studies which claims pore throat sizes are normally larger than 2 ¬µm in conventional reservoir rocks li et al 2017 nelson 2009 it can also see from the pore size distribution of the core sample fig 2 most pore throat are in the range of 1 to 30 ¬µm with median pore diameter around 13 ¬µm therefore boundaries from zhang s experiment micromodel zhang et al 2011 pore throats about 40 ¬µm is more suitable for interpreting the experimental results than using boundaries proposed by lenormand s numerical model with pore throats around 230 ¬µm lenormand et al 1988 or by hu s glass beads model with pore throats about 100 ¬µm hu et al 2020 based on boundaries proposed by zhang et al 2011 co2 crude oil displacements are almost situated in viscous force dominated region while co2 water displacements are located in capillary force dominated region it is needed to point out that the reynolds number re œÅ v d g Œº d œÅ is density of fluid d g is the median grain size of the porous media around 100 ¬µm in this study ranges from about 0 006 to 0 1 indicating that the immiscible displacements were carried out under laminar flow conditions 3 1 signatures of differential pressure in this section the behaviours of differential pressure are compared between viscous dominated co2 crude oil core flooding and capillary dominated co2 water core flooding the results have also been demonstrated by pore scale network experiment as shown in the supporting information 3 1 1 differential pressure in viscous dominated displacements the differential pressures for gco2 sco2 lco2 crude oil displacements are shown in fig 7 a c with injection rate ranging from 0 05 to 0 4 ml min the corresponding superficial velocity varies from 2 to 16 ¬µm s the inset figure indicates the evolutions of differential pressures before co2 breakthrough the displacements are dominated mainly by viscosity of crude oil and differential pressures are clearly dependent on the injection rates before co2 breakthrough differential pressures decrease sharply as co2 enters the core sample and pushes out crude oil resulting in reduction of the length of mobilizable cluster of crude oil l√∏voll et al 2011 primkulov et al 2019 after co2 breakthrough differential pressures vary slightly as most large crude oil cluster are drained out and the effect of viscous force becomes weak before co2 breakthrough the viscous differential pressure is almost a linear function of the distance from the outlet to the most advanced front and together with darcy s law can be estimated as l√∏voll et al 2011 4 Œ¥ p v u d q ka l x f where x f is the position of the most advanced front and l is the length of the core sample l√∏voll et al l√∏voll et al 2011 have proposed a relation for the most advanced front position x f as a function of invading fluid saturation sco2 capillary number nca and the length of the system by studying the morphology of the invading cluster in the transition from viscous to capillary fingering and the relation is simplify for the core sample as 5 x f m l s c o 2 n ca n where m and n are related to geometry of core sample and can be treated as constant numbers for a sample the production rate of crude oil can be estimated by the power law equation toth et al 2002 6 v t m t n where t is dimensionless time represented by the injected co2 pore volumes m and n are constant parameters and can be determined through cumulative crude oil production by assuming co2 saturation equals to the production of crude oil the position of most advanced front can be expressed as 7 x f m l n ca n v t d t n m 1 m l n ca n t m 1 and the viscous dominated differential pressure is 8 Œ¥ p v Œº d q l ka 1 n m 1 m n ca n t m 1 x 1 y t z where x Œº d q l k a y n m 1 m n ca n and z m 1 before co2 breakthrough the differential pressures are well fitted by eq 8 with a coefficient of determination r2 larger than 0 96 as shown in the inset of fig 7 the values of parameter z are indicated in fig 8 which is mainly related to the rates of reduction of the pressures most of parameter z varies between 0 4 and 0 9 except for two conditions where crude oil was displaced by lco2 with an injection rate smaller than 0 1 ml min marked in black dash rectangle these two conditions may fall into the crossover between capillary dominated and viscous dominated regions agreeing with the phase diagram which indicates viscous dominated displacements with larger mobility ratio can get into crossover region more easily with a decreasing injection rate besides the value of dimensionless time t is smaller than 1 before co2 breakthrough and the differential pressure is as power function of t which means a greater value of parameter z larger than 1 will cause smaller variation of the pressure this is because capillary force becomes considerable and can make up the viscous loss of the pressure when injection rate is decreased fig 9 3 1 2 differential pressure in capillary dominated displacements fig 9 a c show the differential pressures of gco2 sco2 lco2 water displacements with various co2 injection rates which indicates a typical of slow capillary dominated drainage with intermittent fluctuations primkulov et al 2019 the pressure profiles are all characterized by a jump at the beginning when co2 starts to enter the core sample because the pressure in co2 needs to be exceed the pressure caused by co2 water interfacial tension before its invasion cottin et al 2010 after co2 invades the core sample the pressure in co2 increases gradually to overcome the viscous resistance by water and invades the pores with smaller size leading to the rise of the pressure in fluctuations and the pressure fluctuations are mostly induced by pore filling events in pore throats such as haines jump primkulov et al 2019 at the end of the experiment the pressure fluctuates around the value of the jump the value of the pressure jump was observed to be close to the capillary displacement pressure p cd derived from the mercury injection curve by egermann et al egermann et al 2006 fig 10 indicates the capillary displacement pressure is the largest in gco2 water displacement and is almost independent of injection rate the displacement pressure is resulted from the meniscus formed by the interface between co2 and water and it can be described by the young laplace equation chalbaud et al 2007 9 p cd 2 œÉ c o 2 w c o s Œ∏ r throat max where œÉ c o 2 w is the interfacial tension between co2 and water Œ∏ is the contact angle around 78 7 for water r throat max is the largest connected pore throat since the interfacial tension between gco2 and water is usually larger than that between sco2 lco2 and water the displacement pressure in gco2 water displacement is greater than that in sco2 lco2 water displacement which is indicated by a more significant jump in the pressure profile combining kozeny equation eq 3 the value of the displacement pressure can be evaluated as 10 p cd œÉ c o 2 w c o s Œ∏ 2 k œï the estimated values are 0 077 0 060 and 0 057 bar for gco2 sco2 lco2 water displacement respectively and they are about 25 larger than the values of displacement pressure from experiments the reason for the overestimation of displacement pressure is that kozeny model takes the pore size as uniform for the core sample which is actually smaller than the size of largest pore throats 3 2 pore scale perspective of the interplay between capillary and viscous effects the inlet and outlet pressure are recorded every 6 s in the experiment and this temporal resolution has been proved to be sufficient to capture differences in fluid front configurations by directly imaging pore scale displacement events in porous rock in real time berg et al 2013 the fluctuations of pressure in the experiment are generally caused by the instability of pump and flow dynamics like reconfiguration of fluid fluid interface and variations in effective hydraulic conductance aker et al 1998 primkulov et al 2019 to get rid of the influence from pump pressure fluctuations of co2 under different phase states are measured as shown in fig s5 a when the syringe pump is running with constant pressure mode at equilibrium before experiment fig 11 a shows that the differential pressure profile is split into general trend and pressure fluctuations by using wavelet decomposition primkulov et al 2019 sygouni et al 2006 and the values of standard deviation of pressure fluctuations before co2 breakthrough are shown in fig 11 b it needs to be pointed out that the results in fig 11 b excludes the pressure fluctuations resulted from instability of pump in co2 water displacements with low nca the values of pressure fluctuations are almost independent of capillary number and pressure fluctuations are largely dominated by the reconfigurations of the fluid fluid menisci in pore throats when new pores are invaded m√•l√∏y et al 1992 the reason for why the differential pressures of co2 water displacements fluctuate greatly especially in lco2 core flooding is discussed in supporting information see fig s5 b in co2 crude oil displacements the values of pressure fluctuations have no relation with capillary number when log nca is smaller than 5 5 after which they increase obviously with growth of the capillary number and pressure fluctuations are controlled by variation in the effective hydraulic conductance of dominant flow channels primkulov et al 2019 the reconfiguration of fluid fluid interface is described by cieplak robbins model in capillary dominated displacement by introducing three modes of interface advance burst touch and overlap cieplak and robbins 1990 burst happens most frequently in slow drainage singh et al 2019b zhao et al 2016 taking pore scale perspective into consideration as shown in fig 12 to invade a single pore requires overcoming a capillary pressure p c at the pore throat which is expressed by the general form of young laplace equation 11 p c œÉ 1 h 1 a where a is the width of pore throat and h is the height assuming h is constant fluctuations of capillary pressure are mainly caused by variation of the width of pore throat a which yields primkulov et al 2019 12 Œ¥ p c œÉ a 2 Œ¥ a pressure fluctuations in viscous dominated displacements are affected by hydraulic diameter of the channel and the viscous pressure of invading through a pore throat is described by darcy weisbach equation primkulov et al 2019 13 p v 32 Œº u l h 2 1 h a 2 where u is the flow velocity through the pore throat and l is the distance between two pores taking variation of p v with a obtains 14 Œ¥ p v 64 Œº u l h a 2 1 h a Œ¥ a the magnitude of total pressure fluctuations is the sum of Œ¥ p v and Œ¥ p c and the ratio of Œ¥ p v to Œ¥ p c is 15 Œ¥ p v Œ¥ p c 64 Œº u l h œÉ 1 h a 64 l h 1 h a n c a when Œ¥ p v and Œ¥ p c are comparable that is Œ¥ p v Œ¥ p c 1 it yields a critical capillary number n ca 16 n ca h 64 l 1 h a the order of magnitude of pore throat size a is around 1 ¬µm for reservoir core samples li et al 2017 and assume h is comparable to a the magnitude of l is taken as the same order as the grain size which is about 100 ¬µm pini et al 2012 the n ca is estimated around 4 1 and is a bit different from the critical point log nca 5 5 in fig 11 b because the model does not take the effect of wettability and heterogeneity of the porous structure into consideration this model however explains the transition in standard deviation of pressure fluctuations when the displacement is transformed from capillary dominated into viscous dominated 3 3 displacement efficiency after each experiment the core sample was taken out from the core holder and was weighed the residual saturation s d r e s of defending phase thus can be calculated 17 s d r e s m 2 m 1 œÅ d v p where m 2 is the mass of the core sample after displacement m 1 is the mass of the dry core sample œÅ d the density of defending phase and v p is the pore volume of core sample the displacement efficiency Œ∑ equals 18 Œ∑ 1 s d r e s the relationship between displacement efficiency and log nca is displayed in fig 13 it shows similar trend for water and crude oil displacements they both exhibit a great increase in displacement efficiency with growing log nca at smaller log nca and this growth trend slows down at larger log nca in general the displacement efficiency increases with the increase of log nca though a small decline appears at the transition from co2 water displacement to co2 crude oil displacement for co2 water displacement controlled by capillary force the displacement efficiency grows notably when log nca is smaller than 6 7 because some water still remains in large pores after drainage with small capillary number and increasing viscous force could overcome the capillary force and push water out however it becomes harder to drive more water out at larger capillary number as unrecovered water mainly resides in smaller pores further increase in viscous force leads to little production of water nobakht et al 2007 for co2 crude oil displacement dominated by viscous force the rate of increase is obvious when log nca is smaller than 5 2 since invaded co2 is nonwetting and occupies the main channel to push more crude oil out with an increasing injection rate besides formation of additional viscous fingers was observed by increasing viscous force in porous media network zhang et al 2011 it is difficult to displace more crude oil with further increase of viscous force because the remaining crude oil sticks to the surface of the channel due to its affinity to the core sample zhao et al 2016 interesting to note a small reduction in displacement efficiency shows in fig 10 at the crossover from water to crude oil displacement similar behaviour also has been found in pore scale experiment wang et al 2013 and numerical simulation lenormand et al 1988 when the displacement changes from viscous fingering into capillary fingering the invading phase grows in all directions where the pressure in invade phase is larger than the capillary displacement pressure and more loops are formed as shown in case leading to an increase in displacement efficiency an et al 2020 wang et al 2013 this is in accord with the results from pore scale network by visualization of flow patterns fig s4 in supporting information 3 4 macroscopic capillary number the aforementioned nca is actually a definition of microscopic capillary number which is defined at fluid fluid interface by balancing the viscous stress to the interfacial stress leal 2007 in this definition the viscous and capillary forces are considered to be equal when nca is around between 10 7 and 10 5 and the exact value of nca is dependent on the type of tested core sample armstrong et al 2014 dullien 2012 this method therefore cannot predict the interplay between viscous and capillary forces in a universal condition the main problem of this definition is that it assumes the viscous and capillary forces act over the same scale and omits the topology of trapped wetting ganglia armstrong et al 2014 in fact the mobilization of ganglia caused by viscous shear can be extended to many pores ranging up to potentially greater than millimetres and the interfacial stress acts over the length scale of a pore throat which is typically on the order of a few micrometres armstrong et al 2014 hilfer et al proposed a macroscopic capillary number n ca macro which has been shown to correctly describe the mobilization of trapped wetting phase at n ca macro 1 hilfer and oren 1996 the microscopic and macroscopic capillary number are connected through a rigorous dimensional analysis and defined the macroscopic capillary number as hilfer and oren 1996 19 n ca macro l cl Œº d v k p b œÉ l cl k p b n ca where l cl is the cluster length consisted of connected mobilizable ganglia and p b is the breakthrough pressure from the capillary pressure curve defined as p b p c s w s b georgiadis et al 2013 hilfer and oren 1996 the dependence of cluster length on the nature of the sample fluid properties and experiment conditions can be expressed as l cl k n ca 0 5 d th based on weitz s study weitz et al 1987 k is the absolute permeability of the core sample and can be treated as constant and the dimensionless cluster length then can be represented as l cl d th n ca 0 5 fig 14 shows the data of cluster length from armstrong et al 2014 and fitted by the dimensionless cluster length equation l cl d th n ca 0 5 the maximum cluster length in the experiment is restricted by the length of the core sample fig 15 a shows the macroscopic capillary number calculated using the dimensionless cluster length while fig 15 b presents the macroscopic capillary number calculated by assuming l cl equals to the length of the core sample l the values of macroscopic capillary number for co2 water displacements are the same and smaller than 1 in these two calculations because they both have the maximum cluster length l the values of macro capillary numbers for co2 crude oil in these two estimations are a bit different assuming l cl equals to the length of the core sample obviously overestimates the macroscopic capillary number especially at larger log nca the analysis of macroscopic capillary number further demonstrates that co2 water core flooding is capillary force dominated and co2 crude oil displacement is controlled by viscous force it is also generally in accord with the phase diagram based on zhang s boundaries except few cases of co2 crude oil displacements at low injection rates they are located at the viscous fingering region but with macroscopic capillary number smaller than 1 the main reason for the difference could be the phase diagram was obtained using homogeneous micromodel but the core sample is heterogeneous which can be seen from the pore size distribution fig 2 4 conclusions a series of core flooding experiments were conducted to investigate the interplay of capillary and viscous forces in immiscible displacements water and crude oil were employed as defending fluid and different states of co2 were injected as invading fluid with various injection rates which obtains a range of capillary numbers and viscosity ratios the differential pressure in co2 crude oil displacement decreases obviously before co2 breakthrough and it is well fitted by a power function the dependency of pressure on the length of mobilizable cluster of crude oil indicates that the displacement is governed by the viscosity of crude oil the exponent of the power function z is around 0 4 to 0 9 in most viscous dominated co2 flooding but it becomes significantly larger at the crossover between capillary dominated and viscous dominated regions the differential pressure in co2 water displacement begins with an jump corresponding to the capillary displacement pressure and then fluctuates around the value of the jump the displacement pressure evaluated by a modified young laplace equation agrees well with the value of jump from the pressure profiles the displacement is dominated by the interfacial tension between co2 and water further analysis of the pressure fluctuations it is found the value of standard deviation of pressure fluctuations increases with nca in viscous dominated flow but is independent of nca in capillary dominated flow and the transition point is around log n ca 5 5 the displacement efficiency increases with an increasing injection rate both in capillary and viscous dominated displacements and the growth rate slows down at higher nca the interaction between capillary and viscous effects is verified by macroscopic capillary number with a critical value of n ca macro 1 which agrees well
