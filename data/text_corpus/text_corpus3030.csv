15150,the utilization of slowly biodegradable organic matter sbom to provide nitrite efficiently for anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox process is an essential topic high nitrite concentration without inhibition of exogenous organic matter is optimal condition for anammox process in this study hydrolytic fermentation hf of sbom was applied to drive an endogenous partial denitrification epd process nitrate to nitrite during an anaerobic anoxic operation in a starch fed system with a limited production of exogenous organic matter 22 3 4 9 mg cod l 79 0 of sbom was transformed into poly hydroxyalkanoates pha through a pathway of simultaneous hf absorption and endogenous polymer synthesis corresponding to a hydrolytic fermentation ratio of 86 0 a high nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio of 85 4 was achieved under an influent carbon to nitrogen ratio of 4 8 denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms dgaos was enriched from 0 6 to 10 9 with an increase from 0 7 to 1 0 of nitrate reductase genes to nitrite reductase genes ratio subsequently nitrate reduction rate was 5 6 fold higher than the nitrate reduction rate a prominent migration of exogenous complete denitrification to epd was accomplished furthermore the starch fed system exhibited performance with significant adaptability and stability in the presence of different sboms dissolved protein and primary sludge therefore the hf epd system achieved efficient nitrite production through epd with the addition of various sboms providing a potential alternative to anammox systems for the treatment of sbom rich wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords endogenous partial denitrification epd hydrolytic fermentation hf slowly biodegradable organic matter sbom dgao data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox is an autotrophic nitrogen removal process that produces nitrogen n2 from nitrite no2 and ammonium nh4 under anaerobic conditions converting wastewater treatment process from being energy consuming to energy neutral or energy producing kartal et al 2010 however the requirement for a stable supply of no2 is the main limitation to the development and widespread application of this technology wang et al 2021 partial nitration pn and partial denitrification pd are both cost effective technologies that provide nitrite as substrate for anammox process du et al 2019 zekker et al 2014 however when pn was combined with anammox accurate control of do and hrt is required zekker et al 2011 to date the utilization of pn anammox is still difficult in main stream of wastewater with low ammonia concentration pd has been shown to provide a stable approach for the simultaneous treatment of municipal sewage and no3 containing wastewater under anammox treatment conditions du et al 2016 however pd is generally achieved with the preference of readily biodegradable organic matter rbom such as sodium acetate and glucose cao et al 2019 ge et al 2012 in actual domestic sewage slowly biodegradable organic matter sbom accounts for a major proportion 78 of organic matter roeleveld and van loosdrecht 2002 zhang et al 2016 and sbom was found to provide a negligible contribution to nitrite production in pd shi et al 2019 therefore the low availability of rbom and the inefficient utilization of sbom significantly increase the cost of pd engineering applications furthermore pd process driven by exogenous rbom requires to cease timely at the point of maximum nitrite production to avoid further no2 reduction which may cause residual organic matter to remain ji et al 2017 when the pd process was coupled with anammox high exogenous rbom concentrations could inhibited anammox activity ni et al 2012 zhang et al 2020a therefore the dependence on specific carbon sources especially rbom and the inhibition on anammox caused by exogenous organic matter have impeded the development of pd applications in wwtp system hydrolytic fermentation hf is widely used as pretreatment process for decomposing sbom liu et al 2021b the decomposition products were mainly volatile fatty acids vfas and saccharides which can directly utilized as the electron donors shi et al 2020a b therefore the hf process enhances the utilization efficiency of sbom in wastewater previous research reported that endogenous partial denitrification epd based on glycogen accumulating organisms gaos maintained a sufficient no2 supply for anammox ji et al 2020 in epd process the influent rbom was utilized by gaos to generate poly hydroxyalkanoates pha under anaerobic condition and pha subsequently was utilized under anoxic condition for the reduction of no2 to no3 at low exogenous organic matter concentrations dan et al 2021 ji et al 2018 based on the previous study a new perspective in establishing a combined hf and epd process hf epd could be provided this approach could possibly transform the hf products of sbom into endogenous polymers rather than exogenous rbom efficiently facilitating the utilization of influent carbon sources for no2 production furthermore hf epd system provides a pathway of no2 supplementation for further combining with anammox circumventing the inhibition of abundant exogenous organic matter however the development of the hf epd system and its potential mechanism of carbon nitrogen metabolisms have not been systematically or comprehensively studied the aim of this study was to 1 assess the feasibility of the hf epd system 2 investigate the transformation of sbom and no3 3 investigate the succession of the functional bacteria via high throughput sequencing analysis and 4 assess the adaptability of systems to different sboms 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculation sludge and inflow characteristics the inoculation sludge of hf epd system was the primary sludge from primary sedimentation tank at wastewater treatment plant wwtp of gaobeidian beijing china the concentration of mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss was maintained at 2500 200 mg l when the effective volume was 10 l starch was used as a typical substrate to investigate the decomposition process of sbom goel et al 1998 mino et al 1995 therefore the starch reagent sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china analytical reagent was used to simulated sbom during the long term operation of hf epd system furthermore based on solubility sbom was divided into granular and soluble portions hu et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 measured by laser particle analyzer s3500 microtrac usa 98 33 of starch particle size was distributed from 10 μm to 100 μm with the average value of 40 03 15 46 μm the results mean that starch belongs to granular sbom to investigate the performance of hf epd system under other types of sboms bovine serum albumin bsa sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china biological reagent and primary sludge from gaobeidian wwtp was selected as soluble sbom and complex sbom the characteristics of sbom solution was shown in table 1 the no3 wastewater was perpetrated by sodium nitrate nano3 with nutrient solution cao et al 2013

decanting period and an 80 min idling period 2 3 batch tests 2 3 1 determination of denitrification activity the denitrification activity of the hf epd system was characterized in terms of the reduction rates of no3 n and no2 n which were measured in 500 ml serum bottles equipped with the magnetic stirrers ret basic c ika germany for each batch system sludge mixture 206 ml was collected from the hf epd sbr after the 480 min anaerobic period then sludge mixture was diluted to 500 ml with deionized water following with the addition of the nutrient solution table s1 in order to establish an anoxic environment do was decreased below 0 02 mg l by flushing with n2 the nitrate or nitrite solution was then injected into the serum bottles to provide the substrate for

was repeated for three times subsequently the sediment was transferred into a 1 l serum bottle containing nutrient addition table s1 in the batch system directly utilizing sboms as electron donors for denitrification the sediment was diluted to 1 l and flushed with n2 subsequently different sboms starch bsa or primary sludge were injected separately into the serum bottles for supplying 120 mg l

nitrate reductase gene including narg gene and napa gene nitrite reductase gene including nirs gene and nirk gene were quantified by quantitative real time pcr qpcr with the approach of fluorescent dye sybr green the corresponding process was listed in table s2 2 6 calculations the feeding carbon to nitrogen ratio c nfeed was calculated by eq 1 where sbomfeed was the initial theoretical concentration at anaerobic stage 4 12 l nox ninflow was concentration of influent no3 n with the inflow volume of 5 88 l 1 c n f e e d 4 12 s b o m f e e d 5 88 n o 3 n i n f l o w the ratio of

was divided into five phases based on the c nfeed and the transformation performance of hf epd system fig 2 in phase i day 1 49 an increase in scodyield was observed under anaerobic condition with improvement of hf capability reaching a peak value of 54 39 on day 24 fig 2a then scodyield reduced to 11 06 on day 37 and stabilized below 13 11 until the final stage of operation fig 2a the initial and final scod during the anoxic stage exhibited a trend of initially increasing and then decreasing from day 24 onwards fig 2b the average c nfeed in phase i was 18 89 with a theoretical sbom concentration of 285 2 mg cod l such a high c n predisposed the anaerobic anoxic system to the dominance of endogenous metabolism chu et al 2021 therefore with the enhancement of hf capacity after day 24 the scod in liquid phase was preferentially transformed into endogenous polymers which might be responsible for the decrease in scodyield fig 2a and the accumulation of pha fig s1 the hydrolysate of sbom facilitated denitrification under anoxic conditions leading to a high average nrr of 91 97 fig 2c however the enhancement of acidogenic performance led to the inevitable accumulation of carbon sources under low no3 n conditions resulting in a decrease in ntr to below 5 41 fig 2c the c nfeed was decreased to 9 36 in phase ii day 50 79 the hf products were no longer present as exogenous polymers less than 16 45 mg l scod contributed to denitrification fig 2a however with the accumulation of excess carbon source mainly endogenous polymers over previous operational cycles the actual c n in system exceeded the theoretical c nfeed value the increase in c n caused by the redundant accumulation of endogenous polymers possibly inhibited the epd process ji et al 2017 subsequently the ntr was stable at 23 43 without further significant growth in phase iii day 80 104 fig 2c the posterior aerobic stage was used to remove endogenous polymers that did not reacted in the anoxic stage chu et al 2021 hence an aerobic stage was added after the first drain period to accelerate the consumption of residual endogenous organic matter within the system fig 1d the modified operational sequence was implemented on day 105 with continuous monitoring of pha concentration fig s1 the initial pha decreased from 461 3 mg l to 323 0 mg l and then remained stable for 10 operation cycles indicating that a balance between pha production and consumption was achieved fig s1 the modified operational procedure ran for an 8 days period day 105 113 then the system was restored to the original operational sequence without the aerobic stage with the consumption of residual pha a dynamic balance was achieved between hf endogenous polymers storage and epd with ntr exhibiting a rapidly increase from 22 21 to 48 74 fig 2c the improvement of epd continued throughout phase iv day 105 191 resulting in the ntr increasing to 77 62 with a corresponding nrr of 85 62 fig 2c phase v day 192 240 was stable period exhibiting an average nrr of 88 41 with a desirable ntr of 85 04 fig 2c these results demonstrate the feasibility and effective performance of the hf epd system generating effluent containing 18 83 mg l no2 n and 30 62 mg l scod which is suitable for no2 n supply in anammox process therefore hf epd could be a potentially feasible way for anammox application in the treatment of sbom rich wastewater 3 2 transformation pathways of organic carbon and nitrogen 3 2 1 mechanism of carbon conversion under anaerobic condition during the 240 day operational period a change was observed in the form of existence of the sbom hydrolysate converting from exogenous carbon scod in liquid phase to endogenous polymers pha on day 24 phase i the degradation of starch contributed to an increase in scod from 115 7 mg l to 265 8 mg l without endogenous carbon storage fig 3 a the pha and glycogen concentrations stabilized without significant change fig 3a in contrast the scod in the liquid phase varied negligibly with the scod production of 19 20 mg l on day 235 fig 3b the pha concentration increased from 316 5 mg l to 559 6 mg l while glycogen decreased from 2209 4 mg l to 2011 6 mg l throughout the anaerobic stage fig 3b the majority of hf products were transformed into pha indicating that the hf process occurred synchronously with the transformation of exogenous carbon to endogenous polymers variations in eps were applied to characterize the extracellular carbon adsorption li et al 2020 the significant increase of total eps was detected at 0 min of anaerobic stage and followed by an insignificant variation during the anaerobic reaction fig 3c and d the eps variation caused by bacterial secretions was negligible in idle stage the increase in eps possibly attributed to the adsorption of polysaccharides produced from the decomposition of sbom furthermore changes in scod were detected in all eps layers fig s2 suggesting that hydrolysis may occur not only in the liquid phase but also in the adsorption layers in contrast to the low level of fluctuation observed on day 24 fig 3c the total eps on day 235 concentration increased significantly until a peak was reached on day 235 after which a downward trend was observed fig 3d it was consistent with the variation trend in eps content in the lb layer while no significant variation in eps was observed in the s layer or tb layer fig 3d within the lb layer the protein was maintained at 3 78 mg g vss while the polysaccharides initially increased from 8 60 mg g vss to 10 86 mg g vss in the first 120 min then gradually decreased to 4 64 mg g vss by the end of the anaerobic stage fig 3d this might due to the dissolved starch and polysaccharides components being adsorbed first adsorbed to the extracellular adsorption layer leading to a peak eps value at 120 min subsequently polysaccharides degraded into rbom and were then transformed into endogenous polymers such as pha this simultaneous adsorption and degradation of sbom were conductive to the transformation of exogenous organic matter to endogenous polymers resulting in a high level of pha production in phase v various performance characteristics were analyzed in typical cycles of each phase to determine the organic carbon transformation pathways including scodyield etr adr and hfr fig 3e in phases i and ii day 24 34 and 51 the scodyield decreased from 54 38 to 9 49 while the adr and etr increased simultaneously leading to an elevated hfr from 67 21 to 72 40 fig 3e this illustrated that the reduction in scod production and the increase in organic carbon adsorption were manifestations of endogenous storage in phase iii the pha concentration became stable at a significant level possibly be saturated which potentially blocked their synthesis and resulting in a decrease in hfr on day 102 after the hf production and carbon consumption achieved a balanced in phase iv the stable performance of the hf epd system was shown throughout phase v the hfr increased further from 78 99 on day 160 to 86 02 on day 235 fig 3e the etr increased from 69 42 to 78 95 with the eliminations of adr and scodyield fig 3e during the long term operational period the observed increase in etr was accompanied by a decrease in adr this possibly attributed to that with the enhancement of endogenous polymers generation capacity the hf products adsorbed in eps layers were transformed into pha leading to a reduction in adsorbed organic matter at the end of the anaerobic stage overall extracellular adsorption provided a site for the occurrence of hf as an intermediate process in conversion of exogenous organic matter to endogenous polymers it also prevented hf hydrolysate from entering the liquid phase which promoted the generation of pha furthermore the dynamic equilibrium formed between hf adsorption and the conversion of endogenous polymers resulted in simultaneous hydrolysate production and endogenous polymers storage during sbom degradation in the hf epd system therefore substantial pha concentration were generated with limited scod concentration detected in the liquid phase 3 2 2 nitrogen carbon transformation pathways under anoxic condition during the long term operational period the driving force for denitrification was found to shift from exogenous carbon source to endogenous polymers during the long term operation from day 20 to day 27 in phase i the concentration of scod in the liquid phase surged due to the degradation of sbom by hf leading to the dominance of denitrification driven by exogenous carbon sources subsequently the scod was decreased from 83 12 mg l to 58 08 mg l within 10 min of anoxic condition fig 4 a correspondingly the no3 n concentration rapidly reduced from 7 02 mg l to 2 29 mg l with the accumulation of 1 82 mg l no2 n fig 4a in addition no3 n and no2 n concentration were gradually reduced to below 0 1 mg l after 20 min due to the excessive c n ratio fig 4a due to the depletion of electron acceptors nox n and oxygen pha and glycogen were nearly unconsumed during anoxic stage fig 4b in contrast the liquid phase scod concentration was maintained at 29 56 mg l in phase v indicating that the exogenous carbon source no longer primarily drove denitrification fig 4c instead pha became the main driving force for denitrification decreasing from 107 75 mg l to 49 26 mg l and 73 56 mg l glycogen was synthesized fig 4d no3 n concentration decreased linearly from 24 01 mg l to 3 33 mg l fig 4c the ntr reached 85 39 with an effluent no2 n concentration of 17 66 mg l fig 4c from phase i to v a shift from exogenous complete denitrification no3 to n2 to epd was observed previous research has shown that the nitrite accumulation during denitrification was attributed to the nitrate reduction rate being higher than the nitrite reduction rate du et al 2015 in this study the maximum rate of no3 n and no2 n reduction rnitrate and rnitrite were evaluated by ex situ batch tests to analyze the formation of no2 n accumulation the theoretical no2 n production rate pnitrite that was calculated by the difference between rnitrate and rnitrite due to the high c nfeed condition rnitrite was found to increase a comparable level with rnitrate resulting in inhibition of nitrite production in phase i pnitrite 0 012 kg n m3 d and phase ii pnitrite 0 014 kg n m3 d fig 4e therefore the generation and consumption of nitrite reached a balanced leading to a plateau period of ntr fig 4e potentially due to the increased capacity of hf a significant portion of sbom was decomposed into pha with an insufficient supply of no3 n the production of organic matters exceeded the capacity of the system for its consumption resulting in a significant accumulation the abundant organic matter promotes the reduction of no2 cao et al 2013 therefore sufficient pha enhanced the rnitrite resulting in the domination of complete denitrification process becoming dominant during the first three phases from day 105 to day 113 the posterior aerobic stage provided oxygen as an extra electron acceptor to consume pha which was redundant in the anoxic stage this accelerated the formation of balance between pha production and consumption which was reflected in the stable concentration of pha of operational cycles fig s1 without an abundant supply of pha the rnitrite decreased from 0 291 kg n m3 d to 0 113 kg n m3 d in phase iv and 0 092 kg n m3 d in phase v with the c nfeed of 6 66 and 4 83 respectively fig 4e this resulted in more organic matter was supplied for the reduction of no3 to no2 therefore rnitrate was increased beyond rnitrite as the system presented characteristics of epd in phase v rnitrate 0 529 kg n m3 d was found to be 5 63 fold higher than the rnitrite 0 094 kg n m3 d fig 4e throughout the operational process the function of aeration and increasing influent no3 n was to achieve an optimal actual c n value which determined the no2 n accumulation of the hf epd system 3 3 analysis of microbial communities and metabolic pathways three typical samples of the inoculated sludge and cultured sludge collected in phase i day 49 and phase v day 232 were analyzed by high throughput sequencing in order to characterize the microbial community evolution of the hf epd system a total of 116 847 effective sequences were obtained for genus level analysis and prediction after filtering out low quality data fig 5 the abundance of hydrolytic fermentation organisms hfos declined from 33 1 to 13 3 during the first 49 days then increased again to 31 9 by day 232 fig 5a this variation may be attributed to the change in community structure of hfos pleomorphomonadaceae wchb1 32 and aeromonas replaced turicibacter a4b georgenia and romboutsia as the dominant genera which were responsible for sboms degradation fig 5b hfos were sensitive to the environmental conditions such as temperature c n ratio and sludge retention time he et al 2022 peng et al 2018 yurtsever et al 2017 in this system the constant temperature range 28 to 30 celsius during anaerobic stage the decreasing influent c n ratio and the operation without sludge discharge might be responsible for the succession of hfos the total abundance of gaos increased from 0 6 to 10 9 over 232 days of cultivation fig 5a candidatus competibacter dechloromonas and zoogloea were the genera of gaos which were significantly enriched during the operational period fig 5b recent studies have found that these genera in particular are related to nitrogen metabolism which can be classed as denitrification glycogen accumulating organisms dgaos shi et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 candidatus competibacter was the main dgaos enriched in the present study increasing in abundance from 0 5 to 9 9 which may indicate they play a significant role in epd performance fig 5b denitrification bacteria dnb that used exogenous organic matter as a metabolic substrate such as olb14 varied according to the carbon source in the liquid phase dnb were enriched with the increasing scodyield and inhibited by low exogenous organic matter condition caused by enhancement of endogenous metabolism pseudomonas has been reported to be related to the nitrite reduction chen et al 2020 nie et al 2021 the proportion of the carbon source used for nitrate reduction increased with the decline in influent c n ratio leading to a decrease in organic matter for nitrite reduction therefore the relative abundance of pseudomonas consistently throughout the long term operational period thauera has been reported previously to be a typical genera responsible for partial denitrification du et al 2017 xie et al 2022 and potentially related to pha synthesis lemos et al 2006 therefore the conditions of the hf epd system that promoted the synthesis of endogenous polymers may potentially have contributed to the slight increase in the abundance of thauera the reduced abundance of dnb that use exogenous organic matter and the enrichment of dgaos may have resulted in the enhancement of epd observed after phase ii especially in phases iv and v to identify the alternations of metabolic pathways under anaerobic condition functional genes of key enzymes involved in carbon conversion were analyzed by picrust ii fig 5b with the names and symbols shown in table s3 a complete pathway was constructed for the hf epd system from starch degradation to endogenous polymers synthesis the starch experienced preliminary degradation by pula glgp and amya then the intermediate glucose was decomposed to pyruvate via the embden meyerhof pathway emp by glk pfka and b and pyk ordinally acetate is generated by pyruvate through an acidogenic process by pora b c and d pta and acka pha synthesis was found to be associated with kora and b hmgcs and hmgcl phbb phac and phaz as the metabolic process mentioned in 3 2 1 that sbom was first degraded to exogenous soluble organic matter then subsequently transformed to endogenous polymers in addition the abundance of functional genes related to pha synthesis increased significantly with the total abundance in phase v being 1 83 fold greater than that in phase i fig 5c this possibly illustrated the enhancement of endogenous organic matter synthesis with etr elevation previous research has found that in both exogenous and endogenous denitrification systems the reduction rates of nitrate and nitrite were affected by the abundance of the corresponding reductase shi et al 2021 zhang et al 2020b with the abundance of reductases dependent on the associated gene in order to determine the variations in nitrogen metabolism under anoxic condition the genes of nitrate reductase genes narg napa and nitrite reductase genes nirs nirk were monitored by qpcr fig 5d the ratio of nitrate reductase genes nar to nitrite reductase genes was used to determine their relative relationship samples were collected in the stable period of each phase day 49 in i day 71 in ii day 103 in iii day 161 in iv and day 232 in v in this study napa and nirs were found to be the dominant nitrate reductase genes and nitrite reductase genes respectively the variation in napa and nirs genes caused fluctuation in the nar to nir ratio on the days 49 and 71 the nar to nir ratio was below 0 68 corresponding to the first two phases with low ntr fig 5d after day 103 the nar to nir ratio increased from 0 81 to 1 04 which was consistent with previously observed trend of increased nitrate reduction rate and decreased trend of nitrite reduction rate therefore the exhibition of nitrite accumulation might be attributed to the observed variations in the denitrification genes which occurred due to the succession of microbial communities and the impact of low actual c n ratio conditions within the system 3 4 adaptability of the hf epd system to different sboms in the present study starch was used as feeding sbom in both start up and long term operational period the performance of hf epd system under other sboms still needs to be evaluated therefore anaerobic and anoxic batch tests were carried out using three representative sboms starch as a granular sbom bsa as a soluble sbom and primary sludge as a complex sbom fig 6 the sboms have been shown to have a negligible capacity to drive effective denitrification directly shi et al 2020b however in terms of the performance of the hf epd system in the degradation of starch bsa and primary sludge the hf products of sboms significantly improved the denitrification rate fig 6a the highest nitrate reduction rate was detected in the system dosed with starch followed by bsa and primary sludge fig 6a moreover the nitrite reduction rate among hf products of sboms ranged from 1 07 10 1 to 1 28 10 1 kg n m3 d and were significantly lower than the nitrate reduction rate fig 6a which suggested the performance of partial denitrification du et al 2015 typical cycles were analyzed with the addition of protein or primary sludge separately after a short term cultivation of 21 days under anaerobic anoxic model for primary sludge the hf led to the decomposition of mlvss resulting in the sludge reduction by 123 45 mg vss l without reduction during sampling fig 6b correspondingly 42 65 mg l scod and 197 64 mg l pha were synthetized with the consumption of 121 65 mg l glycogen fig 6b due to the decrease in denitrification rate the anoxic reaction time was extended to 150 min the effluent no2 n was 10 65 mg l while no3 n was 3 79 mg l with a ntr of 56 10 and a nrr of 84 32 fig 6c bsa as the soluble protein increased the scod concentration in the liquid phase the concentration of liquid protein decreased from 309 43 mg l to 96 54 mg l with the 125 51 mg l synthesis of pha and the 79 75 mg l consumption of glycogen fig 6d during the 90 min anoxic stage the no2 n production was 11 85 mg l with a no3 n reduction of 14 98 mg l corresponding to a ntr of 70 96 and a nrr of 81 07 fig 6e in addition the concentration of polysaccharides and proteins in eps fluctuated insignificantly in both the bsa and primary sludge dosed system fig s4 therefore sboms such as starch bsa and primary sludge can be effectively utilized for epd through hf process the capacity for nitrite accumulation was positively correlated to the hfr under various sboms conditions table 2 the hfr possibly related to the adaption of the hf epd system to different sboms starch was supplied to the system over a long term period of operation and therefore the hf epd system performed high degradability of starch and bsa as the soluble protein had higher mass transfer efficiency than primary sludge that consisted of complex organic matters resulting in hfrs of 78 24 and 62 17 respectively macromolecular carbon sources are unavailable for nitrate reduction without decomposition into micromolecular organic matter zhang et al 2016 therefore the high hfr of sboms resulted in abundant hf production which efficiently improved the nitrate reduction due to the similar nitrite reduction rates of primary sludge bsa and starch in the hf epd system their progressive nitrate reduction rates increased the deference between nitrate and nitrite reduction rates promoting performance of nitrite accumulation the hf epd system exhibited adaptability for a diverse range of sboms after 21 day cultivation the hf process encouraged the supply of carbon source for achieving effective epd performance moreover the hf capability with specific sbom could improve with the extended of cultivation time shi et al 2020a therefore the species of sbom added to the hf epd system can be adjusted according to characteristics and requirements 4 conclusions the utilization of sbom in wastewater and establishing an effective nitrite supply for anammox are ongoing challenges in wastewater treatment in this study a hf epd system was established the specific conclusions were as follows 1 sbom was effectively transformed into endogenous polymers to drive effective nitrite production with 85 4 ntr indicating hf epd could be a potentially feasible way for anammox application in the treatment of sbom rich wastewater 2 through a pathway of simultaneous hf absorption and endogenous polymer synthesis 79 0 sbom was transformed into pha which was the main electron donor in epd process of this system 3 the candidatus competibacter dgaos was enriched from 0 32 to 9 90 with a 1 83 fold increase in pha synthesis genes potentially resulting in an improvement of hf and epd performance 4 the hf epd system exhibited adaptability with the addition of granular sbom starch soluble sbom bsa and primary sludge therefore the hf epd system provides a feasible approach to effectively promote nitrite production using a virous sboms for supplying nitrite to anammox process declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15150,the utilization of slowly biodegradable organic matter sbom to provide nitrite efficiently for anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox process is an essential topic high nitrite concentration without inhibition of exogenous organic matter is optimal condition for anammox process in this study hydrolytic fermentation hf of sbom was applied to drive an endogenous partial denitrification epd process nitrate to nitrite during an anaerobic anoxic operation in a starch fed system with a limited production of exogenous organic matter 22 3 4 9 mg cod l 79 0 of sbom was transformed into poly hydroxyalkanoates pha through a pathway of simultaneous hf absorption and endogenous polymer synthesis corresponding to a hydrolytic fermentation ratio of 86 0 a high nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio of 85 4 was achieved under an influent carbon to nitrogen ratio of 4 8 denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms dgaos was enriched from 0 6 to 10 9 with an increase from 0 7 to 1 0 of nitrate reductase genes to nitrite reductase genes ratio subsequently nitrate reduction rate was 5 6 fold higher than the nitrate reduction rate a prominent migration of exogenous complete denitrification to epd was accomplished furthermore the starch fed system exhibited performance with significant adaptability and stability in the presence of different sboms dissolved protein and primary sludge therefore the hf epd system achieved efficient nitrite production through epd with the addition of various sboms providing a potential alternative to anammox systems for the treatment of sbom rich wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords endogenous partial denitrification epd hydrolytic fermentation hf slowly biodegradable organic matter sbom dgao data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox is an autotrophic nitrogen removal process that produces nitrogen n2 from nitrite no2 and ammonium nh4 under anaerobic conditions converting wastewater treatment process from being energy consuming to energy neutral or energy producing kartal et al 2010 however the requirement for a stable supply of no2 is the main limitation to the development and widespread application of this technology wang et al 2021 partial nitration pn and partial denitrification pd are both cost effective technologies that provide nitrite as substrate for anammox process du et al 2019 zekker et al 2014 however when pn was combined with anammox accurate control of do and hrt is required zekker et al 2011 to date the utilization of pn anammox is still difficult in main stream of wastewater with low ammonia concentration pd has been shown to provide a stable approach for the simultaneous treatment of municipal sewage and no3 containing wastewater under anammox treatment conditions du et al 2016 however pd is generally achieved with the preference of readily biodegradable organic matter rbom such as sodium acetate and glucose cao et al 2019 ge et al 2012 in actual domestic sewage slowly biodegradable organic matter sbom accounts for a major proportion 78 of organic matter roeleveld and van loosdrecht 2002 zhang et al 2016 and sbom was found to provide a negligible contribution to nitrite production in pd shi et al 2019 therefore the low availability of rbom and the inefficient utilization of sbom significantly increase the cost of pd engineering applications furthermore pd process driven by exogenous rbom requires to cease timely at the point of maximum nitrite production to avoid further no2 reduction which may cause residual organic matter to remain ji et al 2017 when the pd process was coupled with anammox high exogenous rbom concentrations could inhibited anammox activity ni et al 2012 zhang et al 2020a therefore the dependence on specific carbon sources especially rbom and the inhibition on anammox caused by exogenous organic matter have impeded the development of pd applications in wwtp system hydrolytic fermentation hf is widely used as pretreatment process for decomposing sbom liu et al 2021b the decomposition products were mainly volatile fatty acids vfas and saccharides which can directly utilized as the electron donors shi et al 2020a b therefore the hf process enhances the utilization efficiency of sbom in wastewater previous research reported that endogenous partial denitrification epd based on glycogen accumulating organisms gaos maintained a sufficient no2 supply for anammox ji et al 2020 in epd process the influent rbom was utilized by gaos to generate poly hydroxyalkanoates pha under anaerobic condition and pha subsequently was utilized under anoxic condition for the reduction of no2 to no3 at low exogenous organic matter concentrations dan et al 2021 ji et al 2018 based on the previous study a new perspective in establishing a combined hf and epd process hf epd could be provided this approach could possibly transform the hf products of sbom into endogenous polymers rather than exogenous rbom efficiently facilitating the utilization of influent carbon sources for no2 production furthermore hf epd system provides a pathway of no2 supplementation for further combining with anammox circumventing the inhibition of abundant exogenous organic matter however the development of the hf epd system and its potential mechanism of carbon nitrogen metabolisms have not been systematically or comprehensively studied the aim of this study was to 1 assess the feasibility of the hf epd system 2 investigate the transformation of sbom and no3 3 investigate the succession of the functional bacteria via high throughput sequencing analysis and 4 assess the adaptability of systems to different sboms 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculation sludge and inflow characteristics the inoculation sludge of hf epd system was the primary sludge from primary sedimentation tank at wastewater treatment plant wwtp of gaobeidian beijing china the concentration of mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss was maintained at 2500 200 mg l when the effective volume was 10 l starch was used as a typical substrate to investigate the decomposition process of sbom goel et al 1998 mino et al 1995 therefore the starch reagent sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china analytical reagent was used to simulated sbom during the long term operation of hf epd system furthermore based on solubility sbom was divided into granular and soluble portions hu et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 measured by laser particle analyzer s3500 microtrac usa 98 33 of starch particle size was distributed from 10 μm to 100 μm with the average value of 40 03 15 46 μm the results mean that starch belongs to granular sbom to investigate the performance of hf epd system under other types of sboms bovine serum albumin bsa sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china biological reagent and primary sludge from gaobeidian wwtp was selected as soluble sbom and complex sbom the characteristics of sbom solution was shown in table 1 the no3 wastewater was perpetrated by sodium nitrate nano3 with nutrient solution cao et al 2013 which the composition was shown in table s1 the no3 n concentration was increased with a stepwise approach 10 mg l day 1 49 20 mg l day 50 79 30 mg l day 80 191 40 mg l day 192 240 2 2 reactor setup and operation the hf epd system was established in a sequencing batch reactor sbr with an effective volume of 4 12 l during the anaerobic stage and 10 l during the anoxic stage with a drainage ratio

decanting period and an 80 min idling period 2 3 batch tests 2 3 1 determination of denitrification activity the denitrification activity of the hf epd system was characterized in terms of the reduction rates of no3 n and no2 n which were measured in 500 ml serum bottles equipped with the magnetic stirrers ret basic c ika germany for each batch system sludge mixture 206 ml was collected from the hf epd sbr after the 480 min anaerobic period then sludge mixture was diluted to 500 ml with deionized water following with the addition of the nutrient solution table s1 in order to establish an anoxic environment do was decreased below 0 02 mg l by flushing with n2 the nitrate or nitrite solution was then injected into the serum bottles to provide the substrate for denitrification the feeding carbon to nitrogen ratios c n were consistent with those of hf epd system 18 89 in phase i 9 36 in phase ii 6 66 in phase iii and iv 4 83 in phase v 2 3 2 nitrogen reduction rates to determine the nitrogen reduction rates of different sboms and their hf products 400 ml sludge mixture was collected from the hf epd sbr during idling period for each batch system the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min using a low speed centrifuge kdc 1044 zonkia china at 4000 rpm to remove supernatant then diluted the sediment to 400 ml with deionized water the washing process was repeated for three times subsequently the sediment was transferred into a 1 l serum bottle containing nutrient addition table s1 in the batch system directly utilizing sboms as electron donors for denitrification the sediment was diluted to 1 l and flushed with n2 subsequently different sboms starch bsa or primary sludge were injected separately into the serum bottles for supplying 120 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod in each batch system followed by addition of 1 ml of 20 g l no3 n or no2 n solution in the batch system using hf products of sboms as the electron donors for denitrification

sludge sample after freeze drying by fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa and the concentration was quantitated by ultramicro spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies nd 1000 usa in this study nitrate reductase gene including narg gene and napa gene nitrite reductase gene including nirs gene and nirk gene were quantified by quantitative real time pcr qpcr with the approach of fluorescent dye sybr green the corresponding process was listed in table s2 2 6 calculations the feeding carbon to nitrogen ratio c nfeed was calculated by eq 1 where sbomfeed was the initial theoretical concentration at anaerobic stage 4 12 l nox ninflow was concentration of influent no3 n with the inflow volume of 5 88 l 1 c n f e e d 4 12 s b o m f e e d 5 88 n o 3 n i n f l o w the ratio of soluble cod produced from sbom decomposition was represented as scodyield calculated by eq 2 where δscod was the variation of scod concentration during anaerobic stage 2 s c o d y i e l d δ s c o d s

was divided into five phases based on the c nfeed and the transformation performance of hf epd system fig 2 in phase i day 1 49 an increase in scodyield was observed under anaerobic condition with improvement of hf capability reaching a peak value of 54 39 on day 24 fig 2a then scodyield reduced to 11 06 on day 37 and stabilized below 13 11 until the final stage of operation fig 2a the initial and final scod during the anoxic stage exhibited a trend of initially increasing and then decreasing from day 24 onwards fig 2b the average c nfeed in phase i was 18 89 with a theoretical sbom concentration of 285 2 mg cod l such a high c n predisposed the anaerobic anoxic system to the dominance of endogenous metabolism chu et al 2021 therefore with the enhancement of hf capacity after day 24 the scod in liquid phase was preferentially transformed into endogenous polymers which might be responsible for the decrease in scodyield fig 2a and the accumulation of pha fig s1 the hydrolysate of sbom facilitated denitrification under anoxic conditions leading to a high average nrr of 91 97 fig 2c however the enhancement of acidogenic performance led to the inevitable accumulation of carbon sources under low no3 n conditions resulting in a decrease in ntr to below 5 41 fig 2c the c nfeed was decreased to 9 36 in phase ii day 50 79 the hf products were no longer present as exogenous polymers less than 16 45 mg l scod contributed to denitrification fig 2a however with the accumulation of excess carbon source mainly endogenous polymers over previous operational cycles the actual c n in system exceeded the theoretical c nfeed value the increase in c n caused by the redundant accumulation of endogenous polymers possibly inhibited the epd process ji et al 2017 subsequently the ntr was stable at 23 43 without further significant growth in phase iii day 80 104 fig 2c the posterior aerobic stage was used to remove endogenous polymers that did not reacted in the anoxic stage chu et al 2021 hence an aerobic stage was added after the first drain period to accelerate the consumption of residual endogenous organic matter within the system fig 1d the modified operational sequence was implemented on day 105 with continuous monitoring of pha concentration fig s1 the initial pha decreased from 461 3 mg l to 323 0 mg l and then remained stable for 10 operation cycles indicating that a balance between pha production and consumption was achieved fig s1 the modified operational procedure ran for an 8 days period day 105 113 then the system was restored to the original operational sequence without the aerobic stage with the consumption of residual pha a dynamic balance was achieved between hf endogenous polymers storage and epd with ntr exhibiting a rapidly increase from 22 21 to 48 74 fig 2c the improvement of epd continued throughout phase iv day 105 191 resulting in the ntr increasing to 77 62 with a corresponding nrr of 85 62 fig 2c phase v day 192 240 was stable period exhibiting an average nrr of 88 41 with a desirable ntr of 85 04 fig 2c these results demonstrate the feasibility and effective performance of the hf epd system generating effluent containing 18 83 mg l no2 n and 30 62 mg l scod which is suitable for no2 n supply in anammox process therefore hf epd could be a potentially feasible way for anammox application in the treatment of sbom rich wastewater 3 2 transformation pathways of organic carbon and nitrogen 3 2 1 mechanism of carbon conversion under anaerobic condition during the 240 day operational period a change was observed in the form of existence of the sbom hydrolysate converting from exogenous carbon scod in liquid phase to endogenous polymers pha on day 24 phase i the degradation of starch contributed to an increase in scod from 115 7 mg l to 265 8 mg l without endogenous carbon storage fig 3 a the pha and glycogen concentrations stabilized without significant change fig 3a in contrast the scod in the liquid phase varied negligibly with the scod production of 19 20 mg l on day 235 fig 3b the pha concentration increased from 316 5 mg l to 559 6 mg l while glycogen decreased from 2209 4 mg l to 2011 6 mg l throughout the anaerobic stage fig 3b the majority of hf products were transformed into pha indicating that the hf process occurred synchronously with the transformation of exogenous carbon to endogenous polymers variations in eps were applied to characterize the extracellular carbon adsorption li et al 2020 the significant increase of total eps was detected at 0 min of anaerobic stage and followed by an insignificant variation during the anaerobic reaction fig 3c and d the eps variation caused by bacterial secretions was negligible in idle stage the increase in eps possibly attributed to the adsorption of polysaccharides produced from the decomposition of sbom furthermore changes in scod were detected in all eps layers fig s2 suggesting that hydrolysis may occur not only in the liquid phase but also in the adsorption layers in contrast to the low level of fluctuation observed on day 24 fig 3c the total eps on day 235 concentration increased significantly until a peak was reached on day 235 after which a downward trend was observed fig 3d it was consistent with the variation trend in eps content in the lb layer while no significant variation in eps was observed in the s layer or tb layer fig 3d within the lb layer the protein was maintained at 3 78 mg g vss while the polysaccharides initially increased from 8 60 mg g vss to 10 86 mg g vss in the first 120 min then gradually decreased to 4 64 mg g vss by the end of the anaerobic stage fig 3d this might due to the dissolved starch and polysaccharides components being adsorbed first adsorbed to the extracellular adsorption layer leading to a peak eps value at 120 min subsequently polysaccharides degraded into rbom and were then transformed into endogenous polymers such as pha this simultaneous adsorption and degradation of sbom were conductive to the transformation of exogenous organic matter to endogenous polymers resulting in a high level of pha production in phase v various performance characteristics were analyzed in typical cycles of each phase to determine the organic carbon transformation pathways including scodyield etr adr and hfr fig 3e in phases i and ii day 24 34 and 51 the scodyield decreased from 54 38 to 9 49 while the adr and etr increased simultaneously leading to an elevated hfr from 67 21 to 72 40 fig 3e this illustrated that the reduction in scod production and the increase in organic carbon adsorption were manifestations of endogenous storage in phase iii the pha concentration became stable at a significant level possibly be saturated which potentially blocked their synthesis and resulting in a decrease in hfr on day 102 after the hf production and carbon consumption achieved a balanced in phase iv the stable performance of the hf epd system was shown throughout phase v the hfr increased further from 78 99 on day 160 to 86 02 on day 235 fig 3e the etr increased from 69 42 to 78 95 with the eliminations of adr and scodyield fig 3e during the long term operational period the observed increase in etr was accompanied by a decrease in adr this possibly attributed to that with the enhancement of endogenous polymers generation capacity the hf products adsorbed in eps layers were transformed into pha leading to a reduction in adsorbed organic matter at the end of the anaerobic stage overall extracellular adsorption provided a site for the occurrence of hf as an intermediate process in conversion of exogenous organic matter to endogenous polymers it also prevented hf hydrolysate from entering the liquid phase which promoted the generation of pha furthermore the dynamic equilibrium formed between hf adsorption and the conversion of endogenous polymers resulted in simultaneous hydrolysate production and endogenous polymers storage during sbom degradation in the hf epd system therefore substantial pha concentration were generated with limited scod concentration detected in the liquid phase 3 2 2 nitrogen carbon transformation pathways under anoxic condition during the long term operational period the driving force for denitrification was found to shift from exogenous carbon source to endogenous polymers during the long term operation from day 20 to day 27 in phase i the concentration of scod in the liquid phase surged due to the degradation of sbom by hf leading to the dominance of denitrification driven by exogenous carbon sources subsequently the scod was decreased from 83 12 mg l to 58 08 mg l within 10 min of anoxic condition fig 4 a correspondingly the no3 n concentration rapidly reduced from 7 02 mg l to 2 29 mg l with the accumulation of 1 82 mg l no2 n fig 4a in addition no3 n and no2 n concentration were gradually reduced to below 0 1 mg l after 20 min due to the excessive c n ratio fig 4a due to the depletion of electron acceptors nox n and oxygen pha and glycogen were nearly unconsumed during anoxic stage fig 4b in contrast the liquid phase scod concentration was maintained at 29 56 mg l in phase v indicating that the exogenous carbon source no longer primarily drove denitrification fig 4c instead pha became the main driving force for denitrification decreasing from 107 75 mg l to 49 26 mg l and 73 56 mg l glycogen was synthesized fig 4d no3 n concentration decreased linearly from 24 01 mg l to 3 33 mg l fig 4c the ntr reached 85 39 with an effluent no2 n concentration of 17 66 mg l fig 4c from phase i to v a shift from exogenous complete denitrification no3 to n2 to epd was observed previous research has shown that the nitrite accumulation during denitrification was attributed to the nitrate reduction rate being higher than the nitrite reduction rate du et al 2015 in this study the maximum rate of no3 n and no2 n reduction rnitrate and rnitrite were evaluated by ex situ batch tests to analyze the formation of no2 n accumulation the theoretical no2 n production rate pnitrite that was calculated by the difference between rnitrate and rnitrite due to the high c nfeed condition rnitrite was found to increase a comparable level with rnitrate resulting in inhibition of nitrite production in phase i pnitrite 0 012 kg n m3 d and phase ii pnitrite 0 014 kg n m3 d fig 4e therefore the generation and consumption of nitrite reached a balanced leading to a plateau period of ntr fig 4e potentially due to the increased capacity of hf a significant portion of sbom was decomposed into pha with an insufficient supply of no3 n the production of organic matters exceeded the capacity of the system for its consumption resulting in a significant accumulation the abundant organic matter promotes the reduction of no2 cao et al 2013 therefore sufficient pha enhanced the rnitrite resulting in the domination of complete denitrification process becoming dominant during the first three phases from day 105 to day 113 the posterior aerobic stage provided oxygen as an extra electron acceptor to consume pha which was redundant in the anoxic stage this accelerated the formation of balance between pha production and consumption which was reflected in the stable concentration of pha of operational cycles fig s1 without an abundant supply of pha the rnitrite decreased from 0 291 kg n m3 d to 0 113 kg n m3 d in phase iv and 0 092 kg n m3 d in phase v with the c nfeed of 6 66 and 4 83 respectively fig 4e this resulted in more organic matter was supplied for the reduction of no3 to no2 therefore rnitrate was increased beyond rnitrite as the system presented characteristics of epd in phase v rnitrate 0 529 kg n m3 d was found to be 5 63 fold higher than the rnitrite 0 094 kg n m3 d fig 4e throughout the operational process the function of aeration and increasing influent no3 n was to achieve an optimal actual c n value which determined the no2 n accumulation of the hf epd system 3 3 analysis of microbial communities and metabolic pathways three typical samples of the inoculated sludge and cultured sludge collected in phase i day 49 and phase v day 232 were analyzed by high throughput sequencing in order to characterize the microbial community evolution of the hf epd system a total of 116 847 effective sequences were obtained for genus level analysis and prediction after filtering out low quality data fig 5 the abundance of hydrolytic fermentation organisms hfos declined from 33 1 to 13 3 during the first 49 days then increased again to 31 9 by day 232 fig 5a this variation may be attributed to the change in community structure of hfos pleomorphomonadaceae wchb1 32 and aeromonas replaced turicibacter a4b georgenia and romboutsia as the dominant genera which were responsible for sboms degradation fig 5b hfos were sensitive to the environmental conditions such as temperature c n ratio and sludge retention time he et al 2022 peng et al 2018 yurtsever et al 2017 in this system the constant temperature range 28 to 30 celsius during anaerobic stage the decreasing influent c n ratio and the operation without sludge discharge might be responsible for the succession of hfos the total abundance of gaos increased from 0 6 to 10 9 over 232 days of cultivation fig 5a candidatus competibacter dechloromonas and zoogloea were the genera of gaos which were significantly enriched during the operational period fig 5b recent studies have found that these genera in particular are related to nitrogen metabolism which can be classed as denitrification glycogen accumulating organisms dgaos shi et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 candidatus competibacter was the main dgaos enriched in the present study increasing in abundance from 0 5 to 9 9 which may indicate they play a significant role in epd performance fig 5b denitrification bacteria dnb that used exogenous organic matter as a metabolic substrate such as olb14 varied according to the carbon source in the liquid phase dnb were enriched with the increasing scodyield and inhibited by low exogenous organic matter condition caused by enhancement of endogenous metabolism pseudomonas has been reported to be related to the nitrite reduction chen et al 2020 nie et al 2021 the proportion of the carbon source used for nitrate reduction increased with the decline in influent c n ratio leading to a decrease in organic matter for nitrite reduction therefore the relative abundance of pseudomonas consistently throughout the long term operational period thauera has been reported previously to be a typical genera responsible for partial denitrification du et al 2017 xie et al 2022 and potentially related to pha synthesis lemos et al 2006 therefore the conditions of the hf epd system that promoted the synthesis of endogenous polymers may potentially have contributed to the slight increase in the abundance of thauera the reduced abundance of dnb that use exogenous organic matter and the enrichment of dgaos may have resulted in the enhancement of epd observed after phase ii especially in phases iv and v to identify the alternations of metabolic pathways under anaerobic condition functional genes of key enzymes involved in carbon conversion were analyzed by picrust ii fig 5b with the names and symbols shown in table s3 a complete pathway was constructed for the hf epd system from starch degradation to endogenous polymers synthesis the starch experienced preliminary degradation by pula glgp and amya then the intermediate glucose was decomposed to pyruvate via the embden meyerhof pathway emp by glk pfka and b and pyk ordinally acetate is generated by pyruvate through an acidogenic process by pora b c and d pta and acka pha synthesis was found to be associated with kora and b hmgcs and hmgcl phbb phac and phaz as the metabolic process mentioned in 3 2 1 that sbom was first degraded to exogenous soluble organic matter then subsequently transformed to endogenous polymers in addition the abundance of functional genes related to pha synthesis increased significantly with the total abundance in phase v being 1 83 fold greater than that in phase i fig 5c this possibly illustrated the enhancement of endogenous organic matter synthesis with etr elevation previous research has found that in both exogenous and endogenous denitrification systems the reduction rates of nitrate and nitrite were affected by the abundance of the corresponding reductase shi et al 2021 zhang et al 2020b with the abundance of reductases dependent on the associated gene in order to determine the variations in nitrogen metabolism under anoxic condition the genes of nitrate reductase genes narg napa and nitrite reductase genes nirs nirk were monitored by qpcr fig 5d the ratio of nitrate reductase genes nar to nitrite reductase genes was used to determine their relative relationship samples were collected in the stable period of each phase day 49 in i day 71 in ii day 103 in iii day 161 in iv and day 232 in v in this study napa and nirs were found to be the dominant nitrate reductase genes and nitrite reductase genes respectively the variation in napa and nirs genes caused fluctuation in the nar to nir ratio on the days 49 and 71 the nar to nir ratio was below 0 68 corresponding to the first two phases with low ntr fig 5d after day 103 the nar to nir ratio increased from 0 81 to 1 04 which was consistent with previously observed trend of increased nitrate reduction rate and decreased trend of nitrite reduction rate therefore the exhibition of nitrite accumulation might be attributed to the observed variations in the denitrification genes which occurred due to the succession of microbial communities and the impact of low actual c n ratio conditions within the system 3 4 adaptability of the hf epd system to different sboms in the present study starch was used as feeding sbom in both start up and long term operational period the performance of hf epd system under other sboms still needs to be evaluated therefore anaerobic and anoxic batch tests were carried out using three representative sboms starch as a granular sbom bsa as a soluble sbom and primary sludge as a complex sbom fig 6 the sboms have been shown to have a negligible capacity to drive effective denitrification directly shi et al 2020b however in terms of the performance of the hf epd system in the degradation of starch bsa and primary sludge the hf products of sboms significantly improved the denitrification rate fig 6a the highest nitrate reduction rate was detected in the system dosed with starch followed by bsa and primary sludge fig 6a moreover the nitrite reduction rate among hf products of sboms ranged from 1 07 10 1 to 1 28 10 1 kg n m3 d and were significantly lower than the nitrate reduction rate fig 6a which suggested the performance of partial denitrification du et al 2015 typical cycles were analyzed with the addition of protein or primary sludge separately after a short term cultivation of 21 days under anaerobic anoxic model for primary sludge the hf led to the decomposition of mlvss resulting in the sludge reduction by 123 45 mg vss l without reduction during sampling fig 6b correspondingly 42 65 mg l scod and 197 64 mg l pha were synthetized with the consumption of 121 65 mg l glycogen fig 6b due to the decrease in denitrification rate the anoxic reaction time was extended to 150 min the effluent no2 n was 10 65 mg l while no3 n was 3 79 mg l with a ntr of 56 10 and a nrr of 84 32 fig 6c bsa as the soluble protein increased the scod concentration in the liquid phase the concentration of liquid protein decreased from 309 43 mg l to 96 54 mg l with the 125 51 mg l synthesis of pha and the 79 75 mg l consumption of glycogen fig 6d during the 90 min anoxic stage the no2 n production was 11 85 mg l with a no3 n reduction of 14 98 mg l corresponding to a ntr of 70 96 and a nrr of 81 07 fig 6e in addition the concentration of polysaccharides and proteins in eps fluctuated insignificantly in both the bsa and primary sludge dosed system fig s4 therefore sboms such as starch bsa and primary sludge can be effectively utilized for epd through hf process the capacity for nitrite accumulation was positively correlated to the hfr under various sboms conditions table 2 the hfr possibly related to the adaption of the hf epd system to different sboms starch was supplied to the system over a long term period of operation and therefore the hf epd system performed high degradability of starch and bsa as the soluble protein had higher mass transfer efficiency than primary sludge that consisted of complex organic matters resulting in hfrs of 78 24 and 62 17 respectively macromolecular carbon sources are unavailable for nitrate reduction without decomposition into micromolecular organic matter zhang et al 2016 therefore the high hfr of sboms resulted in abundant hf production which efficiently improved the nitrate reduction due to the similar nitrite reduction rates of primary sludge bsa and starch in the hf epd system their progressive nitrate reduction rates increased the deference between nitrate and nitrite reduction rates promoting performance of nitrite accumulation the hf epd system exhibited adaptability for a diverse range of sboms after 21 day cultivation the hf process encouraged the supply of carbon source for achieving effective epd performance moreover the hf capability with specific sbom could improve with the extended of cultivation time shi et al 2020a therefore the species of sbom added to the hf epd system can be adjusted according to characteristics and requirements 4 conclusions the utilization of sbom in wastewater and establishing an effective nitrite supply for anammox are ongoing challenges in wastewater treatment in this study a hf epd system was established the specific conclusions were as follows 1 sbom was effectively transformed into endogenous polymers to drive effective nitrite production with 85 4 ntr indicating hf epd could be a potentially feasible way for anammox application in the treatment of sbom rich wastewater 2 through a pathway of simultaneous hf absorption and endogenous polymer synthesis 79 0 sbom was transformed into pha which was the main electron donor in epd process of this system 3 the candidatus competibacter dgaos was enriched from 0 32 to 9 90 with a 1 83 fold increase in pha synthesis genes potentially resulting in an improvement of hf and epd performance 4 the hf epd system exhibited adaptability with the addition of granular sbom starch soluble sbom bsa and primary sludge therefore the hf epd system provides a feasible approach to effectively promote nitrite production using a virous sboms for supplying nitrite to anammox process declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15151,treatment of recalcitrant landfill leachate lfl induces huge energy consumption and carbon emissions due to its complex composition although membrane distillation md exhibits good potential in lfl treatment with waste heat utilization membrane fouling and ammonia rejection are still the major problems encountered that hinder its application herein membrane electrochemical reactor mer was coupled with md for simultaneous membrane fouling control and resource recovery lfl pretreatment with membrane less electrochemical reactor eo and without pretreatment were also purified by md for comparison results showed that the mer md system rejected almost all codcr total phosphorus metal salts and ammonia nitrogen increased by 33 5 43 5 without chemical addition and recovered 31 of ammonia nitrogen and 48 of humic acid in the raw lfl owing to the effective removal of hardness 61 and organics 77 using mer the mer md system showed higher resistance to the membrane wetting and fouling with about 61 and 14 higher final vapor flux than those of the md and eo md systems respectively and the pure water flux could be fully recovered by alkaline solution cleaning moreover sem eds atr ftir and xrd characterization further demonstrated the superiority of the md membrane fouling reversibility of the mer md system energy consumption and carbon emissions analysis showed that the mer md system reduced the total energy consumption carbon emissions by 20 and 8 compared to the md and eo md systems respectively and the ammonia nitrogen recovered by mer could offset 8 25 kg carbon dioxide equivalent therefore the introduction of mer pretreatment in md process would be an option to decrease energy consumption and reduce carbon emissions for md treatment of lfl graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation landfill leachate membrane electrochemical reactor carbon emission data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sanitary landfill is one of the most efficient and cost effective system that is widely applied to deal with municipal solid waste in many countries moreira et al 2015 nevertheless a large volume of recalcitrant and highly toxic landfill leachate lfl is produced through rainwater seeping and various physical chemical and biological reactions iskander et al 2016 jia et al 2022 wiszniowski et al 2006 lfl contains high concentrations of various organic compounds humic acid ha compounds etc heavy metals iron copper chromium etc and macro inorganic compounds mg2 ca2 cl na hco3 nh4 etc yao 2017 without proper treatment lfl may get mixed with surface water or seep into groundwater resulting in contamination of surface water groundwater and soil guo et al 2022 causing severe environmental pollution and health hazards to humans currently biological wastewater treatment involving the action of microorganisms is universally applied for lfl treatment due to its simple and facile treatment process and economic convenience iskander et al 2018 however sole biological treatment is inefficient in removing the refractory organic matter and high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen present in lfl which leads to water environment problems such as water eutrophication wang et al 2018 therefore physical chemical methods are generally introduced to improve treatment capacity and efficiency noteworthy both the fenton process and membrane technology have been proven to be effective and stable methods for lfl treatment wiszniowski et al 2006 yao 2017 however fenton process consumes large quantity of acid and produces tremendous amount of considerable sludge liu et al 2020 and conventional membrane technology suffers from application bottlenecks such as membrane fouling high energy consumption and production of large amounts of concentrate singh et al 2014 moreover the disposal of by products further leads to the increase in energy consumption and carbon emissions as an emerging low temperature distillation technology membrane distillation md offers significant potential in lfl treatment due to the high rejection performance and ability to utilize low grade waste heat utilization parani and oluwafemi 2021 jia et al 2022 applied direct contact membrane distillation dcmd to treat lfl reverse osmosis concentrate brine and 80 water recovery was achieved in our recent study in the lfl treatment via md technique rejections of total organic carbon toc phosphate and metal ions were all higher than 98 93 yan et al 2021 however the rejection of ammonia by md was not satisfactory 46 and the deposition of ha substances and the scaling of calcium and magnesium related inorganic substances could lead to serious membrane fouling resulting in the reduction in the membrane flux by half after the operation yan et al 2022 membrane fouling in md not only leads to significantly increased operation cost but also increases the risk of membrane wetting eventually resulting in the direct failure of md process chang et al 2021 shi et al 2022 till date electrochemical techniques have attracted significant research attention for membrane pretreatment in wastewater treatment process by coupling electrochemical oxidation eo the organic fouling of md in lfl treatment was reported to be effectively alleviated chen et al 2021 when eo and md were combined for the sulfate based electrolytes sulfate radical was in situ yielded which prevented membrane fouling shin et al 2020 although the organics and ammonia could be oxidized by eo the fouling caused by inorganics scaling in the lfl was not satisfactory and dosing scale inhibitors were required with the further introduction of electrocoagulation ec process in eo md membrane scaling could be controlled because the hardness due to ca2 and mg2 ions could be removed by the pretreatment chen et al 2022 however the energy consumption was found to be heavy for both the ec process and eo in the lfl treatment with high concentration foulants so far main target of applying electrochemical pretreatments in md process is the removal of pollutants from lfl as the main target which inevitably consumes huge amount of chemicals and energy however in the context of carbon neutrality it is more desirable to recycle potential resources in lfl treatment with lower chemical and energy consumption and decreased carbon emissions in the electrochemical process hydroxyl ions oh and hydrogen ions proton h are produced at cathode and anode respectively sanju et al 2019 the mixture of oh and h in electrochemical process significantly compromises wastewater softening at the cathode by the introduction of ion selective membranes into the electrochemical system a low ph anolyte and a high ph catholyte could be simultaneously achieved in the membrane electrochemical reactor mer liu et al 2019 furthermore notably for lfl treatment the high ph condition in the catholyte is helpful for the stripping of high concentration ammonia nitrogen and water softening in contrast the low ph condition in the anolyte is helpful for scaling inhabitation and ha recovery ye et al 2019 therefore mer could be considered as a chemical free pretreatment for feed ph conditioning and providing nutrient recovery conditions in lfl treatment in this study an innovative process was developed by integrating mer and md mer md system for lel treatment to improve the md rejection and to reduce energy consumption carbon emissions through resource recovery and mitigation of membrane fouling wetting three cyclic experiments were conducted to explore the reversibility of membrane fouling in the mer md system as an effective approach to assess its potential for long term operation practical application potential was further assessed based on energy consumption and carbon emission calculations for comparative analysis no pretreatment md system and membrane less electrochemical oxidation system pretreatment eo md system were also conducted 2 materials and methods 2 1 lfl sample the lfl was fetched from hongmiaoling comprehensive treatment plant fuzhou fujian the comprehensive treatment plant has two landfills and a waste incineration power plant and their lfl were blended to obtain the research sample detailed characteristics of lfl are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental procedures self constructed laboratory scale mer eo and dcmd experimental device systems were adopted in the experiments detailed information about the construction of mer eo and dcmd system and operating conditions are illustrated in sections s1 and s2 of supplementary information respectively three experiments case a c were performed for comparative analysis and the schematic illustration is presented in fig 1 in case a dcmd was directly applied for lfl treatment as the control group in case b eo pretreatment was adopted which was followed by the treatment of the effluent by dcmd process in case c the lfl was fed into the anode chamber of mer for pretreatment and na2so4 solution 15 mmol l 1 was added to the cathode chamber as catholyte mer was operated for 8 h until the ph of lfl decreased to less than 2 to precipitate ha as a control the eo of case b was also operated for 8 h the lfl after mer or eo treatment was added to the feed tank of the md for further treatment in all systems md operation was ended when 400 ml of water was produced all groups were subjected to three cycle of experiments and the membrane was flushed with pure water for 30 min after each cyclic experiment for membrane cleaning and evaluating the membrane fouling then the md membranes were air dried and reinstalled into the dcmd module to proceed the next cycle test with either raw lfl or pretreated lfl after the three cycles of experiments the md membrane was immersed in naoh solution 20 0 ml ph 12 for 30 min to remove the pollutants present on the membrane surface 2 3 performance evaluation methods 2 3 1 calculation of rejection performance the rejection performance of the system was evaluated by using the removal rate r based on the mass percentage of fouling intercepted as shown in eq 1 1 r 1 c p v p c r v f 100 where cp and vp are the pollutant concentration mg l 1 and volume l of permeate respectively and cf and vf are the pollutant concentration mg l 1 and volume l of the feed respectively 2 3 2 calculation of energy consumption to simplify the operation energy calculation the following assumptions were adopted kim et al 2018 yan et al 2019 1 the heat loss due to module conduction to the environment is negligible 2 the energy required for the magnetic stirring of the pre treatment is minute 3 the pressure drops through the pipes are negligible 4 the specific heat capacities of the feed and permeate remain constant and the specific heat capacity equals that of pure water energy consumption analysis was based on the laboratory scale installations the energy demand for md is associated with feed heating permeate cooling and circulation pumps and the energy demand for mer eo is only the electrical energy of dc power the energy consumption of the mer and eo was calculated by recording the power supply voltage during operation the specific energy consumption of mer eo reactor secmer eo kwh m 3 lfl was calculated by using eq 2 kaur et al 2019 as follows 2 s e c m e r e o u i t 1000 v p where u is the average hourly supply voltage v i is the current a t is the operating time h and vp is the volume of lfl for pretreatment m3 the heating power is calculated based on the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the feed side of the md membrane module therefore the md heating power qh n kw for the nth cycle n from 1 to 3 was calculated by using eq 3 yan et al 2021 as follows 3 q h n 1 1000 c f m f t f i n t f o u t where cf is the feed specific heat j kg c 1 mf is the pumping feed mass flow rate kg s 1 and tf in and tf out are the inlet and outlet temperatures c in the feed side respectively the heating energy consumption eh kwh during the three cycles of the three groups of experiments was calculated by using eq 4 4 e h 1 η e i 1 3 q h n t n where tn is md operating time for the nth cycle h and ηe is the heating efficiency the cooling power is calculated based on the temperature difference between the outlet and inlet of the permeate side of the md membrane module therefore the md cooling power qc n kw for the nth cycle n from 1 to 3 was calculated by using eq 5 yan et al 2021 5 q c n 1 1000 c p m p t p o u t t p i n where cp is the permeate specific heat j kg c 1 mp is the pumping feed mass flow rate kg s 1 and tp in and tp out are the inlet and outlet temperatures c in the permeate side respectively the required input power is calculated based on the cooling coefficient cop and the cooling power therefore the actual input power pc is calculated by using eq 6 6 p c q c c o p where cop is the cooling coefficient according to the cooling temperature and environmental temperature the value of cop was taken to be 5 5 for calculation attia 2010 therefore the cooling energy consumption ec kwh during the three cycles of the three groups of experiments was calculated by using eq 7 7 e c i 1 3 p c n t n the energy consumption of the circulation pumps is calculated based on the difference between the inlet and outlet pressure of the pumps therefore the energy consumption of circulating pumps ep kwh can be calculated by using eq 8 kim et al 2018 8 e p 1 3 6 10 6 i 1 3 q f δ p f η f q p δ p p η p t n where ηf and ηp are the efficiency of the feed and permeate pump qf and qp are the circulating flow m3 h 1 of the feed circulation system and permeate circulation system respectively and δpf and δpp are the pressure difference pa between the inlet and outlet of the module in the feed and permeate side respectively the specific energy consumption of the md system secmd kwh m 3 lfl was calculated by using eq 9 as follows 9 s e c m d e h e c e p v p therefore the total specific energy consumption of different coupling processes sectot kwh m 3 lfl was calculated according to eq 10 10 s e c t o t s e c m e r e o s e c m d for practical application recovering the waste heat from the waste incineration plant is an indispensable choice for lel treatment by md yan et al 2021 therefore the actual specific energy secactual kwh m 3 lfl could be calculated by subtracting the waste heat from sectot by using eq 11 11 s e c a c t u a l s e c t o t v l f l q r v l f l where vlfl is the lfl output of hongmiaoling comprehensive treatment plant m3 d 1 and qr is the recoverable waste heat from incinerator kwh d 1 2 3 3 carbon emission estimate the direct carbon emissions scedirect kg carbon dioxide equivalent co2e m 3 lfl and indirect carbon emissions sceindirect kg co2e m 3 lfl from 1 m3 of lfl treated by the system were calculated by using eqs 12 and 13 respectively 12 s c e d i r e c t α δ c c o d β c a m m o n i a 13 s c e i n d i r e c t γ s e c a c t u a l s e c a m m o n i a where δccod is the codcr concentration change before and after pretreatment kg m 3 and α β and γ are the carbon emission coefficients of oxidized codcr coal fired power generation and the haber bosch process of ammonia production with coal as the feedstock respectively and their values correspond to 10 52 9 44 32 kg co2e kg 1 codcr zhang et al 2022 3 8 kg co2e kg 1 ammonia giddey et al 2017 and 0 99 kg co2e kwh 1 zhang et al 2022 respectively secammonia is the energy consumption offset by ammonia nitrogen recovery kwh m 3 lfl and can be calculated by using eq 14 14 s e c a m m o n i a 17 14 c a m m o n i a e a m m o n i a where cammonia is the concentration of recovered ammonia nitrogen kg m 3 lfl eammonia is energy consumption required for ammonia production kwh kg 1 ammonia and take the energy consumption of ammonia production by the haber bosch process with coal as the feedstock 10 6 kwh kg 1 ammonia was used for calculation giddey et al 2017 therefore the actual carbon emissions scetotal kg co2e m 3 lfl per m3 of lfl treated by the system were calculated by using eq 15 15 s c e a c t u a l s c e d i r e c t s c e i n d i r e c t 2 4 analytical methods the details of the analytical methods including methods for water properties membrane characterization and ha recovery are presented in section s3 briefly ph metal ions and cl were measured using a ph meter phs 3c shanghai china inductively coupled plasma icp optima 8000 perkinelmer usa spectroscopy and ion chromatograph sh ac 11 qingdao shine chromatography technology co ltd china respectively morphology and elements of membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem thermo fisher scientific verios

device respectively ha was recovered by centrifugation tdl 5 a shanghai china and 1 5 µm filter membrane nylon membrane haining china suction filtration 3 results and discussion 3 1 mer eo performance in lfl pre treatment 3 1 1 organics removal recovery the variation of the organic removal efficiency during the mer and eo treatment is shown in fig 2 a the organic concentration denoted with codcr and uv254 absorbance at 254 nm wavelength continuously decreases during the treatment of mer and eo the main oxidants in the eo process are usually hydroxyl radicals oh and active chlorine chen et al 2021 the oxidation of organic matter by oh was verified with tert butanol t buoh quenching experiment the addition of 50 mmol l 1 t buoh led to significant decrease in uv254 removal of mer and eo processes and a more obvious quenching effect was observed in mer shown in fig s4 a the higher decrease of the removal after quenching may be attributed to producing more oh in mer or acidic cathode conditions of mer that reduce the loss of oh fig s4 b illustrates that the chlorine ions decreased in both mer and eo processes and the degree of decrease in mer was higher than that in eo which was possibly due to the fact that the lower ph was conducive to the chlorination reaction the generated aqueous chlorine subsequently reacted to produce reactive chlorine species to oxidize organic matter and gaseous chlorine is dissipated through the air martinez huitle et al 2015 moreover the loss of gaseous chlorine reached its maximum when the ph was below 2 which may explain the rapid decrease of chloride ions in mer at 6 8 h martinez huitle et al 2015 differently faster decrease was observed in the mer system after 8 h of treatment the removal rates of codcr and uv254 were about 77 2 and 62 8 for the mer system and 53 1 and 28 8 for the eo system respectively the higher removal efficiency of organics in the mer was attributed to the separation of the proton exchange membrane pem inducing an acidic condition in the anode chamber owing to the low oxygen evolution overpotential of the platinum plated titanium pt ti electrode some oh radicals react with each other to generate oxygen which consumes some oh and reduces the current efficiency guo et al 2022 li et al 2005 the acidic conditions can increase the oxygen evolution overpotential leading to a decrease in the probability of oh oxygen evolution side reactions martinez huitle et al 2015 furthermore the possible reaction of the mer and eo electrolyte is presented in section s4 for mer electrooxidation led to the production of protons which then accumulated in the anolyte eventually leading to the decrease in the ph of the anolyte ph to below 2 0 fig 2 b the continuous decrease of ph in the mer anolyte resulted in the continuous transfer of chlorine species to hclo and cl2 differently the ph of the eo electrolyte remained relatively constant at around 8 6 due to the relative equilibrium of the generated protons and hydroxides yang et al 2019 therefore the main active chlorine species in the slightly alkaline eo electrolyte included clo notably standard reduction potentials of hclo and cl2 are higher than that of clo therefore mer was expected to undergo a stronger chlorine mediated oxidation reaction leading to mer with higher codcr and uv254 removal rates liu et al 2019 moreover the ha of the lfl in the mer precipitated due to the decrease of ph to below 2 0 by the anode reaction which reduced the consumption of free radicals thereby promoting the oxidative capacity of the mer aeschbacher et al 2012 the organic removal performance after pretreatment for 8 h was further characterized by eem fluorescence fig 2 e exhibits that raw lfl contains four main fluorescence matters i e tyrosine like matter fulvic acid like matter tryptophan like matter and ha like matter represented by peak i ex em 225 340 peak ii ex em 245 460 peak iii ex em 280 340 and peak iv ex em 330 430 respectively yu et al 2020 fig 2 f still shows the existence of four intact peaks in the lfl after 8 h of eo treatment and their peak intensities only decreased only slightly which corresponded to codcr and uv254 removal rate of only 53 1 and 28 8 respectively for mer the four fluorescent peaks all decreased by at least one order of magnitude in particular the peak iv had disappeared combined with the high removal of uv254 fig 2 a the change of spectrum might be due to the reduction of aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds which led to the decomposition of the original ha into low molecular organics in particular organic acids alcohols and aldehydes and even direct mineralization chen et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 moreover the precipitation of ha was also the reason for the disappearance of peak iv the recovered ha from the lfl after mer treatment and addition h2so4 was 50 00 4 6 mg l 1 and 104 86 9 5 mg l 1 respectively therefore about 47 68 of ha in the lfl was recovered in mer the unrecovered ha could be attributed to the oxidation in the mer 3 1 2 hardness removal deposition of calcium and magnesium related scaling on the membrane is one of the major concerns in the md process kim et al 2020 fig 2 c illustrates that after 8 h of mer treatment the ca2 and mg2 in lfl anolyte were removed by 61 1 and 60 9 respectively the concentrations decreased from 216 5 8 and 110 4 9 to 84 6 7 and 43 3 9 mg l 1 respectively comparable performance of ca2 was reported in cation exchange membrane electrolysis for nanofiltration concentrate softening with ca2 removed by 68 8 wang et al 2021 under the action of electric field cations transferred to the cathode chamber of mer and reacted with oh and so4 2 with the detection of 47 7 0 and 21 2 9 mg l 1 of ca2 and mg2 in the catholyte respectively a white precipitate was observed in the catholyte which is highly attributed to the precipitates of mg oh 2 ca oh 2 and caso4 the ca2 and mg2 were also removed by eo treatment 55 9 and 23 4 however the removal of mg2 was significantly lower 3 1 3 ammonia nitrogen removal and recovery after 8 h of treatment the ammonia concentrations in the eo electrolyte decreased from 1597 145 to 1009 24 mg l 1 respectively corresponding to removal efficiencies of 36 8 shown in fig 2 d for mer treatment the concentration significantly decreased to 316 207 mg l 1 removal efficiencies of 80 2 the removal of ammonia nitrogen in the eo is mainly occurred by direct oxidation via stepwise dehydrogenation at the electrode liquid interface of the anode and the oxidation rate was determined by the electron loss ability of cl at the anode li and liu 2009 for mer the acidic condition of the mer anode chamber leads to the enhancement in the oxidation ability and the recovery of the ammonia nitrogen into cathode chamber is the other reason for its higher removal efficiency the ammonia nitrogen concentration detected in the mer cathode chamber reached 498 65 mg l 1 representing a recovery efficiency of 31 2 therefore the rest of ammonia nitrogen 783 mg l 1 was oxidized or volatilized in the catholyte due to the high ph condition noteworthy the recovery might be underestimated because the mer was operated in the batch experiment and part of ammonia nitrogen might have dispersed in the environment due to the high ph condition the hydrogen evolution reaction occurred in the cathode and resulted in rapid increase in the ph to above 12 5 shown in fig 2 b therefore the ammonia nitrogen existed in the form of nh3 99 95 calculated in section s5 which could be easily recovered via membrane contactor zhang et al 2018 a maximal recovery rate of 100 in a pilot scale membrane contactor was reported in recovering gaseous ammonia nitrogen from poultry waste rothrock et al 2013 therefore ammonia nitrogen enriched in the mer catholyte could be completely recovered with conditions optimization 3 2 dcmd performance in lfl treatment 3 2 1 membrane fouling the vapor flux development with concentration factor cf for three systems was exhibited in fig 3 a for all the systems the initial flux was around 20 37 21 87 lmh during the first cycle of the experiment the vapor flux of the md and eo md systems decreased drastically to 13 71 and 14 51 lmh at the cf of 4 61 with the pure water flux decreased 13 33 and 14 03 respectively fig 3 b comparatively the vapor flux decreased only to 18 50 lmh for the mer md system and the corresponding pure water flux did not decrease this could be attributed to the efficient removal of organic pollutants and inorganic salts in mer moreover compared to eo the separation of the pem in the mer induced a lower feed ph of lfl fig 2 b thus the supersaturation index of inorganic scaling was expected to be lower which mitigated the decline of membrane vapor flux yan et al 2019 fouling reversibility and membrane reusability after cleaning are also important performance criteria in particular for evaluating long term performance of membrane therefore three cyclic experiments were performed on the three systems after three cyclic experiments the md vapor fluxes of the md eo md and mer md systems decreased to 5 45 11 96 and 13 85 lmh respectively more importantly the pure water flux of the md system only was recovered to 58 and 70 by water flushing and alkaline solution respectively indicating the existence of severe membrane fouling moreover most of the membrane fouling is irreversible figs 3 b and s5 this may be due to the complex fouling of organics and inorganics which are hard to be removed by single acid or alkaline cleaning yan et al 2019 in contrast the pure water flux was recovered to 80 for the mer md and eo md systems after water flushing and the pure water flux was recovered to 100 and 84 by alkaline solution cleaning respectively indicating that the mer md system was superior in both reversible and irreversible fouling control while eo was not effective for irreversible fouling control the morphology and elemental composition of the fouled membrane after cleaning with the alkaline solution were characterized by sem coupled with eds fig 4 exhibits that for md and eo md systems a dense and homogeneous fouling layer was observed on the md membrane surface and the average thickness reached 6 91 and 6 81 µm respectively the fouling layer could be condensation caused by organic fouling and inorganic fouling involving ca mg and p which is reflected in the related elements c o p mg ca shown in the eds results table s2 and fig s6 the deposition of fouling layer on the membrane surface impeded the mass transfer moreover the fouling layer was expected to deteriorate the temperature polarization further impacting the membrane flux yan et al 2019 for the mer md system clearly visible pores were observed on surfaces of membrane and eds results showed that the element distribution was highly similar to that of the pristine membrane demonstrating that the mer process is an effective pretreatment method for retarding foulant deposition of ha aromatics and metal ions results of xrd characterization clearly indicate the deposition of caco3 deposited in fouled membrane of the md system shown in fig s7 other inorganic fouling was not characterized by xrd due to the low levels or interference of organic fouling the composition of the membrane surface foulants was further characterized by atr ftir spectroscopy fig 5 exhibits the presence of the characteristic peaks located at 1400 1170 876 and 839 cm 1 corresponding to c f2 deformation c f stretching c f stretching vibration and c f2 asymmetric stretching of pvdf pristine membrane respectively liu et al 2011 lu et al 2016 the intensity of these characteristic peaks decreased to varying degrees for the md membrane of the md and eo md systems which might have been caused by the fouling layer covering the membrane surface in particular the peak intensity at 1400 cm 1 did not decrease significantly this could be due to the deposition of ha like substances as indicated by the presence of absorption peaks at around 1400 cm 1 corresponding to the c o asymmetric stretching o h deformation and c o h deformation he et al 2011 the emerging peak at 2920 cm 1 corresponds to the aliphatic c h stretching masouleh et al 2022 the new peaks that appear at 3280 1630 and 1540 cm 1 are attributed to the n h stretching of amines and vibrations of amines i and ii respectively which are associated with the protein like compounds zarebska et al 2015 moreover a broad peak located at around 1030 cm 1 is observed for md system which may be related to the o h bending vibration of polysaccharides and si o si bonds indicating the presence of polysaccharides and silicates these compounds could lead to the formation of more complex and denser fouling layers which may be the reason why the method involving the cleaning of membrane with the alkaline solution of the md system did not show the effect of removing pollutants puligilla and mondal 2015 wang et al 2020 the number and intensity of the characteristic peaks of the fouled membrane of the mer md system were basically the same as those of the pvdf pristine membrane indicating that the membrane fouling was almost completely removed this result is consistent with the results of pure water flux and sem eds characterization 3 2 2 rejection efficiency the permeate of all md systems was limpid despite the lfl being dark brown shown in fig s8 the detailed rejection performance of different systems for various pollutants in lfl is presented in table 2 almost all the tp were removed with a rejection rate higher than 97 7 in all md experiments the rejection rate of codcr in the mer md system was higher than 97 3 indicating that most organic matters were rejected by md the codcr rejection rate of the md and eo md systems was lower with the lowest value of 93 3 the compromised rejection of organics might be attributed to the existence of certain amounts of volatile organics in lfl it was reported that the biodegradable organic matter enclosed in young landfill dump waste underwent rapid anaerobic fermentation processes resulting in the production of volatile fatty acids vfas in the lfl welander et al 1997 in this study part of lfl was not derived from the mature landfill which contained some vfas the stronger oxidative capacity of mer led to the removal of more vfas than eo which induced a higher efficiency toward codcr rejection except for ca2 the rejection rate of md for other metal ions was higher than 98 8 calcium exists in the form of cations or unstable complexes 0 45 µm in lfl oygard et al 2007 in particular ha can complex with ca2 to form stable complexes lubal et al 1998 in the md process trace amounts of ha substances could pass through the membrane pores to the permeate side amaya vías et al 2019 while the size of the complexes produced was just smaller than the pore size of the membranes 0 45 µm therefore it was speculated that its complexes with calcium might also together pass through the membrane pores which compromised the rejection rate of ca2 for ammonia nitrogen a satisfactory rejection was observed only in the mer md system 99 0 the ammonia nitrogen rejection rate of the md and eo md systems was only between 55 8 and 65 5 in an aqueous solution the proportion of nh4 and nh3 were directly related to aqueous ph and temperature and free ammonia got transformed into nh4 under acidic conditions the reaction is shown in eq 16 sun et al 2015 the prominent rejection of mer md was attributed to the mer pretreatment which removed 80 2 of ammonia nitrogen and further acidified the lfl to ph 1 8 almost no ammonia nitrogen was present as volatile nh3 0 01 at a feed solution temperature of 65 c and ph of 1 8 according to eqs s17 s18 therefore the remaining ammonia nitrogen can be almost completely rejected by md for the eo md system the ph remained constant during the eo process the slight increase of the rejection could be attributed to the oxidation of ammonia nitrogen in eo pretreatment removed by 36 8 ammonia nitrogen shown in fig 2 d 16 nh3 h2o nh4 oh 3 2 3 membrane wetting the wcas and leps of the pristine and md membrane after treatment are shown in fig 6 the wca of the pristine pvdf membrane was 120 13 4 4 due to its hydrophobicity in nature wang et al 2014 after three cycles of md treatment and alkaline solution cleaning the wcas of membranes decreased to 61 32 1 4 67 92 2 7 and 89 58 7 1 for the md eo md and mer md systems respectively the decrease in wca indicates a weakened surface hydrophobicity which is attributed to the hydrophilicity of inorganic scaling that is difficult to remove by alkaline solution chang et al 2021 besides severe fouling deposition affects the surface roughness zhang et al 2016 and wetting resistance goh et al 2013 of hydrophobic membrane notably the mer pretreatment could alleviate the inorganic and organic scaling in the subsequent md process a higher wca value was maintained the pristine membrane lep value was 164 0 7 9 kpa after three cycles of md treatment and alkaline solution cleaning the leps decreased to 126 3 14 130 7 5 0 and 149 3 7 1 kpa respectively corresponding to the md eo md and mer md systems therefore the membrane fouling reduces the hydrophobicity and wetting resistance of the membrane shi et al 2022 compared with the operating pressure on the feed side 4 kpa the lep was obviously higher indicating that substantial membrane wetting did not occur under three cycles of md operation the most common method for detecting wetting in md involves the measuring of distillate conductivity horseman et al 2021 fig 7 shows that the final permeate conductivities of three cycles for the md system are 3320 3356 and 3037 µs cm 1 respectively for the eo md system the increase in permeate conductivities was slightly suppressed with final conductivities of 2951 2539 and 2603 µs cm 1 in the three cycles test respectively the main reason for the increased conductivity of md permeate side could be attributed to the volatilization of ammonia nitrogen to the permeate kwon et al 2021 this could be partially verified in the mer md system the md permeate conductivity of three cycles slowly increased to 85 121 and 235 µs cm 1 using the mer as the pretreatment process respectively since more than 99 0 of ammonia nitrogen was removed in the mer md system therefore the trace amounts of ammonia nitrogen could only induce a slight increase in conductivity which indicating that no wetting of the membrane did not occur in order to eliminate the interference of ammonia in wetting detection the high sensitivity eem fluorescence analysis was employed to characterize the rejection performance of the membrane in general the peak value of the permeate was significantly lower than that of the raw lfl figs 2 e and 8 for the md system most of the fulvic acid and ha substances were rejected by md and tyrosine and tryptophan substances also decreased by two orders of magnitude compared to the raw lfl for eo md system compared with the electrolyte after eo pretreatment the four peaks of the first md cycle effluent were basically removed a slightly higher fluorescence intensity detected in the second cycle may be due to insufficient eo electrolysis the four characteristic peaks in the lfl electrolyte after eo pretreatment were all observed for the permeate of the third cycle of the eo md system which was possibly a precursor of local wetting due to the production of intermediates with low surface energy by eo after mer pretreatment the intensity of the four types of fluorescent substances decreased by at least two orders fig 2 f and the intensity further decreased by at least two orders of magnitude after md treatment thus confirming the unwetted state of the membrane 3 3 energy consumption and application perspective for lfl treatment to achieve carbon reduction the specific energy consumption sec of the three systems is shown in fig 9 a owing to the presence of the pem between the two electrodes and the lower conductivity of the catholyte than that of lfl 2 89 vs 20 6 ms cm 1 the voltage of mer was required to be higher to maintain the same operating current density therefore the pretreatment sec of mer md was slightly higher than eo md however secmer eo occupied less than 2 of the entire system the membrane fouling was effectively alleviated by mer eo pretreatment thus the higher membrane flux led to the higher efficiency of md therefore the mer md system showed the lowest sectot 1783 18 kwh m 3 lfl while that of eo md and md systems were 2029 15 and 2195 49 kwh m 3 lfl respectively by taking the advantage of ability of low grade heat utilization recovery of the waste heat for md is an attractive option to reduce the energy consumption due to the common generation of waste heat in incineration power plant yan et al 2021 therefore based on the waste heat evaluation of the hongmiaoling comprehensive treatment plant the actual energy consumption values of the mer md eo md and md systems were found to be 1685 59 1931 57 and 2097 90 kwh m 3 lfl after offsetting part of the energy consumption through waste heat recovery moreover noteworthy the energy evaluation was based on a single stage dcmd in laboratory scale which gained output ratio gor lower than 1 for practical application multi stage air gap membrane distillation agmd with a typical gor of 3 6 could be applied to significantly reduce the energy consumption in our previous estimation the waste heat recovered from the incinerator was sufficient to drive the lfl on site treatment using the agmd system yan et al 2021 therefore for the mer md system the actual energy consumption was only 231 85 kwh m 3 with assumption that the heat energy could be fully supplied by waste heat this part of the energy consumption is mainly caused by md cooling the application of the membrane process commonly gets denounced with the high carbon emissions due to the high energy consumption moreover high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and ha present in lfl could be recovered to offset the energy consumption the ammonia nitrogen recovered from the mer cathode could offset the energy consumption of 6 42 kwh m 3 lfl by replacing the haber bosch process for ammonia production ha could be used as organic fertilizer to replace nitrogen fertilizer which could increase the yield of millet and reduce the consumption of nitrogen fertilizer zhai et al 2022 owing to the minute effect of ha recovery in carbon emission shown in section s8 the value was not counted here the actual carbon emissions of the md system was 2076 92 kg co2e m 3 lfl in the treatment after recovery of waste heat from the incinerator fig 9 b the actual carbon emissions of eo md decreased by 164 kg co2e m 3 lfl for the mer md system the actual carbon emissions of it were reduced by 20 but it still needs to emit 1660 73 kg co2e m 3 lfl after counting the reduction in the recovery of ammonia nitrogen most part of carbon emissions was mainly indirect carbon emissions resulting from insufficient heat from incineration to fully supply the heat energy required by dcmd and this could be reduced by replaced with other md systems a systematic comparison of the proposed technology with conventional treatments biological treatments chemical treatments physical treatments and two state of the art lfl treatment processes including principle advantages defects cod removal ammonia nitrogen removal energy consumption and costs is presented in table s3 the mer md has superiority in organic rejection performance over other treatment processes both mer md and sequential electrochemical peroxidation electro fenton process have satisfactory ammonia nitrogen removal rates 99 mer md technology offers advantages in terms of treatment efficiency chemical use and resources recovery however both the state of the art lfl treatment processes and mer md process need higher energy consumption cost it should be noted that the energy of md was based on the bench scale experiment with a single stage of md without considering of heat recovery which inevitably induced severe energy consumption significant savings are expected when using a low grade thermal energy source which will endow md outperformed performance in water production without consuming large amounts of electrical or high grade thermal energy alobaidani et al 2008 deshmukh et al 2018 the cost of pilot scale eo and md in wastewater treatment is around 0 56 0 85 m 3 cui et al 2017 ramesh et al 2021 and 5 65 12 48 m 3 choi et al 2022 eykens et al 2018 respectively since the membrane fouling of md in the mer md system is well controlled and highly reversible the cost for operation would be further reduced by optimizing process conditions and construction nonetheless some challenges still need to be further addressed first harmful cl2 and by products such as absorbable organic halogen are produced by mer recirculation of hydrogen from the cathode chamber to the anode chamber may be a viable solution to prevent the formation of harmful substances kuntke et al 2017 but this may reduce the oxidation performance second the concentrate produced by md was difficult to treat therefore throwing it into the incinerator or refluxing it in the mer anode chamber for treatment might be a feasible option that needs to be systematically investigated finally the mer electrolysis process produces intermediates with different properties such as low surface energy alcohols phenols etc which may have negative effect on the md process the electrode materials with higher oxygen evolution overpotential could be replaced to make the pollutants more fully oxidized dominguez et al 2018 therefore various works need to be further conducted to promote the application of the mer md process 4 conclusions in this study successful integration of mer with md was investigated for lfl treatment mer as a pretreatment system for of md exhibits the comprehensive advantages including delayed membrane fouling enhancement of membrane wetting resistance and improvement of ammonia nitrogen rejection based on the results the main conclusions are as follows 1 compared with the eo reactor the removal rates of mer for codcr uv254 ca2 mg2 and ammonia nitrogen increased by 24 1 34 0 5 2 37 5 and 43 4 respectively under the same current intensity moreover 31 2 and 47 7 of ammonia and ha in lfl were recovered respectively 2 mer treatment reduced the concentration of ca2 mg2 and organic matter to avoid the formation of dense organic inorganic fouling layers therefore use of mer led to significant increase in the membrane fouling resistance and fouling reversibility of md in the lfl treatment while maintaining a 67 2 of membrane vapor flux after three cycles operation and a fully recovered flux after alkaline solution cleaning 3 the mer md system could efficiently remove pollutants in lfl with the rejection rates of codcr tp ammonia and metal ions higher than 97 3 99 5 99 0 and 96 0 respectively furthermore the mer md system exhibited the highest resistance to wetting of membranes sustainably producing high quality water 4 the integration of mer to md decreased the total energy consumption from 2195 49 to 1783 18 kwh m 3 lfl although the treatment of lfl with mer md system still caused 1660 73 kg co2e m 3 lfl due to the high thermal energy consumption of md

15151,treatment of recalcitrant landfill leachate lfl induces huge energy consumption and carbon emissions due to its complex composition although membrane distillation md exhibits good potential in lfl treatment with waste heat utilization membrane fouling and ammonia rejection are still the major problems encountered that hinder its application herein membrane electrochemical reactor mer was coupled with md for simultaneous membrane fouling control and resource recovery lfl pretreatment with membrane less electrochemical reactor eo and without pretreatment were also purified by md for comparison results showed that the mer md system rejected almost all codcr total phosphorus metal salts and ammonia nitrogen increased by 33 5 43 5 without chemical addition and recovered 31 of ammonia nitrogen and 48 of humic acid in the raw lfl owing to the effective removal of hardness 61 and organics 77 using mer the mer md system showed higher resistance to the membrane wetting and fouling with about 61 and 14 higher final vapor flux than those of the md and eo md systems respectively and the pure water flux could be fully recovered by alkaline solution cleaning moreover sem eds atr ftir and xrd characterization further demonstrated the superiority of the md membrane fouling reversibility of the mer md system energy consumption and carbon emissions analysis showed that the mer md system reduced the total energy consumption carbon emissions by 20 and 8 compared to the md and eo md systems respectively and the ammonia nitrogen recovered by mer could offset 8 25 kg carbon dioxide equivalent therefore the introduction of mer pretreatment in md process would be an option to decrease energy consumption and reduce carbon emissions for md treatment of lfl graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation landfill leachate membrane electrochemical reactor carbon emission data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sanitary landfill is one of the most efficient and cost effective system that is widely applied to deal with municipal solid waste in many countries moreira et al 2015 nevertheless a large volume of recalcitrant and highly toxic landfill leachate lfl is produced through rainwater seeping and various physical chemical and biological reactions iskander et al 2016 jia et al 2022 wiszniowski et al 2006 lfl contains high concentrations of various organic compounds humic acid ha compounds etc heavy metals iron copper chromium etc and macro inorganic compounds mg2 ca2 cl na hco3 nh4 etc yao 2017 without proper treatment lfl may get mixed with surface water or seep into groundwater resulting in contamination of surface water groundwater and soil guo et al 2022 causing severe environmental pollution and health hazards to humans currently biological wastewater treatment involving the action of microorganisms is universally applied for lfl treatment due to its simple and facile treatment process and economic convenience iskander et al 2018 however sole biological treatment is inefficient in removing the refractory organic matter and high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen present in lfl which leads to water environment problems such as water eutrophication wang et al 2018 therefore physical chemical methods are generally introduced to improve treatment capacity and efficiency noteworthy both the fenton process and membrane technology have been proven to be effective and stable methods for lfl treatment wiszniowski et al 2006 yao 2017 however fenton process consumes large quantity of acid and produces tremendous amount of considerable sludge liu et al 2020 and conventional membrane technology suffers from application bottlenecks such as membrane fouling high energy consumption and production of large amounts of concentrate singh et al 2014 moreover the disposal of by products further leads to the increase in energy consumption and carbon emissions as an emerging low temperature distillation technology membrane distillation md offers significant potential in lfl treatment due to the high rejection performance and ability to utilize low grade waste heat utilization parani and oluwafemi 2021 jia et al 2022 applied direct contact membrane distillation dcmd to treat lfl reverse osmosis concentrate brine and 80 water recovery was achieved in our recent study in the lfl treatment via md technique rejections of total organic carbon toc phosphate and metal ions were all higher than 98 93 yan et al 2021 however the rejection of ammonia by md was not satisfactory 46 and the deposition of ha substances and the scaling of calcium and magnesium related inorganic substances could lead to serious membrane fouling resulting in the reduction in the membrane flux by half after the operation yan et al 2022 membrane fouling in md not only leads to significantly increased operation cost but also increases the risk of membrane wetting eventually resulting in the direct failure of md process chang et al 2021 shi et al 2022 till date electrochemical techniques have attracted significant research attention for membrane pretreatment in wastewater treatment process by coupling electrochemical oxidation eo the organic fouling of md in lfl treatment was reported to be effectively alleviated chen et al 2021 when eo and md were combined for the sulfate based electrolytes sulfate radical was in situ yielded which prevented membrane fouling shin et al 2020 although the organics and ammonia could be oxidized by eo the fouling caused by inorganics scaling in the lfl was not satisfactory and dosing scale inhibitors were required with the further introduction of electrocoagulation ec process in eo md membrane scaling could be controlled because the hardness due to ca2 and mg2 ions could be removed by the pretreatment chen et al 2022 however the energy consumption was found to be heavy for both the ec process and eo in the lfl treatment with high concentration foulants so far main target of applying electrochemical pretreatments in md process is the removal of pollutants from lfl as the main target which inevitably consumes huge amount of chemicals and energy however in the context of carbon neutrality it is more desirable to recycle potential resources in lfl treatment with lower chemical and energy consumption and decreased carbon emissions in the electrochemical process hydroxyl ions oh and hydrogen ions proton h are produced at cathode and anode respectively sanju et al 2019 the mixture of oh and h in electrochemical process significantly compromises wastewater softening at the cathode by the introduction of ion selective membranes into the electrochemical system a low ph anolyte and a high ph catholyte could be simultaneously achieved in the membrane electrochemical reactor mer liu et al 2019 furthermore notably for lfl treatment the high ph condition in the catholyte is helpful for the stripping of high concentration ammonia nitrogen and water softening in contrast the low ph condition in the anolyte is helpful for scaling inhabitation and ha recovery ye et al 2019 therefore mer could be considered as a chemical free pretreatment for feed ph conditioning and providing nutrient recovery conditions in lfl treatment in this study an innovative process was developed by integrating mer and md mer md system for lel treatment to improve the md rejection and to reduce energy consumption carbon emissions through resource recovery and mitigation of membrane fouling wetting three cyclic experiments were conducted to explore the reversibility of membrane fouling in the mer md system as an effective approach to assess its potential for long term operation practical application potential was further assessed based on energy consumption and carbon emission calculations for comparative analysis no pretreatment md system and membrane less electrochemical oxidation system pretreatment eo md system were also conducted 2 materials and methods 2 1 lfl sample the lfl was fetched from hongmiaoling comprehensive treatment plant fuzhou fujian the comprehensive treatment plant has two landfills and a waste incineration power plant and their lfl were blended to obtain the research sample detailed characteristics of lfl are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental procedures self constructed laboratory scale mer eo and dcmd experimental device systems were adopted in the experiments detailed information about the construction of mer eo and dcmd system and operating conditions are illustrated in sections s1 and s2 of supplementary information respectively three experiments case a c were performed for comparative analysis and the schematic illustration is presented in fig 1 in case a dcmd was directly applied for lfl treatment as the control group in case b eo pretreatment was adopted which was followed by the treatment of the effluent by dcmd process in case c the lfl was fed into the anode chamber of mer for pretreatment and na2so4 solution 15 mmol l 1 was added to the cathode chamber as catholyte mer was operated for 8 h until the ph of lfl decreased to less than 2 to precipitate ha as a control the eo of case b was also operated for 8 h the lfl after mer or eo treatment was added to the feed tank of the md for further treatment in all systems md operation was ended when 400 ml of water was produced all groups were subjected to three cycle of experiments and the membrane was flushed with pure water for 30 min after each cyclic experiment for membrane cleaning and evaluating the membrane fouling then the md membranes were air dried and reinstalled into the dcmd module to proceed the next cycle test with either raw lfl or pretreated lfl after the three cycles of experiments the md membrane was immersed in naoh solution 20 0 ml ph 12 for 30 min to remove the pollutants present on the membrane surface 2 3 performance evaluation methods 2 3 1 calculation of rejection performance the rejection performance of the system was evaluated by using the removal rate r based on the mass percentage of fouling intercepted as shown in eq 1 1 r 1 c p v p c r v f 100 where cp and vp are the pollutant concentration mg l 1 and volume l of permeate respectively and cf and vf are the pollutant concentration mg l 1 and volume l of the feed respectively 2 3 2 calculation of energy consumption to simplify the operation energy calculation the following assumptions were adopted kim et al 2018 yan et al 2019 1 the heat loss due to module conduction to the environment is negligible 2 the energy required for the magnetic stirring of the pre treatment is minute 3 the pressure drops through the pipes are negligible 4 the specific heat capacities of the feed and permeate remain constant and the specific heat capacity equals that of pure water energy consumption analysis was based on the laboratory scale installations the energy demand for md is associated with feed heating permeate cooling and circulation pumps and the energy demand for mer eo is only the electrical energy of dc power the energy consumption of the mer and eo was calculated by recording the power supply voltage during operation the specific energy consumption of mer eo reactor secmer eo kwh m 3 lfl was calculated by using eq 2 kaur et al 2019 as follows 2 s e c m e r e o u i t 1000 v p where u is the average hourly supply voltage v i is the current a t is the operating time h and vp is the volume of lfl for pretreatment m3 the heating power is calculated based on the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the feed side of the md membrane module therefore the md heating power qh n kw for the nth cycle n from 1 to 3 was calculated by using eq 3 yan et al 2021 as follows 3 q h n 1 1000 c f m f t f i n t f o u t where cf is the feed specific heat j kg c 1 mf is the pumping feed mass flow rate kg s 1 and tf in and tf out are the inlet and outlet temperatures c in the feed side respectively the heating energy consumption eh kwh during the three cycles of the three groups of experiments was calculated by using eq 4 4 e h 1 η e i 1 3 q h n t n where tn is md operating time for the nth cycle h and ηe is the heating efficiency the cooling power is calculated based on the temperature difference between the outlet and inlet of the permeate side of the md membrane module therefore the md cooling power qc n kw for the nth cycle n from 1 to 3 was calculated by using eq 5 yan et al 2021 5 q c n 1 1000 c p m p t p o u t t p i n where cp is the permeate specific heat j kg c 1 mp is the pumping feed mass flow rate kg s 1 and tp in and tp out are the inlet and outlet temperatures c in the permeate side respectively the required input power is calculated based on the cooling coefficient cop and the cooling power therefore the actual input power pc is calculated by using eq 6 6 p c q c c o p where cop is the cooling coefficient according to the cooling temperature and environmental temperature the value of cop was taken to be 5 5 for calculation attia 2010 therefore the cooling energy consumption ec kwh during the three cycles of the three groups of experiments was calculated by using eq 7 7 e c i 1 3 p c n t n the energy consumption of the circulation pumps is calculated based on the difference between the inlet and outlet pressure of the pumps therefore the energy consumption of circulating pumps ep kwh can be calculated by using eq 8 kim et al 2018 8 e p 1 3 6 10 6 i 1 3 q f δ p f η f q p δ p p η p t n where ηf and ηp are the efficiency of the feed and permeate pump qf and qp are the circulating flow m3 h 1 of the feed circulation system and permeate circulation system respectively and δpf and δpp are the pressure difference pa between the inlet and outlet of the module in the feed and permeate side respectively the specific energy consumption of the md system secmd kwh m 3 lfl was calculated by using eq 9 as follows 9 s e c m d e h e c e p v p therefore the total specific energy consumption of different coupling processes sectot kwh m 3 lfl was calculated according to eq 10 10 s e c t o t s e c m e r e o s e c m d for practical application recovering the waste heat from the waste incineration plant is an indispensable choice for lel treatment by md yan et al 2021 therefore the actual specific energy secactual kwh m 3 lfl could be calculated by subtracting the waste heat from sectot by using eq 11 11 s e c a c t u a l s e c t o t v l f l q r v l f l where vlfl is the lfl

t α δ c c o d β c a m m o n i a 13 s c e i n d i r e c t γ s e c a c t u a l s e c a m m o n i a where δccod is the codcr concentration change before and after pretreatment kg m 3 and α β and γ are the carbon emission coefficients of oxidized codcr coal fired power generation and the haber bosch process of ammonia production with coal as the feedstock respectively and their values correspond to

in lfl pre treatment 3 1 1 organics removal recovery the variation of the organic removal efficiency during the mer and eo treatment is shown in fig 2 a the organic concentration denoted with codcr and uv254 absorbance at 254 nm wavelength continuously decreases during the treatment of mer and eo the main oxidants in the eo process are usually hydroxyl radicals oh and active chlorine chen et al 2021 the oxidation of organic matter by oh was verified with tert butanol t buoh quenching experiment the addition of 50 mmol l 1 t buoh led to significant decrease in uv254 removal of mer and eo processes and a more obvious quenching effect was observed in mer shown in fig s4 a the higher decrease of the removal after quenching may be attributed to producing more oh in mer or acidic cathode conditions of mer that reduce the loss of oh fig s4 b illustrates that the chlorine ions decreased in both mer and eo processes and the degree of decrease in mer was higher than that in eo which was possibly due to the fact that the lower ph was conducive to the chlorination reaction the generated aqueous chlorine subsequently reacted to produce reactive chlorine species to oxidize organic matter and gaseous chlorine is dissipated through the air martinez huitle et al 2015 moreover the loss of gaseous chlorine reached its maximum when the ph was below 2 which may explain the rapid decrease of chloride ions in mer at 6 8 h martinez huitle et al 2015 differently faster decrease was observed in the mer system after 8 h of treatment the removal rates of codcr and uv254 were about 77 2 and 62 8 for the mer system and 53 1 and 28 8 for the eo system respectively the higher removal efficiency of organics in the mer was attributed to the separation of the proton exchange membrane pem inducing an acidic condition in the anode chamber owing to the low oxygen evolution overpotential of the platinum plated titanium pt ti electrode some oh radicals react with each other to generate oxygen which consumes some oh and reduces the current efficiency guo et al 2022 li et al 2005 the acidic conditions can increase the oxygen evolution overpotential leading to a decrease in the probability of oh oxygen evolution side reactions martinez huitle et al 2015 furthermore the possible reaction of the mer and eo electrolyte is presented in section s4 for mer electrooxidation led to the production of protons which then accumulated in the anolyte eventually leading to the decrease in the ph of the anolyte ph to below 2 0 fig 2 b the continuous decrease of ph in the mer anolyte resulted in the continuous transfer of chlorine species to hclo and cl2 differently the ph of the eo electrolyte remained relatively constant at around 8 6 due to the relative equilibrium of the generated protons and hydroxides yang et al 2019 therefore the main active chlorine species in the slightly alkaline eo electrolyte included clo notably standard reduction potentials of hclo and cl2 are higher than that of clo therefore mer was expected to undergo a stronger chlorine mediated oxidation reaction leading to mer with higher codcr and uv254 removal rates liu et al 2019 moreover the ha of the lfl in the mer precipitated due to the decrease of ph to below 2 0 by the anode reaction which reduced the consumption of free radicals thereby promoting the oxidative capacity of the mer aeschbacher et al 2012 the organic removal performance after pretreatment for 8 h was further characterized by eem fluorescence fig 2 e exhibits that raw lfl contains four main fluorescence matters i e tyrosine like matter fulvic acid like matter tryptophan like matter and ha like matter represented by peak i ex em 225 340 peak ii ex em 245 460 peak iii ex em 280 340 and peak iv ex em 330 430 respectively yu et al 2020 fig 2 f still shows the existence of four intact peaks in the lfl after 8 h of eo treatment and their peak intensities only decreased only slightly which corresponded to codcr and uv254 removal rate of only 53 1 and 28 8 respectively for mer the four fluorescent peaks all decreased by at least one order of magnitude in particular the peak iv had disappeared combined with the high removal of uv254 fig 2 a the change of spectrum might be due to the reduction of aromatic rings and conjugated double bonds which led to the decomposition of the original ha into low molecular organics in particular organic acids alcohols and aldehydes and even direct mineralization chen et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 moreover the precipitation of ha was also the reason for the disappearance of peak iv the recovered ha from the lfl after mer treatment and addition h2so4 was 50 00 4 6 mg l 1 and 104 86 9 5 mg l 1 respectively therefore about 47 68 of ha in the lfl was recovered in mer the unrecovered ha could be attributed to the oxidation in the mer 3 1 2 hardness removal deposition of calcium and magnesium related scaling on the membrane is one of the major concerns in the md process kim et al 2020 fig 2 c illustrates that after 8 h of mer treatment the ca2 and mg2 in lfl anolyte were removed by 61 1 and 60 9 respectively the concentrations decreased from 216 5 8 and 110 4 9 to 84 6 7 and 43 3 9 mg l 1 respectively comparable performance of ca2 was reported in cation exchange membrane electrolysis for nanofiltration concentrate softening with ca2 removed by 68 8 wang et al 2021 under the action of electric field cations transferred to the cathode chamber of mer and reacted with oh and so4 2 with the detection of 47 7 0 and 21 2 9 mg l 1 of ca2 and mg2 in the catholyte respectively a white precipitate was observed in the catholyte which is highly attributed to the precipitates of mg oh 2 ca oh 2 and caso4 the ca2 and mg2 were also removed by eo treatment 55 9 and 23 4 however the removal of mg2 was significantly lower 3 1 3 ammonia nitrogen removal and recovery after 8 h of treatment the ammonia concentrations in the eo electrolyte decreased from 1597 145 to 1009 24 mg l 1 respectively corresponding to removal efficiencies of 36 8 shown in fig 2 d for mer treatment the concentration significantly decreased to 316 207 mg l 1 removal efficiencies of 80 2 the removal of ammonia nitrogen in the eo is mainly occurred by direct oxidation via stepwise dehydrogenation at the electrode liquid interface of the anode and the oxidation rate was determined by the electron loss ability of cl at the anode li and liu 2009 for mer the acidic condition of the mer anode chamber leads to the enhancement in the oxidation ability and the recovery of the ammonia nitrogen into cathode chamber is the other reason for its higher removal efficiency the ammonia nitrogen concentration detected in the mer cathode chamber reached 498 65 mg l 1 representing a recovery efficiency of 31 2 therefore the rest of ammonia nitrogen 783 mg l 1 was oxidized or volatilized in the catholyte due to the high ph condition noteworthy the recovery might be underestimated because the mer was operated in the batch experiment and part of ammonia nitrogen might have dispersed in the environment due to the high ph condition the hydrogen evolution reaction occurred in the cathode and resulted in rapid increase in the ph to above 12 5 shown in fig 2 b therefore the ammonia nitrogen existed in the form of nh3 99 95 calculated in section s5 which could be easily recovered via membrane contactor zhang et al 2018 a maximal recovery rate of 100 in a pilot scale membrane contactor was reported in recovering gaseous ammonia nitrogen from poultry waste rothrock et al 2013 therefore ammonia nitrogen enriched in the mer catholyte could be completely recovered with conditions optimization 3 2 dcmd performance in lfl treatment 3 2 1 membrane fouling the vapor flux development with concentration factor cf for three systems was exhibited in fig 3 a for all the systems the initial flux was around 20 37 21 87 lmh during the first cycle of the experiment the vapor flux of the md and eo md systems decreased drastically to 13 71 and 14 51 lmh at the cf of 4 61 with the pure water flux decreased 13 33 and 14 03 respectively fig 3 b comparatively the vapor flux decreased only to 18 50 lmh for the mer md system and the corresponding pure water flux did not decrease this could be attributed to the efficient removal of organic pollutants and inorganic salts in mer moreover compared to eo the separation of the pem in the mer induced a lower feed ph of lfl fig 2 b thus the supersaturation index of inorganic scaling was expected to be lower which mitigated the decline of membrane vapor flux yan et al 2019 fouling reversibility and membrane reusability after cleaning are also important performance criteria in particular for evaluating long term performance of membrane therefore three cyclic experiments were performed on the three systems after three cyclic experiments the md vapor fluxes of the md eo md and mer md systems decreased to 5 45 11 96 and 13 85 lmh respectively more importantly the pure water flux of the md system only was recovered to 58 and 70 by water flushing and alkaline solution respectively indicating the existence of severe membrane fouling moreover most of the membrane fouling is irreversible figs 3 b and s5 this may be due to the complex fouling of organics and inorganics which are hard to be removed by single acid or alkaline cleaning yan et al 2019 in contrast the pure water flux was recovered to 80 for the mer md and eo md systems after water flushing and the pure water flux was recovered to 100 and 84 by alkaline solution cleaning respectively indicating that the mer md system was superior in both reversible and irreversible fouling control while eo was not effective for irreversible fouling control the morphology and elemental composition of the fouled membrane after cleaning with the alkaline solution were characterized by sem coupled with eds fig 4 exhibits that for md and eo md systems a dense and homogeneous fouling layer was observed on the md membrane surface and the average thickness reached 6 91 and 6 81 µm respectively the fouling layer could be condensation caused by organic fouling and inorganic fouling involving ca mg and p which is reflected in the related elements c o p mg ca shown in the eds results table s2 and fig s6 the deposition of fouling layer on the membrane surface impeded the mass transfer moreover the fouling layer was expected to deteriorate the temperature polarization further impacting the membrane flux yan et al 2019 for the mer md system clearly visible pores were observed on surfaces of membrane and eds results showed that the element distribution was highly similar to that of the pristine membrane demonstrating that the mer process is an effective pretreatment method for retarding foulant deposition of ha aromatics and metal ions results of xrd characterization clearly indicate the deposition of caco3 deposited in fouled membrane of the md system shown in fig s7 other inorganic fouling was not characterized by xrd due to the low levels or interference of organic fouling the composition of the membrane surface foulants was further characterized by atr ftir spectroscopy fig 5 exhibits the presence of the characteristic peaks located at 1400 1170 876 and 839 cm 1 corresponding to c f2 deformation c f stretching c f stretching vibration and c f2 asymmetric stretching of pvdf pristine membrane respectively liu et al 2011 lu et al 2016 the intensity of these characteristic peaks decreased to varying degrees for the md membrane of the md and eo md systems which might have been caused by the fouling layer covering the membrane surface in particular the peak intensity at 1400 cm 1 did not decrease significantly this could be due to the deposition of ha like substances as indicated by the presence of absorption peaks at around 1400 cm 1 corresponding to the c o asymmetric stretching o h deformation and c o h deformation he et al 2011 the emerging peak at 2920 cm 1 corresponds to the aliphatic c h stretching masouleh et al 2022 the new peaks that appear at 3280 1630 and 1540 cm 1 are attributed to the n h stretching of amines and vibrations of amines i and ii respectively which are associated with the protein like compounds zarebska et al 2015 moreover a broad peak located at around 1030 cm 1 is observed for md system which may be related to the o h bending vibration of polysaccharides and si o si bonds indicating the presence of polysaccharides and silicates these compounds could lead to the formation of more complex and denser fouling layers which may be the reason why the method involving the cleaning of membrane with the alkaline solution of the md system did not show the effect of removing pollutants puligilla and mondal 2015 wang et al 2020 the number and intensity of the characteristic peaks of the fouled membrane of the mer md system were basically the same as those of the pvdf pristine membrane indicating that the membrane fouling was almost completely removed this result is consistent with the results of pure water flux and sem eds characterization 3 2 2 rejection efficiency the permeate of all md systems was limpid despite the lfl being dark brown shown in fig s8 the detailed rejection performance of different systems for various pollutants in lfl is presented in table 2 almost all the tp were removed with a rejection rate higher than 97 7 in all md experiments the rejection rate of codcr in the mer md system was higher than 97 3 indicating that most organic matters were rejected by md the codcr rejection rate of the md and eo md systems was lower with the lowest value of 93 3 the compromised rejection of organics might be attributed to the existence of certain amounts of volatile organics in lfl it was reported that the biodegradable organic matter enclosed in young landfill dump waste underwent rapid anaerobic fermentation processes resulting in the production of volatile fatty acids vfas in the lfl welander et al 1997 in this study part of lfl was not derived from the mature landfill which contained some vfas the stronger oxidative capacity of mer led to the removal of more vfas than eo which induced a higher efficiency toward codcr rejection except for ca2 the rejection rate of md for other metal ions was higher than 98 8 calcium exists in the form of cations or unstable complexes 0 45 µm in lfl oygard et al 2007 in particular ha can complex with ca2 to form stable complexes lubal et al 1998 in the md process trace amounts of ha substances could pass through the membrane pores to the permeate side amaya vías et al 2019 while the size of the complexes produced was just smaller than the pore size of the membranes 0 45 µm therefore it was speculated that its complexes with calcium might also together pass through the membrane pores which compromised the rejection rate of ca2 for ammonia nitrogen a satisfactory rejection was observed only in the mer md system 99 0 the ammonia nitrogen rejection rate of the md and eo md systems was only between 55 8 and 65 5 in an aqueous solution the proportion of nh4 and nh3 were directly related to aqueous ph and temperature and free ammonia got transformed into nh4 under acidic conditions the reaction is shown in eq 16 sun et al 2015 the prominent rejection of mer md was attributed to the mer pretreatment which removed 80 2 of ammonia nitrogen and further acidified the lfl to ph 1 8 almost no ammonia nitrogen was present as volatile nh3 0 01 at a feed solution temperature of 65 c and ph of 1 8 according to eqs s17 s18 therefore the remaining ammonia nitrogen can be almost completely rejected by md for the eo md system the ph remained constant during the eo process the slight increase of the rejection could be attributed to the oxidation of ammonia nitrogen in eo pretreatment removed by 36 8 ammonia nitrogen shown in fig 2 d 16 nh3 h2o nh4 oh 3 2 3 membrane wetting the wcas and leps of the pristine and md membrane after treatment are shown in fig 6 the wca of the pristine pvdf membrane was 120 13 4 4 due to its hydrophobicity in nature wang et al 2014 after three cycles of md treatment and alkaline solution cleaning the wcas of membranes decreased to 61 32 1 4 67 92 2 7 and 89 58 7 1 for the md eo md and mer md systems respectively the decrease in wca indicates a weakened surface hydrophobicity which is attributed to the hydrophilicity of inorganic scaling that is difficult to remove by alkaline solution chang et al 2021 besides severe fouling deposition affects the surface roughness zhang et al 2016 and wetting resistance goh et al 2013 of hydrophobic membrane notably the mer pretreatment could alleviate the inorganic and organic scaling in the subsequent md process a higher wca value was maintained the pristine membrane lep value was 164 0 7 9 kpa after three cycles of md treatment and alkaline solution cleaning the leps decreased to 126 3 14 130 7 5 0 and 149 3 7 1 kpa respectively corresponding to the md eo md and mer md systems therefore the membrane fouling reduces the hydrophobicity and wetting resistance of the membrane shi et al 2022 compared with the operating pressure on the feed side 4 kpa the lep was obviously higher indicating that substantial membrane wetting did not occur under three cycles of md operation the most common method for detecting wetting in md involves the measuring of distillate conductivity horseman et al 2021 fig 7 shows that the final permeate conductivities of three cycles for the md system are 3320 3356 and 3037 µs cm 1 respectively for the eo md system the increase in permeate conductivities was slightly suppressed with final conductivities of 2951 2539 and 2603 µs cm 1 in the three cycles test respectively the main reason for the increased conductivity of md permeate side could be attributed to the volatilization of ammonia nitrogen to the permeate kwon et al 2021 this could be partially verified in the mer md system the md permeate conductivity of three cycles slowly increased to 85 121 and 235 µs cm 1 using the mer as the pretreatment process respectively since more than 99 0 of ammonia nitrogen was removed in the mer md system therefore the trace amounts of ammonia nitrogen could only induce a slight increase in conductivity which indicating that no wetting of the membrane did not occur in order to eliminate the interference of ammonia in wetting detection the high sensitivity eem fluorescence analysis was employed to characterize the rejection performance of the membrane in general the peak value of the permeate was significantly lower than that of the raw lfl figs 2 e and 8 for the md system most of the fulvic acid and ha substances were rejected by md and tyrosine and tryptophan substances also decreased by two orders of magnitude compared to the raw lfl for eo md system compared with the electrolyte after eo pretreatment the four peaks of the first md cycle effluent were basically removed a slightly higher fluorescence intensity detected in the second cycle may be due to insufficient eo electrolysis the four characteristic peaks in the lfl electrolyte after eo pretreatment were all observed for the permeate of the third cycle of the eo md system which was possibly a precursor of local wetting due to the production of intermediates with low surface energy by eo after mer pretreatment the intensity of the four types of fluorescent substances decreased by at least two orders fig 2 f and the intensity further decreased by at least two orders of magnitude after md treatment thus confirming the unwetted state of the membrane 3 3 energy consumption and application perspective for lfl treatment to achieve carbon reduction the specific energy consumption sec of the three systems is shown in fig 9 a owing to the presence of the pem between the two electrodes and the lower conductivity of the catholyte than that of lfl 2 89 vs 20 6 ms cm 1 the voltage of mer was required to be higher to maintain the same operating current density therefore the pretreatment sec of mer md was slightly higher than eo md however secmer eo occupied less than 2 of the entire system the membrane fouling was effectively alleviated by mer eo pretreatment thus the higher membrane flux led to the higher efficiency of md therefore the mer md system showed the lowest sectot 1783 18 kwh m 3 lfl while that of eo md and md systems were 2029 15 and 2195 49 kwh m 3 lfl respectively by taking the advantage of ability of low grade heat utilization recovery of the waste heat for md is an attractive option to reduce the energy consumption due to the common generation of waste heat in incineration power plant yan et al 2021 therefore based on the waste heat evaluation of the hongmiaoling comprehensive treatment plant the actual energy consumption values of the mer md eo md and md systems were found to be 1685 59 1931 57 and 2097 90 kwh m 3 lfl after offsetting part of the energy consumption through waste heat recovery moreover noteworthy the energy evaluation was based on a single stage dcmd in laboratory scale which gained output ratio gor lower than 1 for practical application multi stage air gap membrane distillation agmd with a typical gor of 3 6 could be applied to significantly reduce the energy consumption in our previous estimation the waste heat recovered from the incinerator was sufficient to drive the lfl on site treatment using the agmd system yan et al 2021 therefore for the mer md system the actual energy consumption was only 231 85 kwh m 3 with assumption that the heat energy could be fully supplied by waste heat this part of the energy consumption is mainly caused by md cooling the application of the membrane process commonly gets denounced with the high carbon emissions due to the high energy consumption moreover high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and ha present in lfl could be recovered to offset the energy consumption the ammonia nitrogen recovered from the mer cathode could offset the energy consumption of 6 42 kwh m 3 lfl by replacing the haber bosch process for ammonia production ha could be used as organic fertilizer to replace nitrogen fertilizer which could increase the yield of millet and reduce the consumption of nitrogen fertilizer zhai et al 2022 owing to the minute effect of ha recovery in carbon emission shown in section s8 the value was not counted here the actual carbon emissions of the md system was 2076 92 kg co2e m 3 lfl in the treatment after recovery of waste heat from the incinerator fig 9 b the actual carbon emissions of eo md decreased by 164 kg co2e m 3 lfl for the mer md system the actual carbon emissions of it were reduced by 20 but it still needs to emit 1660 73 kg co2e m 3 lfl after counting the reduction in the recovery of ammonia nitrogen most part of carbon emissions was mainly indirect carbon emissions resulting from insufficient heat from incineration to fully supply the heat energy required by dcmd and this could be reduced by replaced with other md systems a systematic comparison of the proposed technology with conventional treatments biological treatments chemical treatments physical treatments and two state of the art lfl treatment processes including principle advantages defects cod removal ammonia nitrogen removal energy consumption and costs is presented in table s3 the mer md has superiority in organic rejection performance over other treatment processes both mer md and sequential electrochemical peroxidation electro fenton process have satisfactory ammonia nitrogen removal rates 99 mer md technology offers advantages in terms of treatment efficiency chemical use and resources recovery however both the state of the art lfl treatment processes and mer md process need higher energy consumption cost it should be noted that the energy of md was based on the bench scale experiment with a single stage of md without considering of heat recovery which inevitably induced severe energy consumption significant savings are expected when using a low grade thermal energy source which will endow md outperformed performance in water production without consuming large amounts of electrical or high grade thermal energy alobaidani et al 2008 deshmukh et al 2018 the cost of pilot scale eo and md in wastewater treatment is around 0 56 0 85 m 3 cui et al 2017 ramesh et al 2021 and 5 65 12 48 m 3 choi et al 2022 eykens et al 2018 respectively since the membrane fouling of md in the mer md system is well controlled and highly reversible the cost for operation would be further reduced by optimizing process conditions and construction nonetheless some challenges still need to be further addressed first harmful cl2 and by products such as absorbable organic halogen are produced by mer recirculation of hydrogen from the cathode chamber to the anode chamber may be a viable solution to prevent the formation of harmful substances kuntke et al 2017 but this may reduce the oxidation performance second the concentrate produced by md was difficult to treat therefore throwing it into the incinerator or refluxing it in the mer anode chamber for treatment might be a feasible option that needs to be systematically investigated finally the mer electrolysis process produces intermediates with different properties such as low surface energy alcohols phenols etc which may have negative effect on the md process the electrode materials with higher oxygen evolution overpotential could be replaced to make the pollutants more fully oxidized dominguez et al 2018 therefore various works need to be further conducted to promote the application of the mer md process 4 conclusions in this study successful integration of mer with md was investigated for lfl treatment mer as a pretreatment system for of md exhibits the comprehensive advantages including delayed membrane fouling enhancement of membrane wetting resistance and improvement of ammonia nitrogen rejection based on the results the main conclusions are as follows 1 compared with the eo reactor the removal rates of mer for codcr uv254 ca2 mg2 and ammonia nitrogen increased by 24 1 34 0 5 2 37 5 and 43 4 respectively under the same current intensity moreover 31 2 and 47 7 of ammonia and ha in lfl were recovered respectively 2 mer treatment reduced the concentration of ca2 mg2 and organic matter to avoid the formation of dense organic inorganic fouling layers therefore use of mer led to significant increase in the membrane fouling resistance and fouling reversibility of md in the lfl treatment while maintaining a 67 2 of membrane vapor flux after three cycles operation and a fully recovered flux after alkaline solution cleaning 3 the mer md system could efficiently remove pollutants in lfl with the rejection rates of codcr tp ammonia and metal ions higher than 97 3 99 5 99 0 and 96 0 respectively furthermore the mer md system exhibited the highest resistance to wetting of membranes sustainably producing high quality water 4 the integration of mer to md decreased the total energy consumption from 2195 49 to 1783 18 kwh m 3 lfl although the treatment of lfl with mer md system still caused 1660 73 kg co2e m 3 lfl due to the high thermal energy consumption of md

15152,the acidic i e ph 5 activated sludge process is attracting attention because it enables stable nitrite accumulation and enhances sludge reduction and stabilization compared to the conventional process at neutral ph here this study examined the production and potential pathways of nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o during acidic sludge digestion with continuous operation of a laboratory scale aerobic digester at high dissolved oxygen concentration do 4 mg o2 l 1 and low ph 4 7 0 6 a significant amount of total nitrogen tn loss i e 18 6 1 5 of tn in feed sludge was detected notably 40 of the removed tn was emitted as no with 8 as n2o a series of batch assays were then designed to explain the observed tn loss under aerobic conditions all assays were conducted with a low concentration of volatile solids vs i e vs 4 5 g l 1 this vs concentration is commensurate with the values commonly found in the aeration tanks of full scale wastewater treatment systems and thus no significant nitrogen loss should be expected when do is controlled above 4 mg o2 l 1 however nitrite disappeared at a significant rate with the chemical decomposition of nitrite excluded leading to no production in the batch assays at ph 5 the nitrite reduction could be associated with endogenous microbial activities e g nitrite detoxification the significant no production illustrates the importance of aerobic nitrite reduction during acidic aerobic sludge digestion suggesting this process cannot be neglected in developing acidic activated sludge technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological no production acidic activated sludge processes microbial detoxification sludge digestion nitrogen loss data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen conversion to dinitrogen gas n2 is a critical part of wastewater and sludge treatment which reduces the excess nitrogen entering the natural water environment wang et al 2022 however nitrogen removal processes often produce unwanted intermediates such as nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o that can be emitted into the air pocquet et al 2016 schreiber et al 2012 no is a significant atmospheric trace gas contributing to ozone depletion zumft 1993 and is also toxic to many microorganisms including bacteria fungi viruses and microbial parasites kampschreur et al 2007 n2o is a potent greenhouse gas ghg with a global warming potential 300 times that of carbon dioxide and a lengthy atmospheric lifetime 121 years castro barros et al 2016 ni and yuan 2013 in recent years intensive studies on n2o emissions have been carried out in wastewater treatment systems adouani et al 2015 law et al 2012 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b wang et al 2016 previous studies on n2o vastly outnumbered those on no as n2o was reported with a much higher emission factor up to 25 of the influent nitrogen loads compared to that of no e g up to 0 2 kampschreur et al 2008a the measured no level is usually at a trace level due to the fact that no is chemically unstable and can be rapidly utilized by both nitrifiers and denitrifiers ahn et al 2011 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019c as a result researchers have been primarily focusing on developing strategies to reduce n2o emissions and investigating the effects of various environmental conditions on n2o formation however no can also be generated by multiple pathways in microbial nitrogen conversion including hydroxylamine oxidation nitrifier denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification ribera guardia et al 2014 rodriguez caballero and pijuan 2013 wang et al 2019a ribera guardia et al 2014 reported that the no formation rate is linearly related to the ammonia oxidation rate suggesting that aerobic ammonia oxidizers play a role in no generation a potential hotspot for no formation is an acidic system where no is formed via chemical hno2 decomposition at low ph 2 hn o 2 no n o 2 h 2 o ribera guardia and pijuan 2017 udert et al 2005 nevertheless no emission was barely reported in acidic systems li et al 2020 as acidic ph rarely occurs in wastewater and sludge treatment systems which are usually operated at a circumneutral ph recently acidic i e ph 5 activated sludge processes supported by the discovery of an acid tolerant ammonia oxidizer candidatus nitrosoglobus wang et al 2021a are attracting attention as demonstrated the acidophilic ammonia oxidation can enable robust accumulation of nitrite leading to an in situ sustained hno2 concentration above parts per million ppm level thereby enhancing nitrogen removal li et al 2020 wang et al 2021b meng et al 2022 sludge stabilization and reduction duan et al 2019 li et al 2020 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b wang et al 2021c despite the multifold benefits a significant issue for acidic wastewater and sludge treatment is the potentially augmented emissions of n2o and no fumasoli et al 2017 faust et al 2022 in an acidic wastewater treatment reactor li et al 2020 reported that most of the nitrogen loss i e 1 8 4 1 of influent nitrogen might be due to no emission in an aerobic sludge digester operated at ph 4 0 5 5 the n2o emission was measured as 1 74 0 91 of total nitrogen tn in feeding sludge which was much lower than the observed 30 tn loss suggesting a possibility of other emitted nitrogenous gases duan et al 2019 it was reasonable to attribute the tn loss to n2 production via denitrification which could occur in the anoxic zone of thick sludge flocs given the high sludge concentration 20 g volatile solids vs l 1 duan et al 2019 apart from n2 no can also be generated presumably at a non negligible level in the acidic sludge digestion process nevertheless no was not monitored and reported in previous acidic sludge treatment studies this study aims to investigate tn loss in an acidic aerobic digester and gain a comprehensive understanding of the nitrogen conversion mechanisms involved in acidic sludge treatment systems a laboratory scale digester was operated and fed with waste activated sludge was once per day i e semi continuous mode high concentrations of sludge 20 g vs l 1 often induce oxygen limitation inside flocs sludge leading to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification for tn removal kumar et al 2006 novak et al 2011 parravicini et al 2008 as such a relatively low sludge concentration 8 g vs l 1 was adopted to minimize oxygen limited regions in the digester the performance of the sludge digester including sludge reduction nitrogen conversion ph and pathogen removal was monitored regularly at the same time a series of batch experiments were conducted to verify the nitrogen loss at an even lower sludge concentration 4 g vs l 1 close to the sludge concentration in the aerobic tanks of many full scale wastewater treatment plants metcalf et al 2014 results from the short term experiments were expected to unravel potential mechanisms of nitrogen loss providing valuable information for the development of the novel acidic activated sludge processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of an acidic aerobic digester the laboratory digester had a working volume of 1 5 l and was operated in a temperature controlled room 22 1 c a magnetic stirrer with a speed of 250 rpm was used to mix the sludge in the digester an air diffuser was placed at the bottom of the digester to supply compressed air at a flow rate of 3 l min 1 this gave a bulk do concentration above 4 mg o2 l 1 measured with a do probe mettler toledo switzerland tap water was added on a daily basis to compensate for the water loss due to aeration evaporation the ph was monitored on a daily basis with a ph probe tps australia but not controlled the digester was fed with was collected from the secondary settler of the luggage point sewage treatment plant located in brisbane australia the full scale plant implements the modified ludzack ettinger mle process with a sludge retention time srt of about 15 days the collected was was transported to the laboratory and stored in a cold room at 4 c prior to use the main characteristics of the feeding sludge are summarized in table 1 the digester was operated for 200 days in total the first 60 day operation was a start up phase to establish the acidic condition in the aerobic sludge digester in this phase the digester was fed with 100 ml was and discharged 100 ml was once per day which gave an srt of 15 days on day 2 15 ml of a nitrite stock solution 10 g n l 1 was added to the digester resulting in a nitrite concentration of 100 mg n l 1 in the digester the nitrite shock was expected to stimulate self sustained nitrite accumulation as reported in previous studies duan et al 2019 li et al 2020 the digester would reach a steady state with four srts of operation on day 60 the experimental operation days 61 182 commenced the srt was changed to 10 days and the performance of the sludge digester was then evaluated comprehensively as follows throughout the entire operation ammonium nitrite and nitrate nitrogen concentrations in the supernatant of digested sludge were measured twice a week the sum of ammonium nitrite and nitrate makes up the total inorganic nitrogen tin in the supernatant the tn total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total phosphorus tp concentrations of the digested sludge were measured once every two to three weeks ts and vs of feeding was and digested sludge were measured twice a week vs destruction efficiency was calculated as vsin vsout vsin 100 where vsin and vsout represent vs concentrations in the was and the digested sludge respectively fecal coliforms and standard oxygen uptake rate sour of the was and digested sludge were measured to evaluate levels of sludge stabilization sour was measured once every three weeks in the second operating phase fecal coliforms were measured in triplicate at the end of the second phase 2 2 experimental design for short term assays a series of short term assays were carried out to reveal the mechanisms of nitrogen loss the objectives and details of the experimental design are summarized in table 2 all batch assays were carried out in a temperature controlled room 22 1 c using batch reactors which were mixed by magnetic stirrers at 250 rpm the do concentrations were maintained and measured above 4 mg o2 l 1 in all assays each batch reactor was also equipped with a ph probe to monitor the ph for each assay the digested sludge discharged sludge from the laboratory digester was as substrate and tap water were added into batch reactors note the tap water was aerated for 5 min to remove residual chlorine prior to usage after that a nitrite or nitrate stock solution was added to control the initial nitrite nitrate concentration at a designed level the initial ammonium concentration is the in situ ammonium concentration of sludge to exclude the aerobic ammonia oxidation reaction this can produce nitrite

solution aliberti et al 2017 cabrera and yager 2001 ganapathy and leibach 1983 michalet et al 2001 and phosphate buffered saline pbs buffer solution were used to maintain ph at 5 and 7 respectively all assays in objectives 1 and 3 table 2 were conducted in batch reactors with an effective volume of 250 ml and others in objective 2 table 2 were carried out in a large reactor with a volume of 1 l

respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the digester the operation of the laboratory scale digester consisted of two phases the initial 60 days of operation acted as a start up with an srt of 15 days along with continuous aeration the ph gradually decreased from the initial value of 7 to 4 the low ph was attained without adding any chemical acids instead sludge acidification was attributed to microbial oxidation of ammonium in the sludge nitrite concentration decreased from 100 mg n l 1 on day 2 initially added to zero within 10 days and then maintained below the detection limit 0 02 mg n l 1 nitrate concentration continued to increase indicating the activity of aerobic ammonia oxidizers ammonium concentration also gradually increased which was due to the hydrolysis of organic nitrogen during sludge digestion after the start up stable acidic conditions were successfully established in the aerobic sludge digester from day 60 the srt of the digester was shortened to 10 days the increased loading led to periodical ph variations and transient nitrite accumulation fig 1 a and b this phenomenon agreed with the previous studies on acidic sludge digestion because the activity of aerobic ammonia oxidizers could be sensitive to low ph as well as fna accumulation fumasoli et al 2015 park and bae 2009 the ph fluctuated between 4 and 6 and averaged at 4 7 0 6 close to previous reports of acidic aerobic sludge digestion duan et al 2019 wang et al 2021b during the stable operation in the second phase the vs destruction ratio was maintained at 18 2 6 5 fig s1 the sour was reduced from 4 44 1 62 mg o2 g 1 vs h 1 in the feed was to 0 54 0 18 mg o2 g 1 vs h 1 in the digested sludge fig s2 and the fecal coliforms an indicator of pathogens was reduced by 1 6 log fig s3 from day 78 to day 156 the tn concentrations in the feeding was and digested sludge were measured five times with the results clearly showing the tn loss in the digester fig 1d the tn loss was estimated to be 18 6 1 5 of the tn in the feed which is relatively lower than the value 23 28 reported in the previous study duan et al 2019 the reason might be due to the lower sludge concentration of 8 1 0 8 g vs l 1 in this study than the previously applied concentration 20 6 3 0 g vs l 1 and the slightly lower average fna concentration 0 2 vs 0 5 mg hno2 n l 1 further monitoring of no and n2o concentrations in a typical daily operational cycle was carried out fig s4 mass balance analysis revealed that 10 2 mg no n and 2 0 mg n2o n were emitted in one day accounting for 7 3 and 1 4 of tn in the feeding sludge equal to 40 and 8 of the removed tn respectively the results indicated that no production was significant in the sludge digester to exclude the role of anoxic denitrification due to the high sludge concentration batch assays were conducted using diluted sludge at vs concentration of 4 5 g l 1 in the mixed liquor such a sludge concentration has been commonly found in aeration tanks of full scale wastewater treatment systems and thus no significant nitrogen loss should be expected with full aeration i e do 4 mg o2 l 1 metcalf et al 2014 3 2 nitrogen loss associated with nitrite the first group of batch assays was carried out to determine whether nitrogen loss was related to nitrite or nitrate the results of these batch assays are presented in fig 2 the first assay was performed with the initial addition of was i e dump feeding and nitrite despite full aeration the nitrite concentration rapidly decreased from 43 8 mg n l 1 to 27 5 mg n l 1 in 1 5 days giving a nitrite reduction rate of 12 1 mg n l 1 d 1 fig 2a the second assay using slow feeding of was also showed significant nitrite reduction within 1 5 days the nitrite concentration decreased from 58 mg n l 1 to 28 mg n l 1 with a reduction rate of 19 0 mg n l 1 d 1 fig 2a in contrast the nitrate added to the two duplicate assays was almost unchanged after 1 5 days of aeration fig 2a and b the results from these assays indicated that nitrite was preferably reduced over nitrate during the acidic aerobic digestion of was the reason could be related to fna as fna can cause cell lysis and may trigger microbial detoxification to reduce nitrite which will be further discussed in section 3 6 3 3 biological nitrite reduction to no and n2o fig 3 shows the production of no and n2o in a batch assay of acidic sludge digestion with chemical production as a control with the addition of was and digested sludge the nitrite reduction rate was estimated to be 1 74 mg n l 1 h 1 similar to the rates measured in the above batch assays n2o and no concentrations in the off gas of the batch reactor rapidly increased reached the maximal levels of 11 and 40 ppm in 15 min respectively and then both gradually decreased until the end the n2o and no production are much higher than those in the chemical control assay indicating the biological pathway for n2o and no generation mass analysis revealed that 1 89 mg no n was emitted from the biological batch reactor in four hours accounting for 50 of the reduced nitrite 3 78 mg n these results indicated that biological no production is a major contributor to nitrogen loss in this acidic aerobic sludge digester which was further validated by similar rates of nitrite reduction without sludge addition chemical reaction and with sterilized sludge fig s5 3 4 factors affecting aerobic nitrite reduction further batch assays were carried out to investigate the nitrite reduction rates under different conditions including organic availability nitrite concentration ph and microorganisms in sludge these results are presented in fig 4 first duplicate batch assays prolonged to two days were performed in general readily degradable organic matter in sludge can be rapidly consumed in aerobic sludge digestion so the availability of the organic would substantially decrease along with the aeration the results from the batch assays showed that the nitrite concentration decreased rapidly from 44 9 mg n l 1 to 32 2 mg n l 1 on the first day and almost did not decrease after that fig 4a in addition to that the nitrite reduction rate without was addition was measured to be 1 22 mg n l 1 h 1 fig s6 the rate is 30 lower than the rate estimated with was addition i e 1 74 mg n l 1 h 1 further indicating the role of organics availability combined these results indicated that degradable organics were likely required for aerobic nitrite reduction the aerobic nitrite reduction was then analyzed in groups of batch assays with different nitrite concentrations the nitrite concentration decreased in all assays and the nitrite reduction rate increased from 0 020 0 003 to 0 29 0 07 mg n g vs 1 h 1 with the nitrite concentration increasing from 4 2 to 75 8 mg n l 1 fig 4b the result suggested that the rate of aerobic nitrite reduction was closely associated with nitrite concentrations to examine whether the rate also relates to the specific microbial community adapted to acidic ph the feeding was was directly aerated at ph 7 and 5 respectively the neutral ph environment enabled the full conversion of nitrite to nitrate without nitrogen loss fig 4c in contrast the nitrite concentration decreased by 10 mg n l 1 on the first day equal to 0 09 mg n g vs 1 h 1 at ph 5 fig 4d the result illustrated the need of low ph and also revealed that the aerobic nitrite reduction could be mediated by microorganisms in was it should be mentioned that the rate of nitrite reduction in the was test is slightly lower compared to the rates obtained using the digested sludge section 3 2 likely caused by the cultivation of some potential acid tolerant microbes during acidic digestion additionally the nitrate concentration only increased by 3 mg n l 1 in one day at ph 5 which is substantially less than that at ph 7 50 mg n l 1 showing the inhibition of aerobic nitrite oxidizers 3 5 microbial community analysis the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was conducted to reveal microbial communities in the feeding was and digested sludge fig 5 shows the relative abundances of top 20 genera or family showing a clear community shift after digestion in the feeding was caldilineaceae sm1a02 denitratisoma and obscuribacterales were the most abundant genera accounting for 9 2 0 5 4 9 0 6 3 9 0 4 3 8 0 2 in the total community respectively members in these genera families have been commonly found in wastewater treatment systems gregoire et al 2011 kale et al 2013 li et al 2018 nguyen and min 2020 qi et al 2020 tang et al 2020 under the conditions of acidic ph and nitrite accumulation their abundances substantially decreased instead chujaibacter rhodanobacter taibaiella and comamonas became predominant with high relative abundances of 18 2 0 5 12 0 0 7 9 3 0 9 5 0 0 2 respectively chujaibacter was found in sludge and soils and has been reported to be able to degrade organic matter rodríguez sánchez et al 2018 rodriguez sanchez et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 rhodanobacter is able to conduct denitrification utilizing nitrite nitrate or nitrous oxide as electron acceptors ma et al 2019 peng et al 2014 rodríguez sánchez et al 2018 rodriguez sanchez et al 2018 taibaiella was reported to participate in the lignin decomposition diallo et al 2021 qi et al 2022 and comamonas was the potential denitrifying bacteria found in estuarine waters zhu et al 2018 the prevalence of these new microorganisms in digested sludge indicated that they might adapt to acidic environments contributing to biological nitrite reduction in the acidic digester 3 6 potential mechanisms and limitation of this research the denitrification process consists of multiple stepwise reductions including nitrate reduction to nitrite and then to no n2o and n2 previously aerobic denitrification has been widely reported mostly at neutral ph which can reduce both nitrite and nitrate with either n2 or n2o as a major product gupta et al 2022 ji et al 2015 poh et al 2015 rajta et al 2020 vijay et al 2022 here this study reported that aerobic denitrification under acidic conditions prefers nitrite over nitrate as substrate and produces a significant amount of no which is different from neutral aerobic denitrification the biological nitrite reduction along with the no production suggests an incomplete denitrification process in acidic digestion the relationship between organic supply and nitrite reduction further indicates that this process relates to heterotrophic denitrification rather than autotrophic denitrification the nitrite reduction rate increased with the exponential increase in the nitrite concentration fig 4b which cannot be described by the michaelis menten kinetics thus we assumed that this process might not relate to microbial growth the obtained rates of nitrite reduction i e 0 04 0 28 mg n g 1 vs h 1 are substantially lower than the rate of wastewater denitrification 1 10 mg n g 1 vs h 1 yet seem to be close to that of endogenous denitrification metcalf et al 2014 ni et al 2016 in this study the endogenous oxygen respiration rate of the digested sludge i e sour was measured to be 0 5 0 2 mg o2 g 1 vs h 1 since the respiration rate for nitrite is generally only half for oxygen gujer et al 1999 the nitrite respiration rate could be estimated to be about 0 25 mg n g 1 vs h 1 comparable to the measured aerobic nitrite reduction rates this result provides evidence for the hypothesis that the observed aerobic nitrite reduction is an endogenous sludge process the aerobic nitrite reduction only occurred at low ph fig 4c and 4d and the rate significantly increased with a high concentration of fna fig 4b fna can cause severe inhibition of numerous bio processes in wastewater treatment systems zhou et al 2011 ionization from fna to nitrite is in a ph sensitive equilibrium eq 1 in section 2 3 and thus low ph greatly increases fna concentration in recent years researchers have found that fna at a ppm level is not only inhibitory but also biocidal to many microorganisms duan et al 2020a this biocidal effect has been explored and applied in the acidic aerobic digestion process for sludge treatment enabling enhanced vs destruction and pathogen removal duan et al 2019 wang et al 2021b despite that the underlying mechanisms for the biocidal effect remain not completely clear fna can induce the formation of reactive nitrogen species e g no n2o3 no2 causing cell lysis chislett et al 2022 given the relationship between the nitrite reduction rate and the fna concentration fig 4b we thus also led to a hypothesis that microbial detoxification could play a significant role which requires further investigation in general anoxic denitrification no3 no2 n2 contributes to nitrogen loss in a sludge digester at a neutral ph here this study proposes a previously overlooked process in nitrogen conversion i e aerobic nitrite reduction which is proven to be significant under acidic conditions fig 6 as demonstrated this process reduced nitrite at a rate ranging between 0 03 and 0 28 mg n g 1 vs h 1 in batch assays compared to 0 09 mg n g 1 vs h 1 for nitrogen loss in the laboratory digester calculated based on the lost tn in the feed the rate is comparable to the rates identified in the previous acidic aerobic digesters 0 09 0 23 mg n g 1 vs h 1 and 0 18 0 23 mg n g 1 vs h 1 duan et al 2019 wang et al 2021b these results thus illustrate the significance of the aerobic nitrite reduction process in acidic sludge digestion further the question of whether some microorganisms existing in complex sludge communities may possess such a pathway to enable their survival in an acidic sludge digester remains unclear these microbes could be identified as acid and fna tolerant microorganisms and require microbial exploration in future studies 3 7 implication to acidic aerobic sludge treatment acidic aerobic sludge treatment technologies provide unique opportunities in sludge management with superior performance in sludge volume reduction and stabilization compared to conventional processes duan et al 2019 reported that in an acidic sludge digestion system ph 5 5 receiving was the fna accumulation enhanced vs destruction 35 38 4 and stabilization 1 log pathogen reduced and 0 49 0 03 mg o2 g 1 vs h 1 sour determined acidic aerobic sludge treatment technology also exhibited high efficiency for anaerobically digested sludge wang et al 2021b reported that the vs destruction 29 8 4 3 and sludge stabilization 1 8 log pathogen reduced and 0 5 0 1 mg o2 g 1 vs h 1 sour determined of anaerobically digested sludge were significantly enhanced by fna accumulation in these previous studies fna accumulation was considered the most critical factor under aerobic conditions the fna concentration in a sludge digester was previously believed to be mostly associated with the activities of aerobic ammonia and nitrite oxidizers which generate and consume nitrite respectively however the new pathway identified in this study could also reduce nitrite the previously overlooked aerobic nitrite reduction thus led to unstable nitrite accumulation in the aerobic digester of the present study fig 1b making it challenging to attain the ppm level of fna required for efficient sludge reduction from a technological point of view to maintain nitrite fna accumulation in acidic digesters it is essential to develop strategies for controlling the rate of aerobic nitrite reduction it should be noted that no and n2o are unwanted gases in the acidic digester about 40 and 8 of the tn removed were no and n2o respectively for no the production equals 7 3 of tn in the feeding sludge or 5 of the wastewater nitrogen load which is an order of magnitude higher than the no emission factor reported in a full scale wastewater treatment plant i e a level of up to 0 2 of the influent nitrogen load kampschreur et al 2008b thus control strategies must be implemented to mitigate the emissions of no and n2o end of pipe treatment can be a suitable strategy to mitigate no and n2o emitted from acidic aerobic sludge digesters duan et al 2021 to absorb gaseous no and n2o bioscrubbers and biofilters can be installed no and n2o from captured gaseous can be reduced to n2 via a denitrification process carried out by some immobilized heterotrophic denitrifiers duan et al 2021 frutos et al 2017 frutos et al 2016 a recent study immobilized a newly aerobic denitrifying bacterium strain pcn 1 in polyurethane foam puf carriers and showed its capability to mitigate no and n2o emissions from a pilot scale oxidation ditch tian et al 2021 the efficiency of end of pipe technology for no and n2o removal in the acidic aerobic sludge digestion process should be evaluated in future studies notably a low sludge concentration was used in this study to minimize oxygen depleted regions in the digester in real applications however much higher sludge concentration is typically used at which oxygen limitation often occurs inside flocs sludge duan et al 2019 kumar et al 2006 novak et al 2011 whether the no and n2o emissions under such conditions are still comparable and relevant to the low sludge concentration scenario requires further investigation 4 conclusion this study investigated no and n2o emissions and their production pathways in acidic aerobic sludge digestion processes the main conclusions are the tn loss was significant 18 6 1 5 of tn in feed when acidic aerobic digestion was applied to treat secondary sludge even with a relatively low sludge concentration of 9 8 0 5 g vs l 1 though do concentration was above 4 mg o2 l 1 the tn loss was mainly attributed to the aerobic reduction of nitrite to no aerobic nitrite reduction was identified to be a critical microbial process with the rate relating to organic availability nitrite concentration and ph the process can be mediated by microorganisms in secondary sludge at an acidic ph which is likely induced by fna a potent biocide for many microorganisms aerobic nitrite reduction may play a more important role in depleting nitrite in an acidic aerobic digester than aerobic nitrite oxidizers it is essential to develop strategies for controlling the rate of aerobic nitrite reduction to maintain a high fna concentration during acidic sludge

15152,the acidic i e ph 5 activated sludge process is attracting attention because it enables stable nitrite accumulation and enhances sludge reduction and stabilization compared to the conventional process at neutral ph here this study examined the production and potential pathways of nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o during acidic sludge digestion with continuous operation of a laboratory scale aerobic digester at high dissolved oxygen concentration do 4 mg o2 l 1 and low ph 4 7 0 6 a significant amount of total nitrogen tn loss i e 18 6 1 5 of tn in feed sludge was detected notably 40 of the removed tn was emitted as no with 8 as n2o a series of batch assays were then designed to explain the observed tn loss under aerobic conditions all assays were conducted with a low concentration of volatile solids vs i e vs 4 5 g l 1 this vs concentration is commensurate with the values commonly found in the aeration tanks of full scale wastewater treatment systems and thus no significant nitrogen loss should be expected when do is controlled above 4 mg o2 l 1 however nitrite disappeared at a significant rate with the chemical decomposition of nitrite excluded leading to no

1 introduction nitrogen conversion to dinitrogen gas n2 is a critical part of wastewater and sludge treatment which reduces the excess nitrogen entering the natural water environment wang et al 2022 however nitrogen removal processes often produce unwanted intermediates such as nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o that can be emitted into the air pocquet et al 2016 schreiber et al 2012 no is a significant atmospheric trace gas contributing to ozone depletion zumft 1993 and is also toxic to many microorganisms including bacteria fungi viruses and microbial parasites kampschreur et al 2007 n2o is a potent greenhouse gas ghg with a global warming potential 300 times that of carbon dioxide and a lengthy atmospheric lifetime 121 years castro barros et al 2016 ni and yuan 2013 in recent years intensive studies on n2o emissions have been carried out in wastewater treatment systems adouani et al 2015 law et al 2012 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b wang et al 2016 previous studies on n2o vastly outnumbered those on no as n2o was reported with a much higher emission factor up to 25 of the influent nitrogen loads compared to that of no e g up to 0 2 kampschreur et al 2008a the measured no level is usually at a trace level due to the fact that no is chemically unstable and can be rapidly utilized by both nitrifiers and denitrifiers ahn et al 2011 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019c as a result researchers have been primarily focusing on developing strategies to reduce n2o emissions and investigating the effects of various environmental conditions on n2o formation however no can also be generated by multiple pathways in microbial nitrogen conversion including hydroxylamine oxidation nitrifier denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification ribera guardia et al 2014 rodriguez caballero and pijuan 2013 wang et al 2019a ribera guardia et al 2014 reported that the no formation rate is linearly related to the ammonia oxidation rate suggesting that aerobic ammonia oxidizers play a role in no generation a potential hotspot for no formation is an acidic system where no is formed via chemical hno2 decomposition at low ph 2 hn o 2 no n o 2 h 2 o ribera guardia and pijuan 2017 udert et al 2005 nevertheless no emission was barely reported in acidic systems li et al 2020 as acidic ph rarely occurs in wastewater and sludge treatment systems which are usually operated at a circumneutral ph recently acidic i e ph 5 activated sludge processes supported by the discovery of an acid tolerant ammonia oxidizer candidatus nitrosoglobus wang et al 2021a are attracting attention as demonstrated the acidophilic ammonia oxidation can enable robust accumulation of nitrite leading to an in situ sustained hno2 concentration above parts per million ppm level thereby enhancing nitrogen removal li et al 2020 wang et al 2021b meng et al 2022 sludge stabilization and reduction duan et al 2019 li et al 2020 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b wang et al 2021c despite the multifold benefits a significant issue for acidic wastewater and sludge treatment is the potentially augmented emissions of n2o and no fumasoli et al 2017 faust et al 2022 in an acidic wastewater treatment reactor li et al 2020 reported that most of the nitrogen loss i e 1 8 4 1 of influent nitrogen might be due to no emission in an aerobic sludge digester operated at ph 4 0 5 5 the n2o emission was measured as 1 74 0 91 of total nitrogen tn in feeding sludge which was much lower than the observed 30 tn loss suggesting a possibility of other emitted nitrogenous gases duan et al 2019 it was reasonable to attribute the tn loss to n2 production via denitrification which could occur in the anoxic zone of thick sludge flocs given the high sludge concentration 20 g volatile solids vs l 1 duan et al 2019 apart from n2 no can also be generated presumably at a non negligible level in the acidic sludge digestion process nevertheless no was not monitored and reported in previous acidic sludge treatment studies this study aims to investigate tn loss in an acidic aerobic digester and gain a comprehensive understanding of the nitrogen conversion mechanisms involved in acidic sludge treatment systems a laboratory scale digester was operated and fed with waste activated sludge was once per day i e semi continuous mode high concentrations of sludge 20 g vs l 1 often induce oxygen limitation inside flocs sludge leading to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification for tn removal kumar et al 2006 novak et al 2011 parravicini et al 2008 as such a relatively low sludge concentration 8 g vs l 1 was adopted to minimize oxygen limited regions in the digester the performance of the sludge digester including sludge reduction nitrogen conversion ph and pathogen removal was monitored regularly at the same time a series of batch experiments were conducted to verify the nitrogen loss at an even lower sludge concentration 4 g vs l 1 close to the sludge concentration in the aerobic tanks of many full scale wastewater treatment plants metcalf et al 2014 results from the short term experiments were expected to unravel potential mechanisms of nitrogen loss providing valuable information for the development of the novel acidic activated sludge processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of an acidic aerobic digester the laboratory digester had a working volume of 1 5 l and was operated in a temperature controlled room 22 1 c a magnetic stirrer with a speed of 250 rpm was used to mix the sludge in the digester an air diffuser was placed at the bottom of the digester to supply compressed air at a flow rate of 3 l min 1 this gave a bulk do concentration above 4 mg o2 l 1 measured with a do probe mettler toledo switzerland tap water was added on a daily basis to compensate for the water loss due to aeration evaporation the ph was monitored on a daily basis with a ph probe tps australia but not controlled the digester was fed with was

fed with 100 ml was and discharged 100 ml was once per day which gave an srt of 15 days on day 2 15 ml of a nitrite stock solution 10 g n l 1 was added to the digester resulting in a nitrite concentration of 100 mg n l 1 in the digester the nitrite shock was expected to stimulate self sustained nitrite accumulation as reported in previous studies duan et al 2019 li et al 2020 the digester would reach a steady state with four srts of operation on day 60 the experimental operation days 61 182 commenced the srt was changed to 10 days and the performance of the sludge digester was then evaluated comprehensively as follows throughout the entire operation ammonium nitrite and nitrate nitrogen concentrations in the supernatant of digested sludge were measured twice a week the sum of ammonium nitrite and nitrate makes up the total inorganic nitrogen tin in the supernatant the tn total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total phosphorus tp concentrations of the digested sludge were measured once every two to three weeks ts and vs of feeding was and digested sludge were measured twice a week vs destruction efficiency was calculated as vsin vsout vsin 100 where vsin and vsout represent vs concentrations in the was and the digested sludge respectively fecal coliforms and standard oxygen uptake rate sour of the was and digested sludge were measured to evaluate levels of sludge stabilization sour was measured once every three weeks in the second operating phase fecal coliforms were measured in triplicate at the end of the second phase 2 2 experimental design for short term assays a series of short term assays were carried out to reveal the mechanisms of nitrogen loss the objectives and details of the experimental design are summarized in table 2 all batch assays were carried out in a temperature controlled room 22 1 c using batch reactors which were mixed by magnetic stirrers at 250 rpm the do concentrations were maintained and measured above 4 mg o2 l 1 in all assays each batch reactor was also equipped with a ph probe to monitor the ph for each assay the digested sludge discharged sludge from the laboratory digester was as substrate and tap water were added into batch reactors note the tap water was aerated for 5 min to remove residual chlorine prior to usage after that a nitrite or nitrate stock solution was added to control the initial nitrite nitrate concentration at a designed level the initial ammonium concentration is the in situ ammonium concentration of sludge to exclude the aerobic ammonia oxidation reaction this can produce nitrite

solution aliberti et al 2017 cabrera and yager 2001 ganapathy and leibach 1983 michalet et al 2001 and phosphate buffered saline pbs buffer solution were used to maintain ph at 5 and 7 respectively

respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the digester the operation of the laboratory scale digester consisted of two phases the initial 60 days of operation acted as a start up with an srt of 15 days along with continuous aeration the ph gradually decreased from the initial value of 7 to 4 the low ph was attained without adding any chemical acids instead sludge acidification was attributed to microbial oxidation of ammonium in the sludge nitrite concentration decreased from 100 mg n l 1 on day 2 initially added to zero within 10 days and then maintained below the detection limit 0 02 mg n l 1 nitrate concentration continued to increase indicating the activity of aerobic ammonia oxidizers ammonium concentration also gradually increased which was due to the hydrolysis of organic nitrogen during sludge digestion after the start up stable acidic conditions were successfully established in the aerobic sludge digester from day 60 the srt of the digester was shortened to 10 days the increased loading led to periodical ph variations and transient nitrite accumulation fig 1 a and b this phenomenon agreed with the previous studies on acidic sludge digestion because the activity of aerobic ammonia oxidizers could be sensitive to low ph as well as fna accumulation fumasoli et al 2015 park and bae 2009 the ph fluctuated between 4 and 6 and averaged at 4 7 0 6 close to previous reports of acidic aerobic sludge digestion duan et al 2019 wang et al 2021b during the stable operation in the second phase the vs destruction ratio was maintained at 18 2 6 5 fig s1 the sour was reduced from 4 44 1 62 mg o2 g 1 vs h 1 in the feed was to 0 54 0 18 mg o2 g 1 vs h 1 in the digested sludge fig s2 and the fecal coliforms an indicator of pathogens was reduced by 1 6 log fig s3 from day 78 to day 156 the tn concentrations in the feeding was and digested sludge were measured five times with the results clearly showing the tn loss in the digester fig 1d the tn loss was estimated to be 18 6 1 5 of the tn in the feed which is relatively lower than the value 23 28 reported in the previous study duan et al 2019 the reason might be due to the lower sludge concentration of 8 1 0 8 g vs l 1 in this study than the previously applied concentration 20 6 3 0 g vs l 1 and the slightly lower average fna concentration 0 2 vs 0 5 mg hno2 n l 1 further monitoring of no and n2o concentrations in a typical daily operational cycle was carried out fig s4 mass balance analysis revealed that 10 2 mg no n and 2 0 mg n2o n were emitted in one day accounting for 7 3 and 1 4 of tn in the feeding sludge equal to 40 and 8 of the removed tn respectively the results indicated that no production was significant in the sludge digester to exclude the role of anoxic denitrification due to the high sludge concentration batch assays were conducted using diluted sludge at vs concentration of 4 5 g l 1 in the mixed liquor such a sludge concentration has been commonly found in aeration tanks of full scale wastewater treatment systems and thus no significant nitrogen loss should be expected with full aeration i e do 4 mg o2 l 1 metcalf et al 2014 3 2 nitrogen loss associated with nitrite the first group of batch assays was carried out to determine whether nitrogen loss was related to nitrite or nitrate the results of these batch assays are presented in fig 2 the first assay was performed with the initial addition of was i e dump feeding and nitrite despite full aeration the nitrite concentration rapidly decreased from 43 8 mg n l 1 to 27 5 mg n l 1 in 1 5 days giving a nitrite reduction rate of 12 1 mg n l 1 d 1 fig 2a the second assay using slow feeding of was also showed significant nitrite reduction within 1 5 days the nitrite concentration decreased from 58 mg n l 1 to 28 mg n l 1 with a reduction rate of 19 0 mg n l 1 d 1 fig 2a in contrast the nitrate added to the two duplicate assays was almost unchanged after 1 5 days of aeration fig 2a and b the results from these assays indicated that nitrite was preferably reduced over nitrate during the acidic aerobic digestion of was the reason could be related to fna as fna can cause cell lysis and may trigger microbial detoxification to reduce nitrite which will be further discussed in section 3 6 3 3 biological nitrite reduction to no and n2o fig 3 shows the production of no and n2o in a batch assay of acidic sludge digestion with chemical production as a control with the addition of was and digested sludge the nitrite reduction rate was estimated to be 1 74 mg n l 1 h 1 similar to the rates measured in the above batch assays n2o and no concentrations in the off gas of the batch reactor rapidly increased reached the maximal levels of 11 and 40 ppm in 15 min respectively and then both gradually decreased until the end the n2o and no production are much higher than those in the chemical control assay indicating the biological pathway for n2o and no generation mass analysis revealed that 1 89 mg no n was emitted from the biological batch reactor in four hours accounting for 50 of the reduced nitrite 3 78 mg n these results indicated that biological no production is a major contributor to nitrogen loss in this acidic aerobic sludge digester which was further validated by similar rates of nitrite reduction without sludge addition chemical reaction and with sterilized sludge fig s5 3 4 factors affecting aerobic nitrite reduction further batch assays were carried out to investigate the nitrite reduction rates under different conditions including organic availability nitrite concentration ph and microorganisms in sludge these results are presented in fig 4 first duplicate batch assays prolonged to two days were performed in general readily degradable organic matter in sludge can be rapidly consumed in aerobic sludge digestion so the availability of the organic would substantially decrease along with the aeration the results from the batch assays showed that the nitrite concentration decreased rapidly from 44 9 mg n l 1 to 32 2 mg n l 1 on the first day and almost did not decrease after that fig 4a in addition to that the nitrite reduction rate without was addition was measured to be 1 22 mg n l 1 h 1 fig s6 the rate is 30 lower than the rate estimated with was addition i e 1 74 mg n l 1 h 1 further indicating the role of organics availability combined these results indicated that degradable organics were likely required for aerobic nitrite reduction the aerobic nitrite reduction was then analyzed in groups of batch assays with different nitrite concentrations the nitrite concentration decreased in all assays and the nitrite reduction rate increased from 0 020 0 003 to 0 29 0 07 mg n g vs 1 h 1 with the nitrite concentration increasing from 4 2 to 75 8 mg n l 1 fig 4b the result suggested that the rate of aerobic nitrite reduction was closely associated with nitrite concentrations to examine whether the rate also relates to the specific microbial community adapted to acidic ph the feeding was was directly aerated at ph 7 and 5 respectively the neutral ph environment enabled the full conversion of nitrite to nitrate without nitrogen loss fig 4c in contrast the nitrite concentration decreased by 10 mg n l 1 on the first day equal to 0 09 mg n g vs 1 h 1 at ph 5 fig 4d the result illustrated the need of low ph and also revealed that the aerobic nitrite reduction could be mediated by microorganisms in was it should be mentioned that the rate of nitrite reduction in the was test is slightly lower compared to the rates obtained using the digested sludge section 3 2 likely caused by the cultivation of some potential acid tolerant microbes during acidic digestion additionally the nitrate concentration only increased by 3 mg n l 1 in one day at ph 5 which is substantially less than that at ph 7 50 mg n l 1 showing the inhibition of aerobic nitrite oxidizers 3 5 microbial community analysis the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was conducted to reveal microbial communities in the feeding was and digested sludge fig 5 shows the relative abundances of top 20 genera or family showing a clear community shift after digestion in the feeding was caldilineaceae sm1a02 denitratisoma and obscuribacterales were the most abundant genera accounting for 9 2 0 5 4 9 0 6 3 9 0 4 3 8 0 2 in the total community respectively members in these genera families have been commonly found in wastewater treatment systems gregoire et al 2011 kale et al 2013 li et al 2018 nguyen and min 2020 qi et al 2020 tang et al 2020 under the conditions of acidic ph and nitrite accumulation their abundances substantially decreased instead chujaibacter rhodanobacter taibaiella and comamonas became predominant with high relative abundances of 18 2 0 5 12 0 0 7 9 3 0 9 5 0 0 2 respectively chujaibacter was found in sludge and soils and has been reported to be able to degrade organic matter rodríguez sánchez et al 2018 rodriguez sanchez et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 rhodanobacter is able to conduct denitrification utilizing nitrite nitrate or nitrous oxide as electron acceptors ma et al 2019 peng et al 2014 rodríguez sánchez et al 2018 rodriguez sanchez et al 2018 taibaiella was reported to participate in the lignin decomposition diallo et al 2021 qi et al 2022 and comamonas was the potential denitrifying bacteria found in estuarine waters zhu et al 2018 the prevalence of these new microorganisms in digested sludge indicated that they might adapt to acidic environments contributing to biological nitrite reduction in the acidic digester 3 6 potential mechanisms and limitation of this research the denitrification process consists of multiple stepwise reductions including nitrate reduction to nitrite and then to no n2o and n2 previously aerobic denitrification has been widely reported mostly at neutral ph which can reduce both nitrite and nitrate with either n2 or n2o as a major product gupta et al 2022 ji et al 2015 poh et al 2015 rajta et al 2020 vijay et al 2022 here this study reported that aerobic denitrification under acidic conditions prefers nitrite over nitrate as substrate and produces a significant amount of no which is different from neutral aerobic denitrification the biological nitrite reduction along with the no production suggests an incomplete denitrification process in acidic digestion the relationship between organic supply and nitrite reduction further indicates that this process relates to heterotrophic denitrification rather than autotrophic denitrification the nitrite reduction rate increased with the exponential increase in the nitrite concentration fig 4b which cannot be described by the michaelis menten kinetics thus we assumed that this process might not relate to microbial growth the obtained rates of nitrite reduction i e 0 04 0 28 mg n g 1 vs h 1 are substantially lower than the rate of wastewater denitrification 1 10 mg n g 1 vs h 1 yet seem to be close to that of endogenous denitrification metcalf et al 2014 ni et al 2016 in this study the endogenous oxygen respiration rate of the digested sludge i e sour was measured to be 0 5 0 2 mg o2 g 1 vs h 1 since the respiration rate for nitrite is generally only half for oxygen gujer et al 1999 the nitrite respiration rate could be estimated to be about 0 25 mg n g 1 vs h 1 comparable to the measured aerobic nitrite reduction rates this result provides evidence for the hypothesis that the observed aerobic nitrite reduction is an endogenous sludge process the aerobic nitrite reduction only occurred at low ph fig 4c and 4d and the rate significantly increased with a high concentration of fna fig 4b fna can cause severe inhibition of numerous bio processes in wastewater treatment systems zhou et al 2011 ionization from fna to nitrite is in a ph sensitive equilibrium eq 1 in section 2 3 and thus low ph greatly increases fna concentration in recent years researchers have found that fna at a ppm level is not only inhibitory but also biocidal to many microorganisms duan et al 2020a this biocidal effect has been explored and applied in the acidic aerobic digestion process for sludge treatment enabling enhanced vs destruction and pathogen removal duan et al 2019 wang et al 2021b despite that the underlying mechanisms for the biocidal effect remain not completely clear fna can induce the formation of reactive nitrogen species e g no n2o3 no2 causing cell lysis chislett et al 2022 given the relationship between the nitrite reduction rate and the fna concentration fig 4b we thus also led to a hypothesis that microbial detoxification could play a significant role which requires further investigation in general anoxic denitrification no3 no2 n2 contributes to nitrogen loss in a sludge digester at a neutral ph here this study proposes a previously overlooked process in nitrogen conversion i e aerobic nitrite reduction which is proven to be significant under acidic conditions fig 6 as demonstrated this process reduced nitrite at a rate ranging between 0 03 and 0 28 mg n g 1 vs h 1 in batch assays compared to 0 09 mg n g 1 vs h 1 for nitrogen loss in the laboratory digester calculated based on the lost tn in the feed the rate is comparable to the rates identified in the previous acidic aerobic digesters 0 09 0 23 mg n g 1 vs h 1 and 0 18 0 23 mg n g 1 vs h 1 duan et al 2019 wang et al 2021b these results thus illustrate the significance of the aerobic nitrite reduction process in acidic sludge digestion further the question of whether some microorganisms existing in complex sludge communities may possess such a pathway to enable their survival in an acidic sludge digester remains unclear these microbes could be identified as acid and fna tolerant microorganisms and require microbial exploration in future studies 3 7 implication to acidic aerobic sludge treatment acidic aerobic sludge treatment technologies provide unique opportunities in sludge management with superior performance in sludge volume reduction and stabilization compared to conventional processes duan et al 2019 reported that in an acidic sludge digestion system ph 5 5 receiving was the fna accumulation enhanced vs destruction 35 38 4 and stabilization 1 log pathogen reduced and 0 49 0 03 mg o2 g 1 vs h 1 sour determined acidic aerobic sludge treatment technology also exhibited high efficiency for anaerobically digested sludge wang et al 2021b reported that the vs destruction 29 8 4 3 and sludge stabilization 1 8 log pathogen reduced and 0 5 0 1 mg o2 g 1 vs h 1 sour determined of anaerobically digested sludge were significantly enhanced by fna accumulation in these previous studies fna accumulation was considered the most critical factor under aerobic conditions the fna concentration in a sludge digester was previously believed to be mostly associated with the activities of aerobic ammonia and nitrite oxidizers which generate and consume nitrite respectively however the new pathway identified in this study could also reduce nitrite the previously overlooked aerobic nitrite reduction thus led to unstable nitrite accumulation in the aerobic digester of the present study fig 1b making it challenging to attain the ppm level of fna required for efficient sludge reduction from a technological point of view to maintain nitrite fna accumulation in acidic digesters it is essential to develop strategies for controlling the rate of aerobic nitrite reduction it should be noted that no and n2o are unwanted gases in the acidic digester about 40 and 8 of the tn removed were no and n2o respectively for no the production equals 7 3 of tn in the feeding sludge or 5 of the wastewater nitrogen load which is an order of magnitude higher than the no emission factor reported in a full scale wastewater treatment plant i e a level of up to 0 2 of the influent nitrogen load kampschreur et al 2008b thus control strategies must be implemented to mitigate the emissions of no and n2o end of pipe treatment can be a suitable strategy to mitigate no and n2o emitted from acidic aerobic sludge digesters duan et al 2021 to absorb gaseous no and n2o bioscrubbers and biofilters can be installed no and n2o from captured gaseous can be reduced to n2 via a denitrification process carried out by some immobilized heterotrophic denitrifiers duan et al 2021 frutos et al 2017 frutos et al 2016 a recent study immobilized a newly aerobic denitrifying bacterium strain pcn 1 in polyurethane foam puf carriers and showed its capability to mitigate no and n2o emissions from a pilot scale oxidation ditch tian et al 2021 the efficiency of end of pipe technology for no and n2o removal in the acidic aerobic sludge digestion process should be evaluated in future studies notably a low sludge concentration was used in this study to minimize oxygen depleted regions in the digester in real applications however much higher sludge concentration is typically used at which oxygen limitation often occurs inside flocs sludge duan et al 2019 kumar et al 2006 novak et al 2011 whether the no and n2o emissions under such conditions are still comparable and relevant to the low sludge concentration scenario requires further investigation 4 conclusion this study investigated no and n2o emissions and their production pathways in acidic aerobic sludge digestion processes the main conclusions are the tn loss was significant 18 6 1 5 of tn in feed when acidic aerobic digestion was applied to treat secondary sludge even with a relatively low sludge concentration of 9 8 0 5 g vs l 1 though do concentration was above 4 mg o2 l 1 the tn loss was mainly attributed to the aerobic reduction of nitrite to no aerobic nitrite reduction was identified to be a critical microbial process with the rate relating to organic availability nitrite concentration and ph the process can be mediated by microorganisms in secondary sludge at an acidic ph which is likely induced by fna a potent biocide for many microorganisms aerobic nitrite reduction may play a more important role in depleting nitrite in an acidic aerobic digester than aerobic nitrite oxidizers it is essential to develop strategies for controlling the rate of aerobic nitrite reduction to maintain a high fna concentration during acidic sludge

67 have been applied to remove pfas in water treatment plants and household point of use systems boyer et al 2021 gagliano et al 2020 lenka et al 2021 however these conventional adsorbents suffer from sluggish adsorption kinetics low adsorption capacity and limited affinity toward pfas family with various chain lengths mccleaf et al 2017 xiao 2017 in addition the molecular level understanding of the adsorbents pfas interfacial mechanisms is lacking ateia et al 2019 the ideal candidate of the adsorbent for pfas removal should exhibit fast uptake rate and high adsorption capacity typically adsorbent with high hydrophilicity could accelerate the mass transfer of pfas from aqueous solution to solid phase in addition the adsorbent should present strong affinity to pfas family with various

spectroscopy icp ms agilent 7700 usa 2 4 batch adsorption experiments all the adsorption experiments were performed on an orbital shaker at 180 rpm under ambient temperature 25 1 c and were run in three replicates for adsorption kinetics experiments the adsorbent dosages were set as 0 25 g l and the initial concentration of pfoa was 20 mg l adsorption isotherm experiments were examined with different pfoa concentrations 10 20 50 100 200 300 400 and 600 mg l to determine the maximum adsorption capacities for the adsorption experiments with low concentrations pfoa the experimental conditions were similar unless the initial concentrations were set as 500 µg l to evaluate the effect of ph on pfoa adsorption a desired ph ranging from 3 to 11 was adjusted by dropwise addition of 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh the competitive adsorption experiments were performed by adding 1 mm of coexisting competitive ions cl no3 hco3 and so4 2 the effect of natural organic matter nom was tested

c e v m 2 r e m o v a l e f f i c e n c y c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of pfoa v is the volume of the pfoa solution and m is the mass of the adsorbents langmuir and freundlich models were applied to describe the adsorption isotherm as follow 3 q e q m a x k l c e 1 k l c e 4 q e k f c e 1 n where qe and qmax mg g is the adsorbed amount of pfoa at equilibrium and the langmuir adsorption capacity respectively kl l mg is the langmuir constant kf mg g l mg 1 n is the freundlich constant and n is a dimensionless indicator related to the adsorption heterogeneity 2 5 regeneration experiments the regeneration experiments were evaluated through the adsorption desorption experiments for three consecutive cycles in a typical procedure pfoa loaded yohcl nanosheets were collected by centrifugation after adsorption and then immerged into 50 ml mixture of fresh meoh and 1 m nacl v v 1 1 for 24 h the regenerated yohcl adsorbent was collected washed and dried at 80 c for 12 h and further used for another cycle 2 6 continuous flow column experiments two identical column reactors 4 cm i d 30 cm length were constructed to examine the simultaneous adsorption performance of multiple pfas pfpra pfba pfpea pfhxa pfhpa pfoa and pfos the gac column was set as a reference which is constructed by filling with 50 g gac prior to the use of adsorption experiments gac were firstly rinsed with deionized water for several times and dried at 105 c overnight in an oven to fabricate the yohcl gac 3 g ycl3 6h2o was firstly dissolved in 6 ml h2o and then dropwise added on 60 g gac the obtained composite was calcined at 500 c for 30 min under vacuum then washed with water for several times and dried at 105 c overnight finally 50 g yohcl gac was transferred into the column to perform the continuous flow column experiments a stock solution tap water with 10 mg l humic acid and multiple pfas spiked concentration of each compound is 500 μg l was continuously fed into the columns by using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1 2 l h the concentration of the effluents was analyzed by a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms the detailed analytic parameters were attached in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of the yohcl nanosheets a rapid thermal exfoliation approach was developed to prepare the yohcl ultrathin nanosheets in the present study fig 1 a when ycl3 6h2o was calcined in a pre heated tube furnace at a high temperature 500 c under vacuum a large quantity of h2o and hcl would be released immediately to drive exfoliation of layered ycl3 6h2o precursor zhao et al 2016 as shown in tg analysis fig 1b the weight was gradually declined to 41 94 of the initial mass during the calcination process the tg ms analysis further demonstrated that the evaporation of adsorbed h2o or crystalline h2o occurred from 70 c to 300 c and hcl was generated between 90 c and 270 c fig 1c other possible decomposition products such as hclo and cl2 were not detected in the calcination process suggesting the simultaneous stripping of cl and o from the ycl3 6h2o precursor to form hcl and h2o under an overlapped temperature sun et al 2018 yohcl crystal s transformation was completed at 400 c where the weight was stable and no more decomposition products were detected fig 1b and 1c as expected ycl3 6h2o was successfully decomposed into y2 oh 4 86cl1 44 1 07h2o nanosheets after the calcination treatment the xrd pattern exhibited broad peaks which should be attributed to the relative lower crystalline nature derived from the ultrathin structure fig 1d the as synthesized yohcl displayed a flower like morphology that constructed with ultrathin nanosheets fig 1e the thickness of the nanosheets was determined to be about 2 nm fig 1f which contained two 8 37 å thick individual interlayers poudret et al 2008 notably yohcl nanosheets prepared by the direct calcination under air atmosphere posed an inhomogeneous distribution of thickness 2 4 nm fig s1 due to a relatively retard release of h2o and hcl although the sheet like morphology and crystalline was maintained fig s2 therefore a vacuum atmosphere could achieve more rapid and effective exfoliation resulting in ultrathin two dimensional 2d nanosheets with abundant adsorption sites additionally the yohcl nanosheets exhibit positive charges across a wide range of ph fig s3 which is beneficial for the removal of negative pfoa in aquatic environment 3 2 ultra high adsorption capacity of pfoa to assess the adsorption performance of as synthesized yohcl nanosheets adsorption kinetics was evaluated with the comparison to conventional adsorbents such as gac and ira 67 resins additionally mgal ldh a representative ldh with outstanding adsorption capacity for pfas hu et al 2017 was also included in the comparison fig s4 as shown in fig 2 a both yohcl nanosheets and mgal ldh exhibit fast and high uptake of pfoa while gac and ira 67 resins has a relatively low adsorption capacity more than 97 1 of pfoa could be removed after 8 h adsorption experiments by yohcl nanosheets in sharp contrast only 31 4 62 8 and 68 1 of pfoa was removed by gac ira resins and mgal ldh under the same conditions respectively meanwhile both yohcl and mgal ldh were well fitted with pseudo second order kinetic model fig s5 and yohcl s adsorption rate constant k 2 0 31 g mg 1 h 1 was much higher than mgal ldh k 2 0 22 g mg 1 h 1 additionally we also evaluated the adsorption performance of yohcl on the low concentration pfoa c0 500 µg l as shown in fig s6 yohcl exhibited superior adsorption capacity to low concentration pfoa achieving a removal efficiency higher than 91 which was much higher than mgal ldh and other typical adsorbents ira 67 and gac thus yohcl nanosheets exhibit great potential for the efficient removal of pfas the adsorption capacity of yohcl onto pfoa was determined based on equilibrium adsorption isotherm experiments as illustrated in fig 2b the equilibrium adsorption isotherms of yohcl were well fitted with langmuir model r2 0 928 slightly better than the freundlich model r2 0 909 table s1 in comparison mgal ldh perfectly fitted by langmuir model with a r2 value of 0 993 fig s7 indicating different adsorption mechanisms may occur in the yohcl pfoa system significantly the adsorption capacity of yohcl toward pfoa was determined to be 957 1 mg g which is 1 9 times and 9 3 times higher than that of mgal ldh 498 8 mg g and gac 103 2 mg g fig s8 yohcl nanosheets ultra high adsorption capacity toward pfoa is exceptionally higher than most other previously reported adsorbents table s2 furthermore the yohcl nanosheets displayed a robust regeneration ability and the removal efficiencies remained higher than 80 2 after 4 adsorption desorption cycles fig s9 without significant changes in the morphology and crystalline fig s10 overall yohcl nanosheets exhibited superior efficiency to remove pfoa with ultra high adsorption capacity making it a promising adsorbent for the remediation of pfas in aquatic system 3 3 stable removal performance across various water matrices as shown in fig 3 a the yohcl maintained high pfoa removal efficiency 97 across a wide range of ph 3 11 which was associated with its stable positive charges favoring the adsorption of pfoa fig s3 meanwhile the pfoa removal efficiency gradually decreased with the increase of ionic strength fig 3b as the high ionic strength would compress yohcl nanosheets electrical double layer to alter the surface charge goh et al 2008 furthermore the presence of cl would induce direct site competition between cl and pfoa which would also weaken the electrostatic attraction between pfoa and the positively charged yohcl pincus et al 2020 hence the electrostatic interactions between yohcl nanosheets and pfoa play a significant role in the adsorption similarly the increased ionic strength also inhibited mgal ldh s adsorption on pfoa however the adsorption efficiency exhibited more significantly drop compared to that of yohcl fig 3b given that mgal ldh has more positive charge in various ph fig s3 and higher surface area table s3 than yohcl it suggested that electrostatic interactions were not the only dominant mechanism for the adsorption of pfoa by yohcl nanosheets which would be investigated in the following section the effects of co exiting inorganic ions cl no3 hco3 and so4 2 on pfoa removal were also studied fig 3c the presence of cl or no3 exhibited minimum influence on pfoa adsorption by yohcl while the removal efficiency of mgal ldh remarkably decreased from 74 4 to 39 0 and 59 1 respectively on the other hand the co existing of hco3 and so4 2 inhibited the adsorption performance of yohcl and mgal ldh the strong affinity of hco3 co3 2 with the y hydroxide oxide laminates that would occupy the adsorption sites of yohcl to inhibit the adsorption of pfoa mishra et al 2018 and the suppression on the pfoa removal induced by so4 2 was attributed to strong binding affinity between divalent anions and yohcl nanosheets positive charges nevertheless yohcl nanosheets display higher anions resistance ability than mgal ldh for the removal of pfoa since the presence of natural organic matter would eliminate the adsorption performance of conventional adsorbents gagliano et al 2020 humic acid was added to evaluate the influence on the removal of pfoa intriguingly no obvious inhibition on the adsorption efficiency were observed for both yohcl and mgal ldh fig 3d which may be due to the hydrophilic nature of yohcl and mgal ldh and the hydrophobic interaction contributes minimum to the removal of pfoa hence yohcl nanosheets pose stable performance on the removal of pfas under various water matrices 3 4 molecular level insights on adsorption mechanism yohcl nanosheets exhibited excellent adsorption of pfoa with ultra high adsorption capacity which should be studied at molecular level to better understand the adsorption mechanism as shown in the stem and corresponding eds mapping spectra of yohcl after adsorption of pfoa defined as pfoa yohcl fluorine atoms were uniformly distributed over the whole nanosheets suggesting the strong affinity between pfoa and yohcl fig 4 a meanwhile yohcl nanosheets water contact angle shifted from 26 5 to 125 5 indicating yohcl become extremely hydrophobic after the uptake of pfoa which further demonstrated the robust yohcl pfoa binding fig 4b in addition qcm measurements a sensitive and real time measurements of pfoa adsorption desorption kinetics under flow liquid conditions were also performed fig 4c vashist and vashist 2011 as illustrated in fig 4d with injection of 100 ng l pfoa mgal ldh exhibited a weak change 52 hz of surface plasmon resonance spr frequency whereas a dramatical increase of frequency shift 110 hz was observed over yohcl loaded au chip according to the sauebrey equation δm 17 7 δf n where δm is the mass change δf is the frequency change n is the number of the harmonics of the fundamental resonance frequency tu et al 2015 the frequency change is proportional to the mass change and the higher frequency shift represent a better adsorption capability thus the above mentioned results proved that yohcl nanosheets have excellent binding ability with pfoa even at extremely low concentration the superior yohcl pfoa affinity was partly attributed to yohcl nanosheets ultrathin 2d structure which could expose abundant adsorption sites for pfoa fig 1f in addition the high mobility of cl in yohcl nanosheets interlayer confers efficient ion exchange with pfoa for high removal efficiency as the gradual release of cl was observed along the adsorption process fig 4e meanwhile the positively charged metal hydroxyl laminate in yohcl nanosheets contributes to the rapid adsorption of anionic pfoa molecule via electrostatic interactions fig s3 thus yohcl nanosheets ultrathin 2d structure with positive charge and abundant cl led to the ultra high adsorption capacity of pfoa via the multi mechanism of electrostatic attraction and ion exchange to further investigate the binding modes between pfoa and yohcl the absorption configuration was investigated by atr ftir as shown in fig 4f the peaks at 1692 cm 1 and 1462 cm 1 in pfoa molecules are ascribed to asymmetric υas coo and symmetric υs coo stretching vibration of carboxylate respectively gao and chorover 2012 however the wavenumbers of υas coo and υs coo of pfoa yohcl hypsochromic shifted to 1658 cm 1 and 1447 cm 1 typically the frequency difference δυ between υas coo and υs coo reflects the adsorption configuration between pfoa and the adsorbent and a monodentate coordination mode could be formed with larger δυ value compared to ionic δυ otherwise a bidentate or bridging coordination arisen deacon and phillips 1980 li et al 2012 since the δυ value 211 cm 1 of pfoa yohcl is much smaller than that of pfoa 230 cm 1 indicating strong bidentate or bridging coordination is formed in the yohcl pfoa system on the other hand y3d xps spectra showed a higher binding energy in the pfoa yohcl sample fig 4g since terminal carboxylate groups of pfoa molecules have a strong electron withdrawing ability the y atoms become more positive after pfoa adsorption which resulted in the binding energy shift to a higher position hence the lewis acidic coordinatively unsaturated yttrium sites could form a lewis acid base complex with terminal carboxylate groups of pfoa yang et al 2020 which would further strengthen pfoa yohcl affinity furthermore the 19fnmr analysis also confirmed the y terminal carboxylate coordination interactions as shown in fig 4h the chemical shift δ of f4 f8 in the pfoa molecule remained nearly unchanged after adsorption but δ f2 and δ f3 that proximal to terminal carboxylate group remarkably shifted to 111 and 101 from 96 and 109 respectively ning et al 2019 trang et al 2022 thus the presence of yohcl disturbed the chemical environment of f2 and f3 that adjacent to terminal carboxylate group indicating the formation of strong coordination interactions fig 4i overall the above molecular level investigations have revealed that multi mechanism including ion exchange electrostatic attraction and bidentate bridging coordination contributed to the strong pfoa yohcl affinity resulting in the ultra high adsorption capacity of pfoa fig 4j 3 5 simultaneous removal of multiple pfas by continuous flow column we developed proof of concept continuous flow column for simultaneous removal of multiple pfas at environmentally relevant concentrations fig 5 a specially yohcl gac column was fabricated by in situ calcination of ycl3 6h2o precursor over gac under vacuum a tap water solution containing humic acid 10 mg l and multiple pfas 500 μg l with various chain length c3 c8 was pumped through the column at a flow rate of 1 2 l h as shown in fig 5b and fig s11 both of gac and yohcl gac column exhibited a superior removal efficiency for long chain pfas while the removal ability decreased for the short chain pfas more than 99 of pfpea pfhxa pfhpa pfoa and pfos could be simultaneously removed by the yohcl gac column particularly in term of pfas with short chains only 22 of pfpra could be removed by conventional gac column whereas the removal efficiency of pfpra maintained higher than 64 over the yohcl gac column after long term operation 144 h furthermore yohcl gac column exhibits outstanding stability and feasibility for long term continuous flow operation as minimum leakage of yttrium was detected over the 144 h operation table s4 thus continuous flow yohcl gac column exhibits superior performance on simultaneous removal of multiple pfas with wide range of chain lengths which also poses great potential to be applied for the remediation of other persistent organic pollutants 4 conclusion in conclusion ultrathin yohcl nanosheets were synthesized by a one pot thermal exfoliation procedure and employed as effective adsorbents for pfas removal in the merits of the sufficient adsorption sites on the ultrathin 2d structure and strong affinity toward pfoa the yohcl nanosheets exhibited a rapid and superior adsorption ability to pfoa uptake an ultra high adsorption capacity of pfoa up to 957 1 mg g was achieved on yohcl nanosheets which is 1 9 times and 9 3 times higher than the state of the art mgal ldh and benchmark gac under the same conditions respectively in addition yohcl nanosheets could be adopted in continuous flow column for the simultaneous removal of multiple pfas with a wide range of chain lengths at environmentally relevant concentrations the molecular level investigations have revealed that multi mechanism including ion exchange electrostatic attraction and bidentate bridging coordination contributed to the strong pfoa yohcl affinity leading to ultra high adsorption capacity of pfoa we

15153,the global occurrence of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in aquatic systems has raised concerns about their adverse effects on ecosystems and human health adsorption is a promising technique for the remediation of pfas yet effective adsorbents with rapid uptake kinetics and high adsorption capacity are still in high demand and molecular level understanding of the interfacial adsorption mechanisms is lacking in this study we developed a superior layered rare earth hydroxide lrh adsorbent ultrathin y2 oh 4 86cl1 44 1 07h2o namely yohcl nanosheets to achieve the effective

double hydroxides mgal ldh and benchmark granular activated carbon gac under the same conditions respectively furthermore yohcl nanosheets pose stable performance on the removal of pfoa under various water matrices with robust reusability we also developed yohcl based continuous flow column demonstrating its promise in simultaneously removing multiple pfas with wide range of chain lengths at environmentally relevant concentrations with the molecular level investigations we have revealed that multi mechanism including ion exchange electrostatic attraction and bidentate bridging

exhibit high solubility and extreme persistence which are considered as forever chemicals rahman et al 2014 wang et al 2017 fiedler et al 2022 chronic exposure to pfas would induce adverse effects on human health by causing a series of diseases including thyroid disease high cholesterol liver damage reduced immune responses ulcerative colitis and even cancers ma et al 2022 potential health effects of pfas chemicals atsdr 2022 recently us environmental protection agency epa published enforceable limits for pfas in drinking water requiring no more than 0 004 parts per trillion ppt for perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and 0 02 ppt for perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos us epa 2016 which has posed urgent demand to develop advanced technologies for the efficient removal of pfas ding et al 2021 ng et al 2021 zhang et al 2023 adsorption is considered the most effective technique for the remediation of pfas owing to its robust water matrices tolerance and simplicity in engineering infrastructure with good economically feasible du et al 2014 vu and wu 2022 the conventional adsorbents for example activated carbon and commercial ion exchange resins e g purolite a 600 amberlite ira 67 have been applied to remove pfas in water treatment plants and household point of use systems boyer et al 2021 gagliano et al 2020 lenka et al 2021 however these conventional adsorbents suffer from sluggish adsorption kinetics low adsorption capacity and limited affinity toward pfas family with various chain lengths mccleaf et al 2017 xiao 2017 in addition the molecular level understanding of the adsorbents pfas interfacial mechanisms is lacking ateia et al 2019 the ideal candidate of the adsorbent for pfas removal should exhibit fast uptake rate and high adsorption capacity typically adsorbent with high hydrophilicity could accelerate the mass transfer of pfas from aqueous solution to solid phase in addition the adsorbent should present strong affinity to pfas family with various chain lengths and terminal groups e g pfoa pfos etc which may require the engagement of multiply interaction mechanisms and the stability and feasibility for long term continuous flow operation should also be taken into consideration calling for the outstanding structural steadiness however very few adsorbents could fully address the above challenges to achieve the efficient and effective removal of pfas evolved from layered double hydroxides ldh lrhs integrate rare earth elements with tailorable counter anions cl no3 so4 2 etc confined in their lamellar structure which has drawn ever increasing attention in recent years gándara et al 2006 liang et al 2014 the variability of the anionic composition endows lrhs with great potential for desired anions exchange without significant changes in the structure of metal hydroxide host which is beneficial to keep the structural integrity and confront to a long term operation geng et al 2010 yapryntsev et al 2020 for instance geng et al demonstrated the re oh 2 5cl0 5 0 8 h2o re eu tb etc could maintain their high crystalline after ion exchanged with various anions no3 so4 2 dodecylsulfonate etc geng et al 2008 consisting of positively charged metal hydroxide laminates and anions compensated in the interlayer lrhs exhibit an intrinsic positive nature to adsorb specific negatively charged containments e g pfoa via electrostatic attraction huo et al 2022 min et al 2022 yang et al 2022 additionally the coordinatively unsaturated rare earth metal ions in lrhs could render sufficient lewis acid sites which would result in strong coordination with lewis basic carboxylate hydroxyl or sulphonate groups of pfas liu et al 2015 tan et al 2022 thus lrhs could serve as outstanding adsorbents for pfas removal while have not been reported yet herein we present a novel adsorbent ultrathin y2 oh 4 86cl1 44 1 07h2o nanosheets namely yohcl for the efficient removal of pfoa in aquatic systems yohcl nanosheets exhibited a rapid removal of pfoa with ultrahigh adsorption capacity 957 1 mg g which was 1 9 fold and 9 3 fold compared to the state of the art mgal ldh adsorbent and benchmark granular activated carbon gac respectively molecular level investigations revealed that yohcl pfoa interfacial interactions were dominated by ion exchange electrostatic attraction and bidentate bridging coordination additionally a yohcl based continuous flow column was fabricated to simultaneously remove multiple pfas with various chain lengths with high efficiency at environmentally relevant concentrations we have demonstrated the promising application of lrhs to remove persistent pfas with sound molecular level insights 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical and materials all chemicals were analytical grade

and then dropwise added on 60 g gac the obtained composite was calcined at 500 c for 30 min under vacuum then washed with water for several times and dried at 105 c overnight finally 50 g yohcl gac was transferred into the column to perform the continuous flow column experiments a stock solution tap water with 10 mg l humic acid and multiple pfas spiked concentration of each compound is 500 μg l was continuously fed into the columns by using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1 2 l h the concentration of the effluents was analyzed by a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms the detailed analytic parameters were attached in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of the yohcl nanosheets a rapid thermal exfoliation approach was developed to prepare the yohcl ultrathin nanosheets in the present study fig 1 a when ycl3 6h2o was calcined in a pre heated tube furnace at a high temperature 500 c under vacuum a large quantity of h2o and hcl would be released immediately to drive exfoliation of layered ycl3 6h2o precursor zhao et al 2016 as shown in tg analysis fig 1b the weight was gradually declined to 41 94 of the initial mass during the calcination process the tg ms analysis further demonstrated that the evaporation of adsorbed h2o or crystalline h2o occurred from 70 c to 300 c and hcl was generated between 90 c and 270 c fig 1c other possible decomposition products such as hclo and cl2 were not detected in the calcination process suggesting the simultaneous stripping of cl and o from the ycl3 6h2o precursor to form hcl and h2o under an overlapped temperature sun et al 2018 yohcl crystal s transformation was completed at 400 c where the weight was stable and no more decomposition products were detected fig 1b and 1c as expected ycl3 6h2o was successfully decomposed into y2 oh 4 86cl1 44 1 07h2o nanosheets after the calcination treatment the xrd pattern exhibited broad peaks which should be attributed to the relative lower crystalline nature derived from the ultrathin structure fig 1d the as synthesized yohcl displayed a flower like morphology that constructed with ultrathin nanosheets fig 1e the thickness of the nanosheets was determined to be about 2 nm fig 1f which contained two 8 37 å thick individual interlayers poudret et al 2008 notably yohcl nanosheets prepared by the direct calcination under air atmosphere posed an inhomogeneous distribution of thickness 2 4 nm fig s1 due to a relatively retard release of h2o and hcl although the sheet like morphology and crystalline was maintained fig s2 therefore a vacuum atmosphere could achieve more rapid and effective exfoliation resulting in ultrathin two dimensional 2d nanosheets with abundant adsorption sites additionally the yohcl nanosheets exhibit positive charges across a wide range of ph fig s3 which is beneficial for the removal of negative pfoa in aquatic environment 3 2 ultra high adsorption capacity of pfoa to assess the adsorption performance of as synthesized yohcl nanosheets adsorption kinetics was evaluated with the comparison to conventional adsorbents such as gac and ira 67 resins additionally mgal ldh a representative ldh with outstanding adsorption capacity for pfas hu et al 2017 was also included in the comparison fig s4 as shown in fig 2 a both yohcl nanosheets and mgal ldh exhibit fast and high uptake of pfoa while gac and ira 67 resins has a relatively low adsorption capacity more than 97 1 of pfoa could be removed after 8 h adsorption experiments by yohcl nanosheets in sharp contrast only 31 4 62 8 and 68 1 of pfoa was removed by gac ira resins and mgal ldh under the same conditions respectively meanwhile both yohcl and mgal ldh were well fitted with pseudo second order kinetic model fig s5 and yohcl s adsorption rate constant k 2 0 31 g mg 1 h 1 was much higher than mgal ldh k 2 0 22 g mg 1 h 1 additionally we also evaluated the adsorption performance of yohcl on the low concentration pfoa c0 500 µg l as shown in fig s6 yohcl exhibited superior adsorption capacity to low concentration pfoa achieving a removal efficiency higher than 91 which was much higher than mgal ldh and other typical adsorbents ira 67 and gac thus yohcl nanosheets exhibit great potential for the efficient removal of pfas the adsorption capacity of yohcl onto pfoa was determined based on equilibrium adsorption isotherm experiments as illustrated in fig 2b the equilibrium adsorption isotherms of yohcl were well fitted with langmuir model r2 0 928 slightly better than the freundlich model r2 0 909 table s1 in comparison mgal ldh perfectly fitted by langmuir model with a r2 value of 0 993 fig s7 indicating different adsorption mechanisms may occur in the yohcl pfoa system significantly the adsorption capacity of yohcl toward pfoa was determined to be 957 1 mg g which is 1 9 times and 9 3 times higher than that of mgal ldh 498 8 mg g and gac 103 2 mg g fig s8 yohcl nanosheets ultra high adsorption capacity toward pfoa is exceptionally higher than most other previously reported adsorbents table s2 furthermore the yohcl nanosheets displayed a robust regeneration ability and the removal efficiencies remained higher than 80 2 after 4 adsorption desorption cycles fig s9 without significant changes in the morphology and crystalline fig s10 overall yohcl nanosheets exhibited superior efficiency to remove pfoa with ultra high adsorption capacity making it a promising adsorbent for the remediation of pfas in aquatic system 3 3 stable removal performance across various water matrices as shown in fig 3 a the yohcl maintained high pfoa removal efficiency 97 across a wide range of ph 3 11 which was associated with its stable positive charges favoring the adsorption of pfoa fig s3 meanwhile the pfoa removal efficiency gradually decreased with the increase of ionic strength fig 3b as the high ionic strength would compress yohcl nanosheets electrical double layer to alter the surface charge goh et al 2008 furthermore the presence of cl would induce direct site competition between cl and pfoa which would also weaken the electrostatic attraction between pfoa and the positively charged yohcl pincus et al 2020 hence the electrostatic interactions between yohcl nanosheets and pfoa play a significant role in the adsorption similarly the increased ionic strength also inhibited mgal ldh s adsorption on pfoa however the adsorption efficiency exhibited more significantly drop compared to that of yohcl fig 3b given that mgal ldh has more positive charge in various ph fig s3 and higher surface area table s3 than yohcl it suggested that electrostatic interactions were not the only dominant mechanism for the adsorption of pfoa by yohcl nanosheets which would be investigated in the following section the effects of co exiting inorganic ions cl no3 hco3 and so4 2 on pfoa removal were also studied fig 3c the presence of cl or no3 exhibited minimum influence on pfoa adsorption by yohcl while the removal efficiency of mgal ldh remarkably decreased from 74 4 to 39 0 and 59 1 respectively on the other hand the co existing of hco3 and so4 2 inhibited the adsorption performance of yohcl and mgal ldh the strong affinity of hco3 co3 2 with the y hydroxide oxide laminates that would occupy the adsorption sites of yohcl to inhibit the adsorption of pfoa mishra et al 2018 and the suppression on the pfoa removal induced by so4 2 was attributed to strong binding affinity between divalent anions and yohcl nanosheets positive charges nevertheless yohcl nanosheets display higher anions resistance ability than mgal ldh for the removal of pfoa since the presence of natural organic matter would eliminate the adsorption performance of conventional adsorbents gagliano et al 2020 humic acid was added to evaluate the influence on the removal of pfoa intriguingly no obvious inhibition on the adsorption efficiency were observed for both yohcl and mgal ldh fig 3d which may be due to the hydrophilic nature of yohcl and mgal ldh and the hydrophobic interaction contributes minimum to the removal of pfoa hence yohcl nanosheets pose stable performance on the removal of pfas under various water matrices 3 4 molecular level insights on adsorption mechanism yohcl nanosheets exhibited excellent adsorption of pfoa with ultra high adsorption capacity which should be studied at molecular level to better understand the adsorption mechanism as shown in the stem and corresponding eds mapping spectra of yohcl after adsorption of pfoa defined as pfoa yohcl fluorine atoms were uniformly distributed over the whole nanosheets suggesting the strong affinity between pfoa and yohcl fig 4 a meanwhile yohcl nanosheets water contact angle shifted from 26 5 to 125 5 indicating yohcl become extremely hydrophobic after the uptake of pfoa which further demonstrated the robust yohcl pfoa binding fig 4b in addition qcm measurements a sensitive and real time measurements of pfoa adsorption desorption kinetics under flow liquid conditions were also performed fig 4c vashist and vashist 2011 as illustrated in fig 4d with injection of 100 ng l pfoa mgal ldh exhibited a weak change 52 hz of surface plasmon resonance spr frequency whereas a dramatical increase of frequency shift 110 hz was observed over yohcl loaded au chip according to the sauebrey equation δm 17 7 δf n where δm is the mass change δf is the frequency change n is the number of the harmonics of the fundamental resonance frequency tu et al 2015 the frequency change is proportional to the mass change and the higher frequency shift represent a better adsorption capability thus the above mentioned results proved that yohcl nanosheets have excellent binding ability with pfoa even at extremely low concentration the superior yohcl pfoa affinity was partly attributed to yohcl nanosheets ultrathin 2d structure which could expose abundant adsorption sites for pfoa fig 1f in addition the high mobility of cl in yohcl nanosheets interlayer confers efficient ion exchange with pfoa for high removal efficiency as the gradual release of cl was observed along the adsorption process fig 4e meanwhile the positively charged metal hydroxyl laminate in yohcl nanosheets contributes to the rapid adsorption of anionic pfoa molecule via electrostatic interactions fig s3 thus yohcl nanosheets ultrathin 2d structure with positive charge and abundant cl led to the ultra high adsorption capacity of pfoa via the multi mechanism of electrostatic attraction and ion exchange to further investigate the binding modes between pfoa and yohcl the absorption configuration was investigated by atr ftir as shown in fig 4f the peaks at 1692 cm 1 and 1462 cm 1 in pfoa molecules are ascribed to asymmetric υas coo and symmetric υs coo stretching vibration of carboxylate respectively gao and chorover 2012 however the wavenumbers of υas coo and υs coo of pfoa yohcl hypsochromic shifted to 1658 cm 1 and 1447 cm 1 typically the frequency difference δυ between υas coo and υs coo reflects the adsorption configuration between pfoa and the adsorbent and a monodentate coordination mode could be formed with larger δυ value compared to ionic δυ otherwise a bidentate or bridging coordination arisen deacon and phillips 1980 li et al 2012 since the δυ value 211 cm 1 of pfoa yohcl is much smaller than that of pfoa 230 cm 1 indicating strong bidentate or bridging coordination is formed in the yohcl pfoa system on the other hand y3d xps spectra showed a higher binding energy in the pfoa yohcl sample fig 4g since terminal carboxylate groups of pfoa molecules have a strong electron withdrawing ability the y atoms become more positive after pfoa adsorption which resulted in the binding energy shift to a higher position hence the lewis acidic coordinatively unsaturated yttrium sites could form a lewis acid base complex with terminal carboxylate groups of pfoa yang et al 2020 which would further strengthen pfoa yohcl affinity furthermore the 19fnmr analysis also confirmed the y terminal carboxylate coordination interactions as shown in fig 4h the chemical shift δ of f4 f8 in the pfoa molecule remained nearly unchanged after adsorption but δ f2 and δ f3 that proximal to terminal carboxylate group remarkably shifted to 111 and 101 from 96 and 109 respectively ning et al 2019 trang et al 2022 thus the presence of yohcl disturbed the chemical environment of f2 and f3 that adjacent to terminal carboxylate group indicating the formation of strong coordination interactions fig 4i overall the above molecular level investigations have revealed that multi mechanism including ion exchange electrostatic attraction and bidentate bridging coordination contributed to the strong pfoa yohcl affinity resulting in the ultra high adsorption capacity of pfoa fig 4j 3 5 simultaneous removal of multiple pfas by continuous flow column we developed proof of concept continuous flow column for simultaneous removal of multiple pfas at environmentally relevant concentrations fig 5 a specially yohcl gac column was fabricated by in situ calcination of ycl3 6h2o precursor over gac under vacuum a tap water solution containing humic acid 10 mg l and multiple pfas 500 μg l with various chain length c3 c8 was pumped through the column at a flow rate of 1 2 l h as shown in fig 5b and fig s11 both of gac and yohcl gac column exhibited a superior removal efficiency for long chain pfas while the removal ability decreased for the short chain pfas more than 99 of pfpea pfhxa pfhpa pfoa and pfos could be simultaneously removed by the yohcl gac column particularly in term of pfas with short chains only 22 of pfpra could be removed by conventional gac column whereas the removal efficiency of pfpra maintained higher than 64 over the yohcl gac column after long term operation 144 h furthermore yohcl gac column exhibits outstanding stability and feasibility for long term continuous flow operation as minimum leakage of yttrium was detected over the 144 h operation table s4 thus continuous flow yohcl gac column exhibits superior performance on simultaneous removal of multiple pfas with wide range of chain lengths which also poses great potential to be applied for the remediation of other persistent organic pollutants 4 conclusion in conclusion ultrathin yohcl nanosheets were synthesized by a one pot thermal exfoliation procedure and employed as effective adsorbents for pfas removal in the merits of the sufficient adsorption sites on the ultrathin 2d structure and strong affinity toward pfoa the yohcl nanosheets exhibited a rapid and superior adsorption ability to pfoa uptake an ultra high adsorption capacity of pfoa up to 957 1 mg g was achieved on yohcl nanosheets which is 1 9 times and 9 3 times higher than the state of the art mgal ldh and benchmark gac under the same conditions respectively in addition yohcl nanosheets could be adopted in continuous flow column for the simultaneous removal of multiple pfas with a wide range of chain lengths at environmentally relevant concentrations the molecular level investigations have revealed that multi mechanism including ion exchange electrostatic attraction and bidentate bridging coordination contributed to the strong pfoa yohcl affinity leading to ultra high adsorption capacity of pfoa we

15154,the pollution or eutrophication affected by dissolved organic matter dom composition and sources of inland waters had attracted concerns from the public and government in china combined with remote sensing techniques the fluorescent dom fdom parameters accounted for the important part of optical constituent as chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom was a useful tool to trace relative dom sources and assess the trophic states for large scale regions comprehensively and timely here the objective of this research is to calibrate and validate a general model based on landsat 8 oli product embedded in google earth engine gee for deriving humification index hix based on eems in lakes across china the landsat surface reflectance was matched with 1150 pairs fieldtrip samples and the nine sensitive spectral variables with good correlation with hix were selected as the inputs in machine learning methods the calibration of xgboost model r2 0 86 rmse 0 29 outperformed other models our results indicated that the entire dataset of hix has a strong association with landsat reflectance yielding low root mean square error between measured and predicted hix r2 0 81 rmse 0 42 for lakes in china finally the optimal xgboost model was used to calculate the spatial distribution of hix of 2015 and 2020 in typical lakes selected from the report on the state of the ecology and environment in china the significant decreasing of hix from 2015 to 2020 with trophic states showed positive control of humification level of lakes based on the published document of action plan for prevention and control of water pollution in 2015 of china the calibrated model would greatly facilitate fdom monitoring in lakes and provide indicators for relative dom sources to evaluate the impact of water protection measures or human disturbance effect from covid 19 lockdown and offer the government supervision to improve the water quality management for lake ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is an important type of organic matter in inland waters which widely derived from terrestrial sources and affected the ecological systems food web dynamics and global carbon cycling pace et al 2004 tranvik et al 2009 wilkinson et al 2013 lake ecosystems as the most important part of inland waters are linked to environmental and climate changes adrian et al 2006 despite account for only small fraction of the water resources for earth s surface verpoorter et al 2014 a significant amount of the terrestrial matters is transported laterally along the fluvial continuum to aquatic systems fasching et al 2014 the chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom of terrestrial deliveries was often understood as a central role in aquatic light regime trophic status and even safety of drinking water supply lapierre et al 2013 shang et al 2019 meanwhile the increase of urbanization development with rapid economic growth influence the variations of terrestrial organic composition and microbial degradation processes and this would bring uncertainty to regional aquatic ecosystems and ecological crises as well bai et al 2012 smith et al 2018 the drivers of dom quality for inland waters has remained challenging due to its extreme heterogeneity marın spiotta et al 2014 the three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy along with cdom absorption enable us to analyze the relative source and composition of dom in previous studies stedmon and bro 2008 stedmon and markager 2005 henderson et al 2009 singh et al 2010 shang et al 2021 minor et al 2021 the eem was considered as a sensitive and rapid way to evaluate sources and composition of dom rapidly he et al 2016 sgroi et al 2016 the properties of dom for lake ecosystems are different from those of dom in marine systems due to the variations in degree of human activities salinity microbial activities song et al 2019 the use of eem with the shifting of the emission spectra toward longer wavelengths indicated the extent of increasing humification has been proposed as humification index hix krishnarao et al 2001 and the biological index bix310 huguet et al 2009 and fluorescence peak ratio index zhou et al 2017 were proposed for proxying cdom sources as well moreover the peak c derived from parafac analysis could be used to demonstrate terrestrial carbon to lakes painter et al 2018 however the changes in dom composition and sources related to lake distribution in large scale regions remain poorly understood which may affect the management of water quality for lakes ecosystems recently the published document of action plan for prevention and control of water pollution in 2015 is an important step to concern the environmental monitoring for inland waters therefore using remote sensing techniques to explore the large scale temporal spatial patterns of dom sources with fluorescence spectrum is essential and urgent especially for the monitoring efforts of water quality with variations of dom sources to manage the water pollution thanks to the development of remote sensing techniques for water color and water quality the traditional empirical semi empirical and semi analytical algorithms of cdom optical characteristics was intensively studied to elucidate the distribution and dynamics of cdom kutser et al 2005 massicotte et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 recently with the good relationship between optical characteristics and fluorescent components researchers tried to establish indirect cdom fluorescent components algorithms based on remote sensing wavelength bands and the absorption shifting of cdom at the 254 and 443 nm miao et al 2019 the newly machine learning methods such as regularized linear regression lr random forest rf xgboost and support vector machines svm have been used to estimate cdom without considering the classification of water optical properties ruescas et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 cao et al 2020 similarly the remote sensing retrieval of fluorescent index with machine learning methods is potential and accessible to be developed for characterizing cdom components and sources the launch of ocean color satellites with a series of sensors provided the longest satellite imagery data in the world which offers opportunities for long term monitoring of cdom properties kloiber et al 2002 olmanson et al 2016 chen et al 2017 xu et al 2018 moreover the google earth engine gee platform provided a very convenient way to study optical variations for temporal spatial pattern for large scale scales gorelick et al 2017 kuhn et al 2019 the potential to track inland water dom fluorescent variation based on gee has not been widely explored at national scale across china in view of the lack of fluorescent property algorithm and landsat 8 oli sensor application this study tried to develop a machine learning algorithm for dom fluorescent parameter with good performance in lakes across china and demonstrate its environmental linkage with human activities and water quality management the objectives of the study are to 1 explore a uniform and simple fluorescent parameter which could be linked to optical characteristics and water quality parameters 2 calibrate and validate the fluorescent parameter model using optical remote sensing imagery by machine learning algorithms with field site samples from lakes over china 3 examine and compare the transferable performance of optimal algorithms using sentinel 2 sensors and 4 map fluorescent parameter in typical lakes for temporal spatial pattern using landsat oli data and discuss the linkage with environmental effect and water quality management this study could support the understanding of dom sources of lake on large scale regions in response to anthropogenic activities and environmental management 2 methods and materials 2 1 study region and water sampling china is abundant with water resources including 2800 large lakes 1 km2 and 27 000 mid size lakes between 1 ha and 1 km2 distributed in different regions of the country the different regions with complex terrains and climatic hydrological condition contribute to the variations of optical properties or trophic states due to the different sources of organic matter to aquatic systems specially the high altitude tibet qinghai region with few human activities and intense solar radiation would affect the biogeochemical sources and compositions of dom to some extent liu et al 2021 song et al 2019 china s unbalanced economic pattern would also affect the regional organic input to aquatic environment with different intense of anthropogenic activities between southeastern regions and northwestern regions in this study we carried out 12 fieldtrips to collect 1370 samples from over 260 lakes distributed evenly across china during 2015 to 2021 the water samples were stored in 1 l polyethylene bottles using car refrigerator at 4 c the water samples were filtered as soon as possible at the nights of each sampling date immediately and then transported to the laboratory as soon as possible the gps receiver and ysi 600 xlm sondes ysi inc yellow springs oh were used to record the sampling locations and water quality parameters the secchi disk was used to record the secchi disk depth the sampling sites of lakes across china in this study are shown in fig 1 2 2 laboratory measurements and analysis the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was measured with shimadzu toc 5000 analyzer after being filtered with a 0 4 µm microporous membrane filter in the fieldtrips shang et al 2022 the cdom absorption coefficient indicated the relative concentration of cdom was obtained with a shimadzu uv vis spectrophotometer after filtering 0 22 µm polycarbonate membrane filters the fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems was measured with hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer and the parafac analysis was used to track different components of cdom the humification index hix represented the humification degree of dom such as weak humification hix 4 and strong humification hix 10 in general the higher degree of humification the better stability and the longer the existence time in the environment huguet et al 2009 weishaar et al 2003 bix310 was an autochthonous parameter which reflects the relative contribution of dom autochthonous source in water very less autochthonous dom bix310 0 6 more autochthonous dom bix310 1 birdwell and valsaraj 2010 fi370 is a fluorescence index to distinguish between terrestrially fi370 1 4 and microbially fi370 1 9 derived fulvic acids mcknight et al 2001 humic like fluorescence was indicated as fn 355 and protein like fluorescence was indicated as fn 280 song et al 2019 the detailed description is shown in table s1 of si 2 3 image acquisition and processing in order to establish the remote sensing models for fdom parameters and to quantify the spatial variation of dom sources we used the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps data after atmospheric correction using land surface reflectance code lasrc software from the google earth engine platform which was derived from surface reflectance product from landsat 8 oli to match the field sampling datasets for forming a match up dataset involving ground derived and satellite derived images with a time window of 7 days considering the temporal resolution revisit time of 16 days and the impact of cloud contamination 10 gorelick et al 2017 the cloud free landsat 8 images in the ice free period was collected and the landsat surface reflectance was matched with sampling date to obtain matched pairs to calibrate and validate the model the mean reflectance of 3 3 pixel around the gps of sampling sites was extracted to calibrate and validate the models toming et al 2016 the final remote sensing reflectance rrs was obtained by dividing the surface reflectance by 3 14 zhang in order to test the transferability of the selected model the free accessed sentinel 2 images were downloaded to match with the field dataset the atmospheric correction ac processors for sentinel 2 toolboxes sen2cor sentinel 2 correction was used to obtain level 2a product the detailed description could be found in li et al 2021 similarly the 3 3 pixel centered reflectance at field sampling sites with a time window of 7 days was employed to test the application of model with sentinel 2 images toming et al 2016 2 4 model calibration validation and application the matched pairs of in situ and landsat surface reflectance were selected according to the same rules including stable weather with less cloud and precipitation and avoiding sampling in the nearshore depending on the quality of image the matched images acquired during summer and fall were selected as previous study demonstrated the remote sensing images in summer and fall were relatively stable in this study 1150 samples from 236 lakes 2015 2020 were chosen to calibrate n 766 and validate n 384 the model performance we employed four machine learning algorithms most widely used in remote sensing and environment science such as linear regression lr support vector machine svm extreme gradient boosting xgboost and random forest rf to calibrate the hix model the detailed processes of machine learning algorithms are shown in supplementary information si to test the model transferability we also used 236 fieldtrip samples from 30 typical lakes 2016 2019 to match the sentinel 2 images from the google earth engine platform within 7 days and test the transferability of selected model with best accuracy all in all we used the optimal model eventually to map the humification index in typical lakes across china according to the report on the state of the ecology and environment in china 2015 and 2020 using surface reflectance product from landsat 8 oli embedded in gee examine hix variation in both time and space 2 5 statistical analyses the regression and correlation analysis were carried out by spss 16 0 software spss chicago illinois usa considering significant levels p 0 05 we use determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute percent errors mape to assess model performance between measured and predicted hix the information including social data and the trophic states of the mapped typical lakes were collected from the chinese city statistical yearbook and the report on the state of the ecology and environment in china 2015 2020 3 results 3 1 distribution of in situ hix and relationships with environmental parameters the measured datasets for fdom analysis including parafac hix bix310 and fi370 showed wide ranges and variations across china table 1 three components c1 c3 of parafac analysis were identified with lowest squared error and successful split half validation the c1 components of parafac was similar to humic c peak ex em 250 nm 438 nm stedmon et al 2011 jørgensen et al 2011 c2 component was considered as the terrestrial fulvic origin or the terrestrially derived humic like products ex em 230 nm 430 nm stedmon et al 2003 and c3 component was a protein like t peak in the uva region ex em 280 nm 325 nm coble 1996 walker et al 2013 table s2 and fig s1 the fluorescent intensity of humic like c1 and c2 were significantly higher than that of protein like c3 p 0 05 our hix dataset ranged from 1 12 to 30 9 with a mean hix value of 8 23 6 79 meanwhile the bix310 and fi370 ranged from 0 068 to 3 586 and from 0 556 to 3 586 respectively the hix is significantly correlated to c1 c2 bix310 and other water quality parameters p 0 05 fig 2 with the increasing of trophic status the in situ hix increased significantly p 0 05 table s3 the samples with weak humification hix 4 accounted for 23 while strong humification hix 10 accounted for 35 of the water samples the stronger humification levels the higher fluorescent intensity of terrestrial humic like component c1 and c2 the lower bix310 and fi370 p 0 05 table s4 therefore due to the convenience for calculation and comparison for hix hix could be considered as a potential remote sensing parameter for monitoring the relative dom sources and it is a bridge to link to other optical parameters to understand environmental changes 3 2 model calibration and validation correlation analyses of hix with all possible single band band ratios band combinations were computed preliminarily select the most sensitive spectral variables based on the correlation coefficients we selected the most sensitive spectral variables as the inputs for hix estimates blue green green red coastal green coastal red green red red nir blue green red nir table 2 in order to obtain a remote sensing model of hix with good performance and universality the statistical metrics of four machine learning algorithms including linear regression lr support vector machine svm extreme gradient boosting xgboost and random forest rf are computed to calibrate the models of hix table s3 the xgboost model r2 0 86 mape 28 76 rmse 0 29 outperformed svm model r2 0 83 mape 32 97 rmse 0 41 the lr r2 0 71 mape 61 97 rmse 0 51 and rf model r2 0 80 mape 50 41 rmse 0 43 with good fitting performance slope close to 1 and relative low mape and rmse table s3 comparison between in situ hix values in the calibration datasets and predicted hix derived from the xgboost model showed near linear relationship while the other models show poor linear performances fig 3 the validation result of xgboost model was also satisfactory fig 4 as indicated by higher r2 values of 0 81 and lower rmse of 0 42 compared with validation results of other three models table 3 even though there were significant relationships between in situ and predicted hix by the svm model svm model and lr model in the validation datasets these models have poor performances with uneven linear distribution at high level of hix especially fig 4 hence we used the xgboost as the final calibration model for lake datasets across china 3 3 hix mapping of typical lakes in china as an example the calibrated xgboost model was used to calculate the spatial distribution of hix of 2015 and 2020 in 33 typical lakes selected from the report on the state of the ecology and environment in china figs 5 6 the hix distribution for some typical lakes were shown in figs 7 8 the mean hix in typical lakes ranged from 1 49 to 17 96 with average of 7 41 of 2015 and ranged from 1 34 to 11 22 with the average of 8 25 for 2020 the humification levels of lakes trends to decrease significantly during the period of 2015 to 2020 p 0 05 in terms of trophic states the mean hix for oligotrophic lakes mesotrophic lakes and eutrophic lakes were 3 27 1 83 8 83 7 21 and 13 45 8 51 respectively the high hix was observed in khanka lake 11 96 and hulun lake 11 47 while the low hix was found in tibetan lakes such as namucuo lake 3 33 with the increasing of trophic states the hix increased significantly in both 2015 r2 0 35 slope 0 098 p 0 05 and 2020 r2 0 34 slope 0 074 p 0 05 the hix nearshore was generally higher than that of the center of lake in terms of the individual lakes as mapping result of 2015 and 2020 the percentage of weak humification levels 4 accounted for 12 of all mapped lakes while the strong humification levels 10 accounted for 21 of all lakes with the better the stability and the longer the existence time in the aquatic environment 68 of the lakes were underlying the decreasing of hix from 2015 to 2020 4 discussion 4 1 model implication advantage and limitations previous studies have developed empirical models and semi analytical approaches to map cdom indices based on reflectance from satellites joshi et al 2017 cao et al 2018 griffin et al 2018 however these algorithms were hard to overcome the poor generalizability for different waters and multicollinearity problems chen et al 2019 sun et al 2021 the machine learning algorithm of hix would be a choice for complex optical environments most of the cdom estimation methods focus on absorption parameters for a few lakes therefore this study tried to use the machine learning algorithm to estimation to calibrate the fdom indices for large scale regions overcoming the problems above mentioned for cdom absorption the empirical models for single bands and band combination for hix were tested with the best performance of r2 for 0 61 green red the empirical models underestimated all values of hix above 5 the xgboost model r2 0 80 outperformed the empirical models the results indicate that the constructed model of hix has obvious advantages in terms of the r2 and rmse the general classification of hix included three types 4 4 10 and 10 therefore it is essential to evaluate if the confidence limits are small enough to show a statistical difference under different classification according to the study from prairie 1996 for the validation number of 383 t0 05 is 1 65 rmse of xgboost is 0 42 95 of points will lie on the product of t and rmse units from the regression line therefore the precision of the predicted hix values for 95 confidence is the width of 1 38 we believe that the predictive precision would satisfy the classification of hix to some extent the potential for the remote sensing calibration of fluorescent properties using machine learning algorithms has been identified in this study however the validation results showed that for the high humification levels the hix would be underestimated to some extent while the training data for calibration is with the large scale distribution of china to improve the application and portability of the algorithm of hix in order to test the model performance and spatial transferability xgboost model of hix was applied to sentinel 2 images n 236 our results also highlighted that large difference in the validation of transferability of sentinel 2 can decrease model performance fig 9 due to the differences of atmospheric correction and the center of wavelength pflug et al 2019 miao et al 2019 established an optical algorithm for estimating terrestrial humic like substances with band ratios of sentinel 3 olci and considered the management unit mathematical model method is a better choice for olci sensor atmospheric correction for inland waters meanwhile the performance of the xgboost algorithm is constrained by the distribution of calibrated data and the parameter settings the application of the models to some regions with few data may affect the accuracy of the model as well therefore the further research should consider machine learning algorithms with satellite imagery with better temporal spatial and spectral resolution to improve estimation accuracy of hix to evaluate the dom sources in different types of inland water especially for small lakes also the classification of water types such as salinity doc concentration trophic states and the optical characteristics should be considered to improve the accuracy as well 4 2 the linkages of hix with environmental factors and lake area the humification levels of lakes trends to decrease significantly with the comparison of 2015 and 2020 for typical lakes mentioned from the report on the state of the ecology and environment in china this indicated the potential performance for government based on the published document of action plan for prevention and control of water pollution in 2015 also the analysis for the differences of hix from 2015 to 2020 along with trophic status fig 10 a showed that with the decreasing of trophic status the hix trended to decrease significantly p 0 05 this indicated that the oligotrophic lakes were abundant with more biological or recent autochthonous component and the eutrophic lakes were with more terrigenous contribution zhang et al 2010 the clean water such as oligotrophic lakes and mesotrophic lakes in the case study were always the natural reserves with less human disturbance and strict water quality management the lake ecosystems were relatively healthy and easy to restore as instability of the ecosystem and ultimately the clear water qin et al 2013 however the eutrophic lakes were gradually shifting to a turbid water algae dominated ecosystem bhateria and jain 2016 the rising terrestrial dom would also imply greater nutrients input from the catchment and trigger phytoplankton growth and increased risk of hypoxia kissman et al 2017 beck et al 2018 similarly the previous study had also shown a significant correlation between modified trophic state index tsim and hix in chinese manmade lakes which indicated the potential role of hix as a remote sensing proxy shang et al 2019 with the rapid development of social economics the terrestrial influences had become the vital sources to lakes especially for urbanized lakes the covid 19 corona virus disease 2019 was first identified in the city of wuhan of china the fatal virus spread rapidly which cause a lockdown of wuhan the measures in response to covid 19 including manufacturing industries transportation and mobility of people were positive for environmental improvement dantas et al 2020 the comparison of hix variation in the typical lakes of wuhan before and after the lockdown fig 10b indicated the significant decrease of terrestrial input of dom with less human activities the decreasing hix from 2019 to 2020 during the lockdown of the city may due to less humic like substance input the less anthropogenic disturbances could affect the amount and quality of terrestrial dom delivered to nearby waterbodies butman et al 2015 also the lake hydrological attributes such as lakes areas was also related to the humification levels based on the classification of trophic states for eutrophic lakes the pearson coefficient for correlations between hix and lake areas is 0 55 p 0 001 and the pearson coefficient for correlations between hix and lake areas in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes is 0 53 p 0 001 table s5 which indicated that the lakes with large areas would be have less humic like and fulvic like substances than small lakes the lakes with small areas are likely to be affected by terrestrial sources with strong variations of area fluctuation related to climatic conditions such as the seasonal lakes which will bring more terrestrial organic matters flushing to lakes dvomikov et al 2018 in terms of large lakes even though the terrestrial sources of dom affects significantly the autochthonous sources are complex for large lakes the disturbance for fluctuated areas with terrestrial sources input is weaker than that of small lakes the result indicated that we should also concern about the linkages between the lake attributes and dom sources except environmental factors therefore the mapping of hix could be considered as a potential proxy linked to environmental factors and lake attributes to evaluate the terrestrial sources effectively also researchers demonstrated that the decline in industrial activity would contribute to the improvement of water quality wang and yang 2016 our results confirmed that the hix is positively correlated to the numbers of industrial parks within 10 km of the lake p 0 05 r 0 66 n 28 lakes and when the numbers of industrial parks around the lake exceeds 30 the hix trends to be stable this phenomenon could demonstrate that the migration of industrial activities near the crucial lake ecosystems is necessary and essential to control the terrestrial waste input as dom sources yang et al 2013 comprehensively the natural terrestrial and anthropogenic factors all contributed to the humification levels of lakes and the distribution of hix is vital to be a bridge to study the dom sources and driving factors 4 3 implications for water quality management of lake ecosystems the proposed models of estimating hix is crucial for reflecting the aquatic dom sources and human activities the intensity of humic like sources of dom would increase along with the large number of villages and factories around the lakes and the directly discharges for industrial waste water and residential sewage water miao et al 2019 remote sensing of hix had potential to monitoring the changes of dom sources into lakes from the perspective of human activities and aquatic phytoplankton activities in large scale continents the significant variations of hix for typical lakes between inland lake region hixin 3 95 and out flowing lake region hixout 9 87 were found p 0 05 which indicated biogeochemical and hydrological conditions and human activities contributed to the changes of humification levels the hix had been reported to be related the trophic status and cdom concentration positively zhang et al 2010 shang et al 2019 the monitoring hix for different trophic status would offer the government supervision to improve the water quality management for lake ecosystems and control the pollutant into lakes to threat the drinking waters and human health it is reported that the high humification levels of the water is with more risk to occur the kashin beck disease an et al 1999 this was similar to our result that the average hix of typical lakes in 12 provinces was correlated to the numbers of counties with kashin beck disease r 0 52 p 0 05 fig s2 according to the chinese health statistics yearbook of 2020 however the detailed environmental mechanism of how humic matter can cause metabolic disorder of chondroitin sulfate should be explored for pathological mechanism in the future this study indicated that the humification level could affect the safety of human health and water quality significantly also it had been mentioned that the hix was related to some water quality parameters such as doc ec and bix310 so the monitoring of hix could be a bridge to estimate the water quality parameters for complex inland waters especially that without significant optical characteristics the terrestrial humic like substances were relatively low in the period of cyanobacteria blooms with more microbial degradation chen et al 2018 meanwhile the intensity of fdom during the blooms was obviously higher than those for non blooms zhao et al 2009 the abnormal changes of hix is a potential signal to early warning of algal blooms this study provided an illustration of the utility of remote sensing methods to quantify changes of dom sources with fluorescent properties in response to environmental drivers and water quality management of lake ecosystems 5 conclusions estimation of hix in lakes across china from landsat 8 imagery data provides a new angle and an effective tool to synoptically monitor dom sources related to water quality of lakes at a national scale we established machine learning models with satellite surface reflectance products derived from landsat ldeaps embedded in gee platform the calibrated in situ dataset obtained in different regions covering complex optical properties contribute to the reliability of the models the xgboost model outperformed svm model the lr and rf model with relatively low mape and rmse comparison between in situ hix values in the calibration datasets and predicted hix derived from the xgboost model showed near linear relationship while the other models show poor linear performances however the validation of transferability of sentinel 2 images is poor for further multi source data fusion due to the differences of atmospheric correction and the center of wavelength the application of the remote sensing monitoring hix variations for representative lakes across china in 2015 and 2020 would offer the government supervision to improve the water quality management for lake ecosystems and positive control the pollutant into lakes based on the published document of action plan for prevention and control of water pollution in 2015 further models trained with more datasets collected from various types of lakes and multiple satellite sensors with different resolutions was used to map hix to understand the temporal spatial dom sources with linkages to environmental pollution lake attribute and the corresponding measures of environmental management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

15154,the pollution or eutrophication affected by dissolved organic matter dom composition and sources of inland waters had attracted concerns from the public and government in china combined with remote sensing techniques the fluorescent dom fdom parameters accounted for the important part of optical constituent as chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom was a useful tool to trace relative dom sources and assess the trophic states for large scale regions comprehensively and timely here the objective of this research is to calibrate and validate a general model based on landsat 8 oli product embedded in google earth engine gee for deriving humification index hix based on eems in lakes across china the landsat surface reflectance was matched with 1150 pairs fieldtrip samples and the nine sensitive spectral variables with good correlation with hix were selected as the inputs in machine learning methods the calibration of xgboost model r2 0 86 rmse 0 29 outperformed other models our results indicated that the entire dataset of hix has a strong association with landsat reflectance yielding low root mean square error between measured and predicted hix r2 0 81 rmse 0 42 for lakes in china finally the optimal xgboost model was used to calculate the spatial distribution of hix of 2015 and 2020 in typical lakes selected from the report on the state of the ecology and environment in china the significant decreasing of hix from 2015 to 2020 with trophic states showed positive control of humification level of lakes based on the published document of action plan for prevention and control of water pollution in 2015 of china the calibrated model would greatly facilitate fdom monitoring in lakes and provide indicators for relative dom sources to evaluate the impact of water protection measures or human disturbance effect from covid 19 lockdown and offer the government supervision to improve the water quality management for lake ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is an important type of organic matter in inland waters which widely derived from terrestrial sources and affected the ecological systems food web dynamics and global carbon cycling pace et al 2004 tranvik et al 2009 wilkinson et al 2013 lake ecosystems as the most important part of inland waters are linked to environmental and climate changes adrian et al 2006 despite account for only small fraction of the water resources for earth s surface verpoorter et al 2014 a significant amount of the terrestrial matters is transported laterally along the fluvial continuum to aquatic systems fasching et al 2014 the chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom of terrestrial deliveries was often understood as a central role in aquatic light regime trophic status and even safety of drinking water supply lapierre et al 2013 shang et al 2019 meanwhile the increase of urbanization development with rapid economic growth influence the variations of terrestrial organic composition and microbial degradation processes and this would bring uncertainty to regional aquatic ecosystems and ecological crises as well bai et al 2012 smith et al 2018 the drivers of dom quality for inland waters has remained challenging due to its extreme heterogeneity marın spiotta et al 2014 the three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy along with cdom absorption enable us to analyze the relative source and composition of dom in previous studies stedmon and bro 2008 stedmon and markager 2005 henderson et al 2009 singh et al 2010 shang et al 2021 minor et al 2021 the eem was considered as a sensitive and rapid way to evaluate sources and composition of dom rapidly he et al 2016 sgroi et al 2016 the properties of dom for lake ecosystems are different from those of dom in marine systems due to the variations in degree of human activities salinity microbial activities song et al 2019 the use of eem with the shifting of the emission spectra toward longer wavelengths indicated the extent of increasing humification has been proposed as humification index hix krishnarao et al 2001 and the biological index bix310 huguet et al 2009 and fluorescence peak ratio index zhou et al 2017 were proposed for proxying cdom sources as well moreover the peak c derived from parafac analysis could be used to demonstrate terrestrial carbon to lakes painter et al 2018 however the changes in dom composition and sources related to lake distribution in large scale regions remain poorly understood which may affect the management of water quality for lakes ecosystems recently the published document of action plan for prevention and control of water pollution in 2015 is an important step to concern the environmental monitoring for inland waters therefore using remote sensing techniques to explore the large scale temporal spatial patterns of dom sources with fluorescence spectrum is essential and urgent especially for the monitoring efforts of water quality with variations of dom sources to manage the water pollution thanks to the development of remote sensing techniques for water color and water quality the traditional empirical semi empirical and semi analytical algorithms of cdom optical characteristics was intensively studied to elucidate the distribution and dynamics of cdom kutser et al 2005 massicotte et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 recently with the good relationship between optical characteristics and fluorescent components researchers tried to establish indirect cdom fluorescent components algorithms based on remote sensing wavelength bands and the absorption shifting of cdom at the 254 and 443 nm miao et al 2019 the newly machine learning methods such as regularized linear regression lr random forest rf xgboost and support vector machines svm have been used to estimate cdom without considering the classification of water optical properties ruescas et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 cao et al 2020 similarly the remote sensing retrieval of fluorescent index with machine learning methods is potential and accessible to be developed for characterizing cdom components and sources the launch of ocean color satellites with a series of sensors provided the longest satellite imagery data in the world which offers opportunities for long term monitoring of cdom properties kloiber et al 2002 olmanson et al 2016 chen et al 2017 xu et al 2018 moreover the google earth engine gee platform provided a very convenient way to study optical variations for temporal spatial pattern for large scale scales gorelick et al 2017 kuhn et al 2019 the potential to track inland water dom fluorescent variation based on gee has not been widely explored at national scale across china in view of the lack of fluorescent property algorithm and landsat 8 oli sensor application this study tried to develop a machine learning algorithm for dom fluorescent parameter with good performance in lakes across china and demonstrate its environmental linkage with human activities and water quality management the objectives of the study are to 1 explore a uniform and simple fluorescent parameter which could be linked to optical characteristics and water quality parameters 2 calibrate and validate the fluorescent parameter model using optical remote sensing imagery by machine learning algorithms with field site samples from lakes over china 3 examine and compare the transferable performance of optimal algorithms using sentinel 2 sensors and 4 map fluorescent parameter in typical lakes for temporal spatial pattern using landsat oli data and discuss the linkage with environmental effect and water quality management this study could support the understanding of dom sources of lake on large scale regions in response to anthropogenic activities and environmental management 2 methods and materials 2 1 study region and water sampling china is abundant with water resources including 2800 large lakes 1 km2 and 27 000 mid size lakes between 1 ha and 1 km2 distributed in different regions of the country the different regions with complex terrains and climatic hydrological condition contribute to the variations of optical properties or trophic states due to the different sources of organic matter to aquatic systems specially the high altitude tibet qinghai region with few human activities and intense solar radiation would affect the biogeochemical sources and compositions of dom to some extent liu et al 2021 song et al 2019 china s unbalanced economic pattern would also affect the regional organic input to aquatic environment with different intense of anthropogenic activities between southeastern regions and northwestern regions in this study we carried out 12 fieldtrips to collect 1370 samples from over 260 lakes distributed evenly across china during 2015 to 2021 the water samples were stored in 1 l polyethylene bottles using car refrigerator at 4 c the water samples were filtered as soon as possible at the nights of each sampling date immediately and then transported to the laboratory as soon as possible the gps receiver and ysi 600 xlm sondes ysi inc yellow springs oh were used to record the sampling locations and water quality parameters the secchi disk was used to record the secchi disk depth the sampling sites of lakes across china in this study are shown in fig 1 2 2 laboratory measurements and analysis the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was measured with shimadzu toc 5000 analyzer after being filtered with a 0 4 µm microporous membrane filter in the fieldtrips shang et al 2022 the cdom absorption coefficient indicated the relative concentration of cdom was obtained with a shimadzu uv vis spectrophotometer after filtering 0 22 µm polycarbonate membrane filters the fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems was measured with hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer and the parafac analysis was used to track different components of cdom the humification index hix represented the humification degree of dom such as weak humification hix 4 and strong humification hix 10 in general the higher degree of humification the better stability and the longer the existence time in the environment huguet et al 2009 weishaar et al 2003 bix310 was an autochthonous parameter which reflects the relative contribution of dom autochthonous source in water very less autochthonous dom bix310 0 6 more autochthonous dom bix310 1 birdwell and valsaraj 2010 fi370 is a fluorescence index to distinguish between terrestrially fi370 1 4 and microbially fi370 1 9 derived fulvic acids mcknight et al 2001 humic like fluorescence was indicated as fn 355 and protein like fluorescence was indicated as fn 280 song et al 2019 the detailed description is shown in table s1 of si 2 3 image acquisition and processing in order to establish the remote sensing models for fdom parameters and to quantify the spatial variation of dom sources we used the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps data after atmospheric correction using land surface reflectance code lasrc software from the google earth engine platform which was derived from surface reflectance product from landsat 8 oli to match the field sampling datasets for forming a match up dataset involving ground derived and satellite derived images with a time window of 7 days considering the temporal resolution revisit time of 16 days and the impact of cloud contamination 10 gorelick et al 2017 the cloud free landsat 8 images in the ice free period was collected and the landsat surface reflectance was matched with sampling date to obtain matched pairs to calibrate and validate the model the mean reflectance of 3 3 pixel around the gps of sampling sites was extracted to calibrate and validate the models toming et al 2016 the final remote sensing reflectance rrs was obtained by dividing the surface reflectance by 3 14 zhang in order to test the transferability of the selected model the free accessed sentinel 2 images were downloaded to match with the field dataset the atmospheric correction ac processors for sentinel 2 toolboxes sen2cor sentinel 2 correction was used to obtain level 2a product the detailed description could be found in li et al 2021 similarly the 3 3 pixel centered reflectance at field sampling sites with a time window of 7 days was employed to test the application of model with sentinel 2 images toming et al 2016 2 4 model calibration validation and application the matched pairs of in situ and landsat surface reflectance were selected according to the same rules including stable weather with less cloud and precipitation and avoiding sampling in the nearshore depending on the quality of image the matched images acquired during summer and fall were selected as previous study demonstrated the remote sensing images in summer and fall were relatively stable in this study 1150 samples from 236 lakes 2015 2020 were chosen to calibrate n 766 and validate n 384 the model performance we employed four machine learning algorithms most widely used in remote sensing and environment science such as linear regression lr support vector machine svm extreme gradient boosting xgboost and random forest rf to calibrate the hix model the detailed processes of machine learning algorithms are shown in supplementary information si to test the model transferability we also used 236 fieldtrip samples from 30 typical lakes 2016 2019 to match the sentinel 2 images from the google earth engine platform within 7 days and test the transferability of selected model with best accuracy all in all we used the optimal model eventually to map the humification index in typical lakes across china according to the report on the state of the ecology and environment in china 2015 and 2020 using surface reflectance product from landsat 8 oli embedded in gee examine hix variation in both time and space 2 5 statistical analyses the regression and correlation analysis were carried out by spss 16 0 software spss chicago illinois usa considering significant levels p 0 05 we use determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute percent errors mape to assess model performance between measured and predicted hix the information including social data and the trophic states of the mapped typical lakes were collected from the chinese city statistical yearbook and the report on the state of the ecology and environment in china 2015 2020 3 results 3 1 distribution of in situ hix and relationships with environmental parameters the measured datasets for fdom analysis including parafac hix bix310 and fi370 showed wide ranges and variations across china table 1 three components c1 c3 of parafac analysis were identified with lowest squared error and successful split half validation the c1 components of parafac was similar to humic c peak ex em 250 nm 438 nm stedmon et al 2011 jørgensen et al 2011 c2 component was considered as the terrestrial fulvic origin or the terrestrially derived humic like products ex em 230 nm 430 nm stedmon et al 2003 and c3 component was a protein like t peak in the uva region ex em 280 nm 325 nm coble 1996 walker et al 2013 table s2 and fig s1 the fluorescent intensity of humic like c1 and c2 were significantly higher than that of protein like c3 p 0 05 our hix dataset ranged from 1 12 to 30 9 with a mean hix value of 8 23 6 79 meanwhile the bix310 and fi370 ranged from 0 068 to 3 586 and from 0 556 to 3 586 respectively the hix is significantly correlated to c1 c2 bix310 and other water quality parameters p 0 05 fig 2 with the increasing of trophic status the in situ hix increased significantly p 0 05 table s3 the samples with weak humification hix 4 accounted for 23 while strong humification hix 10 accounted for 35 of the water samples the stronger humification levels the higher fluorescent intensity of terrestrial humic like component c1 and c2 the lower bix310 and fi370 p 0 05 table s4 therefore due to the convenience for calculation and comparison for hix hix could be considered as a potential remote sensing parameter for monitoring the relative dom sources and it is a bridge to link to other optical parameters to understand environmental changes 3 2 model calibration and validation correlation analyses of hix with all possible single band band ratios band combinations were computed preliminarily select the most sensitive spectral variables based on the correlation coefficients we selected the most sensitive spectral variables as the inputs for hix estimates blue green green red coastal green coastal red green red red nir blue green red nir table 2 in order to obtain a remote sensing model of hix with good performance and universality the statistical metrics of four machine learning algorithms including linear regression lr support vector machine svm extreme gradient boosting xgboost and random forest rf are computed to calibrate the models of hix table s3 the xgboost model r2 0 86 mape 28 76 rmse 0 29 outperformed svm model r2 0 83 mape 32 97 rmse 0 41 the lr r2 0 71 mape 61 97 rmse 0 51 and rf model r2 0 80 mape 50 41 rmse 0 43 with good fitting performance slope close to 1 and relative low mape and rmse table s3 comparison between in situ hix values in the calibration datasets and predicted hix derived from the xgboost model showed near linear relationship while the other models show poor linear performances fig 3 the validation result of xgboost model was also satisfactory fig 4 as indicated by higher r2 values of 0 81 and lower rmse of 0 42 compared with validation results of other three models table 3 even though there were significant relationships between in situ and predicted hix by the svm model svm model and lr model in the validation datasets these models have poor performances with uneven linear distribution at high level of hix especially fig 4 hence we used the xgboost as the final calibration model for lake datasets across china 3 3 hix mapping of typical lakes in china as an example the calibrated xgboost model was used to calculate the spatial distribution of hix of 2015 and 2020 in 33 typical lakes selected from the report on the state of the ecology and environment in china figs 5 6 the hix distribution for some typical lakes were shown in figs 7 8 the mean hix in typical lakes ranged from 1 49 to 17 96 with average of 7 41 of 2015 and ranged from 1 34 to 11 22 with the average of 8 25 for 2020 the humification levels of lakes trends to decrease significantly during the period of 2015 to 2020 p 0 05 in terms of trophic states the mean hix for oligotrophic lakes mesotrophic lakes and eutrophic lakes were 3 27 1 83 8 83 7 21 and 13 45 8 51 respectively the high hix was observed in khanka lake 11 96 and hulun lake 11 47 while the low hix was found in tibetan lakes such as namucuo lake 3 33 with the increasing of trophic states the hix increased significantly in both 2015 r2 0 35 slope 0 098 p 0 05 and 2020 r2 0 34 slope 0 074 p 0 05 the hix nearshore was generally higher than that of the center of lake in terms of the individual lakes as mapping result of 2015 and 2020 the percentage of weak humification levels 4 accounted for 12 of all mapped lakes while the strong humification levels 10 accounted for 21 of all lakes with the better the stability and the longer the existence time in the aquatic environment 68 of the lakes were underlying the decreasing of hix from 2015 to 2020 4 discussion 4 1 model implication advantage and limitations previous studies have developed empirical models and semi analytical approaches to map cdom indices based on reflectance from satellites joshi et al 2017 cao et al 2018 griffin et al 2018 however these algorithms were hard to overcome the poor generalizability for different waters and multicollinearity problems chen et al 2019 sun et al 2021 the machine learning algorithm of hix would be a choice for complex optical environments most of the cdom estimation methods focus on absorption parameters for a few lakes therefore this study tried to use the machine learning algorithm to estimation to calibrate the fdom indices for large scale regions overcoming the problems above mentioned for cdom absorption the empirical models for single bands and band combination for hix were tested with the best performance of r2 for 0 61 green red the empirical models underestimated all values of hix above 5 the xgboost model r2 0 80 outperformed the empirical models the results indicate that the constructed model of hix has obvious advantages in terms of the r2 and rmse the general classification of hix included three types 4 4 10 and 10 therefore it is essential to evaluate if the confidence limits are small enough to show a statistical difference under different classification according to the study from prairie 1996 for the validation number of 383 t0 05 is 1 65 rmse of xgboost is 0 42 95 of points will lie on the product of t and rmse units from the regression line therefore the precision of the predicted hix values for 95 confidence is the width of 1 38 we believe that the predictive precision would satisfy the classification of hix to some extent the potential for the remote sensing calibration of fluorescent properties using machine learning algorithms has been identified in this study however the validation results showed that for the high humification levels the hix would be underestimated to some extent while the training data for calibration is with the large scale distribution of china to improve the application and portability of the algorithm of hix in order to test the model performance and spatial transferability xgboost model of hix was applied to sentinel 2 images n 236 our results also highlighted that large difference in the validation of transferability of sentinel 2 can decrease model performance fig 9 due to the differences of atmospheric correction and the center of wavelength pflug et al 2019 miao et al 2019 established an optical algorithm for estimating terrestrial humic like substances with band ratios of sentinel 3 olci and considered the management unit mathematical model method is a better choice for olci sensor atmospheric correction for inland waters meanwhile the performance of the xgboost algorithm is constrained by the distribution of calibrated data and the parameter settings the application of the models to some regions with few data may affect the accuracy of the model as well therefore the further research should consider machine learning algorithms with satellite imagery with better temporal spatial and spectral resolution to improve estimation accuracy of hix to evaluate the dom sources in different types of inland water especially for small lakes also the classification of water types such as salinity doc concentration trophic states and the optical characteristics should be considered to improve the accuracy as well 4 2 the linkages of hix with environmental factors and lake area the humification levels of lakes trends to decrease significantly with the comparison of 2015 and 2020 for typical lakes mentioned from the report on the state of the ecology and environment in china this indicated the potential performance for government based on the published document of action plan for prevention and control of water pollution in 2015 also the analysis for the differences of hix from 2015 to 2020 along with trophic status fig 10 a showed that with the decreasing of trophic status the hix trended to decrease significantly p 0 05 this indicated that the oligotrophic lakes were abundant with more biological or recent autochthonous component and the eutrophic lakes were with more terrigenous contribution zhang et al 2010 the clean water such as oligotrophic lakes and mesotrophic lakes in the case study were always the natural reserves with less human disturbance and strict water quality management the lake ecosystems were relatively healthy and easy to restore as instability of the ecosystem and ultimately the clear water qin et al 2013 however the eutrophic lakes were gradually shifting to a turbid water algae dominated ecosystem bhateria and jain 2016 the rising terrestrial dom would also imply greater nutrients input from the catchment and trigger phytoplankton growth and increased risk of hypoxia kissman et al 2017 beck et al 2018 similarly the previous study had also shown a significant correlation between modified trophic state index tsim and hix in chinese manmade lakes which indicated the potential role of hix as a remote sensing proxy shang et al 2019 with the rapid development of social economics the terrestrial influences had become the vital sources to lakes especially for urbanized lakes the covid 19 corona virus disease 2019 was first identified in the city of wuhan of china the fatal virus spread rapidly which cause a lockdown of wuhan the measures in response to covid 19 including manufacturing industries transportation and mobility of people were positive for environmental improvement dantas et al 2020 the comparison of hix variation in the typical lakes of wuhan before and after the lockdown fig 10b indicated the significant decrease of terrestrial input of dom with less human activities the decreasing hix from 2019 to 2020 during the lockdown of the city may due to less humic like substance input the less anthropogenic disturbances could affect the amount and quality of terrestrial dom delivered to nearby waterbodies butman et al 2015 also the lake hydrological attributes such as lakes areas was also related to the humification levels based on the classification of trophic states for eutrophic lakes the pearson coefficient for correlations between hix and lake areas is 0 55 p 0 001 and the pearson coefficient for correlations between hix and lake areas in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes is 0 53 p 0 001 table s5 which indicated that the lakes with large areas would be have less humic like and fulvic like substances than small lakes the lakes with small areas are likely to be affected by terrestrial sources with strong variations of area fluctuation related to climatic conditions such as the seasonal lakes which will bring more terrestrial organic matters flushing to lakes dvomikov et al 2018 in terms of large lakes even though the terrestrial sources of dom affects significantly the autochthonous sources are complex for large lakes the disturbance for fluctuated areas with terrestrial sources input is weaker than that of small lakes the result indicated that we should also concern about the linkages between the lake attributes and dom sources except environmental factors therefore the mapping of hix could be considered as a potential proxy linked to environmental factors and lake attributes to evaluate the terrestrial sources effectively also researchers demonstrated that the decline in industrial activity would contribute to the improvement of water quality wang and yang 2016 our results confirmed that the hix is positively correlated to the numbers of industrial parks within 10 km of the lake p 0 05 r 0 66 n 28 lakes and when the numbers of industrial parks around the lake exceeds 30 the hix trends to be stable this phenomenon could demonstrate that the migration of industrial activities near the crucial lake ecosystems is necessary and essential to control the terrestrial waste input as dom sources yang et al 2013 comprehensively the natural terrestrial and anthropogenic factors all contributed to the humification levels of lakes and the distribution of hix is vital to be a bridge to study the dom sources and driving factors 4 3 implications for water quality management of lake ecosystems the proposed models of estimating hix is crucial for reflecting the aquatic dom sources and human activities the intensity of humic like sources of dom would increase along with the large number of villages and factories around the lakes and the directly discharges for industrial waste water and residential sewage water miao et al 2019 remote sensing of hix had potential to monitoring the changes of dom sources into lakes from the perspective of human activities and aquatic phytoplankton activities in large scale continents the significant variations of hix for typical lakes between inland lake region hixin 3 95 and out flowing lake region hixout 9 87 were found p 0 05 which indicated biogeochemical and hydrological conditions and human activities contributed to the changes of humification levels the hix had been reported to be related the trophic status and cdom concentration positively zhang et al 2010 shang et al 2019 the monitoring hix for different trophic status would offer the government supervision to improve the water quality management for lake ecosystems and control the pollutant into lakes to threat the drinking waters and human health it is reported that the high humification levels of the water is with more risk to occur the kashin beck disease an et al 1999 this was similar to our result that the average hix of typical lakes in 12 provinces was correlated to the numbers of counties with kashin beck disease r 0 52 p 0 05 fig s2 according to the chinese health statistics yearbook of 2020 however the detailed environmental mechanism of how humic matter can cause metabolic disorder of chondroitin sulfate should be explored for pathological mechanism in the future this study indicated that the humification level could affect the safety of human health and water quality significantly also it had been mentioned that the hix was related to some water quality parameters such as doc ec and bix310 so the monitoring of hix could be a bridge to estimate the water quality parameters for complex inland waters especially that without significant optical characteristics the terrestrial humic like substances were relatively low in the period of cyanobacteria blooms with more microbial degradation chen et al 2018 meanwhile the intensity of fdom during the blooms was obviously higher than those for non blooms zhao et al 2009 the abnormal changes of hix is a potential signal to early warning of algal blooms this study provided an illustration of the utility of remote sensing methods to quantify changes of dom sources with fluorescent properties in response to environmental drivers and water quality management of lake ecosystems 5 conclusions estimation of hix in lakes across china from landsat 8 imagery data provides a new angle and an effective tool to synoptically monitor dom sources related to water quality of lakes at a national scale we established machine learning models with satellite surface reflectance products derived from landsat ldeaps embedded in gee platform the calibrated in situ dataset obtained in different regions covering complex optical properties contribute to the reliability of the models the xgboost model outperformed svm model the lr and rf model with relatively low mape and rmse comparison between in situ hix values in the calibration datasets and predicted hix derived from the xgboost model showed near linear relationship while the other models show poor linear performances however the validation of transferability of sentinel 2 images is poor for further multi source data fusion due to the differences of atmospheric correction and the center of wavelength the application of the remote sensing monitoring hix variations for representative lakes across china in 2015 and 2020 would offer the government supervision to improve the water quality management for lake ecosystems and positive control the pollutant into lakes based on the published document of action plan for prevention and control of water pollution in 2015 further models trained with more datasets collected from various types of lakes and multiple satellite sensors with different resolutions was used to map hix to understand the temporal spatial dom sources with linkages to environmental pollution lake attribute and the corresponding measures of environmental management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
