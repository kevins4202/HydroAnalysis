machine learning prediction water quality assessment 1 introduction water quality for industrial purposes is often described in terms of corrosion and scaling potentials csps of water egbueri et al 2021a the dangers of corrosion and scaling in water distribution systems supply networks in homes agricultural ventures water treatment plants in industries and large institutions have been reported in literature egbueri 2021a many developing countries around the world such as nigeria are currently experiencing industrialization at various scales some gradual while others rapid following the increasing industrialization taking place in these parts of the world it is very important to regularly or periodically assess the quality and suitability of available water resources for industrial purposes this helps to ensure cleaner and sustainable industrial processing and production having understood this necessity and taking actions to build on it several researchers from different parts of the globe have analyzed the usability of both surface water and groundwater resources in industries sharpe and de walle 1985 agatemor and okolo 2008 shams et al 2012 ozoko 2015 tavanpour et al 2016 aghazadeh et al 2017 sajil kumar 2019 egbueri 2021a egbueri et al 2020a 2021b most of these researchers have utilized integrated numerical approaches some of the most commonly used indexical modeling techniques for assessing the industrial water quality in terms of csps include the chloride sulphate mass ratio csmr puckorius scaling index psi larson skold index lsi revelle index ri aggressive index ai ryznar stability index rsi and langelier index li langelier 1936 revelle 1941 larson and skold 1958 muller steinhagen and branch 1988 us epa 1984 puckorius and brooke 1991 edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 abyaneh et al 2011 agatemor and okolo 2008 ozoko 2015 shams et al 2012 abbasnia et al 2018 tavanpour et al 2016 nguyen et al 2011 stets et al 2017 aghazadeh et al 2017 sajil kumar 2019 akoteyon et al 2018 egbueri 2021a egbueri et al 2020a 2021a verma et al 2021 mankikar 2021 nevertheless these indices are not so restricted to application for industrial water quality assessment apart from their usefulness in industrial water quality evaluation they can also be used for evaluating the storability of water resources for domestic and agricultural purposes egbueri et al 2020a monitoring and assessment of the csps of natural water resources are of great significance because of the several impacts corrosion and scaling in supply networks have on beverage production the economy and public health sharpe and de walle 1985 egbueri 2021a through such studies the negative implications of water corrosivity and scaling could be minimized or avoided moreover adequate evaluation of the csps could be a good predictor of borehole longevity and well head installation ozoko 2015 overtime several machine learning models such as multiple regression mr hierarchical clusters hcs and artificial neural networks anns have been utilized in the assessment and prediction of water quality indices egbueri 2021b for instance hcs and anns have been used in predicting pollutant occurrence and water quality nadiri et al 2013 chitsazan et al 2015 alizamir and sobhanardakani 2017 nhantumbo et al 2018 wagh et al 2017 2018 latif et al 2020 ozel et al 2020 egbueri 2021b ewusi et al 2021 similar scenario has been reported of the mr models chenini and khemiri 2009 chen and liu 2015 abba et al 2017 kadam et al 2019 el bilali and taleb 2020 ogbozige et al 2020 ouma et al 2020 as a matter of fact the usefulness of these artificial intelligence modeling techniques in water quality assessment and prediction cannot be overemphasized the current research focuses on the industrial water quality of ojoto suburb in southeastern nigeria the inhabitants residents and industrialists in this suburb rely on several water sources including surface and groundwaters for drinking domestic cooking and laundry agricultural commercial and industrial usages egbueri 2021a in recent times the growths in urbanization industrialization and socioeconomic activities have consequently led to rapid human population growth and high demand of water supply the corrosivity and scaling tendencies of the water resources has been investigated by egbueri 2021a it was revealed that the industrial sector at small medium and large scales as well as domestic and agricultural sectors that store and use large quantities of water is currently faced with the risks associated with corrosion and scaling of distribution channels by corrosive water resources egbueri 2021a however one of the key limitations of water quality research in the study area is insufficient funding as a consequence of this regular and extensive water quality monitoring and assessment to acquire large data are not carried out thus researchers are mostly left to use small data points in making interpretations and recommendations nevertheless and fortunately too it has been found that artificial intelligence machine learning modeling techniques could be used to robustly estimate and forecast water quality parameters in areas where data are scarce nhantumbo et al 2018 mazhar et al 2019 ozel et al 2020 egbueri 2021b although several studies have forecasted drinking water quality using machine learning models e g mr anns and hcs etc nadiri et al 2013 chen and liu 2015 abba et al 2017 alizamir and sobhanardakani 2017 nhantumbo et al 2018 wagh et al 2017 2018 kadam et al 2019 ouma et al 2020 latif et al 2020 ozel et al 2020 sakaa et al 2020 egbueri 2021b singh et al 2021 globally researches that have predicted industrial water quality indices csmr psi lsi ri ai rsi and li based on these models are scarce unfortunately to the best of the author s searches and knowledge none of such studies has been done in nigeria hence this work is considered the first of its kind to utilize artificial intelligence in simultaneously predicting the industrial water quality indices integration of artificial intelligence in modeling the industrial water quality indices would aid in resolving the challenges associated with accurate computation of water quality indices and regular water quality monitoring especially in areas where data acquisition is expensive also the artificial intelligence modeling of industrial water quality could assist industrialists water managers policymakers researchers and the inhabitants to generate sustainable water management plans this approach is especially beneficial for the current study area where lack of funding has been identified as one of the main drawbacks of regular extensive water quality monitoring and assessment egbueri 2021b therefore the aim of this paper is to develop optimized artificial intelligence models including mr hcs and anns for predicting and analysing the csps of water resources in ojoto suburb southeastern nigeria the main objectives of this work are to 1 determine the relationships between the physicochemical properties of the natural water resources and the csp indices 2 determine and demarcate the industrial water quality classes and categorize the risk of corrosion and scaling in the study region 3 develop mr and ann models for the estimation and prediction of the csp indices of the natural water resources and 4 analyze the relative importance and influence of the tested physicochemical species on the architectures of the developed ann models moreover the most efficient optimization algorithm for the machine models was identified the most suitable predictor physicochemical parameters for the prediction of the industrial water quality indices were identified and the performances of the mr and ann models were compared it is hoped that this paper will contribute great insights towards the sustainable water resources management in the study area as the developed models would serve as sustainability indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area is found within anambra state in southeastern nigeria west africa and located within 06 50 e 07 00 e and 06 00 n 6 05 n fig 1 the area under study lies a few kilometers away from onitsha which is known as a major commercial hub of in the west african sub region commerce agriculture and human settlements are the major land use patterns predominant in the area following the recent upsurge in industrialization and commercial activities there is an increase in human settlement and industries in the study area resulting in an increase in the population growth among the emerging industries in the area are water bottling companies petrochemical and food industries municipal and domestic water distribution facilities in the area are generally made up of steel iron plastics and polymer of vinyl chloride pvc two major seasons are predominant in the area the wet or rainy season spans from april to november while dry season spans from december to march the dry season is accompanied by dry dusty winds with very high temperatures ranging from 27 c to 32 c egbueri et al 2019 egboka 1993 during the wet season rainfall intensity can reach heights of about 1500 2000 mm egbueri 2021a an observation of fig 1 shows that the major lithostratigraphic units underlying the study area are the nanka formation eocene and the ogwashi formation oligocene miocene the nanka formation is made up of light colored mudrocks alternating friable sands intercalated with sandy shale units and thin bands of limestone and ironstones nwajide 2013 stratigraphically the nanka formation which underlies 80 of the study area is known to be deposited by the regressive depositional episode that occurred during the second phase of the campanian eocene compressive movements nwajide 2013 this deposition episode is known to have given rise to the folding of the abakaliki anticlinorium nwachukwu 1972 the ogwashi formation on the other hand was birthed from the third phase of the tectonic movement which is believed to have commenced towards the end of the eocene period obi et al 2001 the ogwashi formation is composed majorly of alternations of coarse grained and poorly to moderately consolidated sandstone units additionally the rock types of the ogwashi formation are known to be composed of light colored mudrocks and limestones with alternating bands of ironstones and lignite seams nwajide 2013 these two geological formations are known to be the most prolific aquiferous units with variation in aquifer depths akpoborie et al 2011 okoro et al 2010 nfor et al 2007 some literatures have reported greater aquifer depth at the nanka formation than the ogwashi formation in some parts of the state average aquifer depth of 20 m have been reported for the nanka formation nfor et al 2007 however shallower aquifer depth average 7 m have been documented for the ogwashi formation okoro et al 2010 however there is no literature regarding an estimation of the recent aquifer depth in the study area 2 2 physicochemical data for predictive modeling the physicochemical water quality datasets for the present artificial intelligence predictive modeling and assessment were obtained from egbueri 2021a a total of twenty eight water sources including streams springs hand dug wells and boreholes from ojoto and its surroundings in southeastern nigeria fig 1 were analyzed for ph temperature t electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total hardness th calcium ca bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl sulphate so4 iron fe zinc zn and lead pb the ion balance was calculated to check the accuracy and precision of the physicochemical test eq 1 an ion balance of 5 was obtained indicating that the results exhibit acceptable accuracy and precision these twelve physicochemical parameters presented in this work were considered paramount in the evaluation of the corrosivity and scaling tendencies of the water resources egbueri 2021a thus the selected twelve analytical parameters were useful in the current predictive modeling study the sample locations and the underlying geology of the study area are also shown in fig 1 1 cations anions cations anions x 100 2 3 methodology of industrial water quality indexing in recent times industrialization is recognized as one of the major backbones for strong economic growth and development especially in developing countries like nigeria this implies that several industries and industrial activities that would require high quality water supply would be on continuous increase hence a nation planning for industrialization goals should also consider the provision of high quality water for the industrial sector oftentimes availability of adequate water supply remains a big challenge for the industrial sector egbueri et al 2021a this is also a common challenge for several homes as a matter of fact a lot of homes institutions and industries are now faced with numerous undesirable effects of water corrosion and scaling abbasnia et al 2018 aghazadeh et al 2017 sajil kumar 2019 egbueri et al 2020a egbueri 2021a mankikar 2021 the methodology of industrial water quality indexing for the current study area involved the use of several indices such as csmr psi lsi ri ai rsi and li to determine the corrosivity and encrustation scaling of the water resources the equations eqs 1 7 utilized for the computation of the corrosion and scaling potentials csps of the water resources are shown in table 1 2 4 quantifying inter and intra relations of physicochemical variables and csp indices in order to establish the interrelationships between the physicochemical parameters and the csp indices a number of multivariate statistical tools were integrated in this study pearson s and spearman s correlation analysis ca unrotated principal component analysis pca varimax rotated factor analysis fa with kaiser normalization and r mode hierarchical clusters hcs were utilized in the examination of the inter relations between the analyzed and computed water quality variables the direct linearity between these parameters was estimated using the ca pca and fa are machine learning techniques used to reduce the dimensionality of groups of inter correlated datasets or parameters the hcs were used to cluster the inter relationships between the parameters under study the pca fa and hcs performed in this work were to further validate the findings of the ca and to capture some associations not provided by the ca egbueri and unigwe 2020 onyemesili et al 2020 ibm spss v 22 was utilized for these basic multivariate statistical modeling the pca and fa extractions were selected based on the kaiser 1960 selection criterion in this criterion component and factor classes with eigenvalues 1 are selected and the ones with lower eigenvalues are rejected while the former groups are believed to have significant details and information about the dataset the latter with eigenvalues 1 are believed to be unnecessary as they have no substantial information about the interrelationships of dataset parameters under study for the r mode hcs ward 1963 s linkage method with squared euclidean distance was used the loadings coefficients of the ca pca and fa obtained in this study were categorized into three as thus coefficient 0 5 signify weak relationship 0 5 coefficient 0 75 signify medium moderate relationship and coefficient 0 75 signify strong relationship enyigwe et al 2021 it has been reported that the level of associations between water quality parameters as revealed by the ca pca and fa could provide useful insights for the selection of suitable predictors for advanced artificial intelligence modeling egbueri 2021b this implies that the linearity and nonlinearity of the parameters could easily be preliminarily flagged using the ca pca and fa variables with moderate and strong inter relationships seem to be more suitable predictors in ann and hcs modeling egbueri 2021b however whereby there are more of nonlinear associations the predictors could be selected based on researcher s discretion and expert knowledge 2 5 spatiotemporal q mode hierarchical clustering hierarchical cluster analysis hca is an unsupervised machine learning pattern recognition technique used in the determination of the primary structure comparisons or principal characteristics of a given dataset without holding on to prior assumptions about the dataset vega et al 1998 dash et al 2018 by hca system objects can be categorized into groups or simply clusters based on their similarities and dissimilarities to model the spatiotemporal distribution of the csp indices in the study area q mode hcs were utilized over time the usefulness of q mode hcs in water quality assessment has been widely acknowledged by several workers yidana 2010 ukah et al 2020 egbueri 2021b in this work the hierarchical agglomerative clusters were useful in the determination and demarcation of the spatiotemporal industrial water quality and classes obtained in the area moreover the hcs enhanced the qualitative description of the area s industrial water quality the input variables used for the spatiotemporal clustering in the present work are the csp indices thus seven dendrograms that are representatives of the seven csp indices were first produced specifically the first second third fourth fifth sixth and seventh hierarchical dendrograms represent the csmr ri lsi li ai rsi and psi distributions respectively afterwards a cumulative dendrogram which integrated the seven csp indices was produced to harmonize and summarize the spatiotemporal water quality modeling similar to the r mode clustering the q mode hcs were developed using the ward s 1963 linkage this linkage method has been found to be more reliable than other linkage methods güler et al 2002 yidana 2010 subba rao and chaudhary 2019 amiri et al 2020 egbueri and unigwe 2020 ukah et al 2020 egbueri 2021b furthermore the spatiotemporal analysis of the csp indices i e the input variables was done via squared euclidean distance estimation eq 9 singh et al 2004 shrestha and kazama 2007 dash et al 2018 the squared euclidean distance typically reveals the resemblance between two parameters or samples and further revealing the variations in their analytical values singh et al 2004 by this technique the similarities and dissimilarities of the variables and water sample localities were established as the obtained distances are typical indicators of the water quality variances 9 distance q i q j j 1 n x 1 i x 2 j 2 where q i is the ith object x ij is the score of the jth parameter of the ith object it is pertinent to mention that the input variables csp indices for the various locations were standardized by z score transformation algorithm prior to the development of the eight q mode dendrograms this was done to minimize bias that could be associated with the variations in the variable scores by this method the information provided by the hcs are seen to be dimensionless and on a uniform scale nevertheless it is known that the transformation to dimensionless values is a key disadvantage of the hierarchical cluster analysis as equal weights and importance are usually assigned to the analyzed variables egbueri 2021b however the standardization and transformation of data have been reported to outweigh this disadvantage as the use of raw data could give rise to higher errors in data classification and interpretation yidana 2010 egbueri 2021b 2 6 multiple regression modeling the selection of the kind of regression analysis to be performed on a certain dataset depends on the purpose of the simulation and assessment multiple regression mr is the kind of regression analysis that is usually employed in a scenario whereby the relationship between multiple input predictor variables and a single output predicted variable is sought thus by mr the extent of relationship between the variables could easily be estimated this analysis has been implemented across several fields to forecast predict a possible outcome i e a dependent variable based on the input of more than one available factors i e independent variables adams et al 2004 this implies that mr allows for the simulation of random independent explanatory variables in the prediction of a dependent predicted or response variable thus simplifying the predictive modeling of linear and non linear fitting kumar et al 2019 this modeling method which is based on least squares fitting is very suitable especially in a scenario where the dataset is relatively small weisberg 1985 ouma et al 2020 mathematically mr model expresses the scores of the predicted dependent parameter as a linear function of the multiple predictor variables as shown in eq 10 chenini and khemiri 2009 chen and liu 2015 abba et al 2017 stangierski et al 2019 ogbozige et al 2020 ouma et al 2020 khalid and usman 2021 mahmoud et al 2021 noting that mr helps in the determination of the level of variation between the analyzed variables the mr equation defines the line of y response variable on x explanatory variables 10 y b 0 b 1 x 2 b 2 x 2 b i x i ε where x i represents the value of the ith predictor b 0 represent the regression constant whereas b i represents the coefficient of the ith predictor chen and liu 2015 ε represents the residual or error for individual i ouma et al 2020 for the current mr study all the physicochemical parameters ph t ec tds th ca hco3 cl so4 fe zn and pb were used as the input predictor variables however the seven csp indices csmr ri lsi li ai rsi and psi were utilized as the output response variables thus a total of seven mr models were produced all the models were developed using the ibm spss statistics v 22 2 7 artificial neural network modeling artificial neural network ann is a modern soft computing method for simulating and analyzing datasets in such a manner that mimics the human brain anns are comprised of artificial neurons that are inter connected to each other and this interconnection depicts the flow of information and how information is processed by the networks because of its unique characteristics ann is used in finding the relationship between independent input variables and dependent output variables thus the existing correlation and non correlation of the both variables could be established using ann model agatonovic kustrin and beresford 2000 khandelwal and singh 2011 monjezi et al 2013 asadi et al 2014 nadiri et al 2021 thus researches have shown that ann models can be used in modeling both linear and nonlinear relationships between process and response variables under study ighalo et al 2021 egbueri 2021b and as such they have also been found useful in solving several engineering and environmental problems özşahin 2012 asadi et al 2014 heidari et al 2019 egbueri 2021b ighalo et al 2021 nadiri et al 2017 2018 2021 the usefulness of anns cuts across several diverse fields of study including water resources engineering hydrogeology and environmental geology anns have been commonly used in modeling groundwater and surface water resources nadiri et al 2017 2018 rajaee et al 2019 ozel et al 2020 egbueri 2021b anns artificial intelligence modeling has been widely used in the prediction of water quality parameters this is because they provide robust numerical simulation and estimation of water quality via their powerful forecasting functions thus anns have received wider and continuous acceptance in several fields for accurate and effective analysis of water quality usually getting the most suitable ann models for water quality prediction involves the simultaneous training of several networks with wide range of neuron numbers input and output activation functions and training optimization algorithms at the end of which the most suitable ann model is chosen for interpretation in this study the essential methodological information required for the development of ann models used for the water quality prediction are shown in table 2 feedforward back propagated multilayer perceptron mlp neural networks were developed two ann models ann1 and ann2 trained and developed with hyperbolic tangent activation function scaled conjugate gradient scg and gradient descent gd optimization algorithms table 2 were utilized in the current water quality prediction modeling the input water quality variables include the ph t ec tds th ca hco3 cl so4 fe zn and pb whereas the response water quality variables include csmr ri lsi li ai rsi and psi hence each ann model has a multi output layer containing the seven csp indices it should be recalled that these csp indices that formed the multi output layers are the major means through which the industrial water quality of the study area is evaluated ten unit one hidden layer which translated the information provided by the input layers to the output layers was utilized for both ann1 and ann2 moreover it is pertinent to mention that the architectures of the ann models were decided by analyzing the impact of the input variables on the performances of the networks sensitivity analysis of the neural network models was carried out to note the most relevant input variables for the ann modeling the development of the ann models was performed in ibm spss statistics v 22 2 8 validation of artificial intelligence models it is usually necessary to test the performances of artificial intelligence models in order to certify their reliability and applicability in real time scenarios again the model validation is necessary due to the fact that the original values presented in a dataset and those predicted using machine learning techniques are not always in line egbueri 2021b hence by performance validation the most suitable models are selected and implemented moreover model validation aids in the identification of the most effective input output activation functions and training optimization algorithms egbueri 2021b herein the performances of the mr models were validated using multiple correlation coefficient r coefficient of determination r2 eq 11 adjusted r square r2 standard error of estimate see and f ratio however the performances of the ann models were examined and validated through direct comparison of parity plots coefficient of determination or r square r2 eq 11 relative mean square

discussion 3 1 general water quality and possible influencing factors 3 1 1 physicochemical and csp indexing results while the results of the physicochemical parameters analyzed in the natural water resources are presented in table 3 a the results of the computed csp indices are shown in table 3b generally the physicochemical results table 3a revealed that the natural water resources have 1 the concentrations of ec tds th ca so4 cl hco3 and zn well within the nigerian industrial standard nis 2007 and world health organization who 2017 standard limits 2 ph values that are mostly typical of acidic waters that could pose high corrosive effects on metallic storage facilities and distribution networks egbueri 2019 sajil kumar 2019 and 3 the concentration of fe and pb exceeded their nis 2007 and who 2017 standard limits in some of the water resources egbueri 2021a high concentrations of fe and pb in water have been attributed to a number of processes including deterioration and leaching of metallic distribution systems made of fe and pb nis 2007 who 2017 egbueri 2021a egbueri et al 2021a however high fe in water could also be linked to some redox reactions that take place in natural water systems onyemesili et al 2020 egbueri et al 2020b while it is believed that hco3 a weak acid and cl and so4 strong acids possibly influenced the acidity of the water resources it is also believed that the water hardness might have been impacted by the dissolved bivalent calcium similar reports have been documented in literature agatemor and okolo 2008 mukate et al 2019 aghazadeh et al 2017 akoteyon et al 2018 sajil kumar 2019 egbueri et al 2020a 2021a thus while the decrement in acidity causes the water to be more corrosive the dissolution of calcium increases its hardness and scaling potential it has also been found that so4 2 in water could greatly influences the dissolution of metallic materials used for municipal industrial or domestic water distribution networks this has been attributed to the conversion process of so4 sulphate to sulfides that are corrosive atasoy and yesilnacar 2010 ismail and el shamy 2009 in corrosion studies fe and pb have been identified as potentially toxic elements that are commonly found in water pipes and are also known to leach from pipes under the influence of corrosive water egbueri 2021a in this study it was found that about 14 28 of total samples had high fe content above its allowable limit 0 3 mg l who 2017 nis 2007 table 3a generally it believed that redox reactions in the water distribution systems could facilitated the leaching and enrichment of fe in the water resources barzegar et al 2019 egbueri et al 2020a on the other hand excess concentration of pb against the standard threshold of 0 001 mg l was noticed in about 46 43 of the water samples and this could be attributed to the leaching of leaded pipes in the water distribution systems who 2017 nis 2007 egbueri et al 2019 the presence of pb could also be linked to industrial wastes barzegar et al 2019 egbueri et al 2021a with respect to the csp indices it was generally reported that the water samples are mostly corrosive with some having scaling encrustation potentials regarding the csmr water resources for industrial purposes can be classified into two groups while water resources having csmr 0 5 are classified to have no galvanic corrosion potential those with csmr value 0 5 are grouped as waters with significant galvanic corrosion potential edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 stets et al 2017 egbueri 2021a egbueri et al 2020a 2021a mankikar 2021 amongst the analyzed water resources are found 96 43 samples with csmr 0 5 and 3 57 of the total samples with csmr 0 5 table 3b contrarily majority of the other csp indices indicated that most of the water samples are very corrosive in nature for instance li ai rsi and psi revealed that all the analyzed water samples are corrosive the classification scheme of these four indices is presented in table 4 it is seen that all of the four indices li ai rsi and psi suggested that none of the samples have significant scaling potential tables 3b and 4 nevertheless lsi seem to have captured those samples with scaling potential water is classified into three classes based on the lsi categorically lsi 0 8 signifies water resource that has significant scaling potential and slight corrosive tendency 0 8 lsi 1 2 is indicative of a water sample with corrosion tendency higher than expected and lsi 1 2 signifies water resource with higher corrosion potential larson and skold 1958 us epa 1984 shams et al 2012 abbasnia et al 2018 sajil kumar 2019 egbueri 2021a egbueri et al 2020a 2021a it was realized that 71 43 17 86 and 10 71 of the water samples fell into the first second and third categories respectively see table 3b for lsi result further the water resources were analyzed using ri model to investigate whether or not the csp of the water resources were influenced by salinization based on a classification scheme adopted from akoteyon et al 2018 samples with ri 0 5 are unaffected by salinization processes those with ri in the range of 0 5 6 6 are slightly influenced by salinization whereas those with ri 6 6 are noted to be strongly influenced by salinization processes for this study area all the analyzed water samples were observed to have ri scores 0 5 table 3b overall it was realized that the majority of the water resources analyzed in this study have more corrosive potential than scaling potential this implies that the risk of water channel network destruction as a result of corrosion is much higher than the risk of water channel clogging as a result of encrustation or scaling comparing this observation with previous researches in literature it was discovered that most previous authors found the water resources they analyzed to be more corrosive in nature with lower scaling potential edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 atasoy and yesilnacar 2010 ismail and el shamy 2009 stets et al 2017 shams et al 2012 abbasnia et al 2018 sajil kumar 2019 agatemor and okolo 2008 mukate et al 2019 aghazadeh et al 2017 akoteyon et al 2018 egbueri et al 2020a 2021a mankikar 2021 this might be suggesting that industrial areas where those water resources were analyzed seem to have more of acidic waters than alkaline waters 3 1 2 processes affecting the quality of water resources developing a thorough awareness of the current state of accessible water resources as well as the various processes that influence their quality is critical to formulating informed plans and decisions for efficient water management security use and preservation li and wu 2019 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 subba rao and chaudhary 2019 egbueri 2019 prior studies in this region have identified various factors such as lithology hydrology setting mineral rock weathering leaching and anthropogenic inputs from agriculture industry and illegal refuse dumping etc as responsible factors that have affected the chemistry and quality of the water resources egbueri et al 2019 in the study area it is believed that natural and anthropogenic inputs have an impact on the quality of both surface and groundwater lithostratigraphic units such as shales claystones and sandstones dominate the study area these rock formations are typically rich calcic minerals which could have great impacts on water quality for industrial purpose subba rao and chaudhary 2019 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 gaikwad et al 2019 the weathering and leaching processes of these rocks could cause water to contain more calcium ions making it unpalatable to drink and generally unfit for human consumption the ph of the water samples in ojoto area were found to range from 4 to 6 4 table 3 indicating that they are acidic compost from organic or plant decomposition as well as potentially related geochemical processes in the area could be responsible for the acidity of the water resources this could also be attributed to sewage spilled by industries and other factory activities in the research region in humans acidic waters can induce gastrointestinal problems and mucocutaneous degeneration gaikwad et al 2019 the water temperature ranged from 23 to 29 c with an average value of 25 42 c which is considered warm who 2011 2017 warm water is thought to affect mineral dissolution rates and increase the growth of possibly dangerous bacteria which could affect the taste feel smell and corrosiveness of the water in this study area table 3 shows that the tds values obtained for the samples all the water samples showed minimal level below the who allowed range likewise all of the ec results were less than the who s permitted limit of 900 μs cm the amount of dissolved magnesium and calcium in water is measured by total hardness the average th of the analyzed water samples in the ojoto area was between 6 and 52 mg l which was found to be within the allowed level indicating that the water is soft and does not represent a health risk to humans all of the cl concentrations recorded were below the who s maximum allowed limit of 600 mg l table 3 the occurrence of chlorides might be attributed to leaching of chloride containing materials high chloride rich waste and urban industrial effluent released by inhabitants which then came into contact with water resources in all of the areas studied it could also possibly be as a result of chloride salts emitted as industrial effluents in the region all so4 2 levels were below the who acceptable limit of 400 mg l however a buildup of sulphate in water can cause an increase in ph resulting in acidification excess sulphate in water has had no significant health implications or adverse effects to date in the study area in the water samples the bicarbonate ion hco3 was discovered to be the most prevalent anion weathering of calcium bearing rocks causes a high percentage of bicarbonates in water to diverge the principal cause of bicarbonate ions in spring water is dissolved carbon dioxide obtained from rainfall more carbon dioxide is dissolved in water when it penetrates the soil and rocks hosting the water by the action of co2 on carbonates bicarbonates are formed furthermore hydrolysis which enhances chemical weathering could also be responsible for the formation of hco3 in general all of the chemical ions collected in this area were below their corresponding nis 2007 recommended permissible level for industrial applications as a result all of the samples are deemed safe for human consumption and industrial food processing based on these water quality factors and the nis 2007 and who 2011 2017 guidelines a number of naturally occurring phenomena have been considered responsible for the release of potentially toxic elements in water nagajyoti et al 2010 nriagu 1989 ayejoto et al 2021 leaching of pb from piping systems and industrial effluent could be blamed for the significant pb concentration in some of the water sources who 2011 2017 nis 2007 ukah et al 2019 egbueri 2018 furthermore high levels of pb in drinking water can cause serious damage to human health such as cancers hearing loss brain disorders developmental delays intense delusions and procreation issues vitamin d respiration suppression leukopenia and abnormal blood tissue structure and drowsiness and irritability in children nis 2007 who 2011 2017 ukah et al 2019 fe concentrations in some of the samples about 14 28 exceeded the permissible levels of 0 3 mg l nis 2007 who 2011 2017 despite the fact that iron is an integral part of human diet its high concentration in water causes major pollution and health issues kumar and puri 2012 however iron deficiency has been linked to cause nausea sudden cardiac death and constipation as well as the breakdown of blood coagulation egbueri et al 2022 ayejoto et al 2022 the concentration of iron in water was beyond the guideline limits indicating high contamination according to the findings of this study the detected fe concentrations over the allowable limit could be due to leaching of iron natural deposits into water sources although zn concentrations were minimal in all samples various pipe materials composed of iron steel pvc polymer of vinyl chloride and plastic are utilized in the ojoto area for water distribution both in households and in industry resulting in water corrosion and scaling that is hazardous to public health egbueri et al 2019 in general water resources in this area have low to negligible scaling possibilities but high corrosive tendencies implying that if caution is not exercised pipe lines well equipment storage tanks household and commercial water quality and distribution channels will deteriorate further the knowledge presented in this study about the processes that influence water quality will aid decision making processes needed for the remediation preservation and maintenance of water resources in the studied area 3 2 quantifying inter and intra relations of physicochemical variables and csp indices 3 2 1 relationship quantification by ca both pearson s and spearman s correlation analyses were performed on the physicochemical variables and the csp indices both were utilized for the sake of validation and to capture the parametric associations not captured by either of the two correlation methods while the extracted pearson s coefficients are presented in table 5 a the extracted spearman s rho coefficients are shown in table 5b from table 5a the following significant positive correlation pairs were observed t tds th ec ca ec ca th ph hco3 so4 t tds so4 pb zn ri ca ri csmr lsi cl li ph li ec li th li ca li hco3 ai ph ai ec ai th ai hco3 and psi rsi nonetheless the significant negative correlation pairs observed from table 5a are rsi ph ec rsi rsi th rsi ca rsi hco3 rsi so4 rsi li rsi ai psi t psi ec psi ec psi tds psi ca psi th psi so4 psi li and psi ai on the other hand from table 5b the following significant positive correlation pairs were seen t tds th ec ca ec ca th so4 t so4 ec so4 tds ri csmr lsi cl lsi ri li ph li ec li ca li hco3 li so4 ai ph ai ec ai hco3 ai so4 ai li psi ri and psi rsi however more significant negative relationships were noticed in table 5b than in table 5a csmr cl ri tds ri so4 lsi so4 rsi ec rsi tds rsi th rsi ca rsi hco3 rsi so4 rsi li rsi tds rsi ai psi t psi ec psi tds psi so4 psi li and psi ai based on the observations made from table 5a and b the following can be deduced 1 the physical parameters such as ph t tds and ec seem to influence the presence of the anions e g hco3 and so4 in the waters 2 the presence of ca typically influences the th and ec of the water resources 3 the th in turn seems to influence the ec of the waters 4 the strong association between the t and tds suggests that t influences the dissolution of minerals in the waters 5 the strong relationship between zn and pb suggests a common origin for both possibly from anthropogenic source s 6 the significant positive inter relations between the physicochemical variables and the csp indices are indicative of the strong influences the former have on the latter 7 the significant negative relationships between the physicochemical factors and the csp indices suggest an inverse proportionality and as such the former seem to have lower or no impact on the scores of the latter 8 the obvious positive relationships between the csp indices ri csmr psi rsi lsi ri ai li and psi ri table 5a and b are indicative that their numeric values substantially follow similar trend thus are said to be directly proportionate to some extents 9 the peculiar negative associations between the csp indices rsi li rsi ai psi li and psi ai table 5a and b are indicative of the inverse trends between their numerical scores and 10 the numerous inter and intra relationships between the physicochemical variables and the csp indices indicate that they could be utilized for advanced artificial intelligence predictive modeling especially for anns which can forecast both linear and nonlinear functions 3 2 2 relationship quantification by pca and fa results of the pca and fa were also found useful in assessing the relationships between all the analyzed water quality variables the extracted unrotated principal component pc loadings are presented in table 6 a while the extracted varimax rotated factor loadings are shown in table 6b for both pca and fa six pc factor classes with their eigenvalues 1 were selected and others discarded fig 2 table 6 with respect to table 6a a total of 88 579 of the data variances were explained by the six pcs pc1 explained about 36 151 of the variabilities and has high loadings on t ec tds th ca hco3 so4 li ai rsi and psi pc2 has significant loadings on ph t tds so4 and fe explaining about 18 054 of the total variances table 6a while pc3 was realized with significant loadings on pb csmr and ri pc4 was seen to have obvious loadings on cl and lsi however pc5 has significant loading on only zn whereas pc6 which explained about 5 634 of the variabilities has no significant loading on any of the variables table 6a based on the observed associations contained in table 6a the following inferences are made 1 the pc1 demonstrates that the four csp indices li ai rsi and psi that showed that all the water samples are very corrosive are influenced and predictable by t ec tds th ca hco3 and so4 2 the ph seems to affect the presence of fe whereas t seems to obviously influence the concentrations of tds and so4 in the waters 3 the pc3 is mostly comprised of the csp indices csmr and ri that showed high correlations table 5a and b and suggested that the waters have low galvanic corrosion potential and are not influenced by salinization this pc might also be indicating that pb may or may not be a suitable predictor of csmr and ri as the former is positively loaded and the former negatively loaded table 6a 4 the pc4 suggests that cl is a more suitable predictor of the lsi model and 5 the separation of zn and pb into different pcs both elements were seen to correlate well in table 5a could be indicating that zn might also have geogenic origin s egbueri et al 2020b furthermore the factor classes extracted from the fa shown in table 6b also explained about 88 579 of the total variances in the dataset simpler parameter associations were noticed from the fa than from the pca moreover factor 1 with about 21 448 explanation of the data variability has noticed loadings on t tds so4 and psi whereas factor 2 that explained about 19 277 of variances was significantly loaded by ph hco3 li ai and rsi table 6b factor 3 which explained about 19 073 variances has key loadings ec th ca rsi and psi however factors 4 5 and 6 were observed with lower percentages of variance and have significant loadings on zn and pb csmr and ri and cl and lsi respectively table 6b the following inferences could be drawn based on the observations contained in table 6b 1 factor 1 reiterates that the water temperature t influences the tds and so4 concentrations moreover factor 1 seems to imply and as reported by the ca table 5a and b that t tds and so4 have significant negative correlation with psi this might influence the mr prediction modeling more than the ann prediction 2 strong associations seem to exist between the ph and hco3 and li and ai more than the rsi which has negative loading 3 the inverse proportionality shown between ec th ca and rsi psi table 5a and b seems to be reiterated in the factor 3 thus these associations are important for advanced predictive modeling 4 the association between zn and pb is reiterated and this suggests that their commonality in terms of origin is more than their difference s 5 the strong relationship between csmr and ri given in tables 5a b and 6a is confirmed by the factor 5 and 6 as highlighted by ca and pca tables 5 and 6a the strong association between cl and lsi seems to confirm that the latter could be well predicted by the former 3 2 3 relationship quantification by r mode hcs r mode hcs were also employed in the present research to further explain the associations between the analyzed water quality variables two r mode hierarchical dendrograms were produced fig 3 the hcs produced in this study appear to provide a more simplified clear cut association of the analyzed variables the first hierarchical cluster dendrogram given as fig 3a revealed four major cluster groups cluster 1 is comprised of two sub clusters sub cluster 1 has li ai ph and hco3 while sub cluster 2 has zn pb and fe fig 3a it is seen and affirmed from the sub cluster 1 that li and ai have strong relationship and that ph and hco3 seem to influence both li and ai accordingly again the sub cluster 2 confirmed the relationship between the potentially toxic elements especially for zn and pb based on the variation in the euclidean distances shown in the sub cluster 2 it is suggested that fe has a different source from zn and pb the concentration of fe in water has also been attributed to origins such as ferruginization processes weathering of ironstones and dissolution of ferromagnesian minerals e g pentlandite in the form of iron sulphide and redox and anoxic reaction processes in the water environment barzegar et al 2019 egbueri 2019 egbueri and unigwe 2020 cluster 2 also has two sub clusters while the first sub cluster is comprised of csmr and ri the second sub cluster has th ca and ec as members fig 3a however while cluster 3 is comprised of tds so4 and t cluster 3 is constituted by rsi and psi sub cluster 1 and lsi and cl sub cluster 2 fig 3a in view of the information provided by clusters 2 to 4 it suffices to say that 1 the relationship between ri and csmr is affirmed 2 ca is affirmed as the main influencer of the waters th and ec 3 the so4 and tds of the waters are affirmed to be highly dependent on the temperature t 4 the association between rsi and psi is affirmed and 5 the correlation between lsi and cl is affirmed and cl could be the most suitable predictor of the lsi model furthermore the intra relationships between the csp indices were also examined using r mode hcs the second hierarchical dendrogram fig 3b revealed three main cluster classes based on the csp indices for the industrial water quality assessment cluster 1 is comprised of li and ai while cluster 2 has csmr and ri cluster 3 is composed of two sub clusters sub cluster 1 rsi and psi and sub cluster 2 lsi fig 3b this dendrogram affirmed the relationships initially revealed by the ca pca and fa between 1 li and ai 2 csmr and ri and 3 rsi and psi nevertheless it is now clearly seen that apart from the moderate correlation that exist between lsi and ri table 5b the lsi which is the only model that reported that most of the analyzed water resources have significant scaling potentials seems to have no obvious association with the other csp indices utilized in this research 3 3 q mode hierarchical spatiotemporal modeling this modeling study aided the demarcation of the industrial water quality in terms of the csp indices of the study area into stable data subsets that show the extent of corrosivity and encrustation risks hazards the water resources pose though hca modeling has been considered as a semi objective machine learning approach yidana 2010 egbueri 2021b combining the result of the hca and background knowledge of water quality assessment often enhances the interpretation of the model outcomes importantly in this work the hcs extracted were useful in analyzing and discussing the spatiotemporal distribution and classification and the possible corrosion and scaling risks of the analyzed waters in the study region a totality of eight q mode hc dendrograms were generated for the spatiotemporal interpretation of the industrial water quality indices the first second third fourth fifth sixth seventh and eighth hc dendrograms represent the csmr ri lsi li ai rsi psi and cumulative joint csp indices distributions respectively fig 4 a h in fig 4a which represents the cmsr distribution three main clusters were identified cluster 1 included water sites 3 28 13 4 6 2 12 16 25 14 19 21 22 5 11 24 9 15 20 and 26 fig 4a while cluster 2 has sites 1 8 18 23 7 17 and 27 cluster 3 has only water site 10 fig 4a based on the observed dendrogram classification amongst the three clusters cluster 3 has the highest risk of corrosion thus the order of increasing corrosive tendency of the sites based on csmr is cluster 1 with csmr 0 150 cluster 2 with csmr values between 0 150 and 0 400 cluster 3 with csmr 0 500 fig 4a table 3b although all the sampling sites have been noted to be less impacted by salinization processes the second dendrogram fig 4b that classified the sites based on ri revealed two main demarcations cluster 1 of fig 4b is constituted by sites 16 25 14 3 24 5 20 6 12 19 28 7 22 4 17 13 18 9 and 15 while cluster 2 included sites 2 26 1 11 8 21 27 23 and 10 fig 4b the ri scores of the cluster 1 were found to be 0 035 whereas those for the cluster 2 ranged from 0 035 to 0 239 fig 4b table 3b hence the cluster 1 is seen to have the lowest risk of salinization while cluster 2 seem to have higher risk with site 10 having the highest csmr dendrogram showing the classification of the sampling sites with respect to lsi is shown in fig 4c it was realized that this dendrogram has two main hcs while cluster 1 loaded with sites 8 17 18 25 27 1 13 20 23 3 28 7 16 6 24 12 4 19 and 10 has lsi values 0 700 cluster 2 comprised of sites 11 26 2 14 5 9 22 15 and 21 has lsi range of 0 700 3 163 fig 4c table 3b based on the formed classes it was noticed that the first cluster contains sites with high scaling potentials while the second cluster has sites that are mostly corrosive with slight scaling potential furthermore a dendrogram representing the li model was also produced and shown as fig 4d two hcs were realized from this dendrogram cluster 1 comprises of the water sites 16 17 22 9 21 8 26 14 24 25 11 23 4 and 27 with li values ranging from 5 841 to 4 096 however cluster 2 that included sites 2 13 18 10 1 19 12 5 28 6 15 7 20 and 3 has li scores 4 096 fig 4d table 3b this hierarchical classification implies that even though all the samples are corrosive the samples in cluster 1 seem to have higher corrosive tendency and lower scaling potential whereas those of the cluster 2 seem to have higher scaling tendency and lower corrosive tendency with respect to li tables 3b and 4 the aggressive nature ai of the natural waters was classified using the dendrogram shown in fig 4e the samples were effectively classified into two main cluster members although the ai result had suggested that all the sampled sites have high aggressive nature cluster 1 is made up of water sites 16 17 26 8 25 22 1 12 5 19 9 24 14 21 4 27 11 and 23 with their ai values ranging between 6 324 and 7 660 on the other hand cluster 2 is constituted by water sites 6 15 7 20 28 10 18 3 13 and 2 that have their ai values in the range of 8 034 9 442 fig 4e table 3b with reference to the ai classification scheme table 4 it suffices to say that the aggressiveness of the water samples in cluster 1 surpasses that of those samples that constitute cluster 2 nevertheless the next dendrogram which represents the spatiotemporal classes of the rsi model is given as fig 4f three main cluster groups were extracted from fig 4f cluster 1 included water sites 13 18 2 15 6 7 20 and 10 fig 4f the rsi values of this cluster class were observed to range from 11 328 to 13 291 table 3b while cluster 2 has water sites 11 23 4 17 21 27 and 22 cluster 3 has sites 1 16 8 26 9 3 24 12 25 14 5 28 and 19 fig 4f the cluster 2 sites have their rsi scores found between 15 401 and 15 983 whereas cluster 3 sites rsi maintained a range of 13 638 15 116 fig 4f table 3b as have been noted earlier rsi classified all the samples as being highly corrosive however the corrosiveness and risk of the waters seem to follow the order cluster 2 cluster 3 cluster 1 the seventh dendrogram demonstrate the hierarchical classification of the psi model fig 4g the psi dendrogram classified the water sites into two main categories in cluster 1 sites 4 11 17 23 21 9 26 22 8 27 and 1 were found and their psi scores were in the range of 13 203 15 080 fig 4g table 3b on the other hand water sites 13 28 3 16 12 18 5 2 6 15 10 24 19 25 14 7 and 20 formed cluster 2 fig 4g with their psi ranging from 10 013 to 12 911 table 3b the psi classification table 4 implied that all the samples are very corrosive nevertheless this hierarchical classification has shown that cluster 1 pose higher risk of corrosion than cluster 2 ultimately the eight dendrogram fig 4h represents water quality classification based on integrated csp indices in other words the seven csp indices were the input parameters used in modeling fig 4h thus the hcs formed in this dendrogram are used to summarize the spatiotemporal classification of the csp indices and industrial water quality of the study area three main hcs were obtained from fig 4h cluster 1 included sites 9 22 26 4 23 11 8 17 1 27 and 21 while cluster 2 comprises of sampling sites 13 18 12 5 14 16 25 12 3 28 6 7 15 19 20 and 24 fig 4h however cluster 3 has only site 10 as member typically on average 1 cluster 1 seems to represent the water locations that are highly corrosive with slight scaling tendency 2 cluster 2 seems to represent sample locations that are corrosive and have more pronounced scaling tendency and 3 cluster 3 represents the sample site that seems to have high corrosion and scaling risks this sample site was captured by all the csp indices as having high corrosion and scaling tendencies again the sample 10 was also identified by the ri model to have the highest risk of salinization when compared to the other samples 3 4 multiple regression modeling the physicochemical parameters analyzed in this study are the important key factors that define the csps of water resources in view of this mr models were utilized in this work to describe the influence of the changing independent physicochemical variables on the dependent csp indices hence the mr models are considered highly significant in the present work the results of the mr models are summarized in table 7 a on a general note the mr models well predicted the csp indices in other words the models generally showed that the independent variables pb so4 cl th hco3 fe ph t zn ec ca and tds are good predictors of the dependent variables csmr ri lsi li ai rsi and psi however based on the r r2 adjusted r2 and f ratio values table 7a obtained from the predictive modeling it can be deduced that the mr models for li ai rsi and psi predictions outperformed those for csmr ri and lsi predictions this implies that the independent variables better predicted li ai rsi and psi moreover this shows that the mr models for li ai rsi and psi are a good fit for the water quality data thus it makes sense to say that the predicted li ai rsi and psi values are in closer conformity with the observed data values and can be effective representatives of the original the hierarchical of performance of the mr models seems to follow the order ai li rsi psi lsi ri csmr see table 7a 3 5 artificial neural network modeling while mr models are primarily used to predict linear relationships ann models can be used to predict both linear and nonlinear relationships between independent and dependent variables the ann modeling performed in this study employed scg and gd optimization algorithms with hyperbolic tangent activation function ann1 was developed using scg optimizer whereas ann2 was developed using gd optimizer the ann architectures for ann1 and ann2 are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively interestingly the two ann optimization algorithms were efficient in predicting the seven 7 csp indices based on the twelve 12 independent physicochemical variables however some differences were observed in their accuracies and performances parity plots showing the relationships between the measured calculated values of csp indices and the predicted values for ann1 and ann2 are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively the r2 and rmse values of the ann1 and ann2 are summarized in table 7b and c respectively it was realized that while the r2 for ann1 ranged from 0 610 to 0 966 the r2 for ann2 ranged between 0 530 and 0 956 table 7b and c on the other hand the rmse for ann1 was found in the range of 0 019 0 200 while that for ann2 maintained the range of 0 045 0 429 table 7b and c additionally the residual error plots for the ann1 and ann2 models are presented in figs 8 and 9 respectively comparison of the accuracy and performances of scg and gd optimization algorithms based on the parity plots r2 rmse and residual error plots indicate that the scg optimizer outperformed the gd optimizer in predicting the csp indices in the present study generally higher conformity between observed and predicted values higher regression scores and lower model errors were obtained in ann1 than in ann2 similar to the observations made from the mr models both ann1 and ann2 better predicted li ai rsi and psi more than csmr ri and lsi this is obvious in table 7b and c and figs 6a g 7a g 8a g and 9a g with respect to the r2 values the hierarchical order of prediction performance for the csp indices by ann1 is li rsi ai psi ri csmr lsi table 7b while the order for ann2 is li ai rsi psi lsi ri csmr table 7c the sensitivity of the independent variables in the ann1 and ann2 predictive modeling was also analyzed fig 10 a and b are bar charts showing the relative importance impact of the input variables on the ann1 and ann2 models respectively the various percentage contributions of the input variables in the ann modeling are given table 8 in this study only the input variables with 50 normalized importance are considered as the most sensitive variables alternatively stated variables with 50 normalized importance are the most suitable predictors of the csp indices for ann1 the identified sensitive predictors are ca ph cl so4 and ec fig 10 table 8 nevertheless for ann2 the following input variables were identified as the most sensitive predictors ph so4 cl th and ca fig 10b table 8 3 6 comparison of the performances of mr and ann models in this section the performances of mr and ann modeling techniques in the prediction of csp indices are compared both mr and ann models developed in this work have proven to be efficient in predicting the csp indices both modeling techniques also showed higher performances and accuracies in the prediction of ai li rsi and psi much more than for ri lsi and csmr however overall observations have shown that the ann models ann1 and ann2 outperformed the mr models on average the r2 values of mr ann1 and ann2 models are 0 788 0 848 and 0 814 respectively this implies that ann modeling is a more reliable and efficient approach than mr modeling in the prediction of the csps of the natural water resources 3 7 practical implications of the present predictive modeling an increase in industrialization and urbanization is a critical and important factor for the socio economic growth and development of the present study area however the unveiling of the high csps of the available water resources has shown that high level risks are posed to domestic and industrial water storage facilities water tanks distribution pipelines networks well equipment water treatment plants and clean industrial production scaling in water could facilitate the blockage of well screens reduction of aquifer permeability and increment in the costs of operation and maintenance of domestic industrial water facilities continuous monitoring and assessment of the water quality in respect of the csps would require a lot of funding thus the present work has been designed to produce efficient and reliable artificial intelligence models that could be useful in predicting and forecasting the csp indices even in situations where funding is lacking in order to satisfy this aim several machine learning approaches were integrated the performances and accuracies of the models produced were examined and interpreted the results of this predictive modeling research showed that the produced models are efficient and would be effective in predicting industrial water quality informatics of ojoto suburb additionally the crucial information provided in this paper would serve as baseline for other workers across the globe who might be interested in predicting and forecasting the csp indices of water resources in their region summarily the following implications of the present modeling study are worthy of mention utilizing multiple water quality indices i e the csp indices proved to provide clearer and accurate details about the nature of the water resources the information provided by the csp indexing would be very crucial to the industrialists water managers industrialists and policymakers in planning for materials required for well construction borehole casing and pipe networking integrating several exploratory multivariate techniques ca pca fa and r mode hcs enhanced the establishment of the intra and inter relationships between the physicochemical variables and the csp indices the information provided by these models were useful for the selection of variables for the prediction modeling the q mode spatiotemporal hcs were useful in demarcating and classifying the risks of corrosion and scaling across the study area by these models the changes in corrosion and scaling risks would easily be estimated moreover these models provided reliable classifications of corrosion and scaling risks and would also be helpful in efficient design of future water sampling in the area the q mode hcs identified the most vulnerable sites the risk levels and localities captured by these models would be helpful in the planning for water treatment protection and sustainability strategies the analyses of csp indices and the q mode hcs could provide useful insights for siting of industries in the area this is especially important for the establishment of industries wherein strict water quality standards are supposed to be met during production faced with the corrosion and scaling challenges a holistic technical approach is required to ensure water security and cleaner industrial production again knowledge of the csps would be key in planning for investment in future infrastructures ordinarily water samples are supposed to be regularly collected and analyzed in laboratory using conventional methods in order to calculate the values of the csp indices however the mr and ann models produced in this work are found to be efficient and handy tools for the prediction of the indices the machine learning models proved to be good fits for the water quality data without any significant information loss hence with these predictive modeling techniques time human labor and financial costs required for constant monitoring and assessment would be minimized the modeling techniques utilized in the current work have shown the importance significances and contributions of the analyzed water quality variables in modeling the csp indices this could provide more reliable and trusted insights to policymakers for improving the water environment conditions of the area this is a goal geared towards sustainability integration of several modeling techniques proved to be a more efficient approach for a comprehensive and robust water quality data classification predictive modeling and interpretation having seen the performances of the modeling algorithms used future researchers are at liberty to use or improve on these modeling techniques for the prediction of the csp indices in view of this more studies in regards to this subject are encouraged 4 conclusions this work aimed at developing optimized machine learning models that could predict the csps of natural water resources in ojoto suburb in southeast nigeria interestingly this research has achieved its objectives the major highlights of this paper are summarized below the relationships between the physicochemical properties and the csp indices of the waters were clearly deduced from the ca ca pca fa and r mode hcs q mode hcs were effective in analyzing the spatiotemporal classifications and distributions of water quality and corrosion and scaling risks in the study area the csp indices csmr ri lsi li ai rsi and psi were efficiently and reliably predicted using the twelve physicochemical parameters ph t ec tds th ca hco3 cl so4 fe zn and pb the mr models performances were analyzed using r r2 adjusted r2 and f ratio values whereas the performances of the ann models were verified using parity plots r2 rmse and residual error plots both the mr and ann models were found to suitably predict the csp indices however both models were more effective in the predictions of ai li rsi and psi more than in the predictions of lsi ri and csmr comparing the efficiencies and performances of scg and gd optimization algorithms for the ann modeling it was revealed in this study that scg optimizer was more efficient and outperformed the gd optimizer for ann1 the identified sensitive predictors are ca ph cl so4 and ec whereas those for ann2 are ph so4 cl th and ca listed in their decreasing order of impact furthermore the overall efficiencies and performances of the mr and ann models were tested on average the r2 values of the mr ann1 and ann2 models were found as 0 788 0 848 and 0 814 respectively implying that the both ann models outperformed the mr models in the prediction of the csps of the natural water resources the practical implications of the research findings which affirmed the novelty and significance of this paper have been clearly discussed however it is also recommended that more advanced machine learning and hybridized algorithms be employed in future modeling of these indices declaration of competing

machine learning prediction water quality assessment 1 introduction water quality for industrial purposes is often described in terms of corrosion and scaling potentials csps of water egbueri et al 2021a the dangers of corrosion and scaling in water distribution systems supply networks in homes agricultural ventures water treatment plants in industries and large institutions have been reported in literature egbueri 2021a many developing countries around the world such as nigeria are currently experiencing industrialization at various scales some gradual while others rapid following the increasing industrialization taking place in these parts of the world it is very important to regularly or periodically assess the quality and suitability of available water resources for industrial purposes this helps to ensure cleaner and sustainable industrial processing and production having understood this necessity and taking actions to build on it several researchers from different parts of the globe have analyzed the usability of both surface water and groundwater resources in industries sharpe and de walle 1985 agatemor and okolo 2008 shams et al 2012 ozoko 2015 tavanpour et al 2016 aghazadeh et al 2017 sajil kumar 2019 egbueri 2021a egbueri et al 2020a 2021b most of these researchers have utilized integrated numerical approaches some of the most commonly used indexical modeling techniques for assessing the industrial water quality in terms of csps include the chloride sulphate mass ratio csmr puckorius scaling index psi larson skold index lsi revelle index ri aggressive index ai ryznar stability index rsi and langelier index li langelier 1936 revelle 1941 larson and skold 1958 muller steinhagen and branch 1988 us epa 1984 puckorius and brooke 1991 edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 abyaneh et al 2011 agatemor and okolo 2008 ozoko 2015 shams et al 2012 abbasnia et al 2018 tavanpour et al 2016 nguyen et al 2011 stets et al 2017 aghazadeh et al 2017 sajil kumar 2019 akoteyon et al 2018 egbueri 2021a egbueri et al 2020a 2021a verma et al 2021 mankikar 2021 nevertheless these indices are not so restricted to application for industrial water quality assessment apart from their usefulness in industrial water quality evaluation they can also be used for evaluating the storability of water resources for domestic and agricultural purposes egbueri et al 2020a monitoring and assessment of the csps of natural water resources are of great significance because of the several impacts corrosion and scaling in supply networks have on beverage production the economy and public health sharpe and de walle 1985 egbueri 2021a through such studies the negative implications of water corrosivity and scaling could be minimized or avoided moreover adequate evaluation of the csps could be a good predictor of borehole longevity and well head installation ozoko 2015 overtime several machine learning models such as multiple regression mr hierarchical clusters hcs and artificial neural networks anns have been utilized in the assessment and prediction of water quality indices egbueri 2021b for instance hcs and anns have been used in predicting pollutant occurrence and water quality nadiri et al 2013 chitsazan et al 2015 alizamir and sobhanardakani 2017 nhantumbo et al 2018 wagh et al 2017 2018 latif et al 2020 ozel et al 2020 egbueri 2021b ewusi et al 2021 similar scenario has been reported of the mr models chenini and khemiri 2009 chen and liu 2015 abba et al 2017 kadam et al 2019 el bilali and taleb 2020 ogbozige et al 2020 ouma et al 2020 as a matter of fact the usefulness of these artificial intelligence modeling techniques in water quality assessment and prediction cannot be overemphasized the current research focuses on the industrial water quality of ojoto suburb in southeastern nigeria the inhabitants residents and industrialists in this suburb rely on several water sources including surface and groundwaters for drinking domestic cooking and laundry agricultural commercial and industrial usages egbueri 2021a in recent times the growths in urbanization industrialization and socioeconomic activities have consequently led to rapid human population growth and high demand of water supply the corrosivity and scaling tendencies of the water resources has been investigated by egbueri 2021a it was revealed that the industrial sector at small medium and large scales as well as domestic and agricultural sectors that store and use large quantities of water is currently faced with the risks associated with corrosion and scaling of distribution channels by corrosive water resources egbueri 2021a however one of the key limitations of water quality research in the study area is insufficient funding as a consequence of this regular and extensive water quality monitoring and assessment to acquire large data are not carried out thus researchers are mostly left to use small data points in making interpretations and recommendations nevertheless and fortunately too it has been found that artificial intelligence machine learning modeling techniques could be used to robustly estimate and forecast water quality parameters in areas where data are scarce nhantumbo et al 2018 mazhar et al 2019 ozel et al 2020 egbueri 2021b although several studies have forecasted drinking water quality using machine learning models e g mr anns and hcs etc nadiri et al 2013 chen and liu 2015 abba et al 2017 alizamir and sobhanardakani 2017 nhantumbo et al 2018 wagh et al 2017 2018 kadam et al 2019 ouma et al 2020 latif et al 2020 ozel et al 2020 sakaa et al 2020 egbueri 2021b singh et al 2021 globally researches that have predicted industrial water quality indices csmr psi lsi ri ai rsi and li based on these models are scarce unfortunately to the best of the author s searches and knowledge none of such studies has been done in nigeria hence this work is considered the first of its kind to utilize artificial intelligence in simultaneously predicting the industrial water quality indices integration of artificial intelligence in modeling the industrial water quality indices would aid in resolving the challenges associated with accurate computation of water quality indices and regular water quality monitoring especially in areas where data acquisition is expensive also the artificial intelligence modeling of industrial water quality could assist industrialists water managers policymakers researchers and the inhabitants to generate sustainable water management plans this approach is especially beneficial for the current study area where lack of funding has been identified as one of the main drawbacks of regular extensive water quality monitoring and assessment egbueri 2021b therefore the aim of this paper is to develop optimized artificial intelligence models including mr hcs and anns for predicting and analysing the csps of water resources in ojoto suburb southeastern nigeria the main objectives of this work are to 1 determine the relationships between the physicochemical properties of the natural water resources and the csp indices 2 determine and demarcate the industrial water quality classes and categorize the risk of corrosion and scaling in the study region 3 develop mr and ann models for the estimation and prediction of the csp indices of the natural water resources and 4 analyze the relative importance and influence of the tested physicochemical species on the architectures of the developed ann models moreover the most efficient optimization algorithm for the machine models was identified the most suitable predictor physicochemical parameters for the prediction of the industrial water quality indices were identified and the performances of the mr and ann models were compared it is hoped that this paper will contribute great insights towards the sustainable water resources management in the study area as the developed models would serve as sustainability indicators 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area is found within anambra state in southeastern nigeria west africa and located within 06 50 e 07 00 e and 06 00 n 6 05 n fig 1 the area under study lies a few kilometers away from onitsha which is known as a major commercial hub of in the west african sub region commerce agriculture and human settlements are the major land use patterns predominant in the area following the recent upsurge in industrialization and commercial activities there is an increase in human settlement and industries in the study area resulting in an increase in the population growth among the emerging industries in the area are water bottling companies petrochemical and food industries municipal and domestic water distribution facilities in the area are generally made up of steel iron plastics and polymer of vinyl chloride pvc two major seasons are predominant in the area the wet or rainy season spans from april to november while dry season spans from december to march the dry season is accompanied by dry dusty winds with very high temperatures ranging from 27 c to 32 c egbueri et al 2019 egboka 1993 during the wet season rainfall intensity can reach heights of about 1500 2000 mm egbueri 2021a an observation of fig 1 shows that the major lithostratigraphic units underlying the study area are the nanka formation eocene and the ogwashi formation oligocene miocene the nanka formation is made up of light colored mudrocks alternating friable sands intercalated with sandy shale units and thin bands of limestone and ironstones nwajide 2013 stratigraphically the nanka formation which underlies 80 of the study area is known to be deposited by the regressive depositional episode that occurred during the second phase of the campanian eocene compressive movements nwajide 2013 this deposition episode is known to have given rise to the folding of the abakaliki anticlinorium nwachukwu 1972 the ogwashi formation on the other hand was birthed from the third phase of the tectonic movement which is believed to have commenced towards the end of the eocene period obi et al 2001 the ogwashi formation is composed majorly of alternations of coarse grained and poorly to moderately consolidated sandstone units additionally the rock types of the ogwashi formation are known to be composed of light colored mudrocks and limestones with alternating bands of ironstones and lignite seams nwajide 2013 these two geological formations are known to be the most prolific aquiferous units with variation in aquifer depths akpoborie et al 2011 okoro et al 2010 nfor et al 2007 some literatures have reported greater aquifer depth at the nanka formation than the ogwashi formation in some parts of the state average aquifer depth of 20 m have been reported for the nanka formation nfor et al 2007 however shallower aquifer depth average 7 m have been documented for the ogwashi formation okoro et al 2010 however there is no literature regarding an estimation of the recent aquifer depth in the study area 2 2 physicochemical data for predictive modeling the physicochemical water quality datasets for the present artificial intelligence predictive modeling and assessment were obtained from egbueri 2021a a total of twenty eight water sources including streams springs hand dug wells and boreholes from ojoto and its surroundings in southeastern nigeria fig 1 were analyzed for ph temperature t electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total hardness th calcium ca bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl sulphate so4 iron fe zinc zn and lead pb the ion balance was calculated to check the accuracy and precision of the physicochemical test eq 1 an ion balance of 5 was obtained indicating that the results exhibit acceptable accuracy and precision these twelve physicochemical parameters presented in this work were considered paramount in the evaluation of the corrosivity and scaling tendencies of the water resources egbueri 2021a thus the selected twelve analytical parameters were useful in the current predictive modeling study the sample locations and the underlying geology of the study area are also shown in fig 1 1 cations anions cations anions x 100 2 3 methodology of industrial water quality indexing in recent times industrialization is recognized as one of the major backbones for strong economic growth and development especially in developing countries like nigeria this implies that several industries and industrial activities that would require high quality water supply would be on continuous increase hence a nation planning for industrialization goals should also consider the provision of high quality water for the industrial sector oftentimes availability of adequate water supply remains a big challenge for the industrial sector egbueri et al 2021a this is also a common challenge for several homes as a matter of fact a lot of homes institutions and industries are now faced with numerous undesirable effects of water corrosion and scaling abbasnia et al 2018 aghazadeh et al 2017 sajil kumar 2019 egbueri et al 2020a egbueri 2021a mankikar 2021 the methodology of industrial water quality indexing for the current study area involved the use of several indices such as csmr psi lsi ri ai rsi and li to determine the corrosivity and encrustation scaling of the water resources the equations eqs 1 7 utilized for the computation of the corrosion and scaling potentials csps of the water resources are shown in table 1 2 4 quantifying inter and intra relations of physicochemical variables and csp indices in order to establish the interrelationships between the physicochemical parameters and the csp indices a number of multivariate statistical tools were integrated in this study pearson s and spearman s correlation analysis ca unrotated principal component analysis pca varimax rotated factor analysis fa with kaiser normalization and r mode hierarchical clusters hcs were utilized in the examination of the inter relations between the analyzed and computed water quality variables the direct linearity between these parameters was estimated using the ca pca and fa are machine learning techniques used to reduce the dimensionality of groups of inter correlated datasets or parameters the hcs were used to cluster the inter relationships between the parameters under study the pca fa and hcs performed in this work were to further validate the findings of the ca and to capture some associations not provided by the ca egbueri and unigwe 2020 onyemesili et al 2020 ibm spss v 22 was utilized for these basic multivariate statistical modeling the pca and fa extractions were selected based on the kaiser 1960 selection criterion in this criterion component and factor classes with eigenvalues 1 are selected and the ones with lower eigenvalues are rejected while the former groups are believed to have significant details and information about the dataset the latter with eigenvalues 1 are believed to be unnecessary as they have no substantial information about the interrelationships of dataset parameters under study for the r mode hcs ward 1963 s linkage method with squared euclidean distance was used the loadings coefficients of the ca pca and fa obtained in this study were categorized into three as thus coefficient 0 5 signify weak relationship 0 5 coefficient 0 75 signify medium moderate relationship and coefficient 0 75 signify strong relationship enyigwe et al 2021 it has been reported that the level of associations between water quality parameters as revealed by the ca pca and fa could provide useful insights for the selection of suitable predictors for advanced artificial intelligence modeling egbueri 2021b this implies that the linearity and nonlinearity of the parameters could easily be preliminarily flagged using the ca pca and fa variables with moderate and strong inter relationships seem to be more suitable predictors in ann and hcs modeling egbueri 2021b however whereby there are more of nonlinear associations the predictors could be selected based on researcher s discretion and expert knowledge 2 5 spatiotemporal q mode hierarchical clustering hierarchical cluster analysis hca is an unsupervised machine learning pattern recognition technique used in the determination of the primary structure comparisons or principal characteristics of a given dataset without holding on to prior assumptions about the dataset vega et al 1998 dash et al 2018 by hca system objects can be categorized into groups or simply clusters based on their similarities and dissimilarities to model the spatiotemporal distribution of the csp indices in the study area q mode hcs were utilized over time the usefulness of q mode hcs in water quality assessment has been widely acknowledged by several workers yidana 2010 ukah et al 2020 egbueri 2021b in this work the hierarchical agglomerative clusters were useful in the determination and demarcation of the spatiotemporal industrial water quality and classes obtained in the area moreover the hcs enhanced the qualitative description of the area s industrial water quality the input variables used for the spatiotemporal clustering in the present work are the csp indices thus seven dendrograms that are representatives of the seven csp indices were first produced specifically the first second third fourth fifth sixth and seventh hierarchical dendrograms represent the csmr ri lsi li ai rsi and psi distributions respectively afterwards a cumulative dendrogram which integrated the seven csp indices was produced to harmonize and summarize the spatiotemporal water quality modeling similar to the r mode clustering the q mode hcs were developed using the ward s 1963 linkage this linkage method has been found to be more reliable than other linkage methods güler et al 2002 yidana 2010 subba rao and chaudhary 2019 amiri et al 2020 egbueri and unigwe 2020 ukah et al 2020 egbueri 2021b furthermore the spatiotemporal analysis of the csp indices i e the input variables was done via squared euclidean distance estimation eq 9 singh et al 2004 shrestha and kazama 2007 dash et al 2018 the squared euclidean distance typically reveals the resemblance between two parameters or samples and further revealing the variations in their analytical values singh et al 2004 by this technique the similarities and dissimilarities of the variables and water sample localities were established as the obtained distances are typical indicators of the water quality variances 9 distance q i q j j 1 n x 1 i x 2 j 2 where q i is the ith object x ij is the score of the jth parameter of the ith object it is pertinent to mention that the input variables csp indices for the various locations were standardized by z score transformation algorithm prior to the development of the eight q mode dendrograms this was done to minimize bias that could be associated with the variations in the variable scores by this method the information provided by the hcs are seen to be dimensionless and on a uniform scale nevertheless it is known that the transformation to dimensionless values is a key disadvantage of the hierarchical cluster analysis as equal weights and importance are usually assigned to the analyzed variables egbueri 2021b however the standardization and transformation of data have been reported to outweigh this disadvantage as the use of raw data could give rise to higher errors in data classification and interpretation yidana 2010 egbueri 2021b 2 6 multiple regression modeling the selection of the kind of regression analysis to be performed on a certain dataset depends on the purpose of the simulation and assessment multiple regression mr is the kind of regression analysis that is usually employed in a scenario whereby the relationship between multiple input predictor variables and a single output predicted variable is sought thus by mr the extent of relationship between the variables could easily be estimated this analysis has been implemented across several fields to forecast predict a possible outcome i e a dependent variable based on the input of more than one available factors i e independent variables adams et al 2004 this implies that mr allows for the simulation of random independent explanatory variables in the prediction of a dependent predicted or response variable thus simplifying the predictive modeling of linear and non linear fitting kumar et al 2019 this modeling method which is based on least squares fitting is very suitable especially in a scenario where the dataset is relatively small weisberg 1985 ouma et al 2020 mathematically mr model expresses the scores of the predicted dependent parameter as a linear function of the multiple predictor variables as shown in eq 10 chenini and khemiri 2009 chen and liu 2015 abba et al 2017 stangierski et al 2019 ogbozige et al 2020 ouma et al 2020 khalid and usman 2021 mahmoud et al 2021 noting that mr helps in the determination of the level of variation between the analyzed variables the mr equation defines the line of y response variable on x explanatory variables 10 y b 0 b 1 x 2 b 2 x 2 b i x i ε where x i represents the value of the ith predictor b 0 represent the regression constant whereas b i represents the coefficient of the ith predictor chen and liu 2015 ε represents the residual or error for individual i ouma et al 2020 for the current mr study all the physicochemical parameters ph t ec tds th ca hco3 cl so4 fe zn and pb were used as the input predictor variables however the seven csp indices csmr ri lsi li ai rsi and psi were utilized as the output response variables thus a total of seven mr models were produced all the models were developed using the ibm spss statistics v 22 2 7 artificial neural network modeling artificial neural network ann is a modern soft computing method for simulating and analyzing datasets in such a manner that mimics the human brain anns are comprised of artificial neurons that are inter connected to each other and this interconnection depicts the flow of information and how information is processed by the networks because of its unique characteristics ann is used in finding the relationship between independent input variables and dependent output variables thus the existing correlation and non correlation of the both variables could be established using ann model agatonovic kustrin and beresford 2000 khandelwal and singh 2011 monjezi et al 2013 asadi et al 2014 nadiri et al 2021 thus researches have shown that ann models can be used in modeling both linear and nonlinear relationships between process and response variables under study ighalo et al 2021 egbueri 2021b and as such they have also been found useful in solving several engineering and environmental problems özşahin 2012 asadi et al 2014 heidari et al 2019 egbueri 2021b ighalo et al 2021 nadiri et al 2017 2018 2021 the usefulness of anns cuts across several diverse fields of study including water resources engineering hydrogeology and environmental geology anns have been commonly used in modeling groundwater and surface water resources nadiri et al 2017 2018 rajaee et al 2019 ozel et al 2020 egbueri 2021b anns artificial intelligence modeling has been widely used in the prediction of water quality parameters this is because they provide robust numerical simulation and estimation of water quality via their powerful forecasting functions thus anns have received wider and continuous acceptance in several fields for accurate and effective analysis of water quality usually getting the most suitable ann models for water quality prediction involves the simultaneous training of several networks with wide range of neuron numbers input and output activation functions and training optimization algorithms at the end of which the most suitable ann model is chosen for interpretation in this study the essential methodological information required for the development of ann models used for the water quality prediction are shown in table 2 feedforward back propagated multilayer perceptron mlp neural networks were developed two ann models ann1 and ann2 trained and developed with hyperbolic tangent activation function scaled conjugate gradient scg and gradient descent gd optimization algorithms table 2 were utilized in the current water quality prediction modeling the input water quality variables include the ph t ec tds th ca hco3 cl so4 fe zn and pb whereas the response water quality variables include csmr ri lsi li ai rsi and psi hence each ann model has a multi output layer containing the seven csp indices it should be recalled that these csp indices that formed the multi output layers are the major means through which the industrial water quality of the study area is evaluated ten unit one hidden layer which translated the information provided by the input layers to the output layers was utilized for both ann1 and ann2 moreover it is pertinent to mention that the architectures of the ann models were decided by analyzing the impact of the input variables on the performances of the networks sensitivity analysis of the neural network models was carried out to note the most relevant input variables for the ann modeling the development of the ann models was performed in ibm spss statistics v 22 2 8 validation of artificial intelligence models it is usually necessary to test the performances of artificial intelligence models in order to certify their reliability and applicability in real time scenarios again the model validation is necessary due to the fact that the original values presented in a dataset and those predicted using machine learning techniques are not always in line egbueri 2021b hence by performance validation the most suitable models are selected and implemented moreover model validation aids in the identification of the most effective input output activation functions and training optimization algorithms egbueri 2021b herein the performances of the mr models were validated using multiple correlation coefficient r coefficient of determination r2 eq 11 adjusted r square r2 standard error of estimate see and f ratio however the performances of the ann models were examined and validated through direct comparison of parity plots coefficient of determination or r square r2 eq 11 relative mean square

discussion 3 1 general water quality and possible influencing factors 3 1 1 physicochemical and csp indexing results while the results of the physicochemical parameters analyzed in the natural water resources are presented in table 3 a the results of the computed csp indices are shown in table 3b generally the physicochemical results table 3a revealed that the natural water resources have 1 the concentrations of ec tds th ca so4 cl hco3 and zn well within the nigerian industrial standard nis 2007 and world health organization who 2017 standard limits 2 ph values that are mostly typical of acidic waters that could pose high corrosive effects on metallic storage facilities and distribution networks egbueri 2019 sajil kumar 2019 and 3 the concentration of fe and pb exceeded their nis 2007 and who 2017 standard limits in some of the water resources egbueri 2021a high concentrations of fe and pb in water have been attributed to a number of processes including deterioration and leaching of metallic distribution systems made of fe and pb nis 2007 who 2017 egbueri 2021a egbueri et al 2021a however high fe in water could also be linked to some redox reactions that take place in natural water systems onyemesili et al 2020 egbueri et al 2020b while it is believed that hco3 a weak acid and cl and so4 strong acids possibly influenced the acidity of the water resources it is also believed that the water hardness might have been impacted by the dissolved bivalent calcium similar reports have been documented in literature agatemor and okolo 2008 mukate et al 2019 aghazadeh et al 2017 akoteyon et al 2018 sajil kumar 2019 egbueri et al 2020a 2021a thus while the decrement in acidity causes the water to be more corrosive the dissolution of calcium increases its hardness and scaling potential it has also been found that so4 2 in water could greatly influences the dissolution of metallic materials used for municipal industrial or domestic water distribution networks this has been attributed to the conversion process of so4 sulphate to sulfides that are corrosive atasoy and yesilnacar 2010 ismail and el shamy 2009 in corrosion studies fe and pb have been identified as potentially toxic elements that are commonly found in water pipes and are also known to leach from pipes under the influence of corrosive water egbueri 2021a in this study it was found that about 14 28 of total samples had high fe content above its allowable limit 0 3 mg l who 2017 nis 2007 table 3a generally it believed that redox reactions in the water distribution systems could facilitated the leaching and enrichment of fe in the water resources barzegar et al 2019 egbueri et al 2020a on the other hand excess concentration of pb against the standard threshold of 0 001 mg l was noticed in about 46 43 of the water samples and this could be attributed to the leaching of leaded pipes in the water distribution systems who 2017 nis 2007 egbueri et al 2019 the presence of pb could also be linked to industrial wastes barzegar et al 2019 egbueri et al 2021a with respect to the csp indices it was generally reported that the water samples are mostly corrosive with some having scaling encrustation potentials regarding the csmr water resources for industrial purposes can be classified into two groups while water resources having csmr 0 5 are classified to have no galvanic corrosion potential those with csmr value 0 5 are grouped as waters with significant galvanic corrosion potential edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 stets et al 2017 egbueri 2021a egbueri et al 2020a 2021a mankikar 2021 amongst the analyzed water resources are found 96 43 samples with csmr 0 5 and 3 57 of the total samples with csmr 0 5 table 3b contrarily majority of the other csp indices indicated that most of the water samples are very corrosive in nature for instance li ai rsi and psi revealed that all the analyzed water samples are corrosive the classification scheme of these four indices is presented in table 4 it is seen that all of the four indices li ai rsi and psi suggested that none of the samples have significant scaling potential tables 3b and 4 nevertheless lsi seem to have captured those samples with scaling potential water is classified into three classes based on the lsi categorically lsi 0 8 signifies water resource that has significant scaling potential and slight corrosive tendency 0 8 lsi 1 2 is indicative of a water sample with corrosion tendency higher than expected and lsi 1 2 signifies water resource with higher corrosion potential larson and skold 1958 us epa 1984 shams et al 2012 abbasnia et al 2018 sajil kumar 2019 egbueri 2021a egbueri et al 2020a 2021a it was realized that 71 43 17 86 and 10 71 of the water samples fell into the first second and third categories respectively see table 3b for lsi result further the water resources were analyzed using ri model to investigate whether or not the csp of the water resources were influenced by salinization based on a classification scheme adopted from akoteyon et al 2018 samples with ri 0 5 are unaffected by salinization processes those with ri in the range of 0 5 6 6 are slightly influenced by salinization whereas those with ri 6 6 are noted to be strongly influenced by salinization processes for this study area all the analyzed water samples were observed to have ri scores 0 5 table 3b overall it was realized that the majority of the water resources analyzed in this study have more corrosive potential than scaling potential this implies that the risk of water channel network destruction as a result of corrosion is much higher than the risk of water channel clogging as a result of encrustation or scaling comparing this observation with previous researches in literature it was discovered that most previous authors found the water resources they analyzed to be more corrosive in nature with lower scaling potential edwards and triantafyllidou 2007 atasoy and yesilnacar 2010 ismail and el shamy 2009 stets et al 2017 shams et al 2012 abbasnia et al 2018 sajil kumar 2019 agatemor and okolo 2008 mukate et al 2019 aghazadeh et al 2017 akoteyon et al 2018 egbueri et al 2020a 2021a mankikar 2021 this might be suggesting that industrial areas where those water resources were analyzed seem to have more of acidic waters than alkaline waters 3 1 2 processes affecting the quality of water resources developing a thorough awareness of the current state of accessible water resources as well as the various processes that influence their quality is critical to formulating informed plans and decisions for efficient water management security use and preservation li and wu 2019 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 subba rao and chaudhary 2019 egbueri 2019 prior studies in this region have identified various factors such as lithology hydrology setting mineral rock weathering leaching and anthropogenic inputs from agriculture industry and illegal refuse dumping etc as responsible factors that have affected the chemistry and quality of the water resources egbueri et al 2019 in the study area it is believed that natural and anthropogenic inputs have an impact on the quality of both surface and groundwater lithostratigraphic units such as shales claystones and sandstones dominate the study area these rock formations are typically rich calcic minerals which could have great impacts on water quality for industrial purpose subba rao and chaudhary 2019 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 gaikwad et al 2019 the weathering and leaching processes of these rocks could cause water to contain more calcium ions making it unpalatable to drink and generally unfit for human consumption the ph of the water samples in ojoto area were found to range from 4 to 6 4 table 3 indicating that they are acidic compost from organic or plant decomposition as well as potentially related geochemical processes in the area could be responsible for the acidity of the water resources this could also be attributed to sewage spilled by industries and other factory activities in the research region in humans acidic waters can induce gastrointestinal problems and mucocutaneous degeneration gaikwad et al 2019 the water temperature ranged from 23 to 29 c with an average value of 25 42 c which is considered warm who 2011 2017 warm water is thought to affect mineral dissolution rates and increase the growth of possibly dangerous bacteria which could affect the taste feel smell and corrosiveness of the water in this study area table 3 shows that the tds values obtained for the samples all the water samples showed minimal level below the who allowed range likewise all of the ec results were less than the who s permitted limit of 900 μs cm the amount of dissolved magnesium and calcium in water is measured by total hardness the average th of the analyzed water samples in the ojoto area was between 6 and 52 mg l which was found to be within the allowed level indicating that the water is soft and does not represent a health risk to humans all of the cl concentrations recorded were below the who s maximum allowed limit of 600 mg l table 3 the occurrence of chlorides might be attributed to leaching of chloride containing materials high chloride rich waste and urban industrial effluent released by inhabitants which then came into contact with water resources in all of the areas studied it could also possibly be as a result of chloride salts emitted as industrial effluents in the region all so4 2 levels were below the who acceptable limit of 400 mg l however a buildup of sulphate in water can cause an increase in ph resulting in acidification excess sulphate in water has had no significant health implications or adverse effects to date in the study area in the water samples the bicarbonate ion hco3 was discovered to be the most prevalent anion weathering of calcium bearing rocks causes a high percentage of bicarbonates in water to diverge the principal cause of bicarbonate ions in spring water is dissolved carbon dioxide obtained from rainfall more carbon dioxide is dissolved in water when it penetrates the soil and rocks hosting the water by the action of co2 on carbonates bicarbonates are formed furthermore hydrolysis which enhances chemical weathering could also be responsible for the formation of hco3 in general all of the chemical ions collected in this area were below their corresponding nis 2007 recommended permissible level for industrial applications as a result all of the samples are deemed safe for human consumption and industrial food processing based on these water quality factors and the nis 2007 and who 2011 2017 guidelines a number of naturally occurring phenomena have been considered responsible for the release of potentially toxic elements in water nagajyoti et al 2010 nriagu 1989 ayejoto et al 2021 leaching of pb from piping systems and industrial effluent could be blamed for the significant pb concentration in some of the water sources who 2011 2017 nis 2007 ukah et al 2019 egbueri 2018 furthermore high levels of pb in drinking water can cause serious damage to human health such as cancers hearing loss brain disorders developmental delays intense delusions and procreation issues vitamin d respiration suppression leukopenia and abnormal blood tissue structure and drowsiness and irritability in children nis 2007 who 2011 2017 ukah et al 2019 fe concentrations in some of the samples about 14 28 exceeded the permissible levels of 0 3 mg l nis 2007 who 2011 2017 despite the fact that iron is an integral part of human diet its high concentration in water causes major pollution and health issues kumar and puri 2012 however iron deficiency has been linked to cause nausea sudden cardiac death and constipation as well as the breakdown of blood coagulation egbueri et al 2022 ayejoto et al 2022 the concentration of iron in water was beyond the guideline limits indicating high contamination according to the findings of this study the detected fe concentrations over the allowable limit could be due to leaching of iron natural deposits into water sources although zn concentrations were minimal in all samples various pipe materials composed of iron steel pvc polymer of vinyl chloride and plastic are utilized in the ojoto area for water distribution both in households and in industry resulting in water corrosion and scaling that is hazardous to public health egbueri et al 2019 in general water resources in this area have low to negligible scaling possibilities but high corrosive tendencies implying that if caution is not exercised pipe lines well equipment storage tanks household and commercial water quality and distribution channels will deteriorate further the knowledge presented in this study about the processes that influence water quality will aid decision making processes needed for the remediation preservation and maintenance of water resources in the studied area 3 2 quantifying inter and intra relations of physicochemical variables and csp indices 3 2 1 relationship quantification by ca both pearson s and spearman s correlation analyses were performed on the physicochemical variables and the csp indices both were utilized for the sake of validation and to capture the parametric associations not captured by either of the two correlation methods while the extracted pearson s coefficients are presented in table 5 a the extracted spearman s rho coefficients are shown in table 5b from table 5a the following significant positive correlation pairs were observed t tds th ec ca ec ca th ph hco3 so4 t tds so4 pb zn ri ca ri csmr lsi cl li ph li ec li th li ca li hco3 ai ph ai ec ai th ai hco3 and psi rsi nonetheless the significant negative correlation pairs observed from table 5a are rsi ph ec rsi rsi th rsi ca rsi hco3 rsi so4 rsi li rsi ai psi t psi ec psi ec psi tds psi ca psi th psi so4 psi li and psi ai on the other hand from table 5b the following significant positive correlation pairs were seen t tds th ec ca ec ca th so4 t so4 ec so4 tds ri csmr lsi cl lsi ri li ph li ec li ca li hco3 li so4 ai ph ai ec ai hco3 ai so4 ai li psi ri and psi rsi however more significant negative relationships were noticed in table 5b than in table 5a csmr cl ri tds ri so4 lsi so4 rsi ec rsi tds rsi th rsi ca rsi hco3 rsi so4 rsi li rsi tds rsi ai psi t psi ec psi tds psi so4 psi li and psi ai based on the observations made from table 5a and b the following can be deduced 1 the physical parameters such as ph t tds and ec seem to influence the presence of the anions e g hco3 and so4 in the waters 2 the presence of ca typically influences the th and ec of the water resources 3 the th in turn seems to influence the ec of the waters 4 the strong association between the t and tds suggests that t influences the dissolution of minerals in the waters 5 the strong relationship between zn and pb suggests a common origin for both possibly from anthropogenic source s 6 the significant positive inter relations between the physicochemical variables and the csp indices are indicative of the strong influences the former have on the latter 7 the significant negative relationships between the physicochemical factors and the csp indices suggest an inverse proportionality and as such the former seem to have lower or no impact on the scores of the latter 8 the obvious positive relationships between the csp indices ri csmr psi rsi lsi ri ai li and psi ri table 5a and b are indicative that their numeric values substantially follow similar trend thus are said to be directly proportionate to some extents 9 the peculiar negative associations between the csp indices rsi li rsi ai psi li and psi ai table 5a and b are indicative of the inverse trends between their numerical scores and 10 the numerous inter and intra relationships between the physicochemical variables and the csp indices indicate that they could be utilized for advanced artificial intelligence predictive modeling especially for anns which can forecast both linear and nonlinear functions 3 2 2 relationship quantification by pca and fa results of the pca and fa were also found useful in assessing the relationships between all the analyzed water quality variables the extracted unrotated principal component pc loadings are presented in table 6 a while the extracted varimax rotated factor loadings are shown in table 6b for both pca and fa six pc factor classes with their eigenvalues 1 were selected and others discarded fig 2 table 6 with respect to table 6a a total of 88 579 of the data variances were explained by the six pcs pc1 explained about 36 151 of the variabilities and has high loadings on t ec tds th ca hco3 so4 li ai rsi and psi pc2 has significant loadings on ph t tds so4 and fe explaining about 18 054 of the total variances table 6a while pc3 was realized with significant loadings on pb csmr and ri pc4 was seen to have obvious loadings on cl and lsi however pc5 has significant loading on only zn whereas pc6 which explained about 5 634 of the variabilities has no significant loading on any of the variables table 6a based on the observed associations contained in table 6a the following inferences are made 1 the pc1 demonstrates that the four csp indices li ai rsi and psi that showed that all the water samples are very corrosive are influenced and predictable by t ec tds th ca hco3 and so4 2 the ph seems to affect the presence of fe whereas t seems to obviously influence the concentrations of tds and so4 in the waters 3 the pc3 is mostly comprised of the csp indices csmr and ri that showed high correlations table 5a and b and suggested that the waters have low galvanic corrosion potential and are not influenced by salinization this pc might also be indicating that pb may or may not be a suitable predictor of csmr and ri as the former is positively loaded and the former negatively loaded table 6a 4 the pc4 suggests that cl is a more suitable predictor of the lsi model and 5 the separation of zn and pb into different pcs both elements were seen to correlate well in table 5a could be indicating that zn might also have geogenic origin s egbueri et al 2020b furthermore the factor classes extracted from the fa shown in table 6b also explained about 88 579 of the total variances in the dataset simpler parameter associations were noticed from the fa than from the pca moreover factor 1 with about 21 448 explanation of the data variability has noticed loadings on t tds so4 and psi whereas factor 2 that explained about 19 277 of variances was significantly loaded by ph hco3 li ai and rsi table 6b factor 3 which explained about 19 073 variances has key loadings ec th ca rsi and psi however factors 4 5 and 6 were observed with lower percentages of variance and have significant loadings on zn and pb csmr and ri and cl and lsi respectively table 6b the following inferences could be drawn based on the observations contained in table 6b 1 factor 1 reiterates that the water temperature t influences the tds and so4 concentrations moreover factor 1 seems to imply and as reported by the ca table 5a and b that t tds and so4 have significant negative correlation with psi this might influence the mr prediction modeling more than the ann prediction 2 strong associations seem to exist between the ph and hco3 and li and ai more than the rsi which has negative loading 3 the inverse proportionality shown between ec th ca and rsi psi table 5a and b seems to be reiterated in the factor 3 thus these associations are important for advanced predictive modeling 4 the association between zn and pb is reiterated and this suggests that their commonality in terms of origin is more than their difference s 5 the strong relationship between csmr and ri given in tables 5a b and 6a is confirmed by the factor 5 and 6 as highlighted by ca and pca tables 5 and 6a the strong association between cl and lsi seems to confirm that the latter could be well predicted by the former 3 2 3 relationship quantification by r mode hcs r mode hcs were also employed in the present research to further explain the associations between the analyzed water quality variables two r mode hierarchical dendrograms were produced fig 3 the hcs produced in this study appear to provide a more simplified clear cut association of the analyzed variables the first hierarchical cluster dendrogram given as fig 3a revealed four major cluster groups cluster 1 is comprised of two sub clusters sub cluster 1 has li ai ph and hco3 while sub cluster 2 has zn pb and fe fig 3a it is seen and affirmed from the sub cluster 1 that li and ai have strong relationship and that ph and hco3 seem to influence both li and ai accordingly again the sub cluster 2 confirmed the relationship between the potentially toxic elements especially for zn and pb based on the variation in the euclidean distances shown in the sub cluster 2 it is suggested that fe has a different source from zn and pb the concentration of fe in water has also been attributed to origins such as ferruginization processes weathering of ironstones and dissolution of ferromagnesian minerals e g pentlandite in the form of iron sulphide and redox and anoxic reaction processes in the water environment barzegar et al 2019 egbueri 2019 egbueri and unigwe 2020 cluster 2 also has two sub clusters while the first sub cluster is comprised of csmr and ri the second sub cluster has th ca and ec as members fig 3a however while cluster 3 is comprised of tds so4 and t cluster 3 is constituted by rsi and psi sub cluster 1 and lsi and cl sub cluster 2 fig 3a in view of the information provided by clusters 2 to 4 it suffices to say that 1 the relationship between ri and csmr is affirmed 2 ca is affirmed as the main influencer of the waters th and ec 3 the so4 and tds of the waters are affirmed to be highly dependent on the temperature t 4 the association between rsi and psi is affirmed and 5 the correlation between lsi and cl is affirmed and cl could be the most suitable predictor of the lsi model furthermore the intra relationships between the csp indices were also examined using r mode hcs the second hierarchical dendrogram fig 3b revealed three main cluster classes based on the csp indices for the industrial water quality assessment cluster 1 is comprised of li and ai while cluster 2 has csmr and ri cluster 3 is composed of two sub clusters sub cluster 1 rsi and psi and sub cluster 2 lsi fig 3b this dendrogram affirmed the relationships initially revealed by the ca pca and fa between 1 li and ai 2 csmr and ri and 3 rsi and psi nevertheless it is now clearly seen that apart from the moderate correlation that exist between lsi and ri table 5b the lsi which is the only model that reported that most of the analyzed water resources have significant scaling potentials seems to have no obvious association with the other csp indices utilized in this research 3 3 q mode hierarchical spatiotemporal modeling this modeling study aided the demarcation of the industrial water quality in terms of the csp indices of the study area into stable data subsets that show the extent of corrosivity and encrustation risks hazards the water resources pose though hca modeling has been considered as a semi objective machine learning approach yidana 2010 egbueri 2021b combining the result of the hca and background knowledge of water quality assessment often enhances the interpretation of the model outcomes importantly in this work the hcs extracted were useful in analyzing and discussing the spatiotemporal distribution and classification and the possible corrosion and scaling risks of the analyzed waters in the study region a totality of eight q mode hc dendrograms were generated for the spatiotemporal interpretation of the industrial water quality indices the first second third fourth fifth sixth seventh and eighth hc dendrograms represent the csmr ri lsi li ai rsi psi and cumulative joint csp indices distributions respectively fig 4 a h in fig 4a which represents the cmsr distribution three main clusters were identified cluster 1 included water sites 3 28 13 4 6 2 12 16 25 14 19 21 22 5 11 24 9 15 20 and 26 fig 4a while cluster 2 has sites 1 8 18 23 7 17 and 27 cluster 3 has only water site 10 fig 4a based on the observed dendrogram classification amongst the three clusters cluster 3 has the highest risk of corrosion thus the order of increasing corrosive tendency of the sites based on csmr is cluster 1 with csmr 0 150 cluster 2 with csmr values between 0 150 and 0 400 cluster 3 with csmr 0 500 fig 4a table 3b although all the sampling sites have been noted to be less impacted by salinization processes the second dendrogram fig 4b that classified the sites based on ri revealed two main demarcations cluster 1 of fig 4b is constituted by sites 16 25 14 3 24 5 20 6 12 19 28 7 22 4 17 13 18 9 and 15 while cluster 2 included sites 2 26 1 11 8 21 27 23 and 10 fig 4b the ri scores of the cluster 1 were found to be 0 035 whereas those for the cluster 2 ranged from 0 035 to 0 239 fig 4b table 3b hence the cluster 1 is seen to have the lowest risk of salinization while cluster 2 seem to have higher risk with site 10 having the highest csmr dendrogram showing the classification of the sampling sites with respect to lsi is shown in fig 4c it was realized that this dendrogram has two main hcs while cluster 1 loaded with sites 8 17 18 25 27 1 13 20 23 3 28 7 16 6 24 12 4 19 and 10 has lsi values 0 700 cluster 2 comprised of sites 11 26 2 14 5 9 22 15 and 21 has lsi range of 0 700 3 163 fig 4c table 3b based on the formed classes it was noticed that the first cluster contains sites with high scaling potentials while the second cluster has sites that are mostly corrosive with slight scaling potential furthermore a dendrogram representing the li model was also produced and shown as fig 4d two hcs were realized from this dendrogram cluster 1 comprises of the water sites 16 17 22 9 21 8 26 14 24 25 11 23 4 and 27 with li values ranging from 5 841 to 4 096 however cluster 2 that included sites 2 13 18 10 1 19 12 5 28 6 15 7 20 and 3 has li scores 4 096 fig 4d table 3b this hierarchical classification implies that even though all the samples are corrosive the samples in cluster 1 seem to have higher corrosive tendency and lower scaling potential whereas those of the cluster 2 seem to have higher scaling tendency and lower corrosive tendency with respect to li tables 3b and 4 the aggressive nature ai of the natural waters was classified using the dendrogram shown in fig 4e the samples were effectively classified into two main cluster members although the ai result had suggested that all the sampled sites have high aggressive nature cluster 1 is made up of water sites 16 17 26 8 25 22 1 12 5 19 9 24 14 21 4 27 11 and 23 with their ai values ranging between 6 324 and 7 660 on the other hand cluster 2 is constituted by water sites 6 15 7 20 28 10 18 3 13 and 2 that have their ai values in the range of 8 034 9 442 fig 4e table 3b with reference to the ai classification scheme table 4 it suffices to say that the aggressiveness of the water samples in cluster 1 surpasses that of those samples that constitute cluster 2 nevertheless the next dendrogram which represents the spatiotemporal classes of the rsi model is given as fig 4f three main cluster groups were extracted from fig 4f cluster 1 included water sites 13 18 2 15 6 7 20 and 10 fig 4f the rsi values of this cluster class were observed to range from 11 328 to 13 291 table 3b while cluster 2 has water sites 11 23 4 17 21 27 and 22 cluster 3 has sites 1 16 8 26 9 3 24 12 25 14 5 28 and 19 fig 4f the cluster 2 sites have their rsi scores found between 15 401 and 15 983 whereas cluster 3 sites rsi maintained a range of 13 638 15 116 fig 4f table 3b as have been noted earlier rsi classified all the samples as being highly corrosive however the corrosiveness and risk of the waters seem to follow the order cluster 2 cluster 3 cluster 1 the seventh dendrogram demonstrate the hierarchical classification of the psi model fig 4g the psi dendrogram classified the water sites into two main categories in cluster 1 sites 4 11 17 23 21 9 26 22 8 27 and 1 were found and their psi scores were in the range of 13 203 15 080 fig 4g table 3b on the other hand water sites 13 28 3 16 12 18 5 2 6 15 10 24 19 25 14 7 and 20 formed cluster 2 fig 4g with their psi ranging from 10 013 to 12 911 table 3b the psi classification table 4 implied that all the samples are very corrosive nevertheless this hierarchical classification has shown that cluster 1 pose higher risk of corrosion than cluster 2 ultimately the eight dendrogram fig 4h represents water quality classification based on integrated csp indices in other words the seven csp indices were the input parameters used in modeling fig 4h thus the hcs formed in this dendrogram are used to summarize the spatiotemporal classification of the csp indices and industrial water quality of the study area three main hcs were obtained from fig 4h cluster 1 included sites 9 22 26 4 23 11 8 17 1 27 and 21 while cluster 2 comprises of sampling sites 13 18 12 5 14 16 25 12 3 28 6 7 15 19 20 and 24 fig 4h however cluster 3 has only site 10 as member typically on average 1 cluster 1 seems to represent the water locations that are highly corrosive with slight scaling tendency 2 cluster 2 seems to represent sample locations that are corrosive and have more pronounced scaling tendency and 3 cluster 3 represents the sample site that seems to have high corrosion and scaling risks this sample site was captured by all the csp indices as having high corrosion and scaling tendencies again the sample 10 was also identified by the ri model to have the highest risk of salinization when compared to the other samples 3 4 multiple regression modeling the physicochemical parameters analyzed in this study are the important key factors that define the csps of water resources in view of this mr models were utilized in this work to describe the influence of the changing independent physicochemical variables on the dependent csp indices hence the mr models are considered highly significant in the present work the results of the mr models are summarized in table 7 a on a general note the mr models well predicted the csp indices in other words the models generally showed that the independent variables pb so4 cl th hco3 fe ph t zn ec ca and tds are good predictors of the dependent variables csmr ri lsi li ai rsi and psi however based on the r r2 adjusted r2 and f ratio values table 7a obtained from the predictive modeling it can be deduced that the mr models for li ai rsi and psi predictions outperformed those for csmr ri and lsi predictions this implies that the independent variables better predicted li ai rsi and psi moreover this shows that the mr models for li ai rsi and psi are a good fit for the water quality data thus it makes sense to say that the predicted li ai rsi and psi values are in closer conformity with the observed data values and can be effective representatives of the original the hierarchical of performance of the mr models seems to follow the order ai li rsi psi lsi ri csmr see table 7a 3 5 artificial neural network modeling while mr models are primarily used to predict linear relationships ann models can be used to predict both linear and nonlinear relationships between independent and dependent variables the ann modeling performed in this study employed scg and gd optimization algorithms with hyperbolic tangent activation function ann1 was developed using scg optimizer whereas ann2 was developed using gd optimizer the ann architectures for ann1 and ann2 are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively interestingly the two ann optimization algorithms were efficient in predicting the seven 7 csp indices based on the twelve 12 independent physicochemical variables however some differences were observed in their accuracies and performances parity plots showing the relationships between the measured calculated values of csp indices and the predicted values for ann1 and ann2 are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively the r2 and rmse values of the ann1 and ann2 are summarized in table 7b and c respectively it was realized that while the r2 for ann1 ranged from 0 610 to 0 966 the r2 for ann2 ranged between 0 530 and 0 956 table 7b and c on the other hand the rmse for ann1 was found in the range of 0 019 0 200 while that for ann2 maintained the range of 0 045 0 429 table 7b and c additionally the residual error plots for the ann1 and ann2 models are presented in figs 8 and 9 respectively comparison of the accuracy and performances of scg and gd optimization algorithms based on the parity plots r2 rmse and residual error plots indicate that the scg optimizer outperformed the gd optimizer in predicting the csp indices in the present study generally higher conformity between observed and predicted values higher regression scores and lower model errors were obtained in ann1 than in ann2 similar to the observations made from the mr models both ann1 and ann2 better predicted li ai rsi and psi more than csmr ri and lsi this is obvious in table 7b and c and figs 6a g 7a g 8a g and 9a g with respect to the r2 values the hierarchical order of prediction performance for the csp indices by ann1 is li rsi ai psi ri csmr lsi table 7b while the order for ann2 is li ai rsi psi lsi ri csmr table 7c the sensitivity of the independent variables in the ann1 and ann2 predictive modeling was also analyzed fig 10 a and b are bar charts showing the relative importance impact of the input variables on the ann1 and ann2 models respectively the various percentage contributions of the input variables in the ann modeling are given table 8 in this study only the input variables with 50 normalized importance are considered as the most sensitive variables alternatively stated variables with 50 normalized importance are the most suitable predictors of the csp indices for ann1 the identified sensitive predictors are ca ph cl so4 and ec fig 10 table 8 nevertheless for ann2 the following input variables were identified as the most sensitive predictors ph so4 cl th and ca fig 10b table 8 3 6 comparison of the performances of mr and ann models in this section the performances of mr and ann modeling techniques in the prediction of csp indices are compared both mr and ann models developed in this work have proven to be efficient in predicting the csp indices both modeling techniques also showed higher performances and accuracies in the prediction of ai li rsi and psi much more than for ri lsi and csmr however overall observations have shown that the ann models ann1 and ann2 outperformed the mr models on average the r2 values of mr ann1 and ann2 models are 0 788 0 848 and 0 814 respectively this implies that ann modeling is a more reliable and efficient approach than mr modeling in the prediction of the csps of the natural water resources 3 7 practical implications of the present predictive modeling an increase in industrialization and urbanization is a critical and important factor for the socio economic growth and development of the present study area however the unveiling of the high csps of the available water resources has shown that high level risks are posed to domestic and industrial water storage facilities water tanks distribution pipelines networks well equipment water treatment plants and clean industrial production scaling in water could facilitate the blockage of well screens reduction of aquifer permeability and increment in the costs of operation and maintenance of domestic industrial water facilities continuous monitoring and assessment of the water quality in respect of the csps would require a lot of funding thus the present work has been designed to produce efficient and reliable artificial intelligence models that could be useful in predicting and forecasting the csp indices even in situations where funding is lacking in order to satisfy this aim several machine learning approaches were integrated the performances and accuracies of the models produced were examined and interpreted the results of this predictive modeling research showed that the produced models are efficient and would be effective in predicting industrial water quality informatics of ojoto suburb additionally the crucial information provided in this paper would serve as baseline for other workers across the globe who might be interested in predicting and forecasting the csp indices of water resources in their region summarily the following implications of the present modeling study are worthy of mention utilizing multiple water quality indices i e the csp indices proved to provide clearer and accurate details about the nature of the water resources the information provided by the csp indexing would be very crucial to the industrialists water managers industrialists and policymakers in planning for materials required for well construction borehole casing and pipe networking integrating several exploratory multivariate techniques ca pca fa and r mode hcs enhanced the establishment of the intra and inter relationships between the physicochemical variables and the csp indices the information provided by these models were useful for the selection of variables for the prediction modeling the q mode spatiotemporal hcs were useful in demarcating and classifying the risks of corrosion and scaling across the study area by these models the changes in corrosion and scaling risks would easily be estimated moreover these models provided reliable classifications of corrosion and scaling risks and would also be helpful in efficient design of future water sampling in the area the q mode hcs identified the most vulnerable sites the risk levels and localities captured by these models would be helpful in the planning for water treatment protection and sustainability strategies the analyses of csp indices and the q mode hcs could provide useful insights for siting of industries in the area this is especially important for the establishment of industries wherein strict water quality standards are supposed to be met during production faced with the corrosion and scaling challenges a holistic technical approach is required to ensure water security and cleaner industrial production again knowledge of the csps would be key in planning for investment in future infrastructures ordinarily water samples are supposed to be regularly collected and analyzed in laboratory using conventional methods in order to calculate the values of the csp indices however the mr and ann models produced in this work are found to be efficient and handy tools for the prediction of the indices the machine learning models proved to be good fits for the water quality data without any significant information loss hence with these predictive modeling techniques time human labor and financial costs required for constant monitoring and assessment would be minimized the modeling techniques utilized in the current work have shown the importance significances and contributions of the analyzed water quality variables in modeling the csp indices this could provide more reliable and trusted insights to policymakers for improving the water environment conditions of the area this is a goal geared towards sustainability integration of several modeling techniques proved to be a more efficient approach for a comprehensive and robust water quality data classification predictive modeling and interpretation having seen the performances of the modeling algorithms used future researchers are at liberty to use or improve on these modeling techniques for the prediction of the csp indices in view of this more studies in regards to this subject are encouraged 4 conclusions this work aimed at developing optimized machine learning models that could predict the csps of natural water resources in ojoto suburb in southeast nigeria interestingly this research has achieved its objectives the major highlights of this paper are summarized below the relationships between the physicochemical properties and the csp indices of the waters were clearly deduced from the ca ca pca fa and r mode hcs q mode hcs were effective in analyzing the spatiotemporal classifications and distributions of water quality and corrosion and scaling risks in the study area the csp indices csmr ri lsi li ai rsi and psi were efficiently and reliably predicted using the twelve physicochemical parameters ph t ec tds th ca hco3 cl so4 fe zn and pb the mr models performances were analyzed using r r2 adjusted r2 and f ratio values whereas the performances of the ann models were verified using parity plots r2 rmse and residual error plots both the mr and ann models were found to suitably predict the csp indices however both models were more effective in the predictions of ai li rsi and psi more than in the predictions of lsi ri and csmr comparing the efficiencies and performances of scg and gd optimization algorithms for the ann modeling it was revealed in this study that scg optimizer was more efficient and outperformed the gd optimizer for ann1 the identified sensitive predictors are ca ph cl so4 and ec whereas those for ann2 are ph so4 cl th and ca listed in their decreasing order of impact furthermore the overall efficiencies and performances of the mr and ann models were tested on average the r2 values of the mr ann1 and ann2 models were found as 0 788 0 848 and 0 814 respectively implying that the both ann models outperformed the mr models in the prediction of the csps of the natural water resources the practical implications of the research findings which affirmed the novelty and significance of this paper

11811,the leachate derived from lead smelting slag site is a potential hazard to the soil and water nearby due to its excessively high arsenic content a porous carbonaceous solid waste pcsw resulting from the pyrolysis of oily sludge of tank bottom was proposed to remove arsenic as from leachate according to the results of as removal from simulated solution pcsw can remove as efficiently and synchronously increase solution ph at equilibrium the removal efficiency of as was 96 26 and the solution ph at equilibrium was 8 98 under the optimal conditions of pcsw dosage of 3 g l 1 and initial as concentration of 12 mg l 1 with the initial ph of 7 5 the adsorption rate of as was 0 319 g mg min 1 and the maximum adsorption capacity of as on pcsw was 45 314 mg g 1 the removal of as from the solution was attributed mainly to the formation of stable calcium arsenate precipitations and fe as complexes on pcsw surface pcsw can also simultaneously and effectively remove the heavy metals as pb zn cu cd in leachate from lead smelting slag sites and the residual concentration of all heavy metals were lower than the emission concentration gb25466 2010 china it is proved to be feasible for pcsw application in the treatment of leachate containing heavy metals graphical abstract image 1 keywords porous carbonaceous solid waste arsenic removal leachate lead smelting slag 1 introduction lead smelting slag is usually stored in the open air in gejiu city yunnan province china due to the lack of effective resource utilization measures the slag contains some minerals with heavy metals such as zinc lead copper cadmium etc with the change of natural conditions such as rainfall and season some unstable heavy metal minerals can easily leach out saikia et al 2018 resulting in the leachate with heavy metals to be continuously discharged from the stored site gejiu city is located in the karst area and the lead smelting slag site is in a calcareous environment so the concentrations of lead zinc copper and cadmium in the leachate are low but arsenic is high if the leachate is discharged directly without treatment it is bound to cause serious arsenic pollution it is well documented that long term exposure to arsenic contaminated water and soil will cause humans and animals to suffer from skin damage hyperkeratosis intestinal damage serum disorders heart disease and cancer kellett et al 2022 tony et al 2022 yr et al 2021 the arsenic containing leachate must be treated to meet the emission standard of pollutants for lead and zinc industry general administration of quality supervision 2010 before it can be discharged currently there are several techniques for arsenic removal from the wastewater such as photocatalysis electrolysis ion exchange coagulation flocculation membrane filtration adsorption and bioremediation carneiro et al 2022 dsba et al 2021 irshad et al 2021 rathi et al 2021 thakur et al 2021 xu et al 2020 each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages given convenience economy and overall effectiveness adsorption is probably the best approach to remove arsenic with low concentration in an industrial scale vieira et al 2020 carbonaceous materials as adsorbents have driven the progress of arsenic adsorption research tissues of plants such as rice husk zama et al 2022 water hyacinth rigueto et al 2020 dade seeds islam et al 2021 coconut shells gong et al 2020 seaweeds gupta and ghosh 2009 bamboo alchouron et al 2020 etc have been modified by pyrolysis as the carbonaceous adsorbents for arsenic removal however the above adsorbents have exhibited poor capacity and instability for arsenic due to their own lack of sufficient active sites and substances capable of reacting with arsenic deng et al 2020 zheng et al 2015 the arsenic adsorption capacity can be improved by chemical impregnation with fe no 3 l lin et al 2017 cacl2 gong et al 2020 and other agents containing iron and calcium however this undoubtedly increases the cost and complexity of material preparation therefore the development of economical and high effective carbonaceous adsorbents for as removal needs more attention oily sludge is generated during the extraction transportation spill and refining of crude oil in the petroleum industry and composed mainly of water inorganic and organic sludge lin et al 2017 since 2017 more than 600 million tons of oily sludge are annually produced globally and more than 5 million tons are discharged in china alone xu et al 2020 at present it is mainly utilized to recover oils pyrolysis is recognized as the most promising technique for oil recovery yang et al 2019 however the residues derived from pyrolysis are still mainly disposed in landfills apart from a small amount used as construction material zheng et al 2022 different from the carbonaceous materials above mentioned the pyrolysis residue contains not only carbon but also a large amount of silicaluminate sulfide containing calcium and iron etc it is a kind of porous carbonaceous solid waste pcsw yang et al 2019a 2019b our previous studies have shown that this solid waste can effectively remove p v yang et al 2021 and tl i zhang et al 2021 from aqueous solutions by its calcium and iron respectively considering that p v and as v have similar structural and chemical properties tiberg et al 2020 this solid waste may have the potential to remove as from the solution but no research has been carried out the aim of this work is to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of using pcsw to remove arsenic from solutions thus providing a theoretical basis and technical support for the industrial application of pcsw in the removal of heavy metals as pb zn cu cd from the leachate of lead smelting slag storage sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 pcsw used in the work pcsw was generated by pyrolysis using tank bottom oily sludge from sinopec yanshan petrochemical company the preparation method and related property characteristics were the same as our previous study yang et al 2019 yang et al 2021 it was a composite with inorganic matter of more than 70 and carbon of 22 70 carbon constructed its porous skeleton structure the crystalline minerals such as caal2si2o8 cas fes fe1 xs and fe7s8 were embedded in the skeleton some amorphous minerals such as calcium silicate calcium silicaluminate also were found in the structure together with amorphous carbon the distribution of the pore size was mainly in the range of 35 500 nm the prepared pcsw was ground to less than 1 mm for the use 2 2 leachate and simulated solution prepared the leachate was taken from the stored site of lead smelting slag in gejiu city 23 30 n 103 13 e yunnan province china the ph of leachate was 7 5 the concentrations of main heavy metals detected in the leachate and the emission standard of pollutants for lead and zinc industry gb25466 2010 china were shown in table 1 the concentration of as was obviously higher than pb zn cu and cd therefore only the simulated solution with as was prepared with same ph as received leachate so as to preferentially explore as removal in the leachate then on this basis the synchronous removal of heavy metals in the leachate was carried out the as concentration in simulated solution was 12 mg l 1 and its ph was 7 5 it was prepared according to the as concentration and ph in leachate by dissolving the required amount of na3aso4 12h2o in distilled water solution ph was adjusted with 0 1 mol l 1 h2so4 solution the chemicals used were of analytical grade and purchased from chemical procurement and management platform of university of science and technology beijing in china 2 3 batch experiments batch experiments included the removal of as from simulated solution and the decrease of the heavy metals from the leachate were conducted respectively a known amount of pcsw was added into 100 ml simulated solution in a 150 ml flask the flasks were oscillated at 25 3 and 150 rpm for a designed period after that the supernatant was separated by centrifuging at 5000 rpm from the mixture then filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane for as analysis the residual concentration of as and ph in the supernatant were determined respectively the removal efficiency η and adsorption capacity at time t q t mg g were calculated by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 η 100 c 0 c t c 0 2 q t v c 0 c t m where c 0 and c t mg l 1 are the concentration of as at initial and time t respectively v l is the solution volume and m g is the weight of pcsw the experiments on the removal of heavy metals in the leachate was done by the same method for the simulated solution 2 4 analytical methods arsenic concentration in the solution was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes perkinelmer optima 8300 and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms shimadzu 2030 the main phase compositions of pcsw were identified by x ray powder diffraction method xrd rigaku ttr3 equipped with cu kα radiation 40 kv 100 ma at the scanning rate of 3 min from 10 to 90 and the tested data were analyzed by mdi jade 6 0 software the morphology was observed by scanning electron microscope sem supra 55 zeiss equipped with an energy dispersion system eds bruker sdd x flash 5030 when pcsw surface was sprayed by gold the surface groups of pcsw were detected by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo fisher scientific usa in the 400 4000 cm 1 range the surface properties of pcsw were evaluated by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis ultradld kratos with an al anode al ka ¼ 1486 7 ev as the x ray source and the spectra were calibrated with the c 1s band at 284 8 ev 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pcsw dosage on as removal effect of pcsw dosage on as removal and solution ph at equilibrium are presented in fig 1 with the increases of pcsw dosage the removal efficiency of as and solution ph at equilibrium synchronously increased at first and then leveled off showing that the removal of as was related to solution ph when pcsw dosage was 3 g l 1 the removal efficiency of as reached the maximum of 96 26 and the corresponding solution ph at equilibrium was 8 98 the raise of solution ph was probably due to the ionization of crystalline minerals such as cas and amorphous minerals such as calcium silicate calcium silicaluminate in pcsw the ionization of the minerals on pcsw surface led to the generation of oh the increase of solution ph and also provided ca2 for as removal in the solution at the same time thus calcium arsenate was formed by the reaction of ca2 with as and the as in solution was removed this is the reason why the as removal efficiency and solution ph at equilibrium changed synchronously with the change of dosage according to the literature ribeiro et al 2021 the species of as exists mainly in the form of haso4 2 at ph 6 94 11 50 therefore it can be inferred that the existing specie of as was haso4 2 because the solution ph at equilibrium was 8 98 at the maximum removal of as the possible reactions in this work to remove as could be expressed as follows 3 3 ca 2 2 haso 4 2 2 oh ca 3 aso 4 2 2 h 2 o 3 2 effect of adsorption time on as removal and adsorption kinetics effect of adsorption time on as removal was carried out at pcsw dosage of 3 g l 1 and as concentration of 12 mg l 1 with ph 7 5 and the experimental data was fitted by the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models respectively as displayed in fig 2 from fig 2 within 10 min the removal efficiency of as reached 86 94 and leveled off after 30 min showing that pcsw had a high adsorption speed for as the maximum removal efficiency was 96 36 at 60 min apparently the kinetics results were fitted well by the pseudo second order kinetic equation giving linear plots with high correlation coefficients r2 indicating that as adsorption on pcsw surface is the chemisorption and the rate depends on the number of adsorption sites in its surface the equation and parameters are summarized in table 2 3 3 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherm experiments of as removal were done with pcsw dosage of 3 g l 1 and initial as concentration from 10 to 400 mg l 1 at ph 7 5 the experimental data were analyzed by the langmuir freundlich and temkin equation respectively in fig 3 from fig 3 the raw data were fitted well by the langmuir equation giving linear plots with high correlation coefficients r2 obviously the correlation coefficients given by the freundlich and temkin model were lower than that given by the langmuir equation the model and parameters for removal as are displayed in table 3 as shown in table 3 the q max of as 45 314 mg g 1 and langmuir constant kl is 0 077 l mg 1 showing that the adsorption of as on pcsw was easy by chemical adsorption with the monolayer the comparison of adsorption conditions and corresponding isotherm parameters in the work with previously reported adsorbents in aqueous solution are represented in table 4 3 4 removal mechanisms of as the sem images and the corresponding eds of pcsw before and after as adsorption from simulated solution with initial as concentration of 100 mg l and pcsw used of 1 g l 1 were observed by sem eds in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that the porous structure of pcsw showed little change before and after as adsorption but the surface colloidal matter amorphous minerals after adsorption was lower that than before as adsorption this could be mainly due to dissolution of amorphous minerals and as adsorption on the surface of pcsw the as was dected after adsorption indicating that as adsorbed on the active sites of pcsw surface thus resulting in the as removal from the solution in order to understand the compositions of the as containing phase in pcsw the phase compositions were illustrated by xrd in fig 5 obviously after adsorption new peaks of ca3 aso4 2 2h2o 17 0739 ca5 aso4 3 oh 33 0265 and fe oh 3 38 0032 were detected in pcsw while the peaks intensities of cas 08 0464 and caal2si2o8 20 0452 were significantly dereased the peaks of fes fe7s8 and fe1 xs changed a little it can inferred that the ca2 ionized from cas and caal2si2o8 on pcsw surface reacted with the as in the solution and formed the stable ca3 aso4 2 2h2o 17 0738 and ca5 aso4 3 oh 33 0265 on pcsw while fe2 from fes fe7s8 and fe1 xs on pcsw were partially oxidized and formed fe oh 3 to further demonstrate the mechanism of as removal the surface groups of pcsw before and after as adsorption were revealed by ftir in fig 6 form fig 6 most of peak intensities after adsorption were evidently lower than that before adsorption and some peaks shifted and changed obviously the broad peaks at 3424 cm 1 and 1620 cm 1 are stretching vibrations in the o h band from the internal crystalline water of pcsw the latter variation probably originated from the involvement of amorphous arsenates and hydroxides yang et al 2019 the band at 1484 cm 1 may be associated with vibrations of c oh group rigueto et al 2020 after adsorption of as the vibration peak shifted from 1480 cm 1 to 1466 cm 1 and the peak intensity greatly deduced indicating that haso4 2 could exchange with oh in the c oh the peak bands located at 1147 cm 1 880 cm 1 and 601 cm 1 before adsorption are the stretching vibrations of si o si ca o and fe o li et al 2020 shao et al 2018 yang et al 2019a respectively correspondingly these peak bands changed significantly after adsorption it could be related to the involvement of haso4 2 among them 598 cm 1 is considered as the stretching vibration of fe o bands in the form of fe oh 2 fe oh 3 lan et al 2016 notably the new peak at 834 cm 1 is suggested to be associated with the ca o as band myneni et al 1998 the vibrational bands that appear at 878 cm 1 and 806 cm 1 are most likely due to the formation of bidentate surface complex both unprotonated feo2as o 2 2 and protonated feo2as o oh jia et al 2007 based on the above changes the formation of surface complex of metal o as by ligand exchange hydroxyl groups with as species may be a factor in the adsorption of as rodríguez romero et al 2020 therefore it is proved that ca2 and fe2 on pcsw surface played a key role in the removal of as in solution the surface elements and its valence changes of pcsw before and after as adsorption were also analyzed by xps as shown in fig 7 from fig 7 a evidently new peaks such as as 2p as 3s as 3p and as3 d appeared on pcsw further confirmed that the as was removed by pcsw the peaks at 45 6 ev and 46 2 ev of as 3d spectrum as shown in fig 7 b are in the same valence state of as before and after adsorption as seen in fig 7 c the ca 2p peaks underwent a charge shift of 0 2 ev accompanying with a significant weakening of the peak intensities after adsorption one of the peaks ca x at 351 6 ev is considered to be likely a new peak formed by as trapping the free ca2 from the solution zama et al 2022 the sub peaks of o 1s in fig 7 d may be attributed to metal o fe o and ca o oh and c o groups after adsorption the areas of metal o and oh groups decreased from 12 78 53 19 to 8 25 48 54 respectively meanwhile the new peak at 513 3 ev after adsorption is considered to be the as o bond l lin et al 2017 this may be due to the breakage of ca o and fe o on the pcsw surface after chemical reaction with as to form new connections in addition to the reduction of oh due to the formation of surface complexes from fig 7 e it can be seen that the fe iii peak at 712 6 ev before adsorption shifted to 712 8 ev after adsorption and its content increased from 18 01 to 26 19 correspondingly the content of fe ii decreased from 56 75 to 45 42 showing that fe ii partially transformed to fe iii this provides the premise for fe as complexes on pcsw surface in summary when pcsw was added into the as containing solution fe2 and ca2 were partially generated in pcsw structure due to the ionization of the sulfides and the solution ph increased the fe2 was oxidized to transform fe3 and further formed fe oh 3 on the pcsw surface with oh in the solution when the solution ph is higher than the ph of the point zero charge of fe oh 3 the surface of fe oh 3 will gradually be surrounded by negative charges and transform into fe oh2 2 which can form fe as complexes with haso4 2 bordoloi et al 2013 on pcsw in addition the ionized ca2 in pcsw can further react with as in the solution the possible reactions are shown as follows 4 fe1 xs h2o o2 fe oh 3 5 fe oh2 2 haso4 2 feo2as o oh feo2as o 2 2 6 3ca2 2haso4 2 2oh ca3 aso4 2 2h2o 7 5ca2 3haso4 2 4oh ca5 aso4 3oh 3h2o 3 5 treatment of the leachate from lead smelting slag site in order to confirm the practical application feasibility of pcsw based on above removal study of as in the solution that mimicked the leachate from lead smelting slag yard the treatment of the leachate table 1 was performed at the pcsw dosage of 3 g l 1 the changes of hazardous heavy metal concentrations in the leachate before and after treatment by pcsw are presented in fig 8 from fig 8 the addition of pcsw into the leachate can greatly decrease the concentration of heavy metals showing the heavy metals in the leachate all can be effectively removed from the leachate and adsorbed on pcsw surface after treatment the concentrations of as zn pb cu and cd in the leachate reduced from 11 80 3 75 0 04 0 56 and 0 021 mg l to 0 30 0 08 0 01 0 06 and 0 004 mg l 1 respectively and the leachate ph at equilibrium increased from 7 50 to 8 90 the concentrations of heavy metals in the leachate were much lower than the emission standard of pollutants for lead and zinc industry gb25466 2010 china which mean that the treated leachate can be discharged directly therefore it is feasible and effective to utilize pcsw as an adsorption material for removal heavy metals in the leachate in addition the abandoned pcsw after application can be returned to the stored site of lead smelting slag for landfill 4 conclusion the pcsw prepared by pyrolysis of tank bottom oily sludge is a porous carbonaceous solid waste with the crystalline minerals such as caal2si2o8 cas fes fe1 xs and fe7s8 and some amorphous minerals such as calcium silicate calcium silicaluminate it can effectively remove as in the solution and synchronously improve the solution ph at equilibrium the maximum removal efficiency of as was 96 26 and the solution ph at equilibrium was 8 98 under the conditions of the initial as concentration of 12 mg l 1 with the initial ph of 7 5 and pcsw dosage of 3 g l 1 the maximum adsorption capacity of as on pcsw surface was 45 314 mg g 1 the as in the solution was mainly removed by the formation of stable calcium arsenate precipitations and fe as complexes on pcsw surface pcsw is feasible to remove the heavy metals in leachate from lead smelting slag site it can simultaneously decrease the concentrations of heavy metals in the leachate at the pcsw dosage of 3 g l 1 the concentrations of as pb zn cu cd in leachate were reduced to 0 30 0 08 0 01 0 06 and 0 004 mg l 1 which are lower than their emission concentrations gb25466 2010 china based on the application of pcsw in leachate treatment it can be inferred that pcsw also can be used to treat the similar wastewater containing heavy metals declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

from fig 2 within 10 min the removal efficiency of as reached 86 94 and leveled off after 30 min showing that pcsw had a high adsorption speed for as the maximum removal efficiency was 96 36 at 60 min apparently the kinetics results were fitted well by the pseudo second order kinetic equation giving linear plots with high correlation coefficients r2 indicating that as adsorption on pcsw surface is the chemisorption and the rate depends on the number of adsorption sites in its surface the equation and parameters are summarized in table 2 3 3 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherm experiments of as removal were done with pcsw dosage of 3 g l 1 and initial as concentration from 10 to 400 mg l 1 at ph 7 5 the experimental data were analyzed by the langmuir freundlich and temkin equation respectively in fig 3 from fig 3 the raw data were fitted well by the langmuir equation giving linear plots with high correlation coefficients r2 obviously the correlation coefficients given by the freundlich and temkin model were lower than that given by the langmuir equation the model and parameters for removal as are displayed in table 3 as shown in table 3 the q max of as 45 314 mg g 1 and langmuir constant kl is 0 077 l mg 1 showing that the adsorption of as on pcsw was easy by chemical adsorption with the monolayer the comparison of adsorption conditions and corresponding isotherm parameters in the work with previously reported adsorbents in aqueous solution are represented in table 4 3 4 removal mechanisms of as the sem images and the corresponding eds of pcsw before and after as adsorption from simulated solution with initial as concentration of 100 mg l and pcsw used of 1 g l 1 were observed by sem eds in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that the porous structure of pcsw showed little change before and after as adsorption but the surface colloidal matter amorphous minerals after adsorption was lower that than before as adsorption this could be mainly due to dissolution of amorphous minerals and as adsorption on the surface of pcsw the as was dected after adsorption indicating that as adsorbed on the active sites of pcsw surface thus resulting in the as removal from the solution in order to understand the compositions of the as containing phase in pcsw the phase compositions were illustrated by xrd in fig 5 obviously after adsorption new peaks of ca3 aso4 2 2h2o 17 0739 ca5 aso4 3 oh 33 0265 and fe oh 3 38 0032 were detected in pcsw while the peaks intensities of cas 08 0464 and caal2si2o8 20 0452 were significantly dereased the peaks of fes fe7s8 and fe1 xs changed a little it can inferred that the ca2 ionized from cas and caal2si2o8 on pcsw surface reacted with the as in the solution and formed the stable ca3 aso4 2 2h2o 17 0738 and ca5 aso4 3 oh 33 0265 on pcsw while fe2 from fes fe7s8 and fe1 xs on pcsw were partially oxidized and formed fe oh 3 to further demonstrate the mechanism of as removal the surface groups of pcsw before and after as adsorption were revealed by ftir in fig 6 form fig 6 most of peak intensities after adsorption were evidently lower than that before adsorption and some peaks shifted and changed obviously the broad peaks at 3424 cm 1 and 1620 cm 1 are stretching vibrations in the o h band from the internal crystalline water of pcsw the latter variation probably originated from the involvement of amorphous arsenates and hydroxides yang et al 2019 the band at 1484 cm 1 may be associated with vibrations of c oh group rigueto et al 2020 after adsorption of as the vibration peak shifted from 1480 cm 1 to 1466 cm 1 and the peak intensity greatly deduced indicating that haso4 2 could exchange with oh in the c oh the peak bands located at 1147 cm 1 880 cm 1 and 601 cm 1 before adsorption are the stretching vibrations of si o si ca o and fe o li et al 2020 shao et al 2018 yang et al 2019a respectively correspondingly these peak bands changed significantly after adsorption it could be related to the involvement of haso4 2 among them 598 cm 1 is considered as the stretching vibration of fe o bands in the form of fe oh 2 fe oh 3 lan et al 2016 notably the new peak at 834 cm 1 is suggested to be associated with the ca o as band myneni et al 1998 the vibrational bands that appear at 878 cm 1 and 806 cm 1 are most likely due to the formation of bidentate surface complex both unprotonated feo2as o 2 2 and protonated feo2as o oh jia et al 2007 based on the above changes the formation of surface complex of metal o as by ligand exchange hydroxyl groups with as species may be a factor in the adsorption of as rodríguez romero et al 2020 therefore it is proved that ca2 and fe2 on pcsw surface played a key role in the removal of as in solution the surface elements and its valence changes of pcsw before and after as adsorption were also analyzed by xps as shown in fig 7 from fig 7 a evidently new peaks such as as 2p as 3s as 3p and as3 d appeared on pcsw further confirmed that the as was removed by pcsw the peaks at 45 6 ev and 46 2 ev of as 3d spectrum as shown in fig 7 b are in the same valence state of as before and after adsorption as seen in fig 7 c the ca 2p peaks underwent a charge shift of 0 2 ev accompanying with a significant weakening of the peak intensities after adsorption one of the peaks ca x at 351 6 ev is considered to be likely a new peak formed by as trapping the free ca2 from the solution zama et al 2022 the sub peaks of o 1s in fig 7 d may be attributed to metal o fe o and ca o oh and c o groups after adsorption the areas of metal o and oh groups decreased from 12 78 53 19 to 8 25 48 54 respectively meanwhile the new peak at 513 3 ev after adsorption is considered to be the as o bond l lin et al 2017 this may be due to the breakage of ca o and fe o on the pcsw surface after chemical reaction with as to form new connections in addition to the reduction of oh due to the formation of surface complexes from fig 7 e it can be seen that the fe iii peak at 712 6 ev before adsorption shifted to 712 8 ev after adsorption and its content increased from 18 01 to 26 19 correspondingly the content of fe ii decreased from 56 75 to 45 42 showing that fe ii partially transformed to fe iii this provides the premise for fe as complexes on pcsw surface in summary when pcsw was added into the as containing solution fe2 and ca2 were partially generated in pcsw structure due to the ionization of the sulfides and the solution ph increased the fe2 was oxidized to transform fe3 and further formed fe oh 3 on the pcsw surface with oh in the solution when the solution ph is higher than the ph of the point zero charge of fe oh 3 the surface of fe oh 3 will gradually be surrounded by negative charges and transform into fe oh2 2 which can form fe as complexes with haso4 2 bordoloi et al 2013 on pcsw in addition the ionized ca2 in pcsw can further react with as in the solution the possible reactions are shown as follows 4 fe1 xs h2o o2 fe oh 3 5 fe oh2 2 haso4 2 feo2as o oh feo2as o 2 2 6 3ca2 2haso4 2 2oh ca3 aso4 2 2h2o 7 5ca2 3haso4 2 4oh ca5 aso4 3oh 3h2o 3 5 treatment of the leachate from lead smelting slag site in order to confirm the practical application feasibility of pcsw based on above removal study of as in the solution that mimicked the leachate from lead smelting slag yard the treatment of the leachate table 1 was performed at the pcsw dosage of 3 g l 1 the changes of hazardous heavy metal concentrations in the leachate before and after treatment by pcsw are presented in fig 8 from fig 8 the addition of pcsw into the leachate can greatly decrease the concentration of heavy metals showing the heavy metals in the leachate all can be effectively removed from the leachate and adsorbed on pcsw surface after treatment the concentrations of as zn pb cu and cd in the leachate reduced from 11 80 3 75 0 04 0 56 and 0 021 mg l to 0 30 0 08 0 01 0 06 and 0 004 mg l 1 respectively and the leachate ph at equilibrium increased from 7 50 to 8 90 the concentrations of heavy metals in the leachate were much lower than the emission standard of pollutants for lead and zinc industry gb25466 2010 china which mean that the treated leachate can be discharged directly therefore it is feasible and effective to utilize pcsw as an adsorption material for removal heavy metals in the leachate in addition the abandoned pcsw after application can be returned to the stored site of lead smelting slag for landfill 4 conclusion the pcsw prepared by pyrolysis of tank bottom oily sludge is a porous carbonaceous solid waste with the crystalline minerals such as caal2si2o8 cas fes fe1 xs and fe7s8 and some amorphous minerals such as calcium silicate calcium silicaluminate it can effectively remove as in the solution and synchronously improve the solution ph at equilibrium the maximum removal efficiency of as was 96 26 and the solution ph at equilibrium was 8 98 under the conditions of the initial as concentration of 12 mg l 1 with the initial ph of 7 5 and pcsw dosage of 3 g l 1 the maximum adsorption capacity of as on pcsw surface was 45 314 mg g 1 the as in the solution was mainly removed by the formation of stable calcium arsenate precipitations and fe as complexes on pcsw surface pcsw is feasible to remove the heavy metals in leachate from lead smelting slag site it can simultaneously decrease the concentrations of heavy metals in the leachate at the pcsw dosage of 3 g l 1 the concentrations of as pb zn cu cd in leachate were reduced to 0 30 0 08 0 01 0 06 and 0 004 mg l 1 which are lower than their emission concentrations gb25466 2010 china based on the application of pcsw in leachate treatment it can be inferred that pcsw also can be used to treat the similar wastewater

11812,in this research the efficiency of reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf treatment methods installed in the dry zone sri lanka were examined as a function of operation parameters feed and product water quality membrane type user maintenance and wastes handling the quality of the feedwater varies as electrical conductivity 265 1329 mg l total hardness 97 318 mg l as caco3 and fluoride 0 58 2 93 mg l often exceeding who or sls tolerance limits about 77 of the feedwater contains dissolved organic carbon doc above 4 00 mg l that requires control to avoid membrane fouling and other harmful effects the salt rejection ratio pressure flux and transmembrane pressure of the ro nf membranes vary widely with the feedwater quality the operation parameters of the membrane plants vary significantly eight ro plants use low pressure 0 5 1 0 mpa similar to the nf pressure requirement but they desalinate water at 95 salt rejection efficiency most ro membranes deviate 50 from the recommended transmembrane pressure and specific permeate flux values however such deviations are not observed in nf treatment plants ro membranes remove solutes excessively but post mineralization step is currently not practiced in the study area the water recovery by the nf membranes is highest 60 compared to ro plants the wastewater resulting from the nf plants is handled satisfactorily compared to ro generated wastes in the area examined the salinity occurs due to water s permanent hardness therefore nf membrane based technology is suitable to desalinate groundwater in the dry zone sri lanka graphical abstract image 1 keywords reverse osmosis nanofiltration membrane fouling groundwater north central province 1 introduction the worlds only available water resource in arid and semi arid regions is groundwater which fulfils almost half of the drinking water requirements however over 60 of the aquifers in these regions exhibit high salinity due to lithogenic sources world water quality alliance 2021 in the arid or dry areas in sri lanka the lack of safe drinking water due to high salinity is further aggravated by excess dissolved organic matter indika et al 2021 xu et al 2021 both excess or low water salinity induces palatability issues rendering low water consumption particularly among farmers frequently exposed to heated environments resulting in health problems such as dehydration and chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology ckdu chandrajith et al 2011 imbulana and oguma 2021 to resolve water salinity issues in sri lanka the state and private organizations have introduced several interim measures such as the provision of truck driven water and distribution of bottled water and softeners with limited success in 2013 the sri lankan water authorities introduced reverse osmosis desalination plants to the regions where water related health problems are prevalent with a lack of pipe borne water indika et al 2021 zhong et al 2019 in 2018 nanofiltration nf was introduced to sri lanka yet they are not common compared to the ro systems zhong et al 2019 over 2000 ro treatment units are in operation in the dry zone sri lanka indika et al 2021 but only 8 nf plants have been established in sri lanka to date both ro and nf technologies operate on pressure driven water desalination the operating pressure of the nf membranes is lower than ro however the ro plants can operate under different pressures high pressure 2 mpa low pressure 0 7 2 mpa and ultra low pressure 0 5 mpa shon et al 2013 however the low pressure reverse osmosis lpro membranes perform at 98 5 solutes rejection wang et al 2015 and they are comparable to nf 0 7 3 mpa bellona et al 2008 tagliabue et al 2016 the ro membranes efficiently remove monovalent ions whereas nf membranes are selective for removing di or higher valence ions therefore ro membranes are well suited to desalinate seawater and a nanofiltration is a viable option for hardness removal the appropriate membrane topology should be judiciously introduced after characterizing the feedwater since desalination efficiency largely depends on its quality and also membrane type pressure flux temperature tian et al 2021 however most of the treatment plants were installed without paying much attention to feed groundwater quality and quantity for example only four studies are available in the region to probe the treatment efficiency of pressure driven membranes and treatment quality maintenance practices imbulana et al 2020 indika et al 2021 jayasumana et al 2016 zhong et al 2019 most of the membrane treatment plants show similar technical problems namely declined water recovery 19 64 membrane fouling and scaling concentrate disposal issues lack of technical knowledge together with the absence of a proper plant efficiency monitoring program imbulana et al 2020 indika et al 2021 apart from these constraints high operational and maintenance cost is another considerable disadvantage associated with ro technology several studies have suggested the advantages of nf membranes compared to ro in treating groundwater with high hardness and doc in terms of energy efficiency cost conservation and waste generation bellona et al 2008 tagliabue et al 2016 but the rejection of other water contaminants such as monovalent ions is comparably low in nf than in ro taky et al 2021 sometimes this property of the nf membrane helps retain solutes in the treated water that favours good health in essence both ro and nf treatment methods in sri lanka are inappropriately used mostly the membrane treatment units are considered black boxes the selection of ro nf membranes was carried out arbitrarily which resulted in over or under exploitation of the technology therefore the study area provides to assess the robustness of the membrane technology for critical operation parameters transmembrane pressure specific permeate flux water recovery and cleaning frequency and feedwater quality in a high doc zone here we evaluated the performance of ro and nf community scale plants installed in the dry zone sri lanka using 10 ro and 3 nf plants we discussed the major drawbacks of both techniques to suggest possible solutions to overcome the existing barriers the results will complement to enhance the efficiency of groundwater desalination programs those are now in operation in tropical regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and selection of membrane systems groundwater sources located in the north central province ncp of sri lanka were chosen for this work it is the largest district with a 10 472 km2 area where 31 4 of the land area is used for agriculture department of census and statistics 2013 2014 ncp belongs to the country s dry zone with a mean annual temperature ranging from 26 5 to 28 5 c and a mean annual rainfall of 900 mm varied with monsoons october to february is considered the wet season while march to september is regarded as the dry season department of meteorology 2019 the province s total population is around 1 3 million in 22 secretariat divisions covering 6 2 of the country s total population department of census and statistics 2012 where 1 4 of the people reported for ckdu prevalence ranasinghe et al 2019 hardness fluoride salinity and doc are major problems restricting water consumption over 2000 reverse osmosis plants have been installed by state and private sector organizations around 450 ro plants are operated under the surveillance of the community based organizations under the national water supply and drainage board nwsdb government of sri lanka the data available from the cbos were chosen for this study nwsdb 2019 of the total of 450 only 59 ro plants were selected based on a random sampling method by covering all divisional secretariats ds of anuradhapura 22 and polonnaruwa 07 based on population density and ckdu epidemiological data the study locations were evenly distributed among ds divisions forty and nineteen ro plants from anuradhapura and polonnaruwa were selected for the survey they were stratified based on the ro membrane type used in the plants altogether ten strata were identified 1 8 plants per strata a single ro plant was randomly selected from each stratum 10 ro plants in total ten ro plants and the existing 3 nf plants in ncp were considered to compare the efficiency and suitability of ro and nf systems the feed permeate and concentrate water samples were collected into 50 ml polypropylene bottles during the dry season march 2020 the locations of ro and nf plants are shown in fig 1 and further details e g gps coordinates are included in the supplementary material only for the selected ro 10 and nf 3 plants table s1 2 2 operator survey the differences between the operation and maintenance of the ro and nf are required to identify the selection of simpler and more affordable technology for the villagers a questionnaire was distributed among the plant operators to receive data regarding the operational conditions maintenance activities cleaning routines water quality monitoring concentrate disposal and difficulties experienced during the daily and continuous operation in addition the operating pressures flow rates plant configurations pretreatments post treatments membrane names and brine disposal methods were obtained with the help of plant operator s and in situ measurements the technical specifications of the used ro and nf membranes were obtained from the websites of the relevant manufacturers 2 3 water quality analysis the ph and electrical conductivity ec of the water were measured from the unfiltered samples in the laboratory within a day after collection using ph and ec probes thermo scientific orion star a 325 multiparameter meter respectively for dissolved organic carbon measurements the water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm polyethersulfone syringe membrane filters the filtered water ph was adjusted ph 2 with 0 2 m hcl while purging high purity nitrogen gas 99 996 for 2 min to minimize co2 contamination in doc analysis doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l csh csn shimadzu japan and uv254 absorbance was measured using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 2700 shimadzu japan a separate portion of the sample was filtered with 0 22 μm for na k ca2 mg2 co2 fe2 bi2 ni2 cu2 as3 se2 cd2 v3 cr3 mn2 ba2 zn2 mo2 al3 and sr2 analyses by icp ms thermo icapq analyzer thermo fisher scientific inc germany after acidifying with 0 2 m hno3 anions f cl no3 and so4 2 were measured using suppressor ion chromatography metrohm 930 compact ic flex metrohm ag switzerland from an unacidified portion of the samples finally the hardness values were calculated using ca2 and mg2 data all water samples were preserved by storing below 4 c until chemical analysis was commenced other standard preservation protocols like filtration and acidification of samples immediately were not followed due to the technical challenges faced during sampling in rural areas the water quality parameters were derived as an average of 3 repetitive measurements 2 4 membrane performance evaluation membrane performances were evaluated based on transmembrane operational pressure tmp water recovery percentage and salt rejection ratio additionally the membrane specific permeate flux was also calculated using the field and the manufacturer s specification data flow rate observed during membrane testing using the equation 4 given below table 1 the respective equations used for calculations of the above parameters were tabulated in table 1 the tmp and effective membrane area were extracted from membranes specification data from the relevant manufacturers specification sheet 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane type versus field performances in sri lanka and most other countries like australia and africa the selection of ro and nf membranes in the fabrication of treatment plants is arbitrary burbano et al 2007 there are no exact specifications or guidelines to select the best membrane combinations to suit a given feedwater quality most of the membrane treatment plants in the ncp sri lanka especially the ro plants were installed without a reconnaissance survey into operation parameters and feedwater quality an optimized water treatment unit also requires a critical assessment of the feedwater quality and its seasonal variations and the safe limits of groundwater extraction which is still lacking in the country both ro and nf plants selected for the study were based on the model type of the membranes the data were examined in terms of their operational pressure specific permeate flux membrane age and the salinity removal efficiency to evaluate membrane performance and suitability for groundwater treatment according to the manufacturers specifications the membranes used in the field ro units are specified for various applications such as low salinity water brackish water harsh water and residential drinking fountains and water dispensers table 2 the total dissolved solids tds and doc contents of the feedwater vary significantly from 100 to 600 mg l and 3 9 12 7 mg l respectively the ro membranes are inappropriately used for example ultra low pressure low salinity membrane is suited for the purification of groundwater with high tds 600 mg l and a high pressure brackish water membrane is suited for feedwater with low or average tds 160 350 mg l however for every plant that produces water the tds is less than 50 mg l shows that all membrane types are capable of desalination from the information acquired from the plant operators it was identified that the seasonal variation or the available source water quantity during the dry season is not considered when installing the treatment units and it can be supported by the operator statement the feedwater intake well alteration took place in the plant when the water level reduces in the feedwater well the common practice is to shift to a different water source which further signifies that the selection of membrane type or the feedwater source is not based on any scientific factor for a successful treatment unit operation pilot testing for a minimum of 6 months would be beneficial to understand how the plant is operating under different water quality conditions by incorporating the plant operators and the key personnel who will be involved in the unit s operation burbano et al 2007 the doc and salinity removal depend on the pore size kingsbury et al 2020 teychene et al 2020 and the chemical and physical properties of the membrane such as hydrophilicity pore structure and surface area yang et al 2019 all ro and nf membranes are composed of active polyamide layer hence chemical properties are more or less similar however the doc rejection by the membranes varies with physical membrane properties such as pore size and distribution and structure the lack of details on membrane characteristics was a major limitation for a thorough understanding of the behaviour of the individual membrane in water desalination also since the study was conducted on currently operating treatment units exploring the direct membrane filtration removal efficiencies without pretreatment was challenging as there was no way to bypass the pretreatment unit also no outlets were available after the pretreatment units hence the sole effect of the pretreatment process was not investigated however the majority of the ncp sri lanka field ro and nf plants have similar pretreatment units installed sand filter activated carbon filter microfilter and anti scalant application hence when considering the removal efficiencies the variations were assumed to be due to the membrane effect 3 1 1 ro lpro or nf as described by bellona et al 2008 specific permeate flux values can be used to categorize the membranes as ro 0 03 l hm2kpa lpro 0 037 0 057 l hm2kpa and nf systems 11 l hm2kpa the specific permeate flux values of the ro membranes used in ncp sri lanka were calculated using the manufacturers technical specifications and the data collected from the field sites table 2 according to the manufacturer s testing conditions 7 out of 10 membranes have specific permeate flux values in the range of 0 037 0 057 l hm2kpa and they can be classified as lpro membranes the other three have specific permeate flux values less than 0 03 l m2hkpa and hence they are categorized as ro membranes under field conditions eight membranes were performed as lpro while two membranes were performed as ro membranes it is interesting to note that three membranes indexed as ro by the manufacturer behave as lpro membranes under field conditions in rajanganaya medirigiriya and hingurakgoda it may be due to defects created in the membranes from inappropriate pressures or initial flow applications that enhance higher specific permeate flux for low pressure indika et al 2021 here it was noted that the lpro membranes espa2 ld 4040 and ulp 11 4040 are contradictorily producing lower specific permeate flux similar to ro the age of the membrane espa2 ld 4040 is about five years and hence this can be attributed to membrane fouling belkacem et al 2007 this also supports the low tds and calcium removal efficiency observed for this system outlier for ec in fig 3 a but the age of the membrane ulp 11 4040 is less than one year hence the effect of membrane fouling might not be the probable cause in this case the feedwater used for this plant has the highest ec and tds compared to other feedwater sources indicating that the quality of the feedwater source also has a significant impact on the system function the low doc removal efficiency 70 observed for ulp 11 4040 but not for the rest of the parameters might be due to the internal pore blocking with the formation of compacted doc na and doc mg complexes nearly the same or lesser size comparable to the membrane pore size xu et al 2019 comparing the existing nf plants for tested and field specific permeate flux indicated that the current field nf systems function efficiently similar to lpro systems in terms of transmembrane pressure ranging between 0 30 and 0 55 mpa and produced a specific permeate flux of about 0 06 l m2hkpa table 3 the membrane ne 4040 90 is specified for high monovalent rejection but the calculated monovalent ion rejection was less 25 than the specified value 85 95 even though the operating conditions are similar to manufacturer tested conditions a similar observation was noted in ca2 23 but mg2 80 and ec removal 97 were observed as high this plant located in netiyagama sri lanka was designed differently in which the nf concentrate water was treated with a ro membrane and the resultant permeate was mixed with the nf treated water and the observed deviations can be attributed to the differences in the configuration 3 1 2 manufacturer specified vs field operational conditions the transmembrane pressure and the specific permeate flux values obtained for ro and nf membranes were compared against the manufacturers recommended data as shown in fig 2 a and b respectively most ro membranes are operating at low pressures 1 mpa fig 2 a even though the maximum allowable pressure is 4 14 mpa among the total 59 ro plants surveyed 61 operate at low tmp 0 5 1 1 mpa and 12 operate at ultra low tmp 0 5 mpa figure s1 and similar observations were also reported previously imbulana et al 2020 indika et al 2021 nanayakkara et al 2020 alternatively the nf membranes operate at similar tmps as specified by the manufacturers in the specific permeate flux comparison fig 2 b about half of the membranes show high deviations 50 deviation from the manufacturer specified values however membranes ulp 3012 df90 4040 and ne 4040 90 deviate by about 20 ensuing their proper functions tmp and specific permeate flux deviation percentages either negative or positive were examined to determine the performance of the selected membranes figure s2 most ro membranes showed nearly or above 50 deviation for both tmp and specific permeate flux except for a few membranes still nf membranes are not observed for such variations indicating that they are functioning effectively the system with espa2 ld 4040 and xle 4040 membranes showed positive differences tmp and specific permeate flux infield is less than the tested condition with greater deviation indicating fouling either organic or scaling or both park et al 2019 and it is evidenced by the lesser removal efficiency of both systems ec 80 and 92 5 ca2 88 and 89 accordingly the data not shown compared to the rest of the 8 ro systems such variations were not observed in any nf systems even though the systems age varied between 1 and 3 years indicating less fouling propensity of the nf membranes than ro however a depth study needs to correlate fouling and membrane performances 3 1 3 removal efficiencies of the membrane types the tds hardness doc and monovalent ion rejection are also compared using various ro and nf membranes figure s3 all membranes showed removal efficiencies over 80 for the above parameters despite the membrane defects and fouling propensity except for the ro membrane ulp 11 4040 70 doc removal efficiency and the nf membrane ne 4040 90 61 hardness 25 na the deviations observed with ne 4040 90 could have resulted from the plant configuration notably the concentrate recycling with ro membrane application espa2 ld 4040 showed the lowest removal efficiencies 80 tds 92 hardness 87 doc and 79 na presumably due to membrane aging upl 3012 also showed slightly low removal efficiencies 92 tds 96 hardness 91 doc and 86 na this could be due to its specific applicability as automatic water dispensers and residential drinking fountains however our data show that the salinity removal efficiency of ro and nf membranes are comparable when membrane configurations are the same even though the water hardness changed between 95 and 320 mg l as caco3 it produces water with hardness less than 15 mg l as caco3 except ne 4040 90 where the ro treated concentrate is mixed with nf treated water the observed efficiency variations of ne 4040 90 and espa2 ld 4040 are ascribed to different configurations or extensive membrane aging further removal efficiency is discussed under section 3 2 2 in detail in terms of water quality and membrane types however this part indicates that the membrane age initial flux and specified applications are important factors when considering the membrane performance and its successful functionality 3 2 comparison of field ro and nf treatment systems 3 2 1 analysis of the feedwater quality of the ro and nf treatment systems ncp groundwater is hard with 19 750 mg l as caco3 and high doc ranging between 0 and 11 mg l cooray et al 2019 makehelwala et al 2019 nonetheless it was not indicated as brackish water but few studies reported higher na concentrations greater than 1000 mg l paranagama et al 2018 perera et al 2020 the feedwater quality of the selected ro and nf treatment systems was examined for its potability according to the who guidelines 2011 and sri lanka s drinking water quality standards sls 614 2013 table 4 in general ro is mostly suitable for monovalent ion removal however the na concentration in the feedwater ranged from 15 to 138 mg l and this is within the acceptable limits as shown in table 4 the ph cations na cr3 mn2 co2 ni2 cu2 zn2 as3 se2 cd2 and anions no3 so4 2 of the feedwater were within the acceptable limits but ec hardness mg2 f and cl have exceeded the who guidelines and sls standards only 38 of the groundwater samples have the cation concentrations varying in the order of na ca2 mg2 k cooray et al 2019 whereas the rest of the samples showed the variation as na mg2 ca2 k further 85 of the samples showed hardness dominated by mg2 imbulana et al 2020 while the other samples showed ca2 dominated hardness there were no limits defined for the doc level either in the who or sls standards but it was reported that the consumption of natural water with doc levels above 4 mg l may cause adverse effects on human health british columbia 1998 regan et al 2017 it was observed that 77 of the feedwater samples had doc levels above 4 mg l indicating the necessity of membrane water treatment applications particularly ro and nf are suitable as they have a better potential for doc removal in natural water teychene et al 2020 yoon and lueptow 2005 nf has been identified as a suitable technique to bring the hardness and doc levels down to the permissible limits to provide safe water zhong et al 2019 since the study area groundwater has exceeded levels of doc hardness fluoride and chloride and it urges the need for membrane treatment either ro or nf to regulate especially the doc and hardness the current study was conducted during the dry season since significant variations especially the tds are reported in the groundwater quality during different seasons a seasonal study on the ro nf system performance is recommended imbulana et al 2021 3 2 2 groundwater treatment efficiency of ro and nf plants the groundwater treatment efficiencies of the selected field ro and nf plants were investigated by measuring the ph variation the mean removal efficiencies for ec doc and other primary cations ca2 mg2 sr2 ba2 na k al3 heavy metals v3 cr3 mn2 fe2 co2 ni2 cu2 zn2 as3 se2 cd2 and anions f cl no3 and so4 2 of the treated water was calculated using the equation 3 mentioned in table 1 a comparison of the ph values of the treated water by the ro and nf systems indicated that the nf treated water has ph values ranging from 6 1 to 7 5 whereas for ro treated water the ph was mostly less than 6 5 5 7 7 5 with an average of 5 8 the sls guidelines for drinking water specify a ph range of 6 5 8 5 therefore nf seems more favourable than ro in terms of the ph of the treated water the lesser ph values in the ro treated water could be due to the enhanced removal of the electrolytes from the system figs 3 and 4 presents the removal efficiencies of the principal water quality parameters the average removal efficiencies were nearly or above 90 and higher in ro systems compared to the nf systems both methods mean doc removal efficiencies were comparable ro 94 3 and nf 93 5 as observed both ro and nf systems effectively remove groundwater doc below 2 mg l levels permissible doc level for treated water as per ministry of environment 1998 that will not impair human health however one ro plant produced water with 2 8 mg l doc which was higher than that observed for the other plants the doc removal efficiency of this particular ro plant was only 69 7 which is significantly lower than the rest feedwater quality of the plant showed the highest ec 1329 μs cm dominated by na 138 mg l together with higher doc 9 4 mg l and uv254 0 023 cm 1 the highest na of the feedwater with low molecular weight doc fraction could result from compaction of doc via formation of neutral doc na complexes less than membrane cut off level and it is following the experienced specific permeate flux deviation with the internal pore blocking scenario adusei gyamfi et al 2019 makehelwala et al 2019 xu et al 2019 even though the doc removal is influenced by the membrane pore size that governs the doc removal mechanism by diffusion convection yoon and lueptow 2005 comparatively similar removal efficiency ranges were observed in both ncp ro and nf systems both systems were incorporated with a granular activated carbon gac filter in the pretreatment step the gac filters are known to remove feedwater doc to a certain extent via adsorption monnot et al 2016 therefore it can be assumed that the gac filters adsorb most doc present in the feedwater however complete removal of doc is unlikely and the remaining doc can be a potent foulant for both ro and nf membranes since the studied treatment plants were not designed to bypass the pretreatment unit the sole effect of the membrane in removing doc could not be identified nonetheless doc removal efficiency requires a further in depth study on the impact of doc s molecular size distribution in groundwater and the influence of the pretreatment step the comparison of the removal efficiencies of the constituents in the feedwater revealed that the ro systems have higher removal efficiencies as compared to that of nf for most of the elements but the major cations and anions mean removal efficiencies of ro were comparable with nf as observed by wafi et al 2019 since these ro systems are lpros the mean ec removal efficiency of ro was acceptable even though the higher ec removal observed for ro compared to the nf due to the insignificant deviation 1 5 and the range of removal efficiencies observed the ec removal efficiencies of the studied 10 ro plants ranged from 91 8 to 98 5 with an outlier of 80 0 membrane age 5 years while that of the 3 nf plants varied from 94 6 to 96 7 and it was similar in the range observed for ro lpro and nf lpro membranes in bellona et al 2011 study since this comparison was based on the existing systems the ec removal efficiency deviation could be due to the variation in feedwater quality and operational and maintenance conditions indika et al 2021 shen and schäfer 2014 here the 3 nf feedwater sources had ec values above 800 μs cm but the ro feedwater ec values mostly ranged from 250 to 500 μs cm and only 3 were above 800 μs cm the operating pressures also varied significantly from the manufacture specified values as shown in fig 2 a in addition to this the ions in the water together with doc can affect the removal efficiency via doc ion complexation and its fouling on membrane surfaces adusei gyamfi et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the removal efficiency of cu2 was low in both systems 11 4 and 35 6 in ro and nf respectively and this could be due to low concentrations of cu2 present in the groundwater about 3 μg l on average additionally a wider range of removal efficiencies was observed for al3 7 80 mn2 30 85 f 45 83 and no3 22 76 and among them mn2 f and no3 significantly varied to the concentrations of the respective element in the feedwater with the pearson correlation coefficients of 0 545 0 850 and 0 503 indicating that mn2 and no3 rejection moderately 0 5 influenced by its concentration and f rejection highly 0 8 influenced by the concentration also the removal efficiencies of zn2 were nearly zero for both ro and nf systems presumably due to their lower concentration and low pressure application however despite the presence of lower concentrations of certain other heavy metals such as cr3 mn2 co2 and as3 these showed higher removal efficiencies with both techniques moreover the comparison between two mean removal efficiency values based on p values obtained from two samples t tests also indicated that there was a considerable deviation between these ro and nf removal efficiencies statistically significant difference observed only for cd2 and pb2 p value 0 05 and considerable difference observed for ec na cr3 cu2 cl p value 0 15 0 20 and doc ca2 mg2 sr2 ba2 v3 fe2 as3 p value 0 20 0 25 others were not shown any considerable statistical differences while considering the obtained p values 0 30 hence both statistically and experimentally proved that removing the essential elements efficiencies was considerably affected by these two different membrane applications and ro exhibits exaggerated removal in contrast nf exhibits an acceptable removal level therefore increasing the tmp of the ro systems could be a suitable solution for the existing ro systems the efficiency will be increased in terms of higher productivity with lower removal efficiencies leading to more mineral s retention in produced water without exceeding the who and sls standard values since the existing values were too low compared to standard values 3 2 3 health consequences of produced water quality the chemical composition of drinking water plays a significant role in human health not only in terms of not exceeding the levels of potentially toxic elements but also in containing sufficient levels of essential elements such as ca2 mg2 and f treatment methods such as ro and nf both remove essential and non essential minerals from water during the treatment process particularly in ro mineral removal is comparably high due to the superior rejection ability of the membrane however prolonged consumption of ro treated water may cause adverse health effects janna et al 2016 rosborg et al 2015 although ca2 can be taken via dairy products at the same level as drinking water greater attention must be given to mg2 due to its lower bioavailability barbagallo and dominguez 2018 greupner et al 2017 the ca2 mg2 and f levels were measured in ro and nf treated water of the selected plants table 5 the values were compared with the minimum required levels in demineralized softened water established by the european union member states due to the absence of specific minimum levels of these minerals in sls standards and who guidelines kozisek 2020 as can be observed even the maximum concentration values of ca2 and mg2 in both ro and nf produced water were below the minimum level still nf showed relatively higher values as compared to ro the f concentration should be maintained above 0 5 mg l as per who guidelines but in both permeate water the f concentration was below that recommended level when considering the essential mineral content in the treated water nf can provide a better solution for the mineral deficiency issue if ro water is rich in crucial minerals post mineralization step would be essential however in none of the plants examined this step was not performed presumably due to the lack of proper knowledge and lack of resources since both ro and nf produced water mean mineral content is less the higher productivity nf membrane could be applicable to enhance the mineral concentration with proper periodical monitoring also recycling treated concentrate water seems a better solution 3 3 operation and maintenance practices during continuous operation of the membrane based treatment systems the corresponding specific permeate flux of the system can vary due to membrane fouling as experienced in systems with espa2 ld 4040 and xle 4040 membrane fouling is inevitable but can be removed to a certain extent by following proper chemical cleaning practices and reduced with appropriate inexpensive pretreatments however most ro lpro membranes used in the ncp treatment systems are not subjected to periodic chemical cleaning and end up with fouling and lower removal efficiencies instead of cleaning the membranes those are replaced by the plant s installation company upon their performance reduction permeate flow treated water quality variation but chemical cleaning is performed with naoh and hcl in the nf treatment plants on a semi annual basis to recover the specific permeate flux loss and improve the membrane performance however the pretreatment processes were well maintained in both ncp ro and nf systems to reduce the fouling formation pretreatment modules are occasionally replaced with new modules by maintaining routine ec tds monitoring pretreatment methods such as sand filtration microfiltration and gac filtration are generally used in every ro lpro plant and nf plants with antiscalant dosing to reduce the scaling effect that severely hinders the membrane performance can be removed only through extensive cleaning with strong cleaning solutions most plants perform daily backwashing of the pretreatment filters if not once per 2 3 days the replacement of microfiltration is performed occasionally within three months to maintain the produced water quality and fouling reduction the ro lpro membrane replacement frequency is around 2 3 years however membrane cleaning and factors such as operating pressure increase or specific permeate flux reduction and change of treated water quality are rarely considered when replacing the membranes it is more or less of a routine maintenance step this indicates the requirement of proper guidelines for the operation and maintenance of the treatment units to increase the effective usage of membranes adopting automatic control and maintenance facilities with smartphones developed by wu et al 2022 can be adopted for better operation of these plants the nf membranes last for three years without any unusual changes in their performances since they are subjected to proper cleaning periodically every six months or at least once a year the expected lifetime of the nf membranes is five years regarding the system design and configurations the backwashing in nf is carried out with treated water whereas in ro lpro systems raw water is used for backwashing therefore proper cleaning practices and establishing guidelines for membranes systems monitoring will help to increase membrane durability frequent replacement of ro membranes once every 2 3 years in combination with the need for post mineralization of ro treated water though it is not currently practiced in the studied plants makes ro a costly process as compared to nf the lack of technical knowledge of the plant operators was also a major disadvantage for the improper functioning of the treatment units hence educating and training the plant operator is vital for an effectively functioning treatment unit 3 4 reject water management among the 59 ncp ro plants considered for the study nearly 90 have maintained water recovery percentages below 50 as shown in fig 5 but the nf plants have maintained the recovery percentages nearly at 60 even though the wastewater generation in nf plants is less than that of the ro plants it can be further reduced by increasing the water recovery percentage up to 80 as in practice globally jones et al 2019 by limiting the feed and reject water flow rate while maintaining the optimum tmp increasing the recovery percentage will ultimately decrease the negative environmental impacts caused by the brine discharge to the ecosystem during the field survey nf plants followed better reject water management techniques by associating the reuse of reject water for cement block manufacturing and toilet flushing in one plant the concentrate water was recycled through a ro membrane and the treated water was then allowed to be mixed with nf treated water and the concentrate water obtained from ro was used for toilet flushing purposes however almost all the rejected water was discharged into the ground in ro plants without any safety measures in some cases the rejected water was used for crops and no differences were observed between other crops grown with normal groundwater discharge of the concentrate to the land area adjacent to the treatment plant may affect the indigenous plant species due to the resulting changes in soil properties nanayakkara et al 2020 in the short term and the long term this will cause groundwater quality degradation since reject water is concentrated 1 2 7 6 times more than the feedwater also the application of reject water for different reuse purposes was verified by referring to the ambient water quality standards of sri lanka 2019 and ph range f cl no3 n and so4 2 were accepted for irrigation and aquatic life purposes table s 2 however half of the ro plant concentrates exceeded the limit of ec values of 700 μs cm the derived sar values of the reject water ranged from 0 9 to 4 3 for ro and 1 0 2 5 for nf also indicating the potential of utilizing reject water for irrigation still the use of rejected water for agriculture purposes is not recommended due to the possibility of contamination of food products and health related problems added due to the soil salinity increment as per sri lankan ambient water quality standards water is suitable for aquatic life bathing and recreation in addition the available economic and sustainable brine management opportunities such as salt and metal recovery by converting the waste into a resource through combining different processes use for fish and halophyte production systems incorporating reject water treatment or resource recovery technologies with renewable energy from solar wind or thermal power sources could be considerable giwa et al 2017 jones et al 2019 3 5 future projections according to the past ro and nf comparison studies elazhar et al 2015 pontié et al 2013 moving towards nf technology will be advantageous for a tropical country like sri lanka with low tds water 3000 mg l with high yield and solutes along with the optimized brine production and energy requirement wu et al 2022 the present ro lpro systems result in excess removal of solutes with voluminous waste production under ineffective operation at low pressures 1 mpa as discussed earlier tian et al 2021 specific characteristics of feedwater and the purpose of the treatment require consideration to increase the sustainability of the ro nf plants practicing combined applications such as nf for hardness reduction and ro for treating concentrate and recycling with feedwater with near zero waste 5 is a suggestible option as at the netiyagama plant wu et al 2022 increasing the tmp of ro systems is a temporary solution to increase productivity to make these ro plants more efficient than existing ro systems however a cost comparison must be done by considering operational maintenance and cleaning costs to evaluate the economic efficiency of these systems fabrication of new membranes to target contaminants will direct towards cost effective technology that will enhance membranes permeability selectivity and stability tian et al 2021 practicing chemical and physical cleaning methods could be more effective for better removing membrane fouling layers jiang et al 2017 also as with the nf plants chemical cleaning will be beneficial for ncp ro plants to increase the membrane lifetime with acceptable performance and cost conservation by extending membrane replacing intervals jafari et al 2021 also seasonal variation in feedwater quality and their fouling mechanisms have to be considered when selecting a suitable membrane to ensure the sustainability of the plant othman et al 2022 even though the ckdu reduction was observed with these membrane treatment methods there will be a possibility of other illnesses anticipated with prolonged low mineral intakes therefore a comparative study is recommended to evaluate the health consequences of treated water consumption 4 conclusions the efficiency of the field ro and nf treatment plants established in the ncp sri lanka was compared with plant operating conditions and feedwater quality the ph of the nf produced water was within the acceptable limits whereas ro systems produce water with relatively low ph the mineral content in nf treated water was higher 19 mg l ca2 than in the ro treated water 2 5 mg l ca2 hence it offers an alternative solution to the mineral deficiency issues however the increased productivity of nf membranes recycling the concentrate with ro membrane application could be a better solution for ncp groundwater treatment future studies are required to elucidate seasonal variation of feedwater and the dissolved organic and complexes effect on membranes and systems nonetheless proper guidelines and awareness must be introduced to reject water disposal in addition low cost reject water reuse methods must be adopted for the nf and ro systems in conclusion the nf system can be considered as a more suitable option for the treatment of ncp groundwater compared to the existing ro systems when considering productivity waste generation and energy efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

11812,in this research the efficiency of reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf treatment methods installed in the dry zone sri lanka were examined as a function of operation parameters feed and product water quality membrane type user maintenance and wastes handling the quality of the feedwater varies as electrical conductivity 265 1329 mg l total hardness 97 318 mg l as caco3 and fluoride 0 58 2 93 mg l often exceeding who or sls tolerance limits about 77 of the feedwater contains dissolved organic carbon doc above 4 00 mg l that requires control to avoid membrane fouling and other harmful effects the salt rejection ratio pressure flux and transmembrane pressure of the ro nf membranes vary widely with the feedwater quality the operation parameters of the membrane plants vary significantly eight ro plants use low pressure 0 5 1 0 mpa similar to the nf pressure requirement but they desalinate water at 95 salt rejection efficiency most ro membranes deviate 50 from the recommended transmembrane pressure and specific permeate flux values however such deviations are not observed in nf treatment plants ro membranes remove solutes excessively but post mineralization step is currently not practiced in the study area the water recovery by the nf membranes is highest 60 compared to ro plants the wastewater resulting from the nf plants is handled satisfactorily compared to ro generated wastes in the area examined the salinity occurs due to water s permanent hardness therefore nf membrane based technology is suitable to desalinate groundwater in the dry zone sri lanka graphical abstract image 1 keywords reverse osmosis nanofiltration membrane fouling groundwater north central province 1 introduction the worlds only available water resource in arid and semi arid regions is groundwater which fulfils almost half of the drinking water requirements however over 60 of the aquifers in these regions exhibit high salinity due to lithogenic sources world water quality alliance 2021 in the arid or dry areas in sri lanka the lack of safe drinking water due to high salinity is further aggravated by excess dissolved organic matter indika et al 2021 xu et al 2021 both excess or low water salinity induces palatability issues rendering low water consumption particularly among farmers frequently exposed to heated environments resulting in health problems such as dehydration and chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology ckdu chandrajith et al 2011 imbulana and oguma 2021 to resolve water salinity issues in sri lanka the state and private organizations have introduced several interim measures such as the provision of truck driven water and distribution of bottled water and softeners with limited success in 2013 the sri lankan water authorities introduced reverse osmosis desalination plants to the regions where water related health problems are prevalent with a lack of pipe borne water indika et al 2021 zhong et al 2019 in 2018 nanofiltration nf was introduced to sri lanka yet they are not common compared to the ro systems zhong et al 2019 over 2000 ro treatment units are in operation in the dry zone sri lanka indika et al 2021 but only 8 nf plants have been established in sri lanka to date both ro and nf technologies operate on pressure driven water desalination the operating pressure of the nf membranes is lower than ro however the ro plants can operate under different pressures high pressure 2 mpa low pressure 0 7 2 mpa and ultra low pressure 0 5 mpa shon et al 2013 however the low pressure reverse osmosis lpro membranes perform at 98 5 solutes rejection wang et al 2015 and they are comparable to nf 0 7 3 mpa bellona et al 2008 tagliabue et al 2016 the ro membranes efficiently remove monovalent ions whereas nf membranes are selective for removing di or higher valence ions therefore ro membranes are well suited to desalinate seawater and a nanofiltration is a viable option for hardness removal the appropriate membrane topology should be judiciously introduced after characterizing the feedwater since desalination efficiency largely depends on its quality and also membrane type pressure flux temperature tian et al 2021 however most of the treatment plants were installed without paying much attention to feed groundwater quality and quantity for example only four studies are available in the region to probe the treatment efficiency of pressure driven membranes and treatment quality maintenance practices imbulana et al 2020 indika et al 2021 jayasumana et al 2016 zhong et al 2019 most of the membrane treatment plants show similar technical problems namely declined water recovery 19 64 membrane fouling and scaling concentrate disposal issues lack of technical knowledge together with the absence of a proper plant efficiency monitoring program imbulana et al 2020 indika et al 2021 apart from these constraints high operational and maintenance cost is another considerable disadvantage associated with ro technology several studies have suggested the advantages of nf membranes compared to ro in treating groundwater with high hardness and doc in terms of energy efficiency cost conservation and waste generation bellona et al 2008 tagliabue et al 2016 but the rejection of other water contaminants such as monovalent ions is comparably low in nf than in ro taky et al 2021 sometimes this property of the nf membrane helps retain solutes in the treated water that favours good health in essence both ro and nf treatment methods in sri lanka are inappropriately used mostly the membrane treatment units are considered black boxes the selection of ro nf membranes was carried out arbitrarily which resulted in over or under exploitation of the technology therefore the study area provides to assess the robustness of the membrane technology for critical operation parameters transmembrane pressure specific permeate flux water recovery and cleaning frequency and feedwater quality in a high doc zone here we evaluated the performance of ro and nf community scale plants installed in the dry zone sri lanka using 10 ro and 3 nf plants we discussed the major drawbacks of both techniques to suggest possible solutions to overcome the existing barriers the results will complement to enhance the efficiency of groundwater desalination programs those are now in operation in tropical regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and selection of membrane systems groundwater sources located in the north central province ncp of sri lanka were chosen for this work it is the largest district with a 10 472 km2 area where 31 4 of the land area is used for agriculture department of census and statistics 2013 2014 ncp belongs to the country s dry zone with a mean annual temperature ranging from 26 5 to 28 5 c and a mean annual rainfall of 900 mm varied with monsoons october to february is considered the wet season while march to september is regarded as the dry season department of meteorology 2019 the province s total population is around 1 3 million in 22 secretariat divisions covering 6 2 of the country s total population department of census and statistics 2012 where 1 4 of the people reported for ckdu prevalence ranasinghe et al 2019 hardness fluoride salinity and doc are major problems restricting water consumption over 2000 reverse osmosis plants have been installed by state and private sector organizations around 450 ro plants are operated under the surveillance of the community based organizations under the national water supply and drainage board nwsdb government of sri lanka the data available from the cbos were chosen for this study nwsdb 2019 of the total of 450 only 59 ro plants were selected based on a random sampling method by covering all divisional secretariats ds of anuradhapura 22 and polonnaruwa 07 based on population density and ckdu epidemiological data the study locations were evenly distributed among ds divisions forty and nineteen ro plants from anuradhapura and polonnaruwa were selected for the survey they were stratified based on the ro membrane type used in the plants altogether ten strata were identified 1 8 plants per strata a single ro plant was randomly selected from each stratum 10 ro plants in total ten ro plants and the existing 3 nf plants in ncp were considered to compare the efficiency and suitability of ro and nf systems the feed permeate and concentrate water samples were collected into 50 ml polypropylene bottles during the dry season march 2020 the locations of ro and nf plants are shown in fig 1 and further details e g gps coordinates are included in the supplementary material only for the selected ro 10 and nf 3 plants table s1 2 2 operator survey the differences between the operation and maintenance of the ro and nf are required to identify the selection of simpler and more affordable technology for the villagers a questionnaire was distributed among the plant operators to receive data regarding the operational conditions maintenance activities cleaning routines water quality monitoring concentrate disposal and difficulties experienced during the daily and continuous operation in addition the operating pressures flow rates plant configurations pretreatments post treatments membrane names and brine disposal methods were obtained with the help of plant operator s and in situ measurements the technical specifications of the used ro and nf membranes were obtained from the websites of the relevant manufacturers 2 3 water quality analysis the ph and electrical conductivity ec of the water were measured from the unfiltered samples in the laboratory within a day after collection using ph and ec probes thermo scientific orion star a 325 multiparameter meter respectively for dissolved organic carbon measurements the water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm polyethersulfone syringe membrane filters the filtered water ph was adjusted ph 2 with 0 2 m hcl while purging high purity nitrogen gas 99 996 for 2 min to minimize co2 contamination in doc analysis doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l csh csn shimadzu japan and uv254 absorbance was measured using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 2700 shimadzu japan a separate portion of the sample was filtered with 0 22 μm for na k ca2 mg2 co2 fe2 bi2 ni2 cu2 as3 se2 cd2 v3 cr3 mn2 ba2 zn2 mo2 al3 and sr2 analyses by icp ms thermo icapq analyzer thermo fisher scientific inc germany after acidifying with 0 2 m hno3 anions f cl no3 and so4 2 were measured using suppressor ion chromatography metrohm 930 compact ic flex metrohm ag switzerland from an unacidified portion of the samples finally the hardness values were calculated using ca2 and mg2 data all water samples were preserved by storing below 4 c until chemical analysis was commenced other standard preservation protocols like filtration and acidification of samples immediately were not followed due to the technical challenges faced during sampling in rural areas the water quality parameters were derived as an average of 3 repetitive measurements 2 4 membrane performance evaluation membrane performances were evaluated based on transmembrane operational pressure tmp water recovery percentage and salt rejection ratio additionally the membrane specific permeate flux was also calculated using the field and the manufacturer s specification data flow rate observed during membrane testing using the equation 4 given below table 1 the respective equations used for calculations of the above parameters were tabulated in table 1 the tmp and effective membrane area were extracted from membranes specification data from the relevant manufacturers specification sheet 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane type versus field performances in sri lanka and most other countries like australia and africa the selection of ro and nf membranes in the fabrication of treatment plants is arbitrary burbano et al 2007 there are no exact specifications or guidelines to select the best membrane combinations to suit a given feedwater quality most of the membrane treatment plants in the ncp sri lanka especially the ro plants were installed without a reconnaissance survey into operation parameters and feedwater quality an optimized water treatment unit also requires a critical assessment of the feedwater quality and its seasonal variations and the safe limits of groundwater extraction which is still lacking in the country both ro and nf plants selected for the study were based on the model type of the membranes the data were examined in terms of their operational pressure specific permeate flux membrane age and the salinity removal efficiency to evaluate membrane performance and suitability for groundwater treatment according to the manufacturers specifications the membranes used in the field ro units are specified for various applications such as low salinity water brackish water harsh water and residential drinking fountains and water dispensers table 2 the total dissolved solids tds and doc contents of the feedwater vary significantly from 100 to 600 mg l and 3 9 12 7 mg l respectively the ro membranes are inappropriately used for example ultra low pressure low salinity membrane is suited for the purification of groundwater with high tds 600 mg l and a high pressure brackish water membrane is suited for feedwater with low or average tds 160 350 mg l however for every plant that produces water the tds is less than 50 mg l shows that all membrane types are capable of desalination from the information acquired from the plant operators it was identified that the seasonal variation or the available source water quantity during the dry season is not considered when installing the treatment units and it can be supported by the operator statement the feedwater intake well alteration took place in the plant when the water level reduces in the feedwater well the common practice is to shift to a different water source which further signifies that the selection of membrane type or the feedwater source is not based on any scientific factor for a successful treatment unit operation pilot testing for a minimum of 6 months would be beneficial to understand how the plant is operating under different water quality conditions by incorporating the plant operators and the key personnel who will be involved in the unit s operation burbano et al 2007 the doc and salinity removal depend on the pore size kingsbury et al 2020 teychene et al 2020 and the chemical and physical properties of the membrane such as hydrophilicity pore structure and surface area yang et al 2019 all ro and nf membranes are composed of active polyamide layer hence chemical properties are more or less similar however the doc rejection by the membranes varies with physical membrane properties such as pore size and distribution and structure the lack of details on membrane characteristics was a major limitation for a thorough understanding of the behaviour of the individual membrane in water desalination also since the study was conducted on currently operating treatment units exploring the direct membrane filtration removal efficiencies without pretreatment was challenging as there was no way to bypass the pretreatment unit also no outlets were available after the pretreatment units hence the sole effect of the pretreatment process was not investigated however the majority of the ncp sri lanka field ro and nf plants have similar pretreatment units installed sand filter activated carbon filter microfilter and anti scalant application hence when considering the removal efficiencies the variations were assumed to be due to the membrane effect 3 1 1 ro lpro or nf as described by bellona et al 2008 specific permeate flux values can be used to categorize the membranes as ro 0 03 l hm2kpa lpro 0 037 0 057 l hm2kpa and nf systems 11 l hm2kpa the specific permeate flux values of the ro membranes used in ncp sri lanka were calculated using the manufacturers technical specifications and the data collected from the field sites table 2 according to the manufacturer s testing conditions 7 out of 10 membranes have specific permeate flux values in the range of 0 037 0 057 l hm2kpa and they can be classified as lpro membranes the other three have specific permeate flux values less than 0 03 l m2hkpa and hence they are categorized as ro membranes under field conditions eight membranes were performed as lpro while two membranes were performed as ro membranes it is interesting to note that three membranes indexed as ro by the manufacturer behave as lpro membranes under field conditions in rajanganaya medirigiriya and hingurakgoda it may be due to defects created in the membranes from inappropriate pressures or initial flow applications that enhance higher specific permeate flux for low pressure indika et al 2021 here it was noted that the lpro membranes espa2 ld 4040 and ulp 11 4040 are contradictorily producing lower specific permeate flux similar to ro the age of the membrane espa2 ld 4040 is about five years and hence this can be attributed to membrane fouling belkacem et al 2007 this also supports the low tds and calcium removal efficiency observed for this system outlier for ec in fig 3 a but the age of the membrane ulp 11 4040 is less than one year hence the effect of membrane fouling might not be the probable cause in this case the feedwater used for this plant has the highest ec and tds compared to other feedwater sources indicating that the quality of the feedwater source also has a significant impact on the system function the low doc removal efficiency 70 observed for ulp 11 4040 but not for the rest of the parameters might be due to the internal pore blocking with the formation of compacted doc na and doc mg complexes nearly the same or lesser size comparable to the membrane pore size xu et al 2019 comparing the existing nf plants for tested and field specific permeate flux indicated that the current field nf systems function efficiently similar to lpro systems in terms of transmembrane pressure ranging between 0 30 and 0 55 mpa and produced a specific permeate flux of about 0 06 l m2hkpa table 3 the membrane ne 4040 90 is specified for high monovalent rejection but the calculated monovalent ion rejection was less 25 than the specified value 85 95 even though the operating conditions are similar to manufacturer tested conditions a similar observation was noted in ca2 23 but mg2 80 and ec removal 97 were observed as high this plant located in netiyagama sri lanka was designed differently in which the nf concentrate water was treated with a ro membrane and the resultant permeate was mixed with the nf treated water and the observed deviations can be attributed to the differences in the configuration 3 1 2 manufacturer specified vs field operational conditions the transmembrane pressure and the specific permeate flux values obtained for ro and nf membranes were compared against the manufacturers recommended data as shown in fig 2 a and b respectively most ro membranes are operating at low pressures 1 mpa fig 2 a even though the maximum allowable pressure is 4 14 mpa among the total 59 ro plants surveyed 61 operate at low tmp 0 5 1 1 mpa and 12 operate at ultra low tmp 0 5 mpa figure s1 and similar observations were also reported previously imbulana et al 2020 indika et al 2021 nanayakkara et al 2020 alternatively the nf membranes operate at similar tmps as specified by the manufacturers in the specific permeate flux comparison fig 2 b about half of the membranes show high deviations 50 deviation from the manufacturer specified values however membranes ulp 3012 df90 4040 and ne 4040 90 deviate by about 20 ensuing their proper functions tmp and specific permeate flux deviation percentages either negative or positive were examined to determine the performance of the selected membranes figure s2 most ro membranes showed nearly or above 50 deviation for both tmp and specific permeate flux except for a few membranes still nf membranes are not observed for such variations indicating that they are functioning effectively the system with espa2 ld 4040 and xle 4040 membranes showed positive differences tmp and specific permeate flux infield is less than the tested condition with greater deviation indicating fouling either organic or scaling or both park et al 2019 and it is evidenced by the lesser removal efficiency of both systems ec 80 and 92 5 ca2 88 and 89 accordingly the data not shown compared to the rest of the 8 ro systems such variations were not observed in any nf systems even though the systems age varied between 1 and 3 years indicating less fouling propensity of the nf membranes than ro however a depth study needs to correlate fouling and membrane performances 3 1 3 removal efficiencies of the membrane types the tds hardness doc and monovalent ion rejection are also compared using various ro and nf membranes figure s3 all membranes showed removal efficiencies over 80 for the above parameters despite the membrane defects and fouling propensity except for the ro membrane ulp 11 4040 70 doc removal efficiency and the nf membrane ne 4040 90 61 hardness 25 na the deviations observed with ne 4040 90 could have resulted from the plant configuration notably the concentrate recycling with ro membrane application espa2 ld 4040 showed the lowest removal efficiencies 80 tds 92 hardness 87 doc and 79 na presumably due to membrane aging upl 3012 also showed slightly low removal efficiencies 92 tds 96 hardness 91 doc and 86 na this could be due to its specific applicability as automatic water dispensers and residential drinking fountains however our data show that the salinity removal efficiency of ro and nf membranes are comparable when membrane configurations are the same even though the water hardness changed between 95 and 320 mg l as caco3 it produces water with hardness less than 15 mg l as caco3 except ne 4040 90 where the ro treated concentrate is mixed with nf treated water the observed efficiency variations of ne 4040 90 and espa2 ld 4040 are ascribed to different configurations or extensive membrane aging further removal efficiency is discussed under section 3 2 2 in detail in terms of water quality and membrane types however this part indicates that the membrane age initial flux and specified applications are important factors when considering the membrane performance and its successful functionality 3 2 comparison of field ro and nf treatment systems 3 2 1 analysis of the feedwater quality of the ro and nf treatment systems ncp groundwater is hard with 19 750 mg l as caco3 and high doc ranging between 0 and 11 mg l cooray et al 2019 makehelwala et al 2019 nonetheless it was not indicated as brackish water but few studies reported higher na concentrations greater than 1000 mg l paranagama et al 2018 perera et al 2020 the feedwater quality of the selected ro and nf treatment systems was examined for its potability according to the who guidelines 2011 and sri lanka s drinking water quality standards sls 614 2013 table 4 in general ro is mostly suitable for monovalent ion removal however the na concentration in the feedwater ranged from 15 to 138 mg l and this is within the acceptable limits as shown in table 4 the ph cations na cr3 mn2 co2 ni2 cu2 zn2 as3 se2 cd2 and anions no3 so4 2 of the feedwater were within the acceptable limits but ec hardness mg2 f and cl have exceeded the who guidelines and sls standards only 38 of the groundwater samples have the cation concentrations varying in the order of na ca2 mg2 k cooray et al 2019 whereas the rest of the samples showed the variation as na mg2 ca2 k further 85 of the samples showed hardness dominated by mg2 imbulana et al 2020 while the other samples showed ca2 dominated hardness there were no limits defined for the doc level either in the who or sls standards but it was reported that the consumption of natural water with doc levels above 4 mg l may cause adverse effects on human health british columbia 1998 regan et al 2017 it was observed that 77 of the feedwater samples had doc levels above 4 mg l indicating the necessity of membrane water treatment applications particularly ro and nf are suitable as they have a better potential for doc removal in natural water teychene et al 2020 yoon and lueptow 2005 nf has been identified as a suitable technique to bring the hardness and doc levels down to the permissible limits to provide safe water zhong et al 2019 since the study area groundwater has exceeded levels of doc hardness fluoride and chloride and it urges the need for membrane treatment either ro or nf to regulate especially the doc and hardness the current study was conducted during the dry season since significant variations especially the tds are reported in the groundwater quality during different seasons a seasonal study on the ro nf system performance is recommended imbulana et al 2021 3 2 2 groundwater treatment efficiency of ro and nf plants the groundwater treatment efficiencies of the selected field ro and nf plants were investigated by measuring the ph variation the mean removal efficiencies for ec doc and other primary cations ca2 mg2 sr2 ba2 na k al3 heavy metals v3 cr3 mn2 fe2 co2 ni2 cu2 zn2 as3 se2 cd2 and anions f cl no3 and so4 2 of the treated water was calculated using the equation 3 mentioned in table 1 a comparison of the ph values of the treated water by the ro and nf systems indicated that the nf treated water has ph values ranging from 6 1 to 7 5 whereas for ro treated water the ph was mostly less than 6 5 5 7 7 5 with an average of 5 8 the sls guidelines for drinking water specify a ph range of 6 5 8 5 therefore nf seems more favourable than ro in terms of the ph of the treated water the lesser ph values in the ro treated water could be due to the enhanced removal of the electrolytes from the system figs 3 and 4 presents the removal efficiencies of the principal water quality parameters the average removal efficiencies were nearly or above 90 and higher in ro systems compared to the nf systems both methods mean doc removal efficiencies were comparable ro 94 3 and nf 93 5 as observed both ro and nf systems effectively remove groundwater doc below 2 mg l levels permissible doc level for treated water as per ministry of environment 1998 that will not impair human health however one ro plant produced water with 2 8 mg l doc which was higher than that observed for the other plants the doc removal efficiency of this particular ro plant was only 69 7 which is significantly lower than the rest feedwater quality of the plant showed the highest ec 1329 μs cm dominated by na 138 mg l together with higher doc 9 4 mg l and uv254 0 023 cm 1 the highest na of the feedwater with low molecular weight doc fraction could result from compaction of doc via formation of neutral doc na complexes less than membrane cut off level and it is following the experienced specific permeate flux deviation with the internal pore blocking scenario adusei gyamfi et al 2019 makehelwala et al 2019 xu et al 2019 even though the doc removal is influenced by the membrane pore size that governs the doc removal mechanism by diffusion convection yoon and lueptow 2005 comparatively similar removal efficiency ranges were observed in both ncp ro and nf systems both systems were incorporated with a granular activated carbon gac filter in the pretreatment step the gac filters are known to remove feedwater doc to a certain extent via adsorption monnot et al 2016 therefore it can be assumed that the gac filters adsorb most doc present in the feedwater however complete removal of doc is unlikely and the remaining doc can be a potent foulant for both ro and nf membranes since the studied treatment plants were not designed to bypass the pretreatment unit the sole effect of the membrane in removing doc could not be identified nonetheless doc removal efficiency requires a further in depth study on the impact of doc s molecular size distribution in groundwater and the influence of the pretreatment step the comparison of the removal efficiencies of the constituents in the feedwater revealed that the ro systems have higher removal efficiencies as compared to that of nf for most of the elements but the major cations and anions mean removal efficiencies of ro were comparable with nf as observed by wafi et al 2019 since these ro systems are lpros the mean ec removal efficiency of ro was acceptable even though the higher ec removal observed for ro compared to the nf due to the insignificant deviation 1 5 and the range of removal efficiencies observed the ec removal efficiencies of the studied 10 ro plants ranged from 91 8 to 98 5 with an outlier of 80 0 membrane age 5 years while that of the 3 nf plants varied from 94 6 to 96 7 and it was similar in the range observed for ro lpro and nf lpro membranes in bellona et al 2011 study since this comparison was based on the existing systems the ec removal efficiency deviation could be due to the variation in feedwater quality and operational and maintenance conditions indika et al 2021 shen and schäfer 2014 here the 3 nf feedwater sources had ec values above 800 μs cm but the ro feedwater ec values mostly ranged from 250 to 500 μs cm and only 3 were above 800 μs cm the operating pressures also varied significantly from the manufacture specified values as shown in fig 2 a in addition to this the ions in the water together with doc can affect the removal efficiency via doc ion complexation and its fouling on membrane surfaces adusei gyamfi et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the removal efficiency of cu2 was low in both systems 11 4 and 35 6 in ro and nf respectively and this could be due to low concentrations of cu2 present in the groundwater about 3 μg l on average additionally a wider range of removal efficiencies was observed for al3 7 80 mn2 30 85 f 45 83 and no3 22 76 and among them mn2 f and no3 significantly varied to the concentrations of the respective element in the feedwater with the pearson correlation coefficients of 0 545 0 850 and 0 503 indicating that mn2 and no3 rejection moderately 0 5 influenced by its concentration and f rejection highly 0 8 influenced by the concentration also the removal efficiencies of zn2 were nearly zero for both ro and nf systems presumably due to their lower concentration and low pressure application however despite the presence of lower concentrations of certain other heavy metals such as cr3 mn2 co2 and as3 these showed higher removal efficiencies with both techniques moreover the comparison between two mean removal efficiency values based on p values obtained from two samples t tests also indicated that there was a considerable deviation between these ro and nf removal efficiencies statistically significant difference observed only for cd2 and pb2 p value 0 05 and considerable difference observed for ec na cr3 cu2 cl p value 0 15 0 20 and doc ca2 mg2 sr2 ba2 v3 fe2 as3 p value 0 20 0 25 others were not shown any considerable statistical differences while considering the obtained p values 0 30 hence both statistically and experimentally proved that removing the essential elements efficiencies was considerably affected by these two different membrane applications and ro exhibits exaggerated removal in contrast nf exhibits an acceptable removal level therefore increasing the tmp of the ro systems could be a suitable solution for the existing ro systems the efficiency will be increased in terms of higher productivity with lower removal efficiencies leading to more mineral s retention in produced water without exceeding the who and sls standard values since the existing values were too low compared to standard values 3 2 3 health consequences of produced water quality the chemical composition of drinking water plays a significant role in human health not only in terms of not exceeding the levels of potentially toxic elements but also in containing sufficient levels of essential elements such as ca2 mg2 and f treatment methods such as ro and nf both remove essential and non essential minerals from water during the treatment process particularly in ro mineral removal is comparably high due to the superior rejection ability of the membrane however prolonged consumption of ro treated water may cause adverse health effects janna et al 2016 rosborg et al 2015 although ca2 can be taken via dairy products at the same level as drinking water greater attention must be given to mg2 due to its lower bioavailability barbagallo and dominguez 2018 greupner et al 2017 the ca2 mg2 and f levels were measured in ro and nf treated water of the selected plants table 5 the values were compared with the minimum required levels in demineralized softened water established by the european union member states due to the absence of specific minimum levels of these minerals in sls standards and who guidelines kozisek 2020 as can be observed even the maximum concentration values of ca2 and mg2 in both ro and nf produced water were below the minimum level still nf showed relatively higher values as compared to ro the f concentration should be maintained above 0 5 mg l as per who guidelines but in both permeate water the f concentration was below that recommended level when considering the essential mineral content in the treated water nf can provide a better solution for the mineral deficiency issue if ro water is rich in crucial minerals post mineralization step would be essential however in none of the plants examined this step was not performed presumably due to the lack of proper knowledge and lack of resources since both ro and nf produced water mean mineral content is less the higher productivity nf membrane could be applicable to enhance the mineral concentration with proper periodical monitoring also recycling treated concentrate water seems a better solution 3 3 operation and maintenance practices during continuous operation of the membrane based treatment systems the corresponding specific permeate flux of the system can vary due to membrane fouling as experienced in systems with espa2 ld 4040 and xle 4040 membrane fouling is inevitable but can be removed to a certain extent by following proper chemical cleaning practices and reduced with appropriate inexpensive pretreatments however most ro lpro membranes used in the ncp treatment systems are not subjected to periodic chemical cleaning and end up with fouling and lower removal efficiencies instead of cleaning the membranes those are replaced by the plant s installation company upon their performance reduction permeate flow treated water quality variation but chemical cleaning is performed with naoh and hcl in the nf treatment plants on a semi annual basis to recover the specific permeate flux loss and improve the membrane performance however the pretreatment processes were well maintained in both ncp ro and nf systems to reduce the fouling formation pretreatment modules are occasionally replaced with new modules by maintaining routine ec tds monitoring pretreatment methods such as sand filtration microfiltration and gac filtration are generally used in every ro lpro plant and nf plants with antiscalant dosing to reduce the scaling effect that severely hinders the membrane performance can be removed only through extensive cleaning with strong cleaning solutions most plants perform daily backwashing of the pretreatment filters if not once per 2 3 days the replacement of microfiltration is performed occasionally within three months to maintain the produced water quality and fouling reduction the ro lpro membrane replacement frequency is around 2 3 years however membrane cleaning and factors such as operating pressure increase or specific permeate flux reduction and change of treated water quality are rarely considered when replacing the membranes it is more or less of a routine maintenance step this indicates the requirement of proper guidelines for the operation and maintenance of the treatment units to increase the effective usage of membranes adopting automatic control and maintenance facilities with smartphones developed by wu et al 2022 can be adopted for better operation of these plants the nf membranes last for three years without any unusual changes in their performances since they are subjected to proper cleaning periodically every six months or at least once a year the expected lifetime of the nf membranes is five years regarding the system design and configurations the backwashing in nf is carried out with treated water whereas in ro lpro systems raw water is used for backwashing therefore proper cleaning practices and establishing guidelines for membranes systems monitoring will help to increase membrane durability frequent replacement of ro membranes once every 2 3 years in combination with the need for post mineralization of ro treated water though it is not currently practiced in the studied plants makes ro a costly process as compared to nf the lack of technical knowledge of the plant operators was also a major disadvantage for the improper functioning of the treatment units hence educating and training the plant operator is vital for an effectively functioning treatment unit 3 4 reject water management among the 59 ncp ro plants considered for the study nearly 90 have maintained water recovery percentages below 50 as shown in fig 5 but the nf plants have maintained the recovery percentages nearly at 60 even though the wastewater generation in nf plants is less than that of the ro plants it can be further reduced by increasing the water recovery percentage up to 80 as in practice globally jones et al 2019 by limiting the feed and reject water flow rate while maintaining the optimum tmp increasing the recovery percentage will ultimately decrease the negative environmental impacts caused by the brine discharge to the ecosystem during the field survey nf plants followed better reject water management techniques by associating the reuse of reject water for cement block manufacturing and toilet flushing in one plant the concentrate water was recycled through a ro membrane and the treated water was then allowed to be mixed with nf treated water and the concentrate water obtained from ro was used for toilet flushing purposes however almost all the rejected water was discharged into the ground in ro plants without any safety measures in some cases the rejected water was used for crops and no differences were observed between other crops grown with normal groundwater discharge of the concentrate to the land area adjacent to the treatment plant may affect the indigenous plant species due to the resulting changes in soil properties nanayakkara et al 2020 in the short term and the long term this will cause groundwater quality degradation since reject water is concentrated 1 2 7 6 times more than the feedwater also the application of reject water for different reuse purposes was verified by referring to the ambient water quality standards of sri lanka 2019 and ph range f cl no3 n and so4 2 were accepted for irrigation and aquatic life purposes table s 2 however half of the ro plant concentrates exceeded the limit of ec values of 700 μs cm the derived sar values of the reject water ranged from 0 9 to 4 3 for ro and 1 0 2 5 for nf also indicating the potential of utilizing reject water for irrigation still the use of rejected water for agriculture purposes is not recommended due to the possibility of contamination of food products and health related problems added due to the soil salinity increment as per sri lankan ambient water quality standards water is suitable for aquatic life bathing and recreation in addition the available economic and sustainable brine management opportunities such as salt and metal recovery by converting the waste into a resource through combining different processes use for fish and halophyte production systems incorporating reject water treatment or resource recovery technologies with renewable energy from solar wind or thermal power sources could be considerable giwa et al 2017 jones et al 2019 3 5 future projections according to the past ro and nf comparison studies elazhar et al 2015 pontié et al 2013 moving towards nf technology will be advantageous for a tropical country like sri lanka with low tds water 3000 mg l with high yield and solutes along with the optimized brine production and energy requirement wu et al 2022 the present ro lpro systems result in excess removal of solutes with voluminous waste production under ineffective operation at low pressures 1 mpa as discussed earlier tian et al 2021 specific characteristics of feedwater and the purpose of the treatment require consideration to increase the sustainability of the ro nf plants practicing combined applications such as nf for hardness reduction and ro for treating concentrate and recycling with feedwater with near zero waste 5 is a suggestible option as at the netiyagama plant wu et al 2022 increasing the tmp of ro systems is a temporary solution to increase productivity to make these ro plants more efficient than existing ro systems however a cost comparison must be done by considering operational maintenance and cleaning costs to evaluate the economic efficiency of these systems fabrication of new membranes to target contaminants will direct towards cost effective technology that will enhance membranes permeability selectivity and stability tian et al 2021 practicing chemical and physical cleaning methods could be more effective for better removing membrane fouling layers jiang et al 2017 also as with the nf plants chemical cleaning will be beneficial for ncp ro plants to increase the membrane lifetime with acceptable performance and cost conservation by extending membrane replacing intervals jafari et al 2021 also seasonal variation in feedwater quality and their fouling mechanisms have to be considered when selecting a suitable membrane to ensure the sustainability of the plant othman et al 2022 even though the ckdu reduction was observed with these membrane treatment methods there will be a possibility of other illnesses anticipated with prolonged low mineral intakes therefore a comparative study is recommended to evaluate the health consequences of treated water consumption 4 conclusions the efficiency of the field ro and nf treatment plants established in the ncp sri lanka was compared with plant operating conditions and feedwater quality the ph of the nf produced water was within the acceptable limits whereas ro systems produce water with relatively low ph the mineral content in nf treated water was higher 19 mg l ca2 than in the ro treated water 2 5 mg l ca2 hence it offers an alternative solution to the mineral deficiency issues however the increased productivity of nf membranes recycling the concentrate with ro membrane application could be a better solution for ncp groundwater treatment future studies are required to elucidate seasonal variation of feedwater and the dissolved organic and complexes effect on membranes and systems nonetheless proper guidelines and awareness must be introduced to reject water disposal in addition low cost reject water reuse methods must be adopted for the nf and ro systems in conclusion the nf system can be considered as a more suitable option for the treatment of ncp groundwater compared to the existing ro systems when considering productivity waste generation and energy efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

11813,the sustainable management of water resources plays a significant role in boosting the country s economy mainly in the agriculture sector in many regions globally the availability of surface water resources is limited and thus depends on the groundwater for irrigating crops furthermore soil erosion is a severe problem such as worsened soil fertility land use disturbances and sedimentation especially in large scaled river basins having complex topography therefore assessment of the spatial temporal variation of groundwater development such as groundwater recharge gwr and groundwater safe yield gwsy and their response to topsoil erosion in large scaled river basins are crucial for sustainable groundwater development this paper aims to assess the spatial temporal dynamics of groundwater development in response to runoff induced topsoil loss a large scale east african river basin such as the omo river basin was chosen to demonstrate the proposed modeling approaches the wetspass m physical based hydrological model was used to estimate the longtime average annual gwr and runoff the estimated spatial variation of gwr was used for the analysis of gwsy further combined methods such as the rusle model arcgis tool and remote sensing rs data were used to estimate the spatial variation of annual topsoil erosion the result showed that groundwater resources in cultivation land use in the omo river basin have moderate to high productive aquifers 2 28 l s with maximum gwsy capacity ranging from 0 4 to 4 m3 day ha the estimated long term average annual topsoil erosion is 12 35 t ha 1yr 1 and is comparable with the observed sediment yield of 13 24 t ha 1yr 1 the cultivation regions of the river basin receive maximum gwr and experience moderate to severe topsoil erosion indicating that gwr has a direct response to topsoil erosion in the disturbed soil regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords gwr soil loss erosion prone zone rusle wetspass m omo river basin 1 introduction ethiopia is known as africa s water tower however lack of efficient water resource management strategies arsano and tamrat 2005 gebreyohannes et al 2013 leads to water shortages mainly in the agriculture sector under this situation dependence on the groundwater to meet the irrigation demands is vastly increasing awulachew 2019 it is a known fact that exploiting groundwater must ensure the sustainability as a long term source of water maintaining the quality and ecosystem variation equitably gupta and onta 1997 this in fact is important in arid semi arid and sub tropical regions where the crops are exposed to severe water deficit conditions gebreyohannes et al 2013 yenehun et al 2020 sustainable groundwater resources require an understanding of groundwater systems extent distribution and depletion assessment and development of groundwater can be persuaded by water balance methods that balance groundwater abstraction hiscock and bense 2021 hydrological water balance can be used to identify the magnitude of the amount of groundwater that can safely and economically be extracted roscoe and george 1990 water balance provides the direction of the investigation of groundwater resources united states 1977 through investigating the groundwater budget voudouris 2006 the groundwater safe yield gwsy sustainable exploitation and management are quite possible gwsy should be less than groundwater recharge gwr to compensate for the minor decline of groundwater resources fetter 2001 in groundwater management gwsy is defined as the rate at which groundwater can be exploited from aquifers without resulting in undesired conditions dottridge and jaber 1999 heath and spruill 2003 gwsy is a groundwater goal attempt to achieve and maintain a sustainable balance between the annual quantity of groundwater resources and gwr in the catchment jacobs and holway 2004 traditionally gwsy is considered as the condition at which groundwater pumping rate equal with total gwr lin et al 2001 assume that the gwsy is 50 of total natural gwr sustainable groundwater development is primarily determined by groundwater recharge gwr the gwr is defined as the deep percolation of water reaching the water table and subsequently added to the groundwater resources sustainable groundwater development is related to well managed groundwater pumping balanced by the gwr rate known as groundwater safe yield gwsy investigation of spatial temporal variation of gwsy is essential for the regions facing difficulties in accessing surface water resources for crops under deficit irrigation gebreyohannes et al 2013 therefore assessing the spatial temporal of gwr that helps groundwater development is essential for determining the spatial and temporal variation of gwsy bredehoeft 2002 sophocleous 2000 furthermore identifying surface hydrological processes influencing groundwater resources is crucial for planning remedial measures for sustainable groundwater resource development surface hydrological processes such as runoff and surface soil erosion in hydrological systems are significant components possibly influencing groundwater development foster and chilton 2004 therefore assessment of spatial temporal variation of soil erosion and groundwater development relations is vital for the sustainable management of groundwater resources groundwater development such as gwr in virtual increases pore water pressures and decreases soil shear strength which enhances soil erodibility of vadose zone soil rockwell 2002 the high soil water content required for groundwater development entailing deep percolation from rainfall might lead to mass transfers on hillslopes in disturbed soil like cultivation areas only a very few studies reported the investigation relating groundwater development and vadose zone soil erosion at spatial temporal scales on hillslope regions cultivation landuse bryan and rockwell 1998 investigation on relating the spatial temporal variation of groundwater development and soil erosion at the catchment level would be helpful for appropriate planning of soil and water resources conservation measures this is more evident for the watersheds especially in arid semi arid and tropical climate regions where rainfall induced runoff plays a significant role in nutrients soil loss and sediment transportation and entails sustainable management pérez latorre et al 2010 vafakhah et al 2019 another important factor that affects hillslope soil erosion is relatively close hydrological characteristics such as groundwater seepage gws which is shallow groundwater that is exfiltrated at the soil surface huang 1998 in comparison to the free drainage zone the gws zone is restricted along the hillslope often near the bottom zheng et al 2004 the gws has the potential to lower the topsoil cohesive force and thereby increase topsoil erosion howard and mclane iii 1988 dunne et al 1991 the topsoil is unsaturated in a free drainage scenario more precipitation water could permeate into the soil huang et al 2002 however in the gws scenario the soil is saturated and virtually all of the rainwater drains to the surface leading to a rise in erosion huang and laften 1996 zheng et al 2004 additionally under the free drainage condition the type of soil erosion may alter from detachment limited to transport limited under the gws status zheng et al 2000 furthermore the spatial temporal variations of rainfall physiological factors soil land use elevation and slope and environmental indicators play significant roles in groundwater development soil erosion and runoff spatial variation in water resources systems however direct measurement of these factors is impossible for large scaled river basins due to the complexity of physiological conditions and inaccessible areas chen et al 2011 sarangi et al 2006 for the analysis of spatial variation of water balance components such as runoff and gwr several hydrological models such as swat arnold et al 2012 kswat swat model and karst flow model malagò et al 2016 she systeme hydrologique european bathurst 1986 and vic liang et al 1996 have been used in estimating the spatial temporal dynamics of gwr and runoff it may be noted that these models require intensive data and modeling expertise and thus affect broader use worldwide under this condition the wetspass m physical based fully distributed hydrological model has been reported to be an alternate choice that has the capability of estimating the spatial temporal variation of gwr and runoff abdollahi et al 2017 surface runoff is the primary aspect directly related to soil erosion wu et al 2021 the decreasing runoff depth with increasing slope length indicates runoff flow erosivity varies with terrain slope length and thus affects the spatial variation of soil erosion scales besides the spatial variation of runoff significantly varies with rainfall distribution soil type and hillslope surface features further complicate erosion s scaling wu et al 2020 in usle and rusle soil erosion scaling related to runoff is directly determined by the slope angle and shows a direct monotonically trend with slope angle renard 1997 wischmeier and smith 1978 further the runoff scale effect on soil erosion varies significantly with landuse prats et al 2016 therefore relating soil erosion with runoff scale on spatial variation considering all detrimental factors mentioned above should always be considered for appropriate assessment of runoff induced soil erosion effect on hydrological systems surface soil erosion in arid semi arid and tropical regions causes topsoil fertility loss sedimentation of streams water resources decline and flood extremes it is a severe issue in agriculture and water resources projects resulting in a substantial negative impact mekonnen et al 2017 prasad and tiwari 2020 safwan et al 2021 surface soil erosion is anticipated as a primary factor in declining water resources and is currently an alarming issue worldwide esa et al 2018 novara et al 2016 besides surface soil erosion is the dominant factor in land resource worsening in the highland regions yesuph and dagnew 2019 assessment of spatiotemporal variation of soil loss induced by runoff generated rainfall is a milestone for the sustainable development of water resources systems under complex topography and scarcity of measured data currently the revised universal soil loss equation rusle integrating remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis tools that yield precise and low cost soil loss computation has a wide range of applications mukanov 2019 the universal soil loss equation usle model was advanced by wischmeier and meyer 1973 and its modified form is rusle renard 1997 which is adopted worldwide for estimation of longtime average annual soil loss the flexibility fastness and cost effectiveness of the rusle model allow the model to be applicable for watersheds lacking measurable data effectively rusle has limitations in the accuracy of the application over large scaled watersheds chen et al 2011 prasannakumar et al 2011 and overestimates soil erosivity fernández and vega 2016 ostovari et al 2017 therefore to overcome the limitation of the rulse model the combining method of the rusle model gis system and rs data were adopted broadly worldwide for estimation of the mean annual spatial distribution of soil loss gaubi et al 2017 hurni 1985 morgan et al 1984 qin et al 2018 teng et al 2019 wischmeier and smith 1978 zerihun et al 2018 the combined method of rusle rs and gis system considers pixel by pixel basis and efficiently estimates soil loss experiences from any areal catchment extents thapa 2020 xu et al 2013 therefore in this study spatial temporal variation of gwr using the wetspass m model was analyzed and further used to estimate gwsy as the spatial temporal variation of soil erosion is one of the key influencing factors in groundwater development rockwell 2002 different methods such as rusle gis and rs were integrated and used for the estimation of topsoil erosion it is known that the soil textures and lulc catchment characteristics are helpful for investigating the relation between gwr gwsy and soil erosion and the overall spatial temporal variation this study investigated the spatial temporal variation of groundwater development such as gwr and gwsy and their relationship with soil erosion in large scaled catchments under high data scarcity for sustainable development of soil and groundwater resources the following are the specific objectives of the study 1 to analyse the spatial temporal variation of longtime annual gwr and daily gwsy 2 to map aquifer spatial variation based on observed active groundwater borehole aquifer yields and to validate gwsy 3 to analyse longtime spatial temporal variation of annual soil erosion and 4 to establish the relationship between gwr and gwsy with soil erosion for different soil types and lucl changing trends the data collected from large scaled river basin omo in ethiopia east africa under high hydrological data scarcity and complex systems was used to demonstrate the proposed approaches to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first paper that assesses spatial temporal variation of sustainable groundwater development runoff and soil erosion relation by considering critical catchment characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the omo river basin is ethiopia s second largest river basin located in southwest parts of the country and its drainage originates from the high mountain ranges from 3596 m to 334 m masl the omo river basin covers the area of 79 678 km2 and located between 5 00 0 n 9 00 0 n and 34 00 0 e 38 00 0 e fig 1 the river basin consists of thirty sub basins and the principal tributary rivers of the omo river originate from sub basins such as walga wabe rebu and warebessa located in northeast junjo and southwest tunjo gilgel gibe and gojeb sub basin the sub basins in the southern parts such as waybe deme soke and the zage are the primary origin of tributary rivers and the omo river empties into lake turkana on the margin with kenya the omo river basin receives maximum and minimum longtime 1990 2020 average monthly rainfall of 221 mm and 38 mm in july and january respectively gelebo et al 2022 the long term average annual rainfall shows that the omo river basin receives an annual rainfall of 1444 mm yr while experiencing a mean annual temperature of 21 c day and wind speed of 1 24 m s the spatial distribution of longtime average annual rainfall temperature and wind speed range from 458 to 2929 mm yr 15 29 c day and 0 56 2 36 m s respectively the omo river basin receives average annual rainfall from 1640 to 2929 mm yr in its central part while receiving 458 1272 mm yr in its southern regions furthermore the spatial distribution analysis shows that the south part of the river basin experiences a maximum temperature and wind speed ranging from 23 to 29 c day and 1 2 2 36 m s respectively fig 2 2 2 description of data the physiological data of river basin such as lulc soil type topography slope and hydro climate parameters such as rainfall temperature and wind speed are centroid parameters for modeling spatio temporal dynamics of gwr groundwater safe yield surface runoff and soil loss characteristics the omo river basin lulc map of the year 2000 were developed from the modis usgs earth explorer database and lulc of the year 2019 gathered from the ministry of water irrigation and energy mowie ethiopia the lulc of the river basin is classified into twelve classes open water cultivation afro alpine woodland urban plantation bushland forest shrubland marsh bare soil and grassland harmonized world soil database hwsd of 2012 was used to develop a soil map of the river basin fao et al 2012 leenaars et al 2014 according to usda soil classification four soil textural classes sandy loam clay sandy clay loam clay loam and loam dominate the river basin the areal coverage of soil types such as loam clay loam sandy clay loam clay and sandy loam is 68 93 19 32 6 04 4 54 and 1 18 respectively the daily hydro climate data such as rainfall temperature and wind speed for the year of 1990 2020 of 35 weather stations located in the omo river basin was collected from ethiopia national meteorology agency nma the recorded streamflow data of the year 1990 2001 and sediment flow over guraze diversion headwork were collected from south water work and construction enterprise swwce ethiopia all active groundwater borehole gwbh reports for the year 2011 2021 on the river basin were collected from different ethiopia regional offices such as owwce oromia water work and construction enterprise scdse south construction design and supervision enterprise and swwce south water work and construction enterprise and ethiopia federal offices such as mowie ministry of water irrigation and energy and fcdse federal construction and design supervision enterprise topographic data such as a digital elevation model dem 30 arc second were developed from the gtopo30 in the usgs earth explorers database for compatible model simulation all raster input parameters were resampled to an equal cell size of 90 m the details of input data for the models were presented in table 1 2 3 methodology the conceptual framework developed for this study is illustrated in the form of flow chart fig 3 in this section the brief explanation of input data used processes followed methods adopted are presented 2 3 1 water resources assessment wetspass m physical based hydrological models was utilized for estimating the longtime average annual spatial dynamics of rainfall induced groundwater recharge gwr and surface runoff please note that the detailed wetspass m model description and model parameters are described by abdollahi et al 2017 and hence more detail about the model is not presented in this paper the raster input model parameters include longtime 1990 2020 average monthly hydro climate parameters such as temperature wind speed rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet further the catchment physiological parameters such as dem soil types topographic slope and hydro geologic parameters such as groundwater depth are additional raster inputs for the wetspass m model the groundwater depth hydro geologic parameter in the wetspass m model supports delineating seepage flux occurring from wetlands gebreyohannes et al 2013 the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation technique from the spatial analyst tool in the arcgis was used to develop the input raster maps of spatial variation of average monthly hydro climate parameters and hydro geologic groundwater depth the historical streamflow data ranges from 1990 to 2001 and sediment flow over kuraz diversion headwork at the lower of the omo river was used for model performance analysis the wetspass m model has four calibration model parameters such as evaporative efficiency ratio calibration coefficient α calibration parameter depending on soil moisture lp interception threshold parameter a in mm day the longtime average rainfall intensity during wet days considered as an aggregated indicator i in mm hr and runoff day factor x the omo river basin s calibrated wetspass m model parameters were adopted from a previous study gelebo et al 2022 2 3 2 model description wetspass model is a physical based fully distributed hydrological model used for estimating longtime average interannual wbcs such as gwr runoff actual evapotranspiration aet and interception batelaan and de smedt 2007 rwanga 2013 wetspass is abbreviated and read as water energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere in a quasi steady state it is developed using the wetspa time dependent spatial distributed water balance model batelaan et al 1996 batelaan and de smedt 2001 the original wetspass model runs all hydrological processes on a seasonal and annual time step and it is an extension of arcview gis recently the original wespass model was modified to estimate spatiotemporal dynamics of wbcs at a monthly scale and named wetspass m abdollahi et al 2017 it runs alone and can be applied to any area especially in large scale river basins therefore in this paper the wetspass m was preferred to assess spatio temporal variation of gwr and runoff of the omo river basin ethiopia the model computes specific raster output of water balances by adding all vegetated bare soil open water and impervious area components of a raster cell the addition of individual raster cells of wbcs provides for a specific region s total water balance the overall wbcs of a raster cell is mathematically described in eqn 2 1 2 3 2 1 a e t raster a v e t v a s e s a o e o a i e i 2 2 s raster a v s v a s s s a o s o a i s i 2 3 r raster a v r v a s r s a o r o a i r i where aet raster is actual evapotranspiration s raster is total surface runoff r raster is total groundwater recharge and e is evaporation outputs in raster formats each with a vegetated bare soil open water and impervious areas represented by av as ao and ai respectively thus the output wbcs calculations in the westpass m include groundwater recharge actual evapotranspiration surface runoff and an interception in raster and excel format abdollahi et al 2017 2 3 3 soil erosion assessment arcgis and remote sensing rs technologies are technologically advanced systems widely utilized to assess the spatiotemporal distribution of soil erosion elements the arc gis system spatial analyst tools were utilized for the development of raster maps of each component of the rusle model eqn 2 4 and the spatial variation of long term average yearly soil loss of the omo river basin was assessed using a map algebra spatial analyst tool in the arc gis system 2 4 a r k l s c p where a is long term average yearly soil loss t ha yr r is precipitation erosivity mj mm ha 1hr 1yr 1 k is soil erodibility t ha hr ha 1mj 1mm 1 and ls is topographic s is slope gradient c is crop management and p is soil and water conservation practice factors of rusle model components renard 1997 wischmeier and smith 1978 hurni 1985 2 3 4 precipitation runoff erosivity r factor the long term 1990 2020 average annual precipitation data of each 35 weather were analyzed to calculate r factor using eqn 2 5 the r factor is estimated by empirical eqn 2 5 developed by hurni 1985 and widely adopted in ethiopia for calculation of long term average annual r factor and effectively utilized in several portions of the country hurni 1985 esa et al 2018 zerihun et al 2018 fenta et al 2016 tamene et al 2017 choto and fetene 2019 girma and gebre 2020 2 5 r 0 5616 r f 8 1202 where r mj mm ha 1hr 1yr 1 is the precipitation runoff erosivity factor rf mm yr is each weather station s long term average annual precipitation the calculated average annual r values were spatially interpolated by inverse distance weighted idw spatial analyst tool technique in arcgis to develop an r factor raster map the idw technique effectively compensates for missing data as it considers a nearby data station than far away information and is a primarily preferable technique in addition idw techniques showed a more reliable mean square error nistor et al 2020 gebru and tesfahunegn 2020 and can quickly generate robust reliable precipitation runoff erosivity factor r for any catchments scale under scare of hydro climate data jacobs et al 2010 2 3 5 soil erodibility k factor the k factor is the natural resistance of soil to erode by precipitation induced runoff it is different from the actual soil loss due to its primary dependence on precipitation slope crop cover soil textural class characteristics of the catchment k factor values indicate the rate of soil loss per rainfall runoff erosivity r index in this paper k factor were estimated using soil erodability nomograph wischmeier and meyer 1973 wischmeier and smith 1978 in the past this method adopted in ethiopia context and effectively supported implementation of soil conservation systems hurni 1985 the method considers the relationship between estimated soil textural classes organic matter contents soil structure percentage of soil texture and drainage conditions of the river basin table 2 the method estimates the k factor for an area satisfying the condition of a percentage of silt not exceeding 70 wischmeier and meyer 1973 and is preferred in the paper as the omo river basin attains the condition 2 3 6 topographic ls factor the soil loss triggered by precipitation induced runoff in any river basin is susceptible to local topographic factors the ls factor is also called sediment transport index and described as the combination of the effects of slope length l and slope gradient s on soil particle transport renard 1997 the topographic factor ls is estimated using empirical eqn 2 6 developed by wischmeier and smith 1978 and adopted by ganasri and ramesh 2016 this method is very effective in large scaled river basins with a complex topography and is challenging to measure slope length and gradient directly the ls was calculated by eqn 2 6 using dem of river basin as proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 for complex large scaled river basins the dem of 30 m resolution was obtained from the srtm usgs earth explorer database the raster calculator map algebra spatial analyst tool in arcgis system was used for ls analysis using eqn 2 6 2 6 l s q a c g r 22 13 m 0 065 0 0456 s g r 0 06541 s g r 2 where ls is a topographic factor q ac is flow accumulation grid map s gr is slope grid in percent gr 90 m is study area raster map pixel size and m is slope length exponent the m 0 5 for slope greater than 5 m 0 4 for slope equal to 4 and m 0 3 for slope less than or equal to 3 wischmeier and smith 1978 therefore for the omo river basin average slope is 6 and m 0 5 were considered for analysis of the ls factor 2 3 7 land coverage management c factor the c factor reflects the effects of farming and other techniques on erosion rates and it is susceptible to plant growth and precipitation spatiotemporal patterns the c factor values range from 0 to 1 for each lulc of the river basin and a lower c value indicates no loss while a higher value signifies high soil loss low coverage of vegetations in the region the c factor represents the soil loss ratio from land covered by vegetation under quantified conditions to the corresponding soil loss from clean tilled soil the c factor quantifies all interrelated land cover and management practices wischmeier and smith 1978 morgan et al 1984 this paper developed the c factor for the omo river basin using the lulc classes of river basin and immense literature reviews as the detail presented in tabel 3 2 3 8 soil conservation practice p factor the p factor illustrates the effect of soil conservation mechanisms such as building terraces on surface runoff elimination and the severity of soil loss the p factor value ranges from 0 to 1 in which 0 value indicates the presence of a powerful controlling mechanism of soil erosion initiated by anthropogenic activities and 1 signifies no soil conservation mechanisms are available for soil erosion aggravated by anthropogenic activities on the area wischmeier and smith 1978 this paper developed the soil conservation factor p for the omo river basin based on lulc classes and the concrete literature reviews as the detail presented in table 4 3 result and discussion 3 1 omo river basin aquifer the spatial variation of aquifer mapping of omo river basin was developed based on observation of active groundwater boreholes safe yield data with the support of the idw method in the arcgis system nistor et al 2020 the type of aquifer within the river basin scale was classified based on user guidelines of groundwater atlas country of africa hydrogeology maps version 1 1 o dochartaigh 2019 the result showed that the omo river basin is dominated by aquifers with moderate to high production yield ranges from 2 to 20 l s covering around 91 of the river basin and confirming previous reports on hydro geologic mapping of the country kebede et al 2018 the analysis also revealed that moderate productive yield aquifers 2 5 l s cover about 60 of the river basin s total area table 5 the finding indicated that most of the southern north eastern and central eastern parts of the river basin are dominated by moderate yield aquifers the high productive aquifer yield 5 20 l s covers around 31 table 5 of the river basin and mostly dominates the west central west northern and some east southern parts of the river basin fig 4 b according to ethiopian geology hartmann and moosdorf 2012 o dochartaigh 2019 the omo river basin above the central part is dominated by igneous volcanic rock lithology while unconsolidated sedimentary rock lithology dominates the southern part of the river basin fig 4a the igneous volcanic rock is characterized by moderate to high while unconsolidated sedimentary rocks are characterized by low to moderate productive aquifers o dochartaigh 2019 the central and northern part of the river basin is dominated by moderate to high productive aquifer based on observed productive well yield which confirms the lithology characteristics of the river basin fig 4b 3 2 groundwater development groundwater development is mainly controlled by gwr assessment of spatial temporal variation of gwr is critical for assessing groundwater safe yield gwsy for crops under deficit irrigation especially in the region facing the difficulty of accessing surface water resources gebreyohannes et al 2013 sophocleous 2000 in this paper the calibrated wetspass m model parameters such as α 1 5 lp 1 a 5 5 mm day i 5 5 mm h and x 0 3 for the omo river basin were adopted from the previous study gelebo et al 2022 to estimate the spatial variation of longtime average annual gwr and runoff fig 4c depicts the spatial distribution of longtime 1990 2020 average annual gwr estimated for the omo river basin it was noted that the yearly spatial variation of gwr in the omo river basin ranges from 0 to 566 3 mm yr with a mean annual value of 80 1 mm yr and confirmed from the previous study gelebo et al 2022 besides the previous studies reported a comparable average annual gwr value of 70 mm yr for the abaya chamo lake basin sharing the eastern boundary of the omo river basin molla et al 2019 and 113 74 mm yr for the upper blue nile river basin sharing northern boundary asmerom 2008 the gwsy is typically defined as the percentage of gwr abstracted safely for supporting optimal crop growth under deficit water by irrigation where the access of available surface water for irrigation is challenging the spatial map of gwsy which shows how much groundwater may be extracted safely without exploiting groundwater resources beyond the limit in regions under water deficit can be used to determine the sustainable groundwater safe yield gebreyohannes et al 2013 the percentage of gwr of 100 least conservative to 10 reasonably conservative was broadly considered for safe yield estimation miles and chambet 1995 the earlier estimate is primarily obsolete and slightly considered sustainable groundwater safe yield the groundwater abstraction should be much lower than gwr for maintaining sustainable surface water and groundwater ecosystems sophocleous 2000 for reasonable conservative estimation gwr of 25 was considered to estimate the daily spatial variation of gwsy gebreyohannes et al 2013 and the same is adopted in this study in eqn 3 1 to express gwsy estimated in m3 day ha the following unit conversion was made gwsy 0 25 gwr 10 3 365 m day 104 m2 ha and mathematically expressed as 3 1 g w s y 6 85 1 0 3 g w r where gwsy is safe yield m3 day ha and gwr is longtime average annual groundwater recharge mm year the spatial variation of gwsy is illustrated through fig 4d and it was found that it ranges from 0 to 4 m3 day ha with a mean value of 0 6 m3 day ha it is interesting to note that forest and cultivation lulc experience maximum gwsy that ranges from 0 4 to 4 m3 day ha these values can be highly related to aquifer type mapped based on observation borehole data fig 4b for instance the western part of the river basin has a high capacity of gwsy ranging from 0 9 to 4 m3 day ha dominated by high productive aquifer capacity 5 28 l s further relating the results of gwr and gwsy for analysing the spatial variation fig 4a b it was observed that regions receiving maximum gwr have a high capacity of gwsy and similar conditions reported by a previous study gebreyohannes et al 2013 3 3 runoff induced topsoil erosion the omo river basin longtime 1990 2020 average annual rainfall erosivity r factor result revealed that the r factor spatially varies from 249 to 1633 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an average annual value of 802 7 mj mm ha 1hr 1yr 1 besides the central and northern regions experience a maximum r factor range from 911 to 1633 mj mm ha 1 h 1 year 1 fig 5 c in place where the river basin receives maximum annual rainfall distribution 1637 2922 mm yr fig 2 these results suggested that spatio temporal variation of r factors depends on rainfall amount distribution of the catchment fenta et al 2021 teng et al 2019 mahala 2018 yan et al 2019 it was found from the result of spatial distribution of k factor that different soil textural classes such as loam sandy clay loam clay loam clay and sandy loam the values range from 0 14 to 0 16 0 09 0 11 0 16 0 18 0 08 0 09 and 0 11 0 14 t ha h ha 1mj 1mm 1 respectively this indicated that the omo river basin experiences maximum k factor values in the clay loam soil types of portions fig 5d the spatial variation of ls factor varies from 0 to 498 7 and indicates that flattened topography in southern regions of river basin experiences minimum ls factor 0 1 while experiences maximum ls factor exceeding 10 in hillslope and valleys regions in the central and northern part of river basin fig 5e from this observation it was found that topographic factors significantly affect soil loss spatial variation the c factor result shows showed that in cultivation and bare land lulc classes the omo river basin experiences maximum c values ranging from 0 06 to 0 4 fig 5f the finding also revealed that in open water bodies the basin experiences a c factor equal to 0 indicating no soil losses and it also found that a maximum c value of 0 4 detected on bare lands table 3 which signifies the regions are highly suspectable for soil erosion and similar conditions observed by the previous study kebede et al 2021 the spatial variation of the p factors results revealed that the omo river basin experiences maximum values ranging from 0 8 to 1 in grassland bushland bareland woodland and forest lulc the p factor in cultivation lands ranges from 0 4 to 0 6 and shows lower ranges relative to non cultivated lands which is possible due to effective conservation practice while the p factors maximum value fig 5g signifies the insufficiency of conservation management practice taye et al 2018 table 6 depicts the rainfall induced longtime average yearly surface soil topsoil loss and surface runoff assessed for each sub basin in the omo river basin the finding revealed that on sub basins located in hillslope terrain in the central and northern part of river basins such as denchiya gibe gilgel gibe irgene mansa soke and zage experiences a maximum average annual soil erosion exceeds 16 5 t ha 1yr 1 that is above country annual soil loss threshold fenta et al 2021 and experiences runoff more than 730 mm yr fig 6 depicts the omo river basin spatial variation of estimated longtime average annual runoff and soil erosion it can be understood from these results that omo river basin experiences an average annual runoff of 819 mm yr and spatially ranges from 104 4 to 2262 38 mm yr besides the result also indicated that the river basin experiences maximum runoff ranging from 1077 61 to 2262 38 mm yr on hillslope regions where maximum annual precipitation occurs especially around the central and northern part of the river basin fig 6b the estimated mean annual runoff of 819 mm yr is nearly comparable to the observed average annual runoff of 908 92 mm yr for the year of 2000 2001 at the guraz diversion headwork streamflow gauging station it was found that the omo river basin s estimated average annual topsoil erosion is 12 36 t ha 1yr 1 and spatially varies from 0 to 2822 t ha 1yr 1 the sediment yield investigation report of swwce in the year 2013 showed that average annual sediment of 13 24 t ha 1yr 1 was transported over kuraz diversion headwork which is situated at the downstream end of the omo river basin therefore the estimated average annual soil erosion 12 36 t ha 1yr 1 can be comparable to the measured sediment flow rate of 13 24 t ha 1yr 1 over kuraze diversion headwork in addition the estimated average annual topsoil is very close to the estimated national level value of 12 t ha 1yr 1 hurni 1988 recently studies reported an average annual soil loss of 16 5 t ha 1 yr 1 at a country level and 22 1 t ha 1yr 1 for the omo river basin fenta et al 2021 and an annual soil loss of 69 t ha 1yr 1 for the lower part of the omo river basin girma and gebre 2020 however the previous studies findings overestimated annual soil loss compared to the observed annual sediment of 13 24 t ha 1yr 1 for the omo river basin the result of spatial variation of longtime average annual surface runoff implies that sub basins such as gojeb mansa tunjo soke guma gilgel gibe deme and alenga are dominated by hillslope topography and experience the maximum runoff and soil erosion exceeding 1000 mm yr and 15 t ha 1yr 1 respectively fig 6 therefore in the omo river basin the topographic factor and rainfall variation highly influence the runoff and soil loss in which similar conditions are reported worldwide qin et al 2018 xu et al 2013 haregeweyn et al 2017 table 7 depicts the omo river basin s soil loss severity ranges coverage conservation priority and risk level assessment of the spatio temporal variation of runoff induced topsoil loss and mapping erosion prone zones in the catchment are vital for planning appropriate swc measures the result revealed that 49 5 23 5 10 9 4 7 and 4 2 of the omo river basin is vulnerable to very low 6 50e 06 t yr low 1 68e 07 t yr moderate 1 82e 07 t yr high 1 42e 07 t yr and very high 4 19e 07 t yr soil loss respectively further the total annual soil loss from the omo river basin was found to be 97 6e 06 t yr 3 4 spatial variation of soil erosion and runoff on influences of gwr at different lulc table 8 presents the results of longtime average annual gwr runoff soil loss and standard deviation sd referencing different lulu the result indicated that the omo river basin experiences maximum soil loss in lulu such as woodland 61 58 t ha 1yr 1 cultivation 30 97 t ha 1yr 1 and bare land 20 96 t ha 1yr 1 while minimum values in urban 0 16 t ha 1yr 1 forest 1 16 t ha 1yr 1 and wetland 0 21 t ha 1yr 1 lulc in aligned with previous studies which reported similar conditions fenta et al 2021 schiettecatte et al 2008 furthermore it is found that lulc such as cultivation forest and grass land in the catchment experiences maximum gwr the condition of experiencing maximum gwr in cultivation area could be possible due to high groundwater development in disturbed soil due to the easiness of soil for deep percolation which results in a pore water pressure rise and shear strength fall and the condition accelerates topsoil loss by surface runoff rockwell 2002 fig 7 depicts groundwater development relation with runoff and soil erosion based on sd referencing different lulc changing trends it can be understood that soil erosion and runoff experiences are inversely related to groundwater development such as gwr fig 7 for instance when undisturbed land bushland changes to cultivated disturbed soil groundwater recharge decreases while runoff and soil erosion show increasing trends fig 7 further the result of spatial variation of average annual gwr surface runoff and surface soil erosion revealed that maximum groundwater development such as gwr experiences in disturbed soils such as cultivation lulc where runoff induced topsoil loss is maximum especially in hillslope regions situated in central and northern parts of the river basin figs 4 and 5 this condition could be possible due to high groundwater development in disturbed soil due to the easiness of soil for deep percolation which results in a pore water pressure rise and shear strength fall and the condition accelerates topsoil loss by surface runoff rockwell 2002 therefore the finding revealed that spatial variation of landuse rainfall topographic slope influence runoff induced soil erosion and gwr spatiotemporal variation the previous studies jillo et al 2017 vafakhah et al 2019 also reported the same conditions for landuse rainfall and topographic slope effect on surface soil erosion the finding also confirms a previous study that reported direct effects of groundwater development on surface soil erosion in unsaturated disturbed soil rockwell 2002 3 5 variation of groundwater development and soil erosion reference different soil texture table 9 depicts the mean variation of gwr gwsy and topsoil loss at different soil textural classes in the omo river basin it is found that loam soil texture experiences maximum soil loss 15 3 t ha yr while minimum soil loss 2 5 t ha yr occurs from sandy clay loam soil texture the condition of maximum soil loss occurs in loam soil texture possibly due to finner soil particles domination and low rock fragment fraction compared to other soil textures in the river basin cerdan et al 2010 torri et al 1997 it is also found that sandy clay loam soil receives high gwr 85 7 mm yr while clay soil experiences minimum gwr 31 5 mm yr the condition of minimum gwr in clay occurs possibly due to low capacity of infiltration rate while maximum capacity of infiltration rate experienced in sandy clay loam gong et al 2012 wang et al 2009 4 conclusion the assessment of spatio temporal variation of groundwater resources development and soil erosion including their relation in large scaled complex river basins is challenging in a large scaled river basin the complexity of topography resulting difficulties in utilizing available surface water resources for irrigation of crops under water deficit besides assessing spatio temporal variation of sustainable groundwater safe yield is an alternative water source for regions fronting difficulty using surface water resources as groundwater resources are readily available and can be easily exploited in this paper the potential of spatial distributed wetspass m model was explored to study the gwr and runoff behavior with a case example of omo river basin the hillslope regions around the central and upper part of the omo river basin receive a high gwr spatial distribution groundwater resources in these portions have a high capacity of groundwater safe yield spatial variations the outcomes of this paper on gwsy and soil erosion spatiotemporal dynamic are more robust and can support planning and implementation of water resources development projects further the cultivation disturbed soil lulc region in the omo river basin experiences high groundwater development such as gwr and gwsy and is also vulnerable to high topsoil rainfall runoff induced surface soil erosion besides the spatio temporal dynamics of rainfall amount groundwater development and topographic slope are dominant factors for spatial variation of sustainable groundwater safe yield and surface soil erosion the omo river basin s estimated average yearly soil loss and surface runoff are 97 6e 06 tonnes 12 35 t ha 1yr 1 and 819 mm respectively the estimated average yearly soil loss and surface runoff are comparable with the measured average yearly sediment rate of 105e 06 tonnes 13 25 t ha 1yr 1 and surface runoff of 908 92 mm yr therefore the study suggests installing trenches or bunds soil and water conservation measures on portions experiencing soil loss stretching from 10 to 50 t ha yr for soil conservation measures can effectively control soil and water loss severity fenta et al 2021 houser and hamilton 2009 kebede et al 2021 taye et al 2018 the overall methods adopted in this paper efficiently estimated spatiotemporal variation of groundwater resources developments such as gwr gwsy and runoff induced soil loss in the large scaled catchment under a high scarcity of hydrological data it can be concluded that the well framed methodology developed in this study could be effectively adopted in any catchment scale with complex hydrological systems and data scarcity worldwide funding arba minch

11813,the sustainable management of water resources plays a significant role in boosting the country s economy mainly in the agriculture sector in many regions globally the availability of surface water resources is limited and thus depends on the groundwater for irrigating crops furthermore soil erosion is a severe problem such as worsened soil fertility land use disturbances and sedimentation especially in large scaled river basins having complex topography therefore assessment of the spatial temporal variation of groundwater development such as groundwater recharge gwr and groundwater safe yield gwsy and their response to topsoil erosion in large scaled river basins are crucial for sustainable groundwater development this paper aims to assess the spatial temporal dynamics of groundwater development in response to runoff induced topsoil loss a large scale east african river basin such as the omo river basin was chosen to demonstrate the proposed modeling approaches the wetspass m physical based hydrological model was used to estimate the longtime average annual gwr and runoff the estimated spatial variation of gwr was used for the analysis of gwsy further combined methods such as the rusle model arcgis tool and remote sensing rs data were used to estimate the spatial variation of annual topsoil erosion the result showed that groundwater resources in cultivation land use in the omo river basin have moderate to high productive aquifers 2 28 l s with maximum gwsy capacity ranging from 0 4 to 4 m3 day ha the estimated long term average annual topsoil erosion is 12 35 t ha 1yr 1 and is comparable with the observed sediment yield of 13 24 t ha 1yr 1 the cultivation regions of the river basin receive maximum gwr and experience moderate to severe topsoil erosion indicating that gwr has a direct response to topsoil erosion in the disturbed soil regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords gwr soil loss erosion prone zone rusle wetspass m omo river basin 1

the agriculture sector under this situation dependence on the groundwater to meet the irrigation demands is vastly increasing awulachew 2019 it is a known fact that exploiting groundwater must ensure the sustainability as a long term source of water maintaining the quality and ecosystem variation equitably gupta and onta 1997 this in fact is important in arid semi arid and sub tropical regions where the crops are exposed to severe water deficit conditions gebreyohannes et al 2013 yenehun et al 2020 sustainable groundwater resources require an understanding of groundwater systems extent distribution and depletion assessment and development of groundwater can be persuaded by water balance methods that balance groundwater abstraction hiscock and bense 2021 hydrological water balance can be used to identify the magnitude of the amount of groundwater that can safely and economically be extracted roscoe and george 1990 water balance provides the direction of the investigation of groundwater resources united states 1977 through investigating the groundwater budget voudouris 2006 the groundwater safe yield gwsy sustainable exploitation and management are quite possible gwsy should be less than groundwater recharge gwr to compensate for the minor decline of groundwater resources fetter 2001 in groundwater management gwsy is defined as the rate at which groundwater can be exploited from aquifers without resulting in undesired conditions dottridge and jaber 1999 heath and spruill 2003 gwsy is a groundwater goal attempt to achieve and maintain a sustainable balance between the annual quantity of groundwater resources and gwr in the catchment jacobs and holway 2004 traditionally gwsy is considered as the condition at which groundwater pumping rate equal with total gwr lin et al 2001 assume that the gwsy is 50 of total natural gwr sustainable groundwater development is primarily determined by groundwater recharge gwr the gwr is defined as the deep percolation of water reaching the water table and subsequently added to the groundwater resources sustainable groundwater development is related to well managed groundwater pumping balanced by the gwr rate known as groundwater safe yield gwsy investigation of spatial temporal variation of gwsy is essential for the regions facing difficulties in accessing surface water resources for crops under deficit irrigation gebreyohannes et al 2013 therefore assessing the spatial temporal of gwr that helps groundwater development is essential for determining the spatial and temporal variation of gwsy bredehoeft 2002 sophocleous 2000 furthermore identifying surface hydrological processes influencing groundwater resources is crucial for planning remedial measures for sustainable groundwater resource development surface hydrological processes such as runoff and surface soil erosion in hydrological systems are significant components possibly influencing groundwater development foster and chilton 2004 therefore assessment of spatial temporal variation of soil erosion and groundwater development relations is vital for the sustainable management of groundwater resources groundwater development such as gwr in virtual increases pore water pressures and decreases soil shear strength which enhances soil erodibility of vadose zone soil rockwell 2002 the high soil water content required for groundwater development entailing deep percolation from rainfall might lead to mass transfers on hillslopes in disturbed soil like cultivation areas only a very few studies reported the investigation relating groundwater development and vadose zone soil erosion at spatial temporal scales on hillslope regions cultivation landuse bryan and rockwell 1998 investigation on relating the spatial temporal variation of groundwater development and soil erosion at the catchment level would be helpful for appropriate planning of soil and water resources conservation measures this is more evident for the watersheds especially in arid semi arid and tropical climate regions where rainfall induced runoff plays a significant role in nutrients soil loss and sediment transportation and entails sustainable management pérez latorre et al 2010 vafakhah et al 2019 another important factor that affects hillslope soil erosion is relatively close hydrological characteristics such as groundwater seepage gws which is shallow groundwater that is exfiltrated at the soil surface huang 1998 in comparison to the free drainage zone the gws zone is restricted along the hillslope often near the bottom zheng et al 2004 the gws has the potential to lower the topsoil cohesive force and thereby increase topsoil erosion howard and mclane iii 1988 dunne et al 1991 the topsoil is unsaturated in a free drainage scenario more precipitation water could permeate into the soil huang et al 2002 however in the gws scenario the soil is saturated and virtually all of the rainwater drains to the surface leading to a rise in erosion huang and laften 1996 zheng et al 2004 additionally under the free drainage condition the type of soil erosion may alter from detachment limited to transport limited under the gws status zheng et al 2000 furthermore the spatial temporal variations of rainfall physiological factors soil land use elevation and slope and environmental indicators play significant roles in groundwater development soil erosion and runoff spatial variation in water resources systems however direct measurement of these factors is impossible for large scaled river basins due to the complexity of physiological conditions and inaccessible areas chen et al 2011 sarangi et al 2006 for the analysis of spatial variation of water balance components such as runoff and gwr several hydrological models such as swat arnold et al 2012 kswat swat model and karst flow model malagò et al 2016 she systeme hydrologique european bathurst 1986 and vic liang et al 1996 have been used in estimating the spatial temporal dynamics of gwr and runoff it may be noted that these models require intensive data and modeling expertise and thus affect broader use worldwide under this condition the wetspass m physical based fully distributed hydrological model has been reported to be an alternate choice that has the capability of estimating the spatial temporal variation of gwr and runoff abdollahi et al 2017 surface runoff is the primary aspect directly related to soil erosion wu et al 2021 the decreasing runoff depth with increasing slope length indicates runoff flow erosivity varies with terrain slope length and thus affects the spatial variation of soil erosion scales besides the spatial variation of runoff significantly varies with rainfall distribution soil type and hillslope surface features further complicate erosion s scaling wu et al 2020 in usle and rusle soil erosion scaling related to runoff is directly determined by the slope angle and shows a direct monotonically trend with slope angle renard 1997 wischmeier and smith 1978 further the runoff scale effect on soil erosion varies significantly with landuse prats et al 2016 therefore relating soil erosion with runoff scale on spatial variation considering all detrimental factors mentioned above should always be considered for appropriate assessment of runoff induced soil erosion effect on hydrological systems surface soil erosion in arid semi arid and tropical regions causes topsoil fertility loss sedimentation of streams water resources decline and flood extremes it is a severe issue in agriculture and water resources projects resulting in a substantial negative impact mekonnen et al 2017 prasad and tiwari 2020 safwan et al 2021 surface soil erosion is anticipated as a primary factor in declining water resources and is currently an alarming issue worldwide esa et al 2018 novara et al 2016 besides surface soil erosion is the dominant factor in land resource worsening in the highland regions yesuph and dagnew 2019 assessment of spatiotemporal variation of soil loss induced by runoff generated rainfall is a milestone for the sustainable development of water resources systems under complex topography and scarcity of measured data currently the revised universal soil loss equation rusle integrating remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis tools that yield precise and low cost soil loss computation has a wide range of applications mukanov 2019 the universal soil loss equation usle model was advanced by wischmeier and meyer 1973 and its modified form is rusle renard 1997 which is adopted worldwide for estimation of longtime average annual soil loss the flexibility fastness and cost effectiveness of the rusle model allow the model to be applicable for watersheds lacking measurable data effectively rusle has limitations in the accuracy of the application over large scaled watersheds chen et al 2011 prasannakumar et al 2011 and overestimates soil erosivity fernández and vega 2016 ostovari et al 2017 therefore to overcome the limitation of the rulse model the combining method of the rusle model gis system and rs data were adopted broadly worldwide for estimation of the mean annual spatial distribution of soil loss gaubi et al 2017 hurni 1985 morgan et al 1984 qin et al 2018 teng et al 2019 wischmeier and smith 1978 zerihun et al 2018 the combined method of rusle rs and gis system considers pixel by pixel basis and efficiently estimates soil loss experiences from any areal catchment extents thapa 2020 xu et al 2013 therefore in this study spatial temporal variation of gwr using the wetspass m model was analyzed and further used to estimate gwsy as the spatial temporal variation of soil erosion is one of the key influencing factors in groundwater development rockwell 2002 different methods such as rusle gis and rs were integrated and used for the estimation of topsoil erosion it is known that the soil textures and lulc catchment characteristics are helpful for investigating the relation between gwr gwsy and soil erosion and the overall spatial temporal variation this study investigated the spatial temporal variation of groundwater development such as gwr and gwsy and their relationship with soil erosion in large scaled catchments under high data scarcity for sustainable development of soil and groundwater resources the following are the specific objectives of the study 1 to analyse the spatial temporal variation of longtime annual gwr and daily gwsy 2 to map aquifer spatial variation based on observed active groundwater borehole aquifer yields and to validate gwsy 3 to analyse longtime spatial temporal variation of annual soil erosion and 4 to establish the relationship between gwr and gwsy with soil erosion for different soil types and lucl changing trends the data collected from large scaled river basin omo in ethiopia east africa under high hydrological data scarcity and complex systems was used to demonstrate the proposed approaches to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first paper that assesses spatial temporal variation of sustainable groundwater development runoff and soil erosion relation by considering critical catchment characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the omo river basin is ethiopia s second largest river basin located in southwest parts of the country and its drainage originates from the high mountain ranges from 3596 m to 334 m masl the omo river basin covers the area of 79 678 km2 and located between 5 00 0 n 9 00 0 n and 34 00 0 e 38 00 0 e fig 1 the river basin consists of thirty sub basins and the principal tributary rivers of the omo river originate from sub basins such as walga wabe rebu and warebessa located in northeast junjo and southwest tunjo gilgel gibe and gojeb sub basin the sub basins in the southern parts such as waybe deme soke and the zage are the primary origin of tributary rivers and the omo river empties into lake turkana on the margin with kenya the omo river basin receives maximum and minimum longtime 1990 2020 average monthly rainfall of 221 mm and 38 mm in july and january respectively gelebo et al 2022 the long term average annual rainfall shows that the omo river basin receives an annual rainfall of 1444 mm yr while experiencing a mean annual temperature of 21 c day and wind speed of 1 24 m s the spatial distribution of longtime average annual rainfall temperature and wind speed range from 458 to 2929 mm yr 15 29 c day and 0 56 2 36 m s respectively the omo river basin receives average annual rainfall from 1640 to 2929 mm yr in its central part while receiving 458 1272 mm yr in its southern regions furthermore the spatial distribution analysis shows that the south part of the river basin experiences a maximum temperature and wind speed ranging from 23 to 29 c day and 1 2 2 36 m s respectively fig 2 2 2 description of data the physiological data of river basin such as lulc soil type topography slope and hydro climate parameters such as rainfall temperature and wind speed are centroid parameters for modeling spatio temporal dynamics of gwr groundwater safe yield surface runoff and soil loss characteristics the omo river basin lulc map of the year 2000 were developed from the modis usgs earth explorer database and lulc of the year 2019 gathered from the ministry of water irrigation and energy mowie ethiopia the lulc of the river basin is classified into twelve classes open water cultivation afro alpine woodland urban plantation bushland forest shrubland marsh bare soil and grassland harmonized world soil database hwsd of 2012 was used to develop a soil map of the river basin fao et al 2012 leenaars et al 2014 according to usda soil classification four soil textural classes sandy loam clay sandy clay loam clay loam and loam dominate the river basin the areal coverage of soil types such as loam clay loam sandy clay loam clay and sandy loam is 68 93 19 32 6 04 4 54 and 1 18 respectively the daily hydro climate data such as rainfall temperature and wind speed for the year of 1990 2020 of 35 weather stations located in the omo river basin was collected from ethiopia national meteorology agency nma the recorded streamflow data of the year 1990 2001 and sediment flow over guraze diversion headwork were collected from south water work and construction enterprise swwce ethiopia all active groundwater borehole gwbh reports for the year 2011 2021 on the river basin were collected from different ethiopia regional offices such as owwce oromia water work and construction enterprise scdse south construction design and supervision enterprise and swwce south water work and construction enterprise and ethiopia federal offices such as mowie ministry of water irrigation and energy and fcdse federal construction and design supervision enterprise topographic data such as a digital elevation model dem 30 arc second were developed from the gtopo30 in the usgs earth explorers database for compatible model simulation all raster input parameters were resampled to an equal cell size of 90 m the details of input data for the models were presented in table 1 2 3 methodology the conceptual framework developed for this study is illustrated in the form of flow chart fig 3 in this section the brief explanation of input data used processes followed methods adopted are presented 2 3 1 water resources assessment wetspass m physical based hydrological models was utilized for estimating the longtime average annual spatial dynamics of rainfall induced groundwater recharge gwr and surface runoff please note that the detailed wetspass m model description and model parameters are described by abdollahi et al 2017 and hence more detail about the model is not presented in this paper the raster input model parameters include longtime 1990 2020 average monthly hydro climate parameters such as temperature wind speed rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet further the catchment physiological parameters such as dem soil types topographic slope and hydro geologic parameters such as groundwater depth are additional raster inputs for the wetspass m model the groundwater depth hydro geologic parameter in the wetspass m model supports delineating seepage flux occurring from wetlands gebreyohannes et al 2013 the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation technique from the spatial analyst tool in the arcgis was used to develop the input raster maps of spatial variation of average monthly hydro climate parameters and hydro geologic groundwater depth the historical streamflow data ranges from 1990 to 2001 and sediment flow over kuraz diversion headwork at the lower of the omo river was used for model performance analysis the wetspass m model has four calibration model parameters such as evaporative efficiency ratio calibration coefficient α calibration parameter depending on soil moisture lp interception threshold parameter a in mm day the longtime average rainfall intensity during wet days considered as an aggregated indicator i in mm hr and runoff day factor x the omo river basin s calibrated wetspass m model parameters were adopted from a previous study gelebo et al 2022 2 3 2 model description wetspass model is a physical based fully distributed hydrological model used for estimating longtime average interannual wbcs such as gwr runoff actual evapotranspiration aet and interception batelaan and de smedt 2007 rwanga 2013 wetspass is abbreviated and read as water energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere in a quasi steady state it is developed using the wetspa time dependent spatial distributed water balance model batelaan et al 1996 batelaan and de smedt 2001 the original wetspass model runs all hydrological processes on a seasonal and annual time step and it is an extension of arcview gis recently the original wespass model was modified to estimate spatiotemporal dynamics of wbcs at a monthly scale and named wetspass m abdollahi et al 2017 it runs alone and can be applied to any area especially in large scale river basins therefore in this paper the wetspass m was preferred to assess spatio temporal variation of gwr and runoff of the omo river basin ethiopia the model computes specific raster output of water balances by adding all vegetated bare soil open water and impervious area components of a raster cell the addition of individual raster cells of wbcs provides for a specific region s total water balance the overall wbcs of a raster cell is mathematically described in eqn 2 1 2 3 2 1 a e t raster a v e t v a s e s a o e o a i e i 2 2 s raster a v s v a s s s a o s o a i s i 2 3 r raster a v r v a s r s a o r o a i r i where aet raster is actual evapotranspiration s raster is total surface runoff r raster is total groundwater recharge and e is evaporation outputs in raster formats each with a vegetated bare soil open water and impervious areas represented by av as ao and ai respectively thus the output wbcs calculations in the westpass m include groundwater recharge actual evapotranspiration surface runoff and an interception in raster and excel format abdollahi et al 2017 2 3 3 soil erosion assessment arcgis and remote sensing rs technologies are technologically advanced systems widely utilized to assess the spatiotemporal distribution of soil erosion elements the arc gis system spatial analyst tools were utilized for the development of raster maps of each component of the rusle model eqn 2 4 and the spatial variation of long term average yearly soil loss of the omo river basin was assessed using a map algebra spatial analyst tool in the arc gis system 2 4 a r k l s c p where a is long term average yearly soil loss t ha yr r is precipitation erosivity mj mm ha 1hr 1yr 1 k is soil erodibility t ha hr ha 1mj 1mm 1 and ls is topographic s is slope gradient c is crop management and p is soil and water conservation practice factors of rusle model components renard 1997 wischmeier and smith 1978 hurni 1985 2 3 4 precipitation runoff erosivity r factor the long term 1990 2020 average annual precipitation data of each 35 weather were analyzed to calculate r factor using eqn 2 5 the r factor is estimated by empirical eqn 2 5 developed by hurni 1985 and widely adopted in ethiopia for calculation of long term average annual r factor and effectively utilized in several portions of the country hurni 1985 esa et al 2018 zerihun et al 2018 fenta et al 2016 tamene et al 2017 choto and fetene 2019 girma and gebre 2020 2 5 r 0 5616 r f 8 1202 where r mj mm ha 1hr 1yr 1 is the precipitation runoff erosivity factor rf mm yr is each weather station s long term average annual precipitation the calculated average annual r values were spatially interpolated by inverse distance weighted idw spatial analyst tool technique in arcgis to develop an r factor raster map the idw technique effectively compensates for missing data as it considers a nearby data station than far away information and is a primarily preferable technique in addition idw techniques showed a more reliable mean square error nistor et al 2020 gebru and tesfahunegn 2020 and can quickly generate robust reliable precipitation runoff erosivity factor r for any catchments scale under scare of hydro climate data jacobs et al 2010 2 3 5 soil erodibility k factor the k factor is the natural resistance of soil to erode by precipitation induced runoff it is different from the actual soil loss due to its primary dependence on precipitation slope crop cover soil textural class characteristics of the catchment k factor values indicate the rate of soil loss per rainfall runoff erosivity r index in this paper k factor were estimated using soil erodability nomograph wischmeier and meyer 1973 wischmeier and smith 1978 in the past this method adopted in ethiopia context and effectively supported implementation of soil conservation systems hurni 1985 the method considers the relationship between estimated soil textural classes organic matter contents soil structure percentage of soil texture and drainage conditions of the river basin table 2 the method estimates the k factor for an area satisfying the condition of a percentage of silt not exceeding 70 wischmeier and meyer 1973 and is preferred in the paper as the omo river basin attains the condition 2 3 6 topographic ls factor the soil loss triggered by precipitation induced runoff in any river basin is susceptible to local topographic factors the ls factor is also called sediment transport index and described as the combination of the effects of slope length l and slope gradient s on soil particle transport renard 1997 the topographic factor ls is estimated using empirical eqn 2 6 developed by wischmeier and smith 1978 and adopted by ganasri and ramesh 2016 this method is very effective in large scaled river basins with a complex topography and is challenging to measure slope length and gradient directly the ls was calculated by eqn 2 6 using dem of river basin as proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 for complex large scaled river basins the dem of 30 m resolution was obtained from the srtm usgs earth explorer database the raster calculator map algebra spatial analyst tool in arcgis system was used for ls analysis using eqn 2 6 2 6 l s q a c g r 22 13 m 0 065 0 0456 s g r 0 06541 s g r 2 where ls is a topographic factor q ac is flow accumulation grid map s gr is slope grid in percent gr 90 m is study area raster map pixel size and m is slope length exponent the m 0 5 for slope greater than 5 m 0 4 for slope equal to 4 and m 0 3 for slope less than or equal to 3 wischmeier and smith 1978 therefore for the omo river basin average slope is 6 and m 0 5 were considered for analysis of the ls factor 2 3 7 land coverage management c factor the c factor reflects the effects of farming and other techniques on erosion rates and it is susceptible to plant growth and precipitation spatiotemporal patterns the c factor values range from 0 to 1 for each lulc of the river basin and a lower c value indicates no loss while a higher value signifies high soil loss low coverage of vegetations in the region the c factor represents the soil loss ratio from land covered by vegetation under quantified conditions to the corresponding soil loss from clean tilled soil the c factor quantifies all interrelated land cover and management practices wischmeier and smith 1978 morgan et al 1984 this paper developed the c factor for the omo river basin using the lulc classes of river basin and immense literature reviews as the detail presented in tabel 3 2 3 8 soil conservation practice p factor the p factor illustrates the effect of soil conservation mechanisms such as building terraces on surface runoff elimination and the severity of soil loss the p factor value ranges from 0 to 1 in which 0 value indicates the presence of a powerful controlling mechanism of soil erosion initiated by anthropogenic activities and 1 signifies no soil conservation mechanisms are available for soil erosion aggravated by anthropogenic activities on the area wischmeier and smith 1978 this paper developed the soil conservation factor p for the omo river basin based on lulc classes and the concrete literature reviews as the detail presented in table 4 3 result and discussion 3 1 omo river basin aquifer the spatial variation of aquifer mapping of omo river basin was developed based on observation of active groundwater boreholes safe yield data with the support of the idw method in the arcgis system nistor et al 2020 the type of aquifer within the river basin scale was classified based on user guidelines of groundwater atlas country of africa hydrogeology maps version 1 1 o dochartaigh 2019 the result showed that the omo river basin is dominated by aquifers with moderate to high production yield ranges from 2 to 20 l s covering around 91 of the river basin and confirming previous reports on hydro geologic mapping of the country kebede et al 2018 the analysis also revealed that moderate productive yield aquifers 2 5 l s cover about 60 of the river basin s total area table 5 the finding indicated that most of the southern north eastern and central eastern parts of the river basin are dominated by moderate yield aquifers the high productive aquifer yield 5 20 l s covers around 31 table 5 of the river basin and mostly dominates the west central west northern and some east southern parts of the river basin fig 4 b according to ethiopian geology hartmann and moosdorf 2012 o dochartaigh 2019 the omo river basin above the central part is dominated by igneous volcanic rock lithology while unconsolidated sedimentary rock lithology dominates the southern part of the river basin fig 4a the igneous volcanic rock is characterized by moderate to high while unconsolidated sedimentary rocks are characterized by low to moderate productive aquifers o dochartaigh 2019 the central and northern part of the river basin is dominated by moderate to high productive aquifer based on observed productive well yield which confirms the lithology characteristics of the river basin fig 4b 3 2 groundwater development groundwater development is mainly controlled by gwr assessment of spatial temporal variation of gwr is critical for assessing groundwater safe yield gwsy for crops under deficit irrigation especially in the region facing the difficulty of accessing surface water resources gebreyohannes et al 2013 sophocleous 2000 in this paper the calibrated wetspass m model parameters such as α 1 5 lp 1 a 5 5 mm day i 5 5 mm h and x 0 3 for the omo river basin were adopted from the previous study gelebo et al 2022 to estimate the spatial variation of longtime average annual gwr and runoff fig 4c depicts the spatial distribution of longtime 1990 2020 average annual gwr estimated for the omo river basin it was noted that the yearly spatial variation of gwr in the omo river basin ranges from 0 to 566 3 mm yr with a mean annual value of 80 1 mm yr and confirmed from the previous study gelebo et al 2022 besides the previous studies reported a comparable average annual gwr value of 70 mm yr for the abaya chamo lake basin sharing the eastern boundary of the omo river basin molla et al 2019 and 113 74 mm yr for the upper blue nile river basin sharing northern boundary asmerom 2008 the gwsy is typically defined as the percentage of gwr abstracted safely for supporting optimal crop growth under deficit water by irrigation where the access of available surface water for irrigation is challenging the spatial map of gwsy which shows how much groundwater may be extracted safely without exploiting groundwater resources beyond the limit in regions under water deficit can be used to determine the sustainable groundwater safe yield gebreyohannes et al 2013 the percentage of gwr of 100 least conservative to 10 reasonably conservative was broadly considered for safe yield estimation miles and chambet 1995 the earlier estimate is primarily obsolete and slightly considered sustainable groundwater safe yield the groundwater abstraction should be much lower than gwr for maintaining sustainable surface water and groundwater ecosystems sophocleous 2000 for reasonable conservative estimation gwr of 25 was considered to estimate the daily spatial variation of gwsy gebreyohannes et al 2013 and the same is adopted in this study in eqn 3 1 to express gwsy estimated in m3 day ha the following unit conversion was made gwsy 0 25 gwr 10 3 365 m day 104 m2 ha and mathematically expressed as 3 1 g w s y 6 85 1 0 3 g w r where gwsy is safe yield m3 day ha and gwr is longtime average annual groundwater recharge mm year the spatial variation of gwsy is illustrated through fig 4d and it was found that it ranges from 0 to 4 m3 day ha with a mean value of 0 6 m3 day ha it is interesting to note that forest and cultivation lulc experience maximum gwsy that ranges from 0 4 to 4 m3 day ha these values can be highly related to aquifer type mapped based on observation borehole data fig 4b for instance the western part of the river basin has a high capacity of gwsy ranging from 0 9 to 4 m3 day ha dominated by high productive aquifer capacity 5 28 l s further relating the results of gwr and gwsy for analysing the spatial variation fig 4a b it was observed that regions receiving maximum gwr have a high capacity of gwsy and similar conditions reported by a previous study gebreyohannes et al 2013 3 3 runoff induced topsoil erosion the omo river basin longtime 1990 2020 average annual rainfall erosivity r factor result revealed that the r factor spatially varies from 249 to 1633 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 with an average annual value of 802 7 mj mm ha 1hr 1yr 1 besides the central and northern regions experience a maximum r factor range from 911 to 1633 mj mm ha 1 h 1 year 1 fig 5 c in place where the river basin receives maximum annual rainfall distribution 1637 2922 mm yr fig 2 these results suggested that spatio temporal variation of r factors depends on rainfall amount distribution of the catchment fenta et al 2021 teng et al 2019 mahala 2018 yan et al 2019 it was found from the result of spatial distribution of k factor that different soil textural classes such as loam sandy clay loam clay loam clay and sandy loam the values range from 0 14 to 0 16 0 09 0 11 0 16 0 18 0 08 0 09 and 0 11 0 14 t ha h ha 1mj 1mm 1 respectively this indicated that the omo river basin experiences maximum k factor values in the clay loam soil types of portions fig 5d the spatial variation of ls factor varies from 0 to 498 7 and indicates that flattened topography in southern regions of river basin experiences minimum ls factor 0 1 while experiences maximum ls factor exceeding 10 in hillslope and valleys regions in the central and northern part of river basin fig 5e from this observation it was found that topographic factors significantly affect soil loss spatial variation the c factor result shows showed that in cultivation and bare land lulc classes the omo river basin experiences maximum c values ranging from 0 06 to 0 4 fig 5f the finding also revealed that in open water bodies the basin experiences a c factor equal to 0 indicating no soil losses and it also found that a maximum c value of 0 4 detected on bare lands table 3 which signifies the regions are highly suspectable for soil erosion and similar conditions observed by the previous study kebede et al 2021 the spatial variation of the p factors results revealed that the omo river basin experiences maximum values ranging from 0 8 to 1 in grassland bushland bareland woodland and forest lulc the p factor in cultivation lands ranges from 0 4 to 0 6 and shows lower ranges relative to non cultivated lands which is possible due to effective conservation practice while the p factors maximum value fig 5g signifies the insufficiency of conservation management practice taye et al 2018 table 6 depicts the rainfall induced longtime average yearly surface soil topsoil loss and surface runoff assessed for each sub basin in the omo river basin the finding revealed that on sub basins located in hillslope terrain in the central and northern part of river basins such as denchiya gibe gilgel gibe irgene mansa soke and zage experiences a maximum average annual soil erosion exceeds 16 5 t ha 1yr 1 that is above country annual soil loss threshold fenta et al 2021 and experiences runoff more than 730 mm yr fig 6 depicts the omo river basin spatial variation of estimated longtime average annual runoff and soil erosion it can be understood from these results that omo river basin experiences an average annual runoff of 819 mm yr and spatially ranges from 104 4 to 2262 38 mm yr besides the result also indicated that the river basin experiences maximum runoff ranging from 1077 61 to 2262 38 mm yr on hillslope regions where maximum annual precipitation occurs especially around the central and northern part of the river basin fig 6b the estimated mean annual runoff of 819 mm yr is nearly comparable to the observed average annual runoff of 908 92 mm yr for the year of 2000 2001 at the guraz diversion headwork streamflow gauging station it was found that the omo river basin s estimated average annual topsoil erosion is 12 36 t ha 1yr 1 and spatially varies from 0 to 2822 t ha 1yr 1 the sediment yield investigation report of swwce in the year 2013 showed that average annual sediment of 13 24 t ha 1yr 1 was transported over kuraz diversion headwork which is situated at the downstream end of the omo river basin therefore the estimated average annual soil erosion 12 36 t ha 1yr 1 can be comparable to the measured sediment flow rate of 13 24 t ha 1yr 1 over kuraze diversion headwork in addition the estimated average annual topsoil is very close to the estimated national level value of 12 t ha 1yr 1 hurni 1988 recently studies reported an average annual soil loss of 16 5 t ha 1 yr 1 at a country level and 22 1 t ha 1yr 1 for the omo river basin fenta et al 2021 and an annual soil loss of 69 t ha 1yr 1 for the lower part of the omo river basin girma and gebre 2020 however the previous studies findings overestimated annual soil loss compared to the observed annual sediment of 13 24 t ha 1yr 1 for the omo river basin the result of spatial variation of longtime average annual surface runoff implies that sub basins such as gojeb mansa tunjo soke guma gilgel gibe deme and alenga are dominated by hillslope topography and experience the maximum runoff and soil erosion exceeding 1000 mm yr and 15 t ha 1yr 1 respectively fig 6 therefore in the omo river basin the topographic factor and rainfall variation highly influence the runoff and soil loss in which similar conditions are reported worldwide qin et al 2018 xu et al 2013 haregeweyn et al 2017 table 7 depicts the omo river basin s soil loss severity ranges coverage conservation priority and risk level assessment of the spatio temporal variation of runoff induced topsoil loss and mapping erosion prone zones in the catchment are vital for planning appropriate swc measures the result revealed that 49 5 23 5 10 9 4 7 and 4 2 of the omo river basin is vulnerable to very low 6 50e 06 t yr low 1 68e 07 t yr moderate 1 82e 07 t yr high 1 42e 07 t yr and very high 4 19e 07 t yr soil loss respectively further the total annual soil loss from the omo river basin was found to be 97 6e 06 t yr 3 4 spatial variation of soil erosion and runoff on influences of gwr at different lulc table 8 presents the results of longtime average annual gwr runoff soil loss and standard deviation sd referencing different lulu the result indicated that the omo river basin experiences maximum soil loss in lulu such as woodland 61 58 t ha 1yr 1 cultivation 30 97 t ha 1yr 1 and bare land 20 96 t ha 1yr 1 while minimum values in urban 0 16 t ha 1yr 1 forest 1 16 t ha 1yr 1 and wetland 0 21 t ha 1yr 1 lulc in aligned with previous studies which reported similar conditions fenta et al 2021 schiettecatte et al 2008 furthermore it is found that lulc such as cultivation forest and grass land in the catchment experiences maximum gwr the condition of experiencing maximum gwr in cultivation area could be possible due to high groundwater development in disturbed soil due to the easiness of soil for deep percolation which results in a pore water pressure rise and shear strength fall and the condition accelerates topsoil loss by surface runoff rockwell 2002 fig 7 depicts groundwater development relation with runoff and soil erosion based on sd referencing different lulc changing trends it can be understood that soil erosion and runoff experiences are inversely related to groundwater development such as gwr fig 7 for instance when undisturbed land bushland changes to cultivated disturbed soil groundwater recharge decreases while runoff and soil erosion show increasing trends fig 7 further the result of spatial variation of average annual gwr surface runoff and surface soil erosion revealed that maximum groundwater development such as gwr experiences in disturbed soils such as cultivation lulc where runoff induced topsoil loss is maximum especially in hillslope regions situated in central and northern parts of the river basin figs 4 and 5 this condition could be possible due to high groundwater development in disturbed soil due to the easiness of soil for deep percolation which results in a pore water pressure rise and shear strength fall and the condition accelerates topsoil loss by surface runoff rockwell 2002 therefore the finding revealed that spatial variation of landuse rainfall topographic slope influence runoff induced soil erosion and gwr spatiotemporal variation the previous studies jillo et al 2017 vafakhah et al 2019 also reported the same conditions for landuse rainfall and topographic slope effect on surface soil erosion the finding also confirms a previous study that reported direct effects of groundwater development on surface soil erosion in unsaturated disturbed soil rockwell 2002 3 5 variation of groundwater development and soil erosion reference different soil texture table 9 depicts the mean variation of gwr gwsy and topsoil loss at different soil textural classes in the omo river basin it is found that loam soil texture experiences maximum soil loss 15 3 t ha yr while minimum soil loss 2 5 t ha yr occurs from sandy clay loam soil texture the condition of maximum soil loss occurs in loam soil texture possibly due to finner soil particles domination and low rock fragment fraction compared to other soil textures in the river basin cerdan et al 2010 torri et al 1997 it is also found that sandy clay loam soil receives high gwr 85 7 mm yr while clay soil experiences minimum gwr 31 5 mm yr the condition of minimum gwr in clay occurs possibly due to low capacity of infiltration rate while maximum capacity of infiltration rate experienced in sandy clay loam gong et al 2012 wang et al 2009 4 conclusion the assessment of spatio temporal variation of groundwater resources development and soil erosion including their relation in large scaled complex river basins is challenging in a large scaled river basin the complexity of topography resulting difficulties in utilizing available surface water resources for irrigation of crops under water deficit besides assessing spatio temporal variation of sustainable groundwater safe yield is an alternative water source for regions fronting difficulty using surface water resources as groundwater resources are readily available and can be easily exploited in this paper the potential of spatial distributed wetspass m model was explored to study the gwr and runoff behavior with a case example of omo river basin the hillslope regions around the central and upper part of the omo river basin receive a high gwr spatial distribution groundwater resources in these portions have a high capacity of groundwater safe yield spatial variations the outcomes of this paper on gwsy and soil erosion spatiotemporal dynamic are more robust and can support planning and implementation of water resources development projects further the cultivation disturbed soil lulc region in the omo river basin experiences high groundwater development such as gwr and gwsy and is also vulnerable to high topsoil rainfall runoff induced surface soil erosion besides the spatio temporal dynamics of rainfall amount groundwater development and topographic slope are dominant factors for spatial variation of sustainable groundwater safe yield and surface soil erosion the omo river basin s estimated average yearly soil loss and surface runoff are 97 6e 06 tonnes 12 35 t ha 1yr 1 and 819 mm respectively the estimated average yearly soil loss and surface runoff are comparable with the measured average yearly sediment rate of 105e 06 tonnes 13 25 t ha 1yr 1 and surface runoff of 908 92 mm yr therefore the study suggests installing trenches or bunds soil and water conservation measures on portions experiencing soil loss stretching from 10 to 50 t ha yr for soil conservation measures can effectively control soil and water loss severity fenta et al 2021 houser and hamilton 2009 kebede et al 2021 taye et al 2018 the overall methods adopted in this paper efficiently estimated spatiotemporal variation of groundwater resources developments such as gwr gwsy and runoff induced soil loss in the large scaled catchment under a high scarcity of hydrological data it can be concluded that the well framed methodology developed in this study could be effectively adopted in any catchment scale with complex hydrological systems and data scarcity worldwide funding arba minch

researchers used above mentioned techniques bera et al 2020 saranya saravanan 2020 xu et al 2021 groundwater management and planning benefited greatly from remote sensing and traditional data sources alikhanov et al 2021 arabameri et al 2019 different multi criteria studies were performed and developed various thematic layers using the rs gis system the pairwise comparison matrix was developed for calculating the weightage for each parameter arunbose et al 2021 the geometric mean and normalized weight of each parameter were examined using the ahp method as stated in the article this comprehensive strategy included a step by step method the methodology flowchart of the study area is given in fig 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 preparation of thematic layers using rs gis there are two sub basins available in the bhavani river basin and it was divided into 46 firkas to identify the groundwater recharge potential zone the different thematic layers are shown below and the influence of groundwater potential was discussed one by one 4 1 1 geology the groundwater flow and the aquifer water storage mainly depend on the underlined rock mondal 2020 muniraj 2019 different type of weathered and massive hard rock formations was found in the bhavani river basin it s mainly occupied by peninsular gneissic complex 1969 10 km2 and charnockite 1709 03 km2 rocks as shown in fig 3 a in the bhavani river basin 46 80 of the area is covered with a peninsular gneissic complex and this rock type is located in the plain topographic southern part of the basin the second most rock type is charnockite it covers 40 62 of the basin and is located in the western part of the basin area like coonoor kundah and bannar hill regions the remaining basin area covered 12 57 of rocks and those rock types have lower infiltration capacity and lack weathering 4 1 2 geomorphology the geomorphology controls the groundwater movement to the impervious layer of the confined and unconfined aquifer system banerjee et al 2021 bhavani river basin covers two major landform features those are 47 99 percent pediment pediplain complex and it is located in the southern part of the study area 2019 19 km2 te another highly dissected hills and valleys type covered 41 52 percent in the northern part of the area 1747 13 km2 shown in fig 3b the gentle slope has a high infiltration rate and it was influenced by the adjacent side of the river channel also it is more helpful to the groundwater storage 4 1 3 land use land cover the land use land cover lulc map provides information about the soil moisture availability infiltration capacity suitable area for groundwater recharge and indication of surface water storage aggarwal et al 2019 goitsemang et al 2020 saravanan saranya 2020 the primary distribution of cropland 1239 22 km2 29 46 covers the eastern portion and some middle portions of the bhavanisagar reservoir are shown in fig 3c the cropland has a gentle slope and more infiltration capacity and it is more suitable for recharging groundwater the western side of the upper bhavani river basin has 21 29 of the plantation covered 895 61 km2 the kundath coonoor and kothagiri areas had higher elevation crops like tea coffee carrot etc the lower bhavani northern side spread deciduous broadleaf forest 13 95 some middle portion of the basin covers built up land 1 97 and the built up land covers hard platform areas because it s having a lower infiltration capacity the lulc map was validated from the actual ground truth analysis randomly 48 sites were selected and validated to the supervised classification image the developed thematic layers result was more relevant to the observed bhavani basin locations 4 1 4 drainage density groundwater recharging to the sub surface zone drainage density plays a major role aykut 2021 bhattacharya et al 2021 drainage density described as the total length of the stream network is divided by the total area of the basin d d l s a 6 where dd drainage density m m2 ls total length of stream m and a area m2 this was calculated using horton s method introduced in 1932 the map value ranges from 0 to 16 km km2 which were shown in fig 3d the north and southern parts of the basin found 0 53 km km2 drainage networks that lower drainage density area has more suitable for groundwater recharge and the areas have infiltration was high in these regions and those areas have more groundwater recharge the middle portion of the basin has a high drainage density network where found the value ranges from 73 to 124 km km2 the higher drainage density areas have low to very low groundwater recharge potential 4 1 5 lineament density the lineament was derived from the linear arrangement of the groundwater movement mainly depending on the porosity and permeability of the rock material kumar et al 2021 it s defined as the total length of lineament in a unit area of the basin l d l l a 7 where ld lineament density m m2 ll total length of lineament m and a area m2 the lineament is more related to geological formations like folds fractures joints and shears are directly related to groundwater recharge potential zones the western part of the study area found more lineament fractures the lineament density was categorized into five classes based on the fracture per unit area the categorized values are very high 77 96 km km2 high 58 76 km km2 moderate 38 57 km km2 low 19 37 km km2 and very low 0 19 km km2 were shown in fig 3e the very low and low category lineament has very minimum groundwater recharge potential further the lineament density was above 57 km km2 having a good porosity and permeability rate and it was directly connected to the groundwater recharge zone areas 4 1 6 slope the higher degree of slope having a short period of runoff will be more and low and leveled topographical land having a minimum slope dar et al 2020 saha et al 2019 the slope ranges in the basin were 0 79 as shown in fig 3f zero indicating leveled land and 79 indicating steep slope areas the western part and some north side of the basin 1212 km2 have the nilgiris mountain available because of the higher slope value of 79 in that area the middle and southern part bhavai basin falls under nearly smooth lands 2022 km2 this land has a gentle slope and is more suitable for infiltrating surface water in this portion of the basin area good groundwater potential was available the slope map was categorized into five classes based on the degree of slope that was very low 2022 km2 low 638 km2 moderate 179 km2 and high 157 km2 and very high slope 1212 km2 4 1 7 elevation the bhavani basin has hilly and flat topographical areas like agricultural lands and domestic areas the elevation was varied from 161 to 2132 m with the southern part and the middle part of the basin having flatlands and some of the north and western sides of the basin having found very steep hills the elevation was directly related to the groundwater recharge potential zone higher elevation areas had a steep slope and the recharge potential was very low kou et al 2016 in the niligiri district most of the area has higher to lower elevation hills the higher elevation was recorded in the kundath region in the nilgiri district and the lower elevation was absorbed on the southern side of the basin the elevation was categorized into five classes which was shown in fig 3g 4 1 8 soil texture based on the soil type the groundwater potential was varying place to place aykut 2021 soil is a media wherein under standard conditions macro and micropores are filled up and further addition of water will add up to the groundwater aquifer in the north and western parts of the basin 32 percent clay covered 1552 km2 is shown in fig 3h the 21 percent of clay loam soil was spread in the middle portion of the basin 782 km2 the fine texture soil has low permeability and low infiltration capacity compared to the coarse texture soil based on the groundwater recharge also decreasing sandy loam 119 km2 and sandy clay loam 728 km2 soil were located in the eastern part of the basin the mixture of sand soil particles has high groundwater potential because the infiltration was rate comparatively high followed by the middle of the basin sand soil 106 km2 was located near the bhavanisagar dam and some of the streams the agriculture areas have loam 313 km2 and fine loam 457 km2 soil covered in the southern part of the bhavani basin 4 1 9 rainfall there is 24 rain gauge station that absorbed a particular year s rainfall distribution were shown in fig 3i the upper bhavai mettupalayam sathaymangalam and nambiyur areas have higher rainfall ranges from 1600 to 2700 mm and those areas are less concentrated in the groundwater recharge potential those areas have very steep slope lands because the infiltration was less runoff will be more the eastern part and middle of the bhavanisagar rain gauge station observed lower rainfall the lower rainfall region has groundwater potential and also lowers those areas that need artificial recharge structures for increasing the groundwater table kouser et al 2022 kumar et al 2021 4 1 10 groundwater level the groundwater was more related to delineating the groundwater potential zone for the bhavani river basin the seasonal rainfall changes directly affect groundwater potential for different parts of the basin chaitanya et al 2021 pande et al 2021 the 96 observation well groundwater was collected from the year 1991 2019 the annual groundwater changes in the study area vary from 2 to 35 m duplicated in fig 3j a higher depth of groundwater level 19 35 m was observed in the southern part of the basin and it s less favorable to gwpz the higher depth of groundwater indicates very low recharge potential availability and the lower depth bgl of groundwater indicates higher recharge potential availability further the lower level of groundwater was observed middle part of the basin as a more suitable site for extracting groundwater for agriculture and other purposes 4 2 analytical hierarchical process ahp saaty 1994 introduced an ahp to identify the groundwater potential zone based on the mathematical system and different thematic layers were prepared to involve the multi criteria decision making mcdm the ahp based pairwise comparison matrix was used to give weightage value for each parameter and priority based individual weightage was given to the sub parameters bera et al 2020 dar et al 2020 saha et al 2019 all the thematic maps were in direct contact with the calculating groundwater potential zones for the study area each parameter was allotted a scale value of 1 9 the value 1 indicated equal importance for all parameters and the value 9 indicated absolute importance for the parameters given in table 1 for applying scale weight for each parameter value is given in table 2 the ahp method was used to calculate the geometric mean value for each parameter the value ranges from 0 to 1 the scale weight was calculated using a sum of total vale for the individual parameters for calculating the geometric mean value pairwise comparison matrix was used and the total scale weight was divided into the number of a parameter used for the identification of the potential zone kou et al 2016 the pairwise comparison was duplicated in table 3 and the geometric equation was shown in eq 1 moakher 2005 adopted the normalized weight method to calculate normalized weight using eq 2 and the equation was derived from assigned weightage for individual parameters divided by the geometric mean of the parameters 1 g e o m e t r i c m e a n t o t a l s c a l e w e i g h t t o t a l n u m b e r o f p a r a m e t e r s 2 n o r m a l i z e d w e i g h t a s s i g n e d w e i g h t o f i n d i v i d u a l p a r a m e t e r g e o m e t r i c m e a n after calculating normalized weight for each thematic layer the weightage was given to the ten parameters through the attribute table using gis software are shown in table 4 further to validate the normalized weight value consistency index and consistency ratio were calculated the consistency ratio value 0 1 indicates the applied scale value used for groundwater potential recharge zone analysis the consistency index and consistency ratio calculating equation were given in eq 3 and 4 3 c i λ m a x n n 1 4 c r c i c r where λ m a x is the sum of individual parameter weightage divided by the geometric mean of the individual parameter n is the number of parameters and the cr value was given in table 5 the computation of the consistency ratio was 0 0059 0 1 and it is shown in table 6 the calculated values are more relevant to the weighting assigned for each parameter the thematic layers were multiplied by the normalized weight value of the individual thematic layer and the geometric mean value of the overall parameter using the raster calculator in the gis system and the equation was given in eq 5 finally multiplied raster layers were combined using the union tool in the arc gis software then the final output map was categorized based on the potential zone availability of the study area 5 g w p z g 1 g 2 g m 1 g m 2 l u l c 1 l u l c 2 d d 1 d d 2 l d 1 l d 2 s l 1 s l 2 s 1 s 2 e 1 e 2 r 1 r 2 g w 1 g w 2 where gwpz indicates groundwater potential zone g geology gm geomorphology lulc land use land cover dd drainage density ld lineament density sl slope s soil e elevation r rainfall and gw grondwwater level further 1 and 2 indicate the rank and weight of each thematic layer further the groundwater potential zone was categorized based on the map value there are 46 firka available in the both upper and lower bhavani basin based on the availability of groundwater data was compared to pwd data and the firka were categorized into safe semi critical critical and overexploited 4 3 3 identification of groundwater potential zones gwpz there are ten thematic maps were prepared to identify the recharge potential for the study area the more depth of soil layer with high permeability and agricultural land with moderate slope areas having suitable for groundwater recharge dhayachandhran jothilakshmi 2020 kadam et al 2021 rawat et al 2018 a very high potential was observed in the middle part of the study area 1599 km2 and it covered 38 of the study area the high potential zones were absorbed southwest northwest and west side of the basin covering an area of 1430 km2 34 further the moderate zone was identified as northeast northwest and some portion of the southwest side some patches were identified and the covering basin area of 547 km2 13 a low potential zone was observed western part of the hillside and some portion of the northwest side coverage area of 421 km2 10 finally a very low groundwater potential was observed western part of the hillside and some small patches were found northern hilly side of the basin a coverage area of 210 km2 5 are shown in fig 4 nearly 71 of the basin area falls under high and very high groundwater recharge potential zone as shown in table 7 the remaining 29 of the areas have low groundwater recharge potential zones the groundwater draft was reduced and feature extraction of groundwater using open tube well for agriculture purposes 4 4 comparison of firka wise groundwater categorization for bhavani river basin the bhavani basin was categorized into 46 firkas under this 19 firkas were upper basin and 27 firkas fell under the lower basin as shown in fig 3k the bhavani river basin is divided into two sub basin upper bhavani basin and lower bhavani basin as duplicated in fig 3l based on the 2011 2020 pwd public work department the groundwater was categorized into five classes that were safe semicritical critical overexploited and saline under the 2020 classification bhavani basin 11 firkas fell under the safe zone and followed by 10 firkas that were semi critical and 22 firkas were overexploited the remaining 3 firkas were reserved forest 2 firka and bhavanisagar reservoir 1 firka as shown in table 8 and graphically represented in fig 5 further pwd has assessed in the 2011 assessment that 14 firkas fell the safe zone and only 12 firkas fell overexploited zones the groundwater potential was decreased compared to the previous report published by the in the potential recharge map compared to the firka wise categorization map the overexploited areas have good recharge potential because the groundwater also raises continuously with the regular pumping of groundwater the firkas were going safe to over exploited zones the high and very high potential zone areas fell under critical and over exploited zones the overall finding was firka wise groundwater resource assessment of the bhavani river basin gives a more relevant result to the identified groundwater potential zone 4 5 validation of groundwater level there are 97 observation wells and 42 years of data collected for the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods the coefficient of determination r2 value was determined for the random well groundwater level was duplicated in fig 6 the observed data indicates that pre monsoon has a lower groundwater level compared to the post monsoon groundwater level the identified groundwater potential zone compare to the observed groundwater level the result was more relevant to the gis based identified potential zone the post monsoon has more northeast monsoon rainfall in the study area and the groundwater level also increases dueto recharge the calculated r2 value for pre and post monsoon was 0 90 and 0 83 overall the gwpz was more useful for planning water management practices in the feature development 5 conclusions previously the bhavani river basin had safe conditions in most of the areas and the depletion of groundwater mostly affects agriculture domestic industries etc with the recent decads increasing seasonal rainfall the recharge of groundwater level also increasing at the same time extraction of groundwater increasing from the gwpz map the east and middle portions of the bhavani basin had very good gwpz 38 and more extraction of groundwater the areas were over exploited the western part of the basin has a more hilly region because of that the groundwater potential is very low 5 further the basin was divided into a small unit of 46 firkas the groundwater potential zone was compared with the pwd groundwater categorization data for 2011 and 2020 from the firka wise assessment one firkas are improved 14 firkas have deteriorated and 28 firkas are in the same condition for validating the groundwater level pre and post monsoon groundwater data was collected and validated the validated result also gives acceptable results this research output gives the bhavani basin potential recharge zone were more helpful to the increasing groundwater table the groundwater is used by farmers to cultivate the land the domestic purpose for drinking for groundwater extraction industries geoscience researchers agricultural engineers to construct recharge structures and decision makers for efficient water resources

important drinking characteristics for all living things and water plays an important role in the growth of numerous industrial sectors saranya saravanan 2020 according to fao 2009 26 of the world s renewable freshwater resource remains as groundwater the national commission for integrated water resources development nciwrd reported that the average annual per capita water availability in 2001 was 1816 m3 and this availability is expected to drop to 1367 m3 by 2031 the central groundwater board cgwb estimated in april 2015 that the annual water resource potential was 1869 billion cubic meters bcm however india s useable water resources are estimated to be at 1123 bcm year the shares of surface water and groundwater respectively are 690 bcm year and 433 bcm year setting aside 35 bcm for natural discharge the net annual groundwater availability for the entire country is 398 bcm central groundwater board cgwb 2017 assessed 6584 units in the year 2013 across the country and found 4520 to be safe 681 to be semi critical 253 to be critical and 1034 to be overexploited and 96 blocks were saline earlier the identification of gwpz was carried out by ground surveys which is a time consuming and laborious method saravanan et al 2020 recent technology like remote sensing and geographical information system rs gis is a more powerful tool that provides accurate results compared with other methods a et al 2017 rehman et al 2019 aggarwal et al 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 through arc gis 10 3 software was used to develop different thematic layers for the study area the input parameters are land use land cover geology geomorphology lineaments drainage density soil rainfall groundwater elevation and slope these parameters serve either as a direct or indirect influence on the range of groundwater recharge saravanan et al 2020 saravanan saranya 2020 these parameters define the geological formation and hydrological properties of soil underground the suitable weight and rank assigned for each parameter are based on multi criteria decision analysis mcda methods and summed up to obtain a potential zone kolandhavel ramamoorthy 2019 roy et al 2020 further the basin groundwater zones are compared with firka wise assessment areas here the firka or revenue circles are the local revenue sub divisions of the various districts in the states of india numerous methods were adopted to delineate the gwpz including geospatial techniques the gwpz identification was determined using the methods such as multi influencing factors mif bhattacharya et al 2021 khan et al

groundwater level 42 years data were collected from state ground and surface water resources data centre chennai 3 methodology to discover the proper groundwater zones for the different study areas researchers used above mentioned techniques bera et al 2020 saranya saravanan 2020 xu et al 2021 groundwater management and planning benefited greatly from remote sensing and traditional data sources alikhanov et al 2021 arabameri et al 2019 different multi criteria studies were performed and developed various thematic layers using the rs gis system the pairwise comparison matrix was developed for calculating the weightage for each parameter arunbose et al 2021 the geometric mean and normalized weight of each parameter were examined using the ahp method as stated in the article this comprehensive strategy included a step by step method the methodology flowchart of the study area is given in fig 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 preparation of thematic layers using rs gis there are two sub basins available in the bhavani river basin and it was divided into 46 firkas to identify the groundwater recharge potential zone the different thematic layers are shown below and the influence of groundwater potential was discussed one by one 4 1 1 geology the groundwater flow and the aquifer water storage mainly depend on the underlined rock mondal 2020 muniraj 2019 different type of weathered and massive hard rock formations was found in the bhavani river basin it s mainly occupied by peninsular gneissic complex 1969 10 km2 and charnockite 1709 03 km2 rocks as shown in fig 3 a in the bhavani river basin 46 80 of the area is covered with a peninsular gneissic complex and this rock type is located in the plain topographic southern part of the basin the second most rock type is charnockite it covers 40 62 of the basin and is located in the western part of the basin area like coonoor kundah and bannar hill regions the remaining basin area covered 12 57 of rocks and those rock types have lower infiltration capacity and lack weathering 4 1 2 geomorphology the geomorphology controls the groundwater movement to the impervious layer of the confined and unconfined aquifer system banerjee et al 2021 bhavani river basin covers two major landform features those are 47 99 percent pediment pediplain complex and it is located in the southern part of the study area 2019 19 km2 te another highly dissected hills and valleys type covered 41 52 percent in the northern part of the area 1747 13 km2 shown in fig 3b the gentle slope has a high infiltration rate and it was influenced by the adjacent side of the river channel also it is more helpful to the groundwater storage 4 1 3 land use land cover the land use land cover lulc map provides information about the soil moisture availability infiltration capacity suitable area for groundwater recharge and indication of surface water storage aggarwal et al 2019 goitsemang et al 2020 saravanan saranya 2020 the primary distribution of cropland 1239 22 km2 29 46 covers the eastern portion and some middle portions of the bhavanisagar reservoir are shown in fig 3c the cropland has a gentle slope and more infiltration capacity and it is more suitable for recharging groundwater the western side of the upper bhavani river basin has 21 29 of the plantation covered 895 61 km2 the kundath coonoor and kothagiri areas had higher elevation crops like tea coffee carrot etc the lower bhavani northern side spread deciduous broadleaf forest 13 95 some middle portion of the basin covers built up land 1 97 and the built up land covers hard platform areas because it s having a lower infiltration capacity the lulc map was validated from the actual ground truth analysis randomly 48 sites were selected and validated to the supervised classification image the developed thematic layers result was more relevant to the observed bhavani basin locations 4 1 4 drainage density groundwater recharging to the sub surface zone drainage density plays a major role aykut 2021 bhattacharya et al 2021 drainage density described as the total length of the stream network is divided by the total area of the basin d d l s a 6 where dd drainage density m m2 ls total length of stream m and a area m2 this was calculated using horton s method introduced in 1932 the map value ranges from 0 to 16 km km2 which were shown in fig 3d the north and southern parts of the basin found 0 53 km km2 drainage networks that lower drainage density area has more suitable for groundwater recharge and the areas have infiltration was high in these regions and those areas have more groundwater recharge the middle portion of the basin has a high drainage density network where found the value ranges from 73 to 124 km km2 the higher drainage density areas have low to very low groundwater recharge potential 4 1 5 lineament density the lineament was derived from the linear arrangement of the groundwater movement mainly depending on the porosity and permeability of the rock material kumar et al 2021 it s defined as the total length of lineament in a unit area of the basin l d l l a 7 where ld lineament density m m2 ll total length of lineament m and a area m2 the lineament is more related to geological formations like folds fractures joints and shears are directly related to groundwater recharge potential zones the western part of the study area found more lineament fractures the lineament density was categorized into five classes based on the fracture per unit area the categorized values are very high 77 96 km km2 high 58 76 km km2 moderate 38 57 km km2 low 19 37 km km2 and very low 0 19 km km2 were shown in fig 3e the very low and low category lineament has very minimum groundwater recharge potential further the lineament density was above 57 km km2 having a good porosity and permeability rate and it was directly connected to the groundwater recharge zone areas 4 1 6 slope the higher degree of slope having a short period of runoff will be more and low and leveled topographical land having a minimum slope dar et al 2020 saha et al 2019 the slope ranges in the basin were 0 79 as shown in fig 3f zero indicating leveled land and 79 indicating steep slope areas the western part and some north side of the basin 1212 km2 have the nilgiris mountain available because of the higher slope value of 79 in that area the middle and southern part bhavai basin falls under nearly smooth lands 2022 km2 this land has a gentle slope and is more suitable for infiltrating surface water in this portion of the basin area good groundwater potential was available the slope map was categorized into five classes based on the degree of slope that was very low 2022 km2 low 638 km2 moderate 179 km2 and high 157 km2 and very high slope 1212 km2 4 1 7 elevation the bhavani basin has hilly and flat topographical areas like agricultural lands and domestic areas the elevation was varied from 161 to 2132 m with the southern part and the middle part of the basin having flatlands and some of the north and western sides of the basin having found very steep hills the elevation was directly related to the groundwater recharge potential zone higher elevation areas had a steep slope and the recharge potential was very low kou et al 2016 in the niligiri district most of the area has higher to lower elevation hills the higher elevation was recorded in the kundath region in the nilgiri district and the lower elevation was absorbed on the southern side of the basin the elevation was categorized into five classes which was shown in fig 3g 4 1 8 soil texture based on the soil type the groundwater potential was varying place to place aykut 2021 soil is a media wherein under standard conditions macro and micropores are filled up and further addition of water will add up to the groundwater aquifer in the north and western parts of the basin 32 percent clay covered 1552 km2 is shown in fig 3h the 21 percent of clay loam soil was spread in the middle portion of the basin 782 km2 the fine texture soil has low permeability and low infiltration capacity compared to the coarse texture soil based on the groundwater recharge also decreasing sandy loam 119 km2 and sandy clay loam 728 km2 soil were located in the eastern part of the basin the mixture of sand soil particles has high groundwater potential because the infiltration was rate comparatively high followed by the middle of the basin sand soil 106 km2 was located near the bhavanisagar dam and some of the streams the agriculture areas have loam 313 km2 and fine loam 457 km2 soil covered in the southern part of the bhavani basin 4 1 9 rainfall there is 24 rain gauge station that absorbed a particular year s rainfall distribution were shown in fig 3i the upper bhavai mettupalayam sathaymangalam and nambiyur areas have higher rainfall ranges from 1600 to 2700 mm and those areas are less concentrated in the groundwater recharge potential those areas have very steep slope lands because the infiltration was less runoff will be more the eastern part and middle of the bhavanisagar rain gauge station observed lower rainfall the lower rainfall region has groundwater potential and also lowers those areas that need artificial recharge structures for increasing the groundwater table kouser et al 2022 kumar et al 2021 4 1 10 groundwater level the groundwater was more related to delineating the groundwater potential zone for the bhavani river basin the seasonal rainfall changes directly affect groundwater potential for different parts of the basin chaitanya et al 2021 pande et al 2021 the 96 observation well groundwater was collected from the year 1991 2019 the annual groundwater changes in the study area vary from 2 to 35 m duplicated in fig 3j a higher depth of groundwater level 19 35 m was observed in the southern part of the basin and it s less favorable to gwpz the higher depth of groundwater indicates very low recharge potential availability and the lower depth bgl of groundwater indicates higher recharge potential availability further the lower level of groundwater was observed middle part of the basin as a more suitable site for extracting groundwater for agriculture and other purposes 4 2 analytical hierarchical process ahp saaty 1994 introduced an ahp to identify the groundwater potential zone based on the mathematical system and different thematic layers were prepared to involve the multi criteria decision making mcdm the ahp based pairwise comparison matrix was used to give weightage value for each parameter and priority based individual weightage was given to the sub parameters bera et al 2020 dar et al 2020 saha et al 2019 all the thematic maps were in direct contact with the calculating groundwater potential zones for the study area each parameter was allotted a scale value of 1 9 the value 1 indicated equal importance for all parameters and the value 9 indicated absolute importance for the parameters given in table 1 for applying scale weight for each parameter value is given in table 2 the ahp method was used to calculate the geometric mean value for each parameter the value ranges from 0 to 1 the scale weight was calculated using a sum of total vale for the individual parameters for calculating the geometric mean value pairwise comparison matrix was used and the total scale weight was divided into the number of a parameter used for the identification of the potential zone kou et al 2016 the pairwise comparison was duplicated in table 3 and the geometric equation was shown in eq 1 moakher 2005 adopted the normalized weight method to calculate normalized weight using eq 2 and the equation was derived from assigned weightage for individual parameters divided by the geometric mean of the parameters 1 g e o m e t r i c m e a n t o t a l s c a l e w e i g h t t o t a l n u m b e r o f p a r a m e t e r s 2 n o r m a l i z e d w e i g h t a s s i g n e d w e i g h t o f i n d i v i d u a l p a r a m e t e r g e o m e t r i c m e a n after calculating normalized weight for each thematic layer the weightage was given to the ten parameters through the attribute table using gis software are shown in table 4 further to validate the normalized weight value consistency index and consistency ratio were calculated the consistency ratio value 0 1 indicates the applied scale value used for groundwater potential recharge zone analysis the consistency index and consistency ratio calculating equation were given in eq 3 and 4 3 c i λ m a x n n 1 4 c r c i c r where λ m a x is the sum of individual parameter weightage divided by the geometric mean of the individual parameter n is the number of parameters and the cr value was given in table 5 the computation of the consistency ratio was 0 0059 0 1 and it is shown in table 6 the calculated values are more relevant to the weighting assigned for each parameter the thematic layers were multiplied by the normalized weight value of the individual thematic layer and the geometric mean value of the overall parameter using the raster calculator in the gis system and the equation was given in eq 5 finally multiplied raster layers were combined using the union tool in the arc gis software then the final output map was categorized based on the potential zone availability of the study area 5 g w p z g 1 g 2 g m 1 g m 2 l u l c 1 l u l c 2 d d 1 d d 2 l d 1 l d 2 s l 1 s l 2 s 1 s 2 e 1 e 2 r 1 r 2 g w 1 g w 2 where gwpz indicates groundwater potential zone g geology gm geomorphology lulc land use land cover dd drainage density ld lineament density sl slope s soil e elevation r rainfall and gw grondwwater level further 1 and 2 indicate the rank and weight of each thematic layer further the groundwater potential zone was categorized based on the map value there are 46 firka available in the both upper and lower bhavani basin based on the availability of groundwater data was compared to pwd data and the firka were categorized into safe semi critical critical and overexploited 4 3 3 identification of groundwater potential zones gwpz there are ten thematic maps were prepared to identify the recharge potential for the study area the more depth of soil layer with high permeability and agricultural land with moderate slope areas having suitable for groundwater recharge dhayachandhran jothilakshmi 2020 kadam et al 2021 rawat et al 2018 a very high potential was observed in the middle part of the study area 1599 km2 and it covered 38 of the study area the high potential zones were absorbed southwest northwest and west side of the basin covering an area of 1430 km2 34 further the moderate zone was identified as northeast northwest and some portion of the southwest side some patches were identified and the covering basin area of 547 km2 13 a low potential zone was observed western part of the hillside and some portion of the northwest side coverage area of 421 km2 10 finally a very low groundwater potential was observed western part of the hillside and some small patches were found northern hilly side of the basin a coverage area of 210 km2 5 are shown in fig 4 nearly 71 of the basin area falls under high and very high groundwater recharge potential zone as shown in table 7 the remaining 29 of the areas have low groundwater recharge potential zones the groundwater draft was reduced and feature extraction of groundwater using open tube well for agriculture purposes 4 4 comparison of firka wise groundwater categorization for bhavani river basin the bhavani basin was categorized into 46 firkas under this 19 firkas were upper basin and 27 firkas fell under the lower basin as shown in fig 3k the bhavani river basin is divided into two sub basin upper bhavani basin and lower bhavani basin as duplicated in fig 3l based on the 2011 2020 pwd public work department the groundwater was categorized into five classes that were safe semicritical critical overexploited and saline under the 2020 classification bhavani basin 11 firkas fell under the safe zone and followed by 10 firkas that were semi critical and 22 firkas were overexploited the remaining 3 firkas were reserved forest 2 firka and bhavanisagar reservoir 1 firka as shown in table 8 and graphically represented in fig 5 further pwd has assessed in the 2011 assessment that 14 firkas fell the safe zone and only 12 firkas fell overexploited zones the groundwater potential was decreased compared to the previous report published by the in the potential recharge map compared to the firka wise categorization map the overexploited areas have good recharge potential because the groundwater also raises continuously with the regular pumping of groundwater the firkas were going safe to over exploited zones the high and very high potential zone areas fell under critical and over exploited zones the overall finding was firka wise groundwater resource assessment of the bhavani river basin gives a more relevant result to the identified groundwater potential zone 4 5 validation of groundwater level there are 97 observation wells and 42 years of data collected for the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods the coefficient of determination r2 value was determined for the random well groundwater level was duplicated in fig 6 the observed data indicates that pre monsoon has a lower groundwater level compared to the post monsoon groundwater level the identified groundwater potential zone compare to the observed groundwater level the result was more relevant to the gis based identified potential zone the post monsoon has more northeast monsoon rainfall in the study area and the groundwater level also increases dueto recharge the calculated r2 value for pre and post monsoon was 0 90 and 0 83 overall the gwpz was more useful for planning water management practices in the feature development 5 conclusions previously the bhavani river basin had safe conditions in most of the areas and the depletion of groundwater mostly affects agriculture domestic industries etc with the recent decads increasing seasonal rainfall the recharge of groundwater level also increasing at the same time extraction of groundwater increasing from the gwpz map the east and middle portions of the bhavani basin had very good gwpz 38 and more extraction of groundwater the areas were over exploited the western part of the basin has a more hilly region because of that the groundwater potential is very low 5 further the basin was divided into a small unit of 46 firkas the groundwater potential zone was compared with the pwd groundwater categorization data for 2011 and 2020 from the firka wise assessment one firkas are improved 14 firkas have deteriorated and 28 firkas are in the same condition for validating the groundwater level pre and post monsoon groundwater data was collected and validated the validated result also gives acceptable results this research output gives the bhavani basin potential recharge zone were more helpful to the increasing groundwater table the groundwater is used by farmers to cultivate the land the domestic purpose for drinking for groundwater extraction industries geoscience researchers agricultural engineers to construct recharge structures and decision makers for efficient water resources
