1420,in this research a dual randomness bi level interval multi objective programming dr bimp model was developed for supporting water resources management among multiple water sectors under complexities and uncertainties techniques of bi level multi objective programming bmop double sided stochastic chance constrained programming dsccp and interval parameter programming ipp were incorporated into an integrated modeling framework to achieve comprehensive consideration of the complexities and uncertainties of water resources management systems the dr bimp model can not only effectively deal with the interactive effects between multiple decision makers in complex water management systems through the bi level hierarchical strategies but also can characterize the multiple uncertainties information expressed as interval format and probability density functions it could thus improve upon the existing bi level multi objective programming through addressing discrete interval parameters and dual randomness problems in optimization processes simultaneously then the developed model was applied to a real world case to optimally allocate water resources among three different water sectors in five sub regions in the dongjiang river basin south china the results of the model include determining values interval values and stochastic distribution information which can assist bi level decision makers to plan future resources effectively to some extent after comparing the variations of results it is found that an increasing probability level can lead to higher system benefits which is increased from 20 786 00 26 425 92 108 cny to 22 290 84 27 492 57 108 cny while the gini value is reduced from 0 365 0 446 to 0 345 0 405 a set of increased probability levels gives rise to the lower level objectives furthermore the advantages of the dr bimp model were highlighted by comparing with the other models originated from the developed model the comparison results indicated that the dr bimp model was a valuable tool for generating a range of decision alternatives and thus assists the bi level decision makers to identify the desired water resources allocation

chance constrained programming interval parameter programming 1 introduction the management of water resources is a worldwide issue due to increasing water demands and shrinking water availability in many areas across the world li et al 2018a loucks et al 2005 due to the combined effects of population growth socio economic development and changing consumption patterns global water use has been increasing by approximately 1 per year since the 1980s wwap 2019 the worldwide water demand is expected to continue increasing at a similar rate until 2050 accounting for an increase of 20 to 30 above the current amount of water use wwap 2019 this is causing a potential water shortage in many areas obviously the scarcity of water resources and the increasing competition among multiple water users have highlighted the importance of water allocation in river basins with the booming economy intensive industrialization and dense population much research was thus conducted to generate water allocation schemes abdulbaki et al 2017 al jawad et al 2019 lalehzari et al 2016 martinsen et al 2019 milan et al 2018 mortada et al 2018 ye et al 2018 due to the existing complexities and uncertainties of water resource systems water resource managers are always plagued by serious challenges tan et al 2017 for instance dual randomness might exist for both water availability and water related events which were induced by the randomness of the hydrologic cycle and merely reflected by conventional studies moreover multiple objectives may be associated with water resource utilization due to potential interest conflicts of multi level decision makers and pure consumers those extreme complexities are arising in many water management practical problems calling for comprehensive and advanced methods therefore it is desired to develop advanced tools for supporting water resources management with the consideration of such dual randomness and multiple objectiveness previously many inexact optimization techniques have been presented to deal with uncertainties of water resources management gurav and regulwar 2012 khosrojerdi et al 2018 nikoo et al 2012 ren et al 2017 wang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 according to the published literature the frequent mathematical programming methods can be divided into three categories i e stochastic mathematical programming smp interval parameter programming ipp and fuzzy mathematical programming fmp method among them as one of an effective smp technology the stochastic chance constrained programming sccp method was frequently employed to deal with stochastic uncertainty which was proposed by charnes and cooper 1959 initially practically the sccp method could represent the stochastic parameters through probability density functions pdfs and more crucial is that the sccp method has the advantage in effectively providing mutual information regarding the level of violated risk between the objective function and the constraint nevertheless the traditional sccp technology was usually used to deal with the randomness parameters existing on the right hand side of system constraints for instance xu et al 2012 developed an interval parameter stochastic chance constrained programming model for an urban water supply system a two stage chance constrained fractional programming method was put forward by zhou et al 2015 for dealing with water quality management problems associated with stochastic inputs li et al 2019 developed a stochastic multi objective non linear programming model for identifying the sustainable irrigation schemes that water availability as a stochastic uncertainty parameter exists in the right hand side of constraints however the stochastic uncertainty might exist on both the left and right hand sides of the system constraints in real world cases the double sided stochastic chance constrained programming dsccp method was established by liu 2009 to solve such problems effectively recently zhang et al 2018 adopted dsccp to deal with the problem of optimal irrigation water resources management although dsccp can be used as an effective stochastic method to deal with double sided stochastic uncertainties for problems in water resources management processing it requires sufficient parameter information which leads to the difficulty that the collected data may not have enough information to accurately generate the probability density function of relevant parameters interval parameter programming ipp can be used as an alternative method which merely needs the upper and lower boundaries of known parameters to adequately represent the uncertainty dai et al 2012 xie et al 2013 based on the above analysis the couple of dsccp and ipp methods can effectively account for dual randomness and interval uncertainty for instance ji et al 2015 developed an inexact double hand side chance constrained programming idccp method for nonpoint source water quality management within an agricultural system zhang et al 2019a developed an inexact joint probabilistic double sided stochastic chance constrained programming ijdsccp model for sustainable water resources planning and pollution control on the other hand water resource allocation systems frequently depend on various independent aspects such as economic social and natural that may conflict with each other li et al 2018b such water resource allocation issues can be addressed through the multi objective programming mop method over the past decades many scholars have applied multi objective programming methods for the management of water resource systems for example amini fasakhodi et al 2010 proposed a multi objective fractional goal programming that considers the water resources sustainability in the cropping pattern planning zarghami 2010 proposed a fuzzy probabilistic multi objective decision making model for efficient urban water management to design optimum water supply and demand patterns habibi davijani et al 2016 presented a two objective socio economic model for the optimum allocation of water resources to industry agriculture and municipal water sectors zhang et al 2019b developed an interval multi objective approach for helping irrigation water managers solve the multi objective problem under interval uncertainty in the process of allocating limited irrigation water although many previous studies have been effective in coordinating water supply and demand issues and dealing with uncertainties there are still deficiencies tan and zhang 2018 for real world water management problems the water allocation decision making process is complicated it s not just a multi objective collaborative process this usually involves multi level decision makers e g the river basin authority and administrative managers meanwhile different decision makers may be inclined to multiple different objectives the river basin authority as the upper decision maker whose aim is to plan an allocation strategy from a macroscopic perspective to gain the best benefits and equity of the system while the lower level managers were to gain more economic profits for themselves additionally each level of decision makers may have multiple conflicting objectives in the decision making process which makes this decision problem more complicated nevertheless most of the previous allocation models seldom consider the hierarchical structure of water resources management which oversimplified the hierarchical structure characterize in response to these problems the bi level multi objective programming bmop model can be proposed to reflect the hierarchical structure and considering multi objectives that existed in each level simultaneously ahmad et al 2018 wang et al 2019 although bmop can make the tradeoff between two level decision makers it can hardly deal with the issues of dual randomness and the parameters represent an interval form in the model unfortunately few researchers handled the integrated interval dual randomness issues with bmop models and few applications to water resources management have been reported therefore the objective of this research is to develop an innovative method to address bi level decision makers optimization problems under the circumstance of interval dual randomness uncertainties in the constraints which could comprehensively consideration the complexities and uncertainties of the water resources management system the innovative model is developed by incorporating bmop dsccp and ipp into a comprehensive modeling framework formulate a dual randomness bi level interval multi objective programming model namely dr bimp the dr bimp model has the following characteristics a it can effectively deal with the interaction effects between multiple decision makers in complex water management systems through the bi level hierarchical strategies b it can characterize the interval dual randomness uncertain information expressed as interval format and probability density functions c it can provide desired water resources allocation schemes under different constraints violated probability levels to illustrate the applicability of the developed model it will be applied to a real world case study to optimally allocate available water resources among multiple water use sectors in the dongjiang river basin south china the optimal solutions obtained can assist the relevant decision makers to identify the desired best water resources allocation schemes to alleviate the supply demand contradiction in the basin 2 methodology in particular there is a concern not be solved which still existing many uncertain problems for decision makers in real world water resources system including 1 the water availability is affected by randomness natural precipitation and streamflow 2 the economic parameters e g water use benefit and recourse cost and the technical parameters e g leakage coefficient of the model are affected by market economy fluctuation and technical quality 3 lacking and inaccurate data of the collection process will inevitably bring uncertainty those uncertainties have a significant impact on the effectiveness of management decisions tan et al 2016 2017 if those uncertainties were transformed into the deterministic type oversimply the results might be inaccurate and resulting in the aggravation of the system risk hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to introduce advanced optimal methods and establish a corresponding integrated water management model to effectively deal with multiple uncertainties in the water resources management system 2 1 development of interval double sided stochastic chance constrained programming for a general linear programming model it is not equipped to deal with uncertain problems especially the uncertain parameters exist on both the left hand and right hand sides of the system constraints e g these parameters are independent randomness variables that obey normal distributions and the interval numbers also existing in the model thus through coupling double sided stochastic chance constrained programming dsccp with interval parameter programming ipp into an integrated modeling framework to comprehensively considering the interval dual randomness problems an interval double sided stochastic chance constrained programming idsccp model can be formulated as follows zhang et al 2019a 1a min f x j 1 n c j x j subject to 1b pr j 1 n a ij t x j b j t 1 p α α 1 2 m 1c a ij t n μ ij σ ij 2 1d b j t n v j τ j 2 1e x j 0 j 0 1 q in this model where f is the objective functions x j denote the interval form decision variables and c j is the interval parameter of the model superscript denotes the upper and the lower bound value of the interval respectively p r denote stochastic events a ij t b i t denote the left hand and right hand sides randomness parameters of the decision variables that obey normal distribution n δ ij δ ij 2 and n v j τ j 2 respectively in particular dsccp as an smp method that requires eq 1b should be satisfied with at least a given probability level 1 p α p α represents the constraint violated probability m is the number of constraints p α 0 1 2 2 development of bi level multi objective programming for a bi level multi objective programming bmop which is a mathematical optimization model with the bi level hierarchical structure it can handle the multi level decision makers problem in the water management system and tradeoff the potential interests of various decision levels simultaneously therefore each level of decision makers can obtain a satisfactory maximum overall coordination result generally the framework of a bmop model can be formulated as follows baky et al 2013 cai et al 2018b upper level 2a min x 0 f 0 x min x 0 f 01 x f 02 x f 0 n 1 x lower level 2b min x 1 f 1 x min x 1 f 11 x f 12 x f 1 n 2 x 2c min x q f q x min x q f q 1 x f q 2 x f q n q x subject to 2d j 1 n a ij x j b i x j 0 j 0 1 q i 0 1 n j where f 0 x f 1 x f q x denote the objective functions of the upper level and lower level respectively x j and b i are column vectors with j and i components respectively a ij is the coefficient matrix to the left hand of the decision variable x j 2 3 development of dual randomness bi level interval multi objective programming although the bmop method can effectively reflect the hierarchical relationship in the process of water resources management it still has limitations in some aspects for decision makers the bmop model can only handle the deterministic problems however it can hardly deal with the uncertainty problems of dual randomness and interval numbers in the model in response to the above considerations incorporating the idsccp into a bmop modeling framework therefore giving a dual randomness bi level interval multi objective programming dr bimp method to enhance its applicability which can be formulated as follows upper level 3a min x 0 f 0 x min x 0 f 01 x f 02 x f 0 n 1 x lower level 3b min x 1 f 1 x min x 1 f 11 x f 12 x f 1 n 1 x 3c min x q f q x min x q

denote the interval form decision variables in this model a ij t b i t denote the left hand and right hand side stochastic parameters of the decision variables obey normal distribution n μ ij σ ij 2 and n v j τ j 2 respectively 2 4 solution method multiple uncertainties and the bi level hierarchical structure are the difficulties faced in solving the established models to deal with these complex problems this study established a comprehensive solution framework to obtain the final optimization results first and foremost to solve the complicated dr bimp model the model should be transformed into a deterministic model deal with the problem of dsccp at first the detailed conversion process can reference zhang et al 2018 and zhang et al 2019a accordingly in order to describe the specific conversion process in more detail a flowchart can be seen in appendix i based on there eq 3d could be transformed into 4a j 1 n μ ij x j v j φ 1 1 p α j 1 n σ ij x j τ j 0 then an interactive two step algorithm is proposed for solving the ipp cai et al 2007 cai et al 2018a huang et al 1993 xie et al 2018 after the above the model could be transformed into a deterministic form besides the bmop model can be solved by the fuzzy coordination method fcm jin et al 2018 yue et al 2020 zhang et al 2019c finally the detailed calculation flow is summarized as follows step 1 formulate the dr bimp model step 2 acquire the model parameters through obtaining their deterministic values probability density functions and interval upper and lower boundaries step 3 transform the dsccp to the approximated linear forms by giving a certain probability level p α step 4 reformulate the linear forms of each sub objective function in the dr bimp model into a lower bound sub model and upper bound sub model through the interactive solution algorithm step 5 calculate the value of each objective separately and obtain the maximum and minimum values of each objective f i max and f i min step 6 solving the upper and lower level interval multi objective functions through the interactive algorithm and the fuzzy coordination method fcm li et al 2018b based on the solutions obtained from step 5 then obtain the solutions f u opt f u opt f u opt and f l opt f l opt f l opt step 7 the upper and lower level decision makers communicate and give feedback to each other build the corresponding membership function for upper level objectives lower level objectives and decision variables based on the solutions obtained from step 5 and step 6 which can be expressed as follows 4b γ x j p j x j u x j p j if x j u p j x j x j u p j 0 if otherwise 4c γ f u x j 1 if f u x j f u u f u x j f u u f u l f u u if f u u f u x j f u l 0 if f u x j f u l 4d γ f l x j 1 if f l x j f l l f l x j f l l f l u f l l if f l l f l x j f l u 0 if f l x j f l u step 8 to achieve the maximum satisfaction of the upper and lower level objective functions simultaneously formulate a new optimization model to maximize a satisfactory degree of objectives as follows 4e max δ 4f δ γ x j 4g δ γ f u x j 4h δ γ f l x j 4i j 1 n μ ij x j v j φ 1 1 p α j 1 n δ ij x j τ j 0 4j x j 0 4k δ 0 1 step 9 reformulate the new optimization model into a lower bound sub model and upper bound sub model through the two step algorithm and then solving for them respectively step 10 the final solutions would be obtained as f u opt f u opt f u opt f l opt f l opt f l opt and x j opt x j opt x j opt step 11 repeat and solve the dr bimp model under different probability levels p α step 12 provide satisfactory schemes to bi level decision makers in water resources management 3 case study 3 1 overview of the studying basin the developed dr bimp model was applied to the real world water resource management in the dongjiang river djr basin fig 1 the djr basin is an inter provincial basin located in south china 113 52 115 52 e 22 38 25 14 n which has a drainage area of 35 340 km2 and with 88 8 of its total drainage area in guangdong province the djr basin undertakes the important task of supplying water to the regions of huizhou hz shenzhen sz dongguan dg heyuan hy and guangzhou zengcheng zc those administrative regions that form more than half of these cities belong to the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area city cluster li et al 2020 in particular the development of hong kong has made water security in the djr basin more prominent because the river provides 80 of its water supply he et al 2018 the djr basin is not only relatively developed in industry but also has a large scale of agriculture which requires a large amount of water however in recent years due to the increasing population and the rapid development of industry there already exists serious water shortages meanwhile the imbalance between the supply and demand of water resources has increasingly prominent in this basin there is a serious contradiction between limited water resources and coordinated socio economic development in other words it is necessary to ensure sustainable development in the djr basin for decision makers the main challenge is to optimize the water resources consumption structure among the three water users e g domestic sector dom agricultural sector agr and industrial sector ind in the djr basin and improve water resource utilization efficiency at the same time however the optimal allocation of regional water resources is not only a simple problem of supply and demand matching for example the real world water distribution system is a complex multi level and sub level supply and demand structure at different levels each decision maker independently controls his decision making process which makes it more difficult to formulate an appropriate water resource allocation strategy generally speaking there are two decision making levels namely watershed authorities and regional managers additionally as an upper level decision maker the djr basin authority was inclined to consider the overall benefits of the basin water system on the contrary as lower level decision makers managers of each sub region in the basin were more inclined to consider the economic benefits of themself furthermore the uncertain problems of water availability and water related events may be existing on both sides of the system constraints which usually shown randomness in real world water management in response to the above problems it needs to be solved 1 in terms of management the model frame establish must be able to effectively deal with the interaction and decision making preferences among multiple decision makers in a complex water management system 2 in terms of system uncertainty the developed model must be able to effectively deal with and characterize much uncertain information in decision making goals and system constraints thereupon it is crucial to develop a comprehensive tool to solve the above problems for supporting water resources management in the djr basin 3 2 data preparation the original data is the yearly runoff of the boluo hydrological station from 1956 to 2015 then using the research method of li et al 2019 the streamflow can be divided into five flow levels based on the degree of dryness and wetness from extreme wet to extreme dry levels besides to solve the sccp problem the first necessary thing is to obtain the normal distribution of the runoff amounts under different flows however these historical data were not enough to simulate the probability distribution under each flow level therefore the box muller method is adopted for stochastic simulating the normal distribution the box muller method can be expressed as huang 2009 li et al 2016 5a q μ σ 2 ln 2 u 1 1 2 2 u 2 1 2 2 u 1 1 2 2 u 2 1 2 2 u 1 1 where μ and σ denote the mean value and standard deviation value of water availability respectively u 1 u 2 are random numbers that obey the uniform distribution and 2u 1 1 2 2u 2 1 2 1 then fig 2 shows the available surface water under different flow levels the basic data of the dr bimp model is shown in tables 1 and 2 including water benefit coefficients cost coefficients maximum and minimum water demands of each water use sector in subareas the benefit of per cubic meter water for each water use sector was collected from related research in the djr basin lei et al 2017 meanwhile it assumed that the cost per cubic meter of water is equal to the water price for local each water use sector and the corresponding interval numbers were calculated from the method of p 100 120 where p is the value of the economic parameter besides in this case 2025 was chosen as a recent planning year and the basic data used to calculate the water demand amount of the three sectors were collected from the statistical yearbook 2007 2018 of each city water resources bulletin of guangdong province and related websites therefore the water demand of each water sectors was predicted through gm 1 1 method which can be expressed as 5b d 0 1 d 0 1 d 0 k 1 e a d 0 1 b a e a k 1 k 2 3 n where d 0 k is the final predicted value d 0 1 is the first item of the original sample sequence a and b are the parameters that need to be identified the detailed calculate process of the gm 1 1 method can reference deng 2002 3 3 application of dr bimp model in this study the dr bimp model was formulated for supporting water resources planning in the djr basin the general framework of the developed dr bimp is graphically presented in fig 3 as the upper level decision maker the djr basin authority was more inclined to consider the overall benefits of the basin water system therefore two objective functions are considered in the decision making process and the gini coefficient was adopted to measure the equity of water resources allocation to maximize the social benefits of the basin and of course the overall economic benefits should also be maximized however as lower level decision makers managers of each sub region in the basin were more inclined to consider their benefits hoping to meet the water coordination of various sectors and obtain more regional economic net benefits moreover there are some uncertain factors in water management systems for example water availability and the rate of water loss during conveyance usually shown randomness in response to these existing problems reasonable simulation and hypothesis of input parameters were needed to tackle the mentioned above uncertainties specifically it is assumed that the rate of water loss during conveyance follow a normal distribution n 10 0 252 therefore an integrated modeling framework is developed for supporting water resources management under complexities and uncertainties upper level decision making

probability p levels i e scenarios were chosen including 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 by inputting all the related basic parameters into the dr bimp model and then the final optimal allocation schemes can be obtained through the comprehensive solution method the different p levels will result in different water resource allocation schemes taking the normal flow level as an example fig 4 presents the water allocation results under different p levels among them including combinations of interval and deterministic information the interval solutions can provide a range of decision space for decision makers which will help them tradeoffs the related scope and better identify the required alternatives simultaneously in terms of outcomes for the domestic sector under five scenarios the allocation amount of the domestic sector in sub region 1 i 1 all would be 4 23 108 m3 i e the maximum demand under the five scenarios similarly those in sub region 5 i 5 all satisfy the maximum demand i e 0 76 108 m3 in scenarios 1 5 those in sub region 2 i 2 would be 14 71 15 41 15 37 15 41 108 m3 in scenarios 1 2 and 15 41 108 m3 in scenarios 3 5 respectively those in sub region 3 i 3 would be 9 39 10 50 10 35 10 51 108 m3 in scenarios 1 2 and 10 51 108 m3 in scenarios 3 5 respectively those in sub region 4 i 4 would be 1 55 1 97 1 66 1 97 1 66 1 97 1 66 1 97 1 67 1 97 108 m3 under the scenarios 1 5 respectively overall for each scenario the results would all increases with the increase of p level additionally it is important to note that there are some deterministic values since both the lower and upper bounds are close to the maximum water demand level fig 4 also present similar trends for industrial and agricultural sector water supply plans in five scenarios generally for the solutions of three sectors water supply the overall increasing trends are mainly due to the assumed increase in the risk of violating the constraints means increased available surface water in the allocation however according to the ratio of water supply and demand it can be found that the water allocation results except for the domestic sector in each sub region there is still a certain degree of water shortage under the normal flow level furthermore the small ratio indicates that there is a serious contradiction between water supply and demand in particular there is a greater water shortage in the agricultural sector since in the context of relatively scarce water resources which gives priority to the more economically benefit domestic and industrial sectors the water allocation proportion among the three different sectors in the djr basin is shown in fig 5 the structure of the water allocation proportion is inconsistent under the five different scenarios i e from p 0 01 to p 0 2 for the proportion of water allocation the proportion of the domestic sector in the djr basin is higher than the other two sectors both greater than 40 conversely the proportion of the agriculture sector is smallest both less than 23 especially here the unusual phenomena are shown the proportion of the domestic sector decreases as the increase of p level while the proportion of other sectors shown the opposite trend the following explanations for the above phenomenon the available water resources with the increase of from p 0 01 to p 0 2 nevertheless the problem of water shortage still exists under the circumstances decision makers priority to satisfy the domestic sector water use scheme at first so the result in the domestic sector with water allocation has reached the maximum demand at the same time after that the extra water resources would be allocated to the other two sectors hence the above phenomenon has appeared the objective functions of the water system are to maximize the system benefits region profits and allocation equity through solving the dr bimp model the results of the objective functions under the five different scenarios i e from p 0 01 to p 0 2 were obtained fig 6 shows the values changing with the constraint violated probability p level changes it can be seen from the figure that the system benefits would be from lower to higher 20 786 00 26 425 92 108 cny 21 786 81 27 009 42 108 cny 21 971 76 27 252 30 108 cny 22 155 68 27 397 67 108 cny 22 290 84 27 492 57 108 cny when p level is 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 respectively on the other hand gini coefficient value has the opposite trend which would be from higher to lower are 0 365 0 446 0 354 0 418 0 348 0 412 0 346 0 409 0 345 0 405 with the constraint violated probability p level increases as can be seen from fig 6 sub region 2 has a bigger profit than others mainly due to the higher allocation of water in the domestic sector compared to the other four sub regions the results of those numerical characteristic change trends are mainly influenced by the contradiction between characteristics of objectives functions the availability of water resources and the net benefit parameters the greater water allocation and unit net benefit will generate more economic benefits similarly the results demonstrate that the lower p level would increase the system inequity in contrast decisions at higher p levels lead to greater benefit and system equity but increased risk of constraint violations in summary from the above results it can be seen that this model can balance not only the benefits and risks of the system but also consider the tradeoff between the profits of the sub region and the overall equity of water distribution under the condition of considering interval and random multiple uncertainties fig 7 shows the total optimal water allocation amount results for different sub regions of scenario 3 i e p 0 1 under different flow levels as shown in the figure as it is clear that the total water allocation amount under the runoff flow levels of extreme wet wet normal dry nevertheless when the flow level is extremely dry there is no feasible solution of the dr bimp model this is because the minimum water requirements cannot be met for the extreme dry flow level due to the lowest total surface water availability and the water demand increased combined with rapid population growth and economic growth in the djr basin besides from fig 7 it can be seen that both the upper bound and the lower bound of each sub region allocation results under extreme wet and wet flow levels equal to their corresponding target values that means the water demand amount of each sub region in wet and extreme wet flow levels can easily be satisfied in this case the dr bimp model seems ineffective because the decision makers can fully allocate the maximum amount of water according to the sector s water demand however in other flow levels the developed model could be effective 4 2 effectiveness and reliability of the model in this study in order to better reflect the effectiveness and reliability of the dr bimp model multiple models were introduced for comparison to help decision makers make the best decision schemes when decision makers focus more on individual goals such as the objective function of maximizing system benefits or maximizing system allocation equity the dr bimp model could be transformed into a single objective model with the same constraints under five scenarios p 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 of course it is also possible for water resource managers to put more emphasis on multiple objectives simultaneously with the same input parameters of the interval stochastic and deterministic as the original model therefore four optimization models that originated from the dr bimp model are described as shown in table 3 after coding these models in optimization software the objective values of different optimization models can be obtained as shown in fig 8 a c in terms of the system economic benefit as shown in fig 8a apparently that the function value of model 1 model 4 dr bimp model model 3 model 2 model 1 with the largest value and the result will be increased from 22 447 33 27 893 44 108 cny to 23 305 77 28 001 06 108 cny which is considerably upper than others model on the contrary while that of model 2 with the smallest value will be increased from 15 278 57 19 790 58 108 cny to 18 170 26 25 324 02 108 cny under the scenarios from p 0 01 to p 0 2 nevertheless as can be seen in fig 8b the result of the system water allocation equity represents a contrary trend gini coefficient value of model 2 is the smallest and decreases from 0 313 0 376 to 0 310 0 373 under the increase of p levels indicating that the allocation result of model 2 is the fairest while that of model 1 and model 4 are inequity accordingly as far as the single objective model is concerned the realization of high system benefits will inevitably lead to the generation of system unfairness the same phenomenon also appears in fig 8c fig 8c presents the economic profits of each sub region resulting from the four models and the dr bimp model under a range of p levels in terms of the overall outcome model 1 and model 4 have better results while the dr bimp model is in an intermediate position similar to the previous two results simultaneously in order to more intuitively identify the advantages of the dr bimp model a detailed comparison of the dr bimp model with the other four different optimization models was carried out to calculate the relevant rate of change take the two systemic goals of the upper level decision making as an example and the specific growth rate change results are shown in fig 9 first of all in considering the economic benefits of the system the ability of the dr bimp model is weaker than that of model 1 and model 4 from scenario 1 to scenario 5 the increase rate of model 1 has changed from 5 55 7 99 to 1 85 4 55 while the increase of model 4 has changed from 2 49 4 01 to 1 34 2 34 and it can be found that the increase of model 1 is more obvious but compared to model 2 and model 3 the dr bimp model has stronger capabilities on the other hand when considering the goal of system fairness on the contrary the ability of the dr bimp model is stronger than that of model 1 and model 4 specifically from scenario 1 to scenario 5 the growth rates of model 1 are 8 75 20 81 6 41 11 78 5 47 12 74 3 99 5 77 and 1 95 2 44 respectively however model 2 has the strongest ability in this respect which means that its changes are the most obvious this is because the two decision making goals of economic benefits and social equity are completely contradictory that is the changes between the two are inversely proportional so the above mentioned trend of changes has appeared to sum up it can clearly be found that the model can obtain the required optimal target value when single objective planning was carried out but only so for example model 1 and model 2 can only obtain the required optimal target value while lacking consideration for the goals of other aspects nevertheless the multi objective programming model can balance the objectives of multiple levels and take into account the interests of all aspects while being comprehensive without a doubt the solutions of model 3 are better than its corresponding sub model 1 model 1 and sub model 2 model 2 despite model 3 and model 4 correspond to the upper and lower decision objectives of the dr bimp model respectively while the results obtained by the dr bimp model are closer to the results of model 3 it is shown that the dr bimp model not only has the advantages of balancing multi objective programming but also can effectively reflect the bi level hierarchical relationship between the upper and lower decision makers in the decision making process in addition the dr bimp model can be transformed into a deterministic bmop model by converting all input parameters to deterministic when random and interval uncertainties were not considered that means ignoring the standard deviation of random numbers and taking the mean of interval parameters therefore table 4 shows the results through solving the deterministic bmop nevertheless from the results it can be seen that the deterministic bmop model can only obtain a single solution moreover the system benefit and the gini coefficient of the bmop model are 25 277 80 108 cny and 0 403 which belong to the interval decision range of the dr bimp model the same is true for the economic profits of each sub region so this solution can be considered as a special solution of the dr bimp model however it usually involves many uncertainties in the actual water resource management process and the deterministic bmop model will encounter obstacles in the deal with these problems therefore compared with the bmop model the dr bimp model established in this study not only can reflect more interval and random uncertain information but also can achieve a tradeoff the relationship between the system decision objectives and the risk of a chance constraint violation moreover the decision maker can simultaneously obtain more effective and flexible feasible solutions according to different violation probability scenarios in summary compared with the deterministic bmop model the dr bimp model has more practical applicability and flexibility 5 conclusions in this research a dr bimp model is developed for regional water resources management among multiple water sectors under complexities and uncertainties the study is an innovative method to couple the bi level multi objective programming double sided stochastic chance constrained programming and interval parameter programming into an integrated modeling framework to achieve considering the complexities and uncertainties of water resources management system it thus improves upon the existing bi level multi objective programming by addressing discrete interval parameters and double sided stochastic problems of constraints in optimization processes simultaneously compared to previous studies the comprehensive model framework has the following advantages 1 it can effectively deal with the interaction effects between multiple decision makers in complex water management systems through the bi level hierarchical strategies 2 it can characterize the interval dual randomness uncertain information expressed as interval format and probability density functions 3 and it can provide desired water resources allocation schemes under multiple constraints violated probability levels to illustrate the applicability of the developed comprehensive framework the dr bimp model was applied to a real world case to optimally allocate available water resources among three water use sectors in five sub regions in the djr basin south china the goals of the upper level decision maker the djr basin authority were to maximize the system s economic benefit and maximize the system s water allocation equity the goals of the lower level managers were to maximize the economic profits of themselves then through the proposed comprehensive solution method the optimal results of the dr bimp model under multiple flow levels and different risk violation scenarios can provide reliable guidance and suggestions for managers moreover by comparing with the other models originated from the developed model under the same constraints the comparison shows better performance in making balance the interaction effects between two level decision makers similarly according to the comparison results of the deterministic bmop model can highlight and emphasize the practical applicability and flexibility of the established model based on the results of the dr bimp model and comparison results it thus can assist the bi level decision makers to identify the desired water resources allocation schemes in the studying basin there are still limitations in practical applications in this research due to the simplified processing of basic data in the early stage only the water demand of domestic industrial and agricultural was emphasized the ecological water demand of the study area was not considered because it was very small which may violate the requirements of coordination and sustainable development between society economy and environment resulting in environmental degradation and resource shortage therefore in future practical research the system boundary

1420,in this research a dual randomness bi level interval multi objective programming dr bimp model was developed for supporting water resources management among multiple water sectors under complexities and uncertainties techniques of bi level multi objective programming bmop double sided stochastic chance constrained programming dsccp and interval parameter programming ipp were incorporated into an integrated modeling framework to achieve comprehensive consideration of the complexities and uncertainties of water resources management systems the dr bimp model can not only effectively deal with the interactive effects between multiple decision makers in complex water management systems through the bi level hierarchical strategies but also can characterize the multiple uncertainties information expressed as interval format and probability density functions it could thus improve upon the existing bi level multi objective programming through addressing discrete interval parameters and dual randomness problems in optimization processes simultaneously then the developed model was applied to a real world case to optimally allocate water resources among three different water sectors in five sub regions in the dongjiang river basin south china the results of the model include determining values interval values and stochastic distribution information which can assist bi level decision makers to plan future resources effectively to some extent after comparing the variations of results it is found that an increasing probability level can lead to higher system benefits which is increased from 20 786 00 26 425 92 108 cny to 22 290 84 27 492 57 108 cny while the gini value is reduced from 0 365 0 446 to 0 345 0 405 a set of increased probability levels gives rise to the lower level objectives furthermore the advantages of the dr bimp model were highlighted by comparing with the other models originated from the developed model the comparison results indicated that the dr bimp model was a valuable tool for generating a range of decision alternatives and thus assists the bi level decision makers to identify the desired water resources allocation schemes under multiple scenarios graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water resources management complexities and uncertainties bi level multi objective programming double sided stochastic chance constrained programming interval parameter programming 1 introduction the management of water resources is a worldwide issue due to increasing water demands and shrinking water availability in many areas across the world li et al 2018a loucks et al 2005 due to the combined effects of population growth socio economic development and changing consumption patterns global water use has been increasing by approximately 1 per year since the 1980s wwap 2019 the worldwide water demand is expected to continue increasing at a similar rate until 2050 accounting for an increase of 20 to 30 above the current amount of water use wwap 2019 this is causing a potential water shortage in many areas obviously the scarcity of water resources and the increasing competition among multiple water users have highlighted the importance of water allocation in river basins with the booming economy intensive industrialization and dense population much research was thus conducted to generate water allocation schemes abdulbaki et al 2017 al jawad et al 2019 lalehzari et al 2016 martinsen et al 2019 milan et al 2018 mortada et al 2018 ye et al 2018 due to the existing complexities and uncertainties of water resource systems water resource managers are always plagued by serious challenges tan et al 2017 for instance dual randomness might exist for both water availability and water related events which were induced by the randomness of the hydrologic cycle and merely reflected by conventional studies moreover multiple objectives may be associated with water resource utilization due to potential interest conflicts of multi level decision makers and pure consumers those extreme complexities are arising in many water management practical problems calling for comprehensive and advanced methods therefore it is desired to develop advanced tools for supporting water resources management with the consideration of such dual randomness and multiple objectiveness previously many inexact optimization techniques have been presented to deal with uncertainties of water resources management gurav and regulwar 2012 khosrojerdi et al 2018 nikoo et al 2012 ren et al 2017 wang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 according to the published literature the frequent mathematical programming methods can be divided into three categories i e stochastic mathematical programming smp interval parameter programming ipp and fuzzy mathematical programming fmp method among them as one of an effective smp technology the stochastic chance constrained programming sccp method was frequently employed to deal with stochastic uncertainty which was proposed by charnes and cooper 1959 initially practically the sccp method could represent the stochastic parameters through probability density functions pdfs and more crucial is that the sccp method has the advantage in effectively providing mutual information regarding the level of violated risk between the objective function and the constraint nevertheless the traditional sccp technology was usually used to deal with the randomness parameters existing on the right hand side of system constraints for instance xu et al 2012 developed an interval parameter stochastic chance constrained programming model for an urban water supply system a two stage chance constrained fractional programming method was put forward by zhou et al 2015 for dealing with water quality management problems associated with stochastic inputs li et al 2019 developed a stochastic multi objective non linear programming model for identifying the sustainable irrigation schemes that water availability as a stochastic uncertainty parameter exists in the right hand side of constraints however the stochastic uncertainty might exist on both the left and right hand sides of the system constraints in real world cases the double sided stochastic chance constrained programming dsccp method was established by liu 2009 to solve such problems effectively recently zhang et al 2018 adopted dsccp to deal with the problem of optimal irrigation water resources management although dsccp can be used as an effective stochastic method to deal with double sided stochastic uncertainties for problems in water resources management processing it requires sufficient parameter information which leads to the difficulty that the collected data may not have enough information to accurately generate the probability density function of relevant parameters interval parameter programming ipp can be used as an alternative method which merely needs the upper and lower boundaries of known parameters to adequately represent the uncertainty dai et al 2012 xie et al 2013 based on the above analysis the couple of dsccp and ipp methods can effectively account for dual randomness and interval uncertainty for instance ji et al 2015 developed an inexact double hand side chance constrained programming idccp method for nonpoint source water quality management within an agricultural system zhang et al 2019a developed an inexact joint probabilistic double sided stochastic chance constrained programming ijdsccp model for sustainable water resources planning and pollution control on the other hand water resource allocation systems frequently depend on various independent aspects such as economic social and natural that may conflict with each other li et al 2018b such water resource allocation issues can be addressed through the multi objective programming mop method over the past decades many scholars have applied multi objective programming methods for the management of water resource systems for example amini fasakhodi et al 2010 proposed a multi objective fractional goal programming that considers the water resources sustainability in the cropping pattern planning zarghami 2010 proposed a fuzzy probabilistic multi objective decision making model for efficient urban water management to design optimum water supply and demand patterns habibi davijani et al 2016 presented a two objective socio economic model for the optimum allocation of water resources to industry agriculture and municipal water sectors zhang et al 2019b developed an interval multi objective approach for helping irrigation water managers solve the multi objective problem under interval uncertainty in the process of allocating limited irrigation water although many previous studies have been effective in coordinating water supply and demand issues and dealing with uncertainties there are still deficiencies tan and zhang 2018 for real world water management problems the water allocation decision making process is complicated it s not just a multi objective collaborative process this usually involves multi level decision makers e g the river basin authority and administrative managers meanwhile different decision makers may be inclined to multiple different objectives the river basin authority as the upper decision maker whose aim is to plan an allocation strategy from a macroscopic perspective to gain the best benefits and equity of the system while the lower level managers were to gain more economic profits for themselves additionally each level of decision makers may have multiple conflicting objectives in the decision making process which makes this decision problem more complicated nevertheless most of the previous allocation models seldom consider the hierarchical structure of water resources management which oversimplified the hierarchical structure characterize in response to these problems the bi level multi objective programming bmop model can be proposed to reflect the hierarchical structure and considering multi objectives that existed in each level simultaneously ahmad et al 2018 wang et al 2019 although bmop can make the tradeoff between two level decision makers it can hardly deal with the issues of dual randomness and the parameters represent an interval form in the model unfortunately few researchers handled the integrated interval dual randomness issues with bmop models and few applications to water resources management have been reported therefore the objective of this research is to develop an innovative method to address bi level decision makers optimization problems under the circumstance of interval dual randomness uncertainties in the constraints which could comprehensively consideration the complexities and uncertainties of the water resources management system the innovative model is developed by incorporating bmop dsccp and ipp into a comprehensive modeling framework formulate a dual randomness bi level interval multi objective programming model namely dr bimp the dr bimp model has the following characteristics a it can effectively deal with the interaction effects between multiple decision makers in complex water management systems through the bi level hierarchical strategies b it can characterize the interval dual randomness uncertain information expressed as interval format and probability density functions c it can provide desired water resources allocation schemes under different constraints violated probability levels to illustrate the applicability of the developed model it will be applied to a real world case study to optimally allocate available water resources among multiple water use sectors in the dongjiang river basin south china the optimal solutions obtained can assist the relevant decision makers to identify the desired best water resources allocation schemes to alleviate the supply demand contradiction in the basin 2 methodology in particular there is a concern not be solved which still existing many uncertain problems for decision makers in real world water resources system including 1 the water availability is affected by randomness natural precipitation and streamflow 2 the economic parameters e g water use benefit and recourse cost and the technical parameters e g leakage coefficient of the model are affected by market economy fluctuation and technical quality 3 lacking and inaccurate data of the collection process will inevitably bring uncertainty those uncertainties have a significant impact on the effectiveness of management decisions tan et al 2016 2017 if those uncertainties were transformed into the deterministic type oversimply the results might be inaccurate and resulting in the aggravation of the system risk hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to introduce advanced optimal methods and establish a corresponding integrated water management model to effectively deal with multiple uncertainties in the water resources management system 2 1 development of interval double sided stochastic chance constrained programming for a general linear programming model it is not equipped to deal with uncertain problems especially the uncertain parameters exist on both the left hand and right hand sides of the system constraints e g these parameters are independent randomness variables that obey normal distributions and the interval numbers also existing in the model thus through coupling double sided stochastic chance constrained programming dsccp with interval parameter programming ipp into an integrated modeling framework to comprehensively considering the interval dual randomness problems an interval double sided stochastic chance constrained programming idsccp model can be formulated as follows zhang et al 2019a 1a min f x j 1 n c j x j subject to 1b pr j 1 n a ij t x j b j t 1 p α α 1 2 m 1c a ij t n μ ij σ ij 2 1d b j t n v j τ j 2 1e x j 0 j 0 1 q in this model where f is the objective functions x j denote the interval form decision variables and c j is the interval parameter of the model superscript denotes the upper and the lower bound value of the interval respectively p r denote stochastic events a ij t b i t denote the left hand and right hand sides randomness parameters of the decision variables that obey normal distribution n δ ij δ ij 2 and n v j τ j 2 respectively in particular dsccp as an smp method that requires eq 1b should be satisfied with at least a given probability level 1 p α p α represents the constraint violated probability m is the number of constraints p α 0 1 2 2 development of bi level multi objective programming for a bi level multi objective programming bmop which is a mathematical optimization model with the bi level hierarchical structure it can handle the multi level decision makers problem in the water management system and tradeoff the potential interests of various decision levels simultaneously therefore each level of decision makers can obtain a satisfactory maximum overall coordination result generally the framework of a bmop model can be formulated as follows baky et al 2013 cai et al 2018b upper level 2a min x 0 f 0 x min x 0 f 01 x f 02 x f 0 n 1 x lower level 2b min x 1 f 1 x min x 1 f 11 x f 12 x f 1 n 2 x 2c min x q f q x min x q f q 1 x f q 2 x f q n q x subject to 2d j 1 n a ij x j b i x j 0 j 0 1 q i 0 1 n j where f 0 x f 1 x f q x denote the objective functions of the upper level and lower level respectively x j and b i are column vectors with j and i components respectively a ij is the coefficient matrix to the left hand of the decision variable x j 2 3 development of dual randomness bi level interval multi objective programming although the bmop method can effectively reflect the hierarchical relationship in the process of water resources management it still has limitations in some aspects for decision makers the bmop model can only handle the deterministic problems however it can hardly deal with the uncertainty problems of dual randomness and interval numbers in the model in response to the above considerations incorporating the idsccp into a bmop modeling framework therefore giving a dual randomness bi level interval multi objective programming dr bimp method to enhance its applicability which can be formulated as follows upper level 3a min x 0 f 0 x min x 0 f 01 x f 02 x f 0 n 1 x lower level 3b min x 1 f 1 x min x 1 f 11 x f 12 x f 1 n 1 x 3c min x q f q x min x q

denote the interval form decision variables in this model a ij t b i t denote the left hand and right hand side stochastic parameters of the decision variables obey normal distribution n μ ij σ ij 2 and n v j τ j 2 respectively 2 4 solution method multiple uncertainties and the bi level hierarchical structure are the difficulties faced in solving the established models to deal with these complex problems this study established a comprehensive solution framework to obtain the final optimization results first and foremost to solve the complicated dr bimp model the model should be transformed into a deterministic model deal with the problem of dsccp at first the detailed conversion process can reference zhang et al 2018 and zhang et al 2019a accordingly in order to describe the specific conversion process in more detail a flowchart can be seen in appendix i based on there eq 3d could be transformed into 4a j 1 n μ ij x j v j φ 1 1 p α j 1 n σ ij x j τ j 0 then an interactive two step algorithm is proposed for solving the ipp cai et al 2007 cai et al 2018a huang et al 1993 xie et al 2018 after the above the model could be transformed into a deterministic form besides the bmop model can be solved by the fuzzy coordination method fcm jin et al 2018 yue et al 2020 zhang et al 2019c finally the detailed calculation flow is summarized as follows step 1 formulate the dr bimp model step 2 acquire the model parameters through obtaining their deterministic values probability density functions and interval upper and lower boundaries step 3 transform the dsccp to the approximated linear forms by giving a certain probability level p α step 4 reformulate the linear forms of each sub objective function in the dr bimp model into a lower bound sub model and upper bound sub model through the interactive solution algorithm step 5 calculate the value of each objective separately and obtain the maximum and minimum values of each objective f i max and f i min step 6 solving the upper and lower level interval multi objective functions through the interactive algorithm and the fuzzy coordination method fcm li et al 2018b based on the solutions obtained from step 5 then obtain the solutions f u opt f u opt f u opt and f l opt f l opt f l opt step 7 the upper and lower level decision makers communicate and give feedback to each other build the corresponding membership function for upper level objectives lower level objectives and decision variables based on the solutions obtained from step 5 and step 6 which can be expressed as follows 4b γ x j p j x j u x j p j if x j u p j x j x j u p j 0 if otherwise 4c γ f u x j 1 if f u x j f u u f u x j f u u f u l f u u if f u u f u x j f u l 0 if f u x j f u l 4d γ f l x j 1 if f l x j f l l f l x j f l l f l u f l l if f l l f l x j f l u 0 if f l x j f l u step 8 to achieve the maximum satisfaction of the upper and lower level objective functions simultaneously formulate a new optimization model to maximize a satisfactory degree of objectives as follows 4e max δ 4f δ γ x j 4g δ γ f u x j 4h δ γ f l x j 4i j 1 n μ ij x j v j φ 1 1 p α j 1 n δ ij x j τ j 0 4j x j 0 4k δ 0 1 step 9 reformulate the new optimization model into a lower bound sub model and upper bound sub model through the two step algorithm and then solving for them respectively step 10 the final solutions would be obtained as f u opt f u opt f u opt f l opt f l opt f l opt and x j opt x j opt x j opt step 11 repeat and solve the dr bimp model under different probability levels p α step 12 provide satisfactory schemes to bi level decision makers in water resources management 3 case study 3 1 overview of the studying basin the developed dr bimp model was applied to the real world water resource management in the dongjiang river djr basin fig 1 the djr basin is an inter provincial basin located in south china 113 52 115 52 e 22 38 25 14 n which has a drainage area of 35 340 km2 and with 88 8 of its total drainage area in guangdong province the djr basin undertakes the important task of supplying water to the regions of huizhou hz shenzhen sz dongguan dg heyuan hy and guangzhou zengcheng zc those administrative regions that form more than half of these cities belong to the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area city cluster li et al 2020 in particular the development of hong kong has made water security in the djr basin more prominent because the river provides 80 of its water supply he et al 2018 the djr basin is not only relatively developed in industry but also has a large scale of agriculture which requires a large amount of water however in recent years due to the increasing population and the rapid development of industry there already exists serious water shortages meanwhile the imbalance between the supply and demand of water resources has increasingly prominent in this basin there is a serious contradiction between limited water resources and coordinated socio economic development in other words it is necessary to ensure sustainable development in the djr basin for decision makers the main challenge is to optimize the water resources consumption structure among the three water users e g domestic sector dom agricultural sector agr and industrial sector ind in the djr basin and improve water resource utilization efficiency at the same time however the optimal allocation of regional water resources is not only a simple problem of supply and demand matching for example the real world water distribution system is a complex multi level and sub level supply and demand structure at different levels each decision maker independently controls his decision making process which makes it more difficult to formulate an appropriate water resource allocation strategy generally speaking there are two decision making levels namely watershed authorities and regional managers additionally as an upper level decision maker the djr basin authority was inclined to consider the overall benefits of the basin water system on the contrary as lower level decision makers managers of each sub region in the basin were more inclined to consider the economic benefits of themself furthermore the uncertain problems of water availability and water related events may be existing on both sides of the system constraints which usually shown randomness in real world water management in response to the above problems it needs to be solved 1 in terms of management the model frame establish must be able to effectively deal with the interaction and decision making preferences among multiple decision makers in a complex water management system 2 in terms of system uncertainty the developed model must be able to effectively deal with and characterize much uncertain information in decision making goals and system constraints thereupon it is crucial to develop a comprehensive tool to solve the above problems for supporting water resources management in the djr basin 3 2 data preparation the original data is the yearly runoff of the boluo hydrological station from 1956 to 2015 then using the research method of li et al 2019 the streamflow can be divided into five flow levels based on the degree of dryness and wetness from extreme wet to extreme dry levels besides to solve the sccp problem the first necessary thing is to obtain the normal distribution of the runoff amounts under different flows however these historical data were not enough to simulate the probability distribution under each flow level therefore the box muller method is adopted for stochastic simulating the normal distribution the box muller method can be expressed as huang 2009 li et al 2016 5a q μ σ 2 ln 2 u 1 1 2 2 u 2 1 2 2 u 1 1 2 2 u 2 1 2 2 u 1 1 where μ and σ denote the mean value and standard deviation value of water availability respectively u 1 u 2 are random numbers that obey the uniform distribution and 2u 1 1 2 2u 2 1 2 1 then fig 2 shows the available surface water under different flow levels the basic data of the dr bimp model is shown in tables 1 and 2 including water benefit coefficients cost coefficients maximum and minimum water demands of each water use sector in subareas the benefit of per cubic meter water for each water use sector was collected from related research in the djr basin lei et al 2017 meanwhile it assumed that the cost per cubic meter of water is equal to the water price for local each water use sector and the corresponding interval numbers were calculated from the method of p 100 120 where p is the value of the economic parameter besides in this case 2025 was chosen as a recent planning year and the basic data used to calculate the water demand amount of the three sectors were collected from the statistical yearbook 2007 2018 of each city water resources bulletin of guangdong province and related websites therefore the water demand of each water sectors was predicted through gm 1 1 method which can be expressed as 5b d 0 1 d 0 1 d 0 k 1 e a d 0 1 b a e a k 1 k 2 3 n where d 0 k is the final predicted value d 0 1 is the first item of the original sample sequence a and b are the parameters that need to be identified the detailed calculate process of the gm 1 1 method can reference deng 2002 3 3 application of dr bimp model in this study the dr bimp model was formulated for supporting water resources planning in the djr basin the general framework of the developed dr bimp is graphically presented in fig 3 as the upper level decision maker the djr basin authority was more inclined to consider the overall benefits of the basin water system therefore two objective functions are considered in the decision making process and the gini coefficient was adopted to measure the equity of water resources allocation to maximize the social benefits of the basin and of course the overall economic benefits should also be maximized however as lower level decision makers managers of each sub region in the basin were more inclined to consider their benefits hoping to meet the water coordination of various sectors and obtain more regional economic net benefits moreover there are some uncertain factors in water management systems for example water availability and the rate of water loss during conveyance usually shown randomness in response to these existing problems reasonable simulation and hypothesis of input parameters were needed to tackle the mentioned above uncertainties specifically it is assumed that the rate of water loss during conveyance follow a normal distribution n 10 0 252 therefore an integrated modeling framework is developed for supporting water resources management under complexities and uncertainties upper level decision making

probability p levels i e scenarios were chosen including 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 by inputting all the related basic parameters into the dr bimp model and then the final optimal allocation schemes can be obtained through the comprehensive solution method the different p levels will result in different water resource allocation schemes taking the normal flow level as an example fig 4 presents the water allocation results under different p levels among them including combinations of interval and deterministic information the interval solutions can provide a range of decision space for decision makers which will help them tradeoffs the related scope and better identify the required alternatives simultaneously in terms of outcomes for the domestic sector under five scenarios the allocation amount of the domestic sector in sub region 1 i 1 all would be 4 23 108 m3 i e the maximum demand under the five scenarios similarly those in sub region 5 i 5 all satisfy the maximum demand i e 0 76 108 m3 in scenarios 1 5 those in sub region 2 i 2 would be 14 71 15 41 15 37 15 41 108 m3 in scenarios 1 2 and 15 41 108 m3 in scenarios 3 5 respectively those in sub region 3 i 3 would be 9 39 10 50 10 35 10 51 108 m3 in scenarios 1 2 and 10 51 108 m3 in scenarios 3 5 respectively those in sub region 4 i 4 would be 1 55 1 97 1 66 1 97 1 66 1 97 1 66 1 97 1 67 1 97 108 m3 under the scenarios 1 5 respectively overall for each scenario the results would all increases with the increase of p level additionally it is important to note that there are some deterministic values since both the lower and upper bounds are close to the maximum water demand level fig 4 also present similar trends for industrial and agricultural sector water supply plans in five scenarios generally for the solutions of three sectors water supply the overall increasing trends are mainly due to the assumed increase in the risk of violating the constraints means increased available surface water in the allocation however according to the ratio of water supply and demand it can be found that the water allocation results except for the domestic sector in each sub region there is still a certain degree of water shortage under the normal flow level furthermore the small ratio indicates that there is a serious contradiction between water supply and demand in particular there is a greater water shortage in the agricultural sector since in the context of relatively scarce water resources which gives priority to the more economically benefit domestic and industrial sectors the water allocation proportion among the three different sectors in the djr basin is shown in fig 5 the structure of the water allocation proportion is inconsistent under the five different scenarios i e from p 0 01 to p 0 2 for the proportion of water allocation the proportion of the domestic sector in the djr basin is higher than the other two sectors both greater than 40 conversely the proportion of the agriculture sector is smallest both less than 23 especially here the unusual phenomena are shown the proportion of the domestic sector decreases as the increase of p level while the proportion of other sectors shown the opposite trend the following explanations for the above phenomenon the available water resources with the increase of from p 0 01 to p 0 2 nevertheless the problem of water shortage still exists under the circumstances decision makers priority to satisfy the domestic sector water use scheme at first so the result in the domestic sector with water allocation has reached the maximum demand at the same time after that the extra water resources would be allocated to the other two sectors hence the above phenomenon has appeared the objective functions of the water system are to maximize the system benefits region profits and allocation equity through solving the dr bimp model the results of the objective functions under the five different scenarios i e from p 0 01 to p 0 2 were obtained fig 6 shows the values changing with the constraint violated probability p level changes it can be seen from the figure that the system benefits would be from lower to higher 20 786 00 26 425 92 108 cny 21 786 81 27 009 42 108 cny 21 971 76 27 252 30 108 cny 22 155 68 27 397 67 108 cny 22 290 84 27 492 57 108 cny when p level is 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 respectively on the other hand gini coefficient value has the opposite trend which would be from higher to lower are 0 365 0 446 0 354 0 418 0 348 0 412 0 346 0 409 0 345 0 405 with the constraint violated probability p level increases as can be seen from fig 6 sub region 2 has a bigger profit than others mainly due to the higher allocation of water in the domestic sector compared to the other four sub regions the results of those numerical characteristic change trends are mainly influenced by the contradiction between characteristics of objectives functions the availability of water resources and the net benefit parameters the greater water allocation and unit net benefit will generate more economic benefits similarly the results demonstrate that the lower p level would increase the system inequity in contrast decisions at higher p levels lead to greater benefit and system equity but increased risk of constraint violations in summary from the above results it can be seen that this model can balance not only the benefits and risks of the system but also consider the tradeoff between the profits of the sub region and the overall equity of water distribution under the condition of considering interval and random multiple uncertainties fig 7 shows the total optimal water allocation amount results for different sub regions of scenario 3 i e p 0 1 under different flow levels as shown in the figure as it is clear that the total water allocation amount under the runoff flow levels of extreme wet wet normal dry nevertheless when the flow level is extremely dry there is no feasible solution of the dr bimp model this is because the minimum water requirements cannot be met for the extreme dry flow level due to the lowest total surface water availability and the water demand increased combined with rapid population growth and economic growth in the djr basin besides from fig 7 it can be seen that both the upper bound and the lower bound of each sub region allocation results under extreme wet and wet flow levels equal to their corresponding target values that means the water demand amount of each sub region in wet and extreme wet flow levels can easily be satisfied in this case the dr bimp model seems ineffective because the decision makers can fully allocate the maximum amount of water according to the sector s water demand however in other flow levels the developed model could be effective 4 2 effectiveness and reliability of the model in this study in order to better reflect the effectiveness and reliability of the dr bimp model multiple models were introduced for comparison to help decision makers make the best decision schemes when decision makers focus more on individual goals such as the objective function of maximizing system benefits or maximizing system allocation equity the dr bimp model could be transformed into a single objective model with the same constraints under five scenarios p 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 of course it is also possible for water resource managers to put more emphasis on multiple objectives simultaneously with the same input parameters of the interval stochastic and deterministic as the original model therefore four optimization models that originated from the dr bimp model are described as shown in table 3 after coding these models in optimization software the objective values of different optimization models can be obtained as shown in fig 8 a c in terms of the system economic benefit as shown in fig 8a apparently that the function value of model 1 model 4 dr bimp model model 3 model 2 model 1 with the largest value and the result will be increased from 22 447 33 27 893 44 108 cny to 23 305 77 28 001 06 108 cny which is considerably upper than others model on the contrary while that of model 2 with the smallest value will be increased from 15 278 57 19 790 58 108 cny to 18 170 26 25 324 02 108 cny under the scenarios from p 0 01 to p 0 2 nevertheless as can be seen in fig 8b the result of the system water allocation equity represents a contrary trend gini coefficient value of model 2 is the smallest and decreases from 0 313 0 376 to 0 310 0 373 under the increase of p levels indicating that the allocation result of model 2 is the fairest while that of model 1 and model 4 are inequity accordingly as far as the single objective model is concerned the realization of high system benefits will inevitably lead to the generation of system unfairness the same phenomenon also appears in fig 8c fig 8c presents the economic profits of each sub region resulting from the four models and the dr bimp model under a range of p levels in terms of the overall outcome model 1 and model 4 have better results while the dr bimp model is in an intermediate position similar to the previous two results simultaneously in order to more intuitively identify the advantages of the dr bimp model a detailed comparison of the dr bimp model with the other four different optimization models was carried out to calculate the relevant rate of change take the two systemic goals of the upper level decision making as an example and the specific growth rate change results are shown in fig 9 first of all in considering the economic benefits of the system the ability of the dr bimp model is weaker than that of model 1 and model 4 from scenario 1 to scenario 5 the increase rate of model 1 has changed from 5 55 7 99 to 1 85 4 55 while the increase of model 4 has changed from 2 49 4 01 to 1 34 2 34 and it can be found that the increase of model 1 is more obvious but compared to model 2 and model 3 the dr bimp model has stronger capabilities on the other hand when considering the goal of system fairness on the contrary the ability of the dr bimp model is stronger than that of model 1 and model 4 specifically from scenario 1 to scenario 5 the growth rates of model 1 are 8 75 20 81 6 41 11 78 5 47 12 74 3 99 5 77 and 1 95 2 44 respectively however model 2 has the strongest ability in this respect which means that its changes are the most obvious this is because the two decision making goals of economic benefits and social equity are completely contradictory that is the changes between the two are inversely proportional so the above mentioned trend of changes has appeared to sum up it can clearly be found that the model can obtain the required optimal target value when single objective planning was carried out but only so for example model 1 and model 2 can only obtain the required optimal target value while lacking consideration for the goals of other aspects nevertheless the multi objective programming model can balance the objectives of multiple levels and take into account the interests of all aspects while being comprehensive without a doubt the solutions of model 3 are better than its corresponding sub model 1 model 1 and sub model 2 model 2 despite model 3 and model 4 correspond to the upper and lower decision objectives of the dr bimp model respectively while the results obtained by the dr bimp model are closer to the results of model 3 it is shown that the dr bimp model not only has the advantages of balancing multi objective programming but also can effectively reflect the bi level hierarchical relationship between the upper and lower decision makers in the decision making process in addition the dr bimp model can be transformed into a deterministic bmop model by converting all input parameters to deterministic when random and interval uncertainties were not considered that means ignoring the standard deviation of random numbers and taking the mean of interval parameters therefore table 4 shows the results through solving the deterministic bmop nevertheless from the results it can be seen that the deterministic bmop model can only obtain a single solution moreover the system benefit and the gini coefficient of the bmop model are 25 277 80 108 cny and 0 403 which belong to the interval decision range of the dr bimp model the same is true for the economic profits of each sub region so this solution can be considered as a special solution of the dr bimp model however it usually involves many uncertainties in the actual water resource management process and the deterministic bmop model will encounter obstacles in the deal with these problems therefore compared with the bmop model the dr bimp model established in this study not only can reflect more interval and random uncertain information but also can achieve a tradeoff the relationship between the system decision objectives and the risk of a chance constraint violation moreover the decision maker can simultaneously obtain more effective and flexible feasible solutions according to different violation probability scenarios in summary compared with the deterministic bmop model the dr bimp model has more practical applicability and flexibility 5 conclusions in this research a dr bimp model is developed for regional water resources management among multiple water sectors under complexities and uncertainties the study is an innovative method to couple the bi level multi objective programming double sided stochastic chance constrained programming and interval parameter programming into an integrated modeling framework to achieve considering the complexities and uncertainties of water resources management system it thus improves upon the existing bi level multi objective programming by addressing discrete interval parameters and double sided stochastic problems of constraints in optimization processes simultaneously compared to previous studies the comprehensive model framework has the following advantages 1 it can effectively deal with the interaction effects between multiple decision makers in complex water management systems through the bi level hierarchical strategies 2 it can characterize the interval dual randomness uncertain information expressed as interval format and probability density functions 3 and it can provide desired water resources allocation schemes under multiple constraints violated probability levels to illustrate the applicability of the developed comprehensive framework the dr bimp model was applied to a real world case to optimally allocate available water resources among three water use sectors in five sub regions in the djr basin south china the goals of the upper level decision maker the djr basin authority were to maximize the system s economic benefit and maximize the system s water allocation equity the goals of the lower level managers were to maximize the economic profits of themselves then through the proposed comprehensive solution method the optimal results of the dr bimp model under multiple flow levels and different risk violation scenarios can provide reliable guidance and suggestions for managers moreover by comparing with the other models originated from the developed model under the same constraints the comparison shows better performance in making balance the interaction effects between two level decision makers similarly according to the comparison results of the deterministic bmop model can highlight and emphasize the practical applicability and flexibility of the established model based on the results of the dr bimp model and comparison results it thus can assist the bi level decision makers to identify the desired water resources allocation schemes in the studying basin there are still limitations in practical applications in this research due to the simplified processing of basic data in the early stage only the water demand of domestic industrial and agricultural was emphasized the ecological water demand of the study area was not considered because it was very small which may violate the requirements of coordination and sustainable development between society economy and environment resulting in environmental degradation and resource shortage therefore in future practical research the system boundary

1421,diffuse groundwater contamination by intense fertilizer use is a widespread problem in most of the agricultural regions in west europe and in many other countries worldwide as a result elevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater are found and as groundwater is the source of baseflow into rivers and streams also surface waters show increased nitrate levels flanders in the north of belgium is no exception and despite restrictions on the fertilizer use and remediation practices initiated in the mid 1990s and still ongoing in many stream monitoring points peak concentrations are measured above the 50 mg l criterium in many monitoring stations there is apparently a long delay between the start of the restrictions and effect on water quality often this delay is related to high concentrations in the groundwater inflow and long residence and travel times of groundwater feeding the streams to better understand this behavior and estimate response times a tool was developed that incorporates the main water flows in a typical catchment and considers the effects of varying groundwater ages this tool is conceived as a parsimonious lumped parameter model simple and easy enough to be used by many people but still capturing the main mechanisms end processes in this paper the tool is explained and it is applied on two testcases in flanders to show its performance keywords model time lag nitrate pollution groundwater surface water interaction groundwater travel times 1 introduction agricultural land is a major source of nitrate contamination in groundwater and flanders belgium is no exception to that extensive studies in the past of nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater systems in different geographic regions in flanders and varied hydrogeological settings walraevens et al 2002 walraevens et al 2003 walraevens et al 2005 have identified the distribution patterns and controlling factors and mechanisms in agricultural areas elevated nitrate concentrations are found in most groundwater monitoring wells late 2018 showed in 32 5 of the monitoring wells an exceedance of the 50 mg l norm with an overall average concentration of around 35 mg l vlm 2020 as groundwater inflow in rivers and streams is year round a main contribution to surface water flow groundwater quality itself is a main factor for nitrate levels that are recorded in surface monitoring stations flow velocities of groundwater are low certainly compared to surface water flow and travel times between land parcels as the contamination source and streams as the receptors tend to be in the range of years to decades or even longer the efficacy of water quality policies aiming to reduce or prevent nitrate contamination of waterbodies may be constrained by the inherent delay or time lag of water and solute transport through unsaturated soil and saturated groundwater pathways vero et al 2017 surface water quality monitoring in flanders has revealed that in many control points no significant improvement in water quality are observed despite the fact that remediation measures has been started more than 20 years ago to explain this a thorough understanding of the hydrogeologic functioning of catchments and underlying aquifer systems is necessary to support this simulation models are helpful but are often very complicated and unsuitable for use by a wide range of people therefore there is a need for a simple tool based on parsimonious lumped parameter model but still capturing the main nitrate transport mechanisms and transport pathways including time delay caused by groundwater travel times starting around the year 2000 the flemish administration vmm implemented a monitoring network called map network on streams and rivers consisting of more than 850 sampling points monthly water samples are taken and concentrations of no3 no2 nh4 cl ortho po4 were analyzed and ec and ph and dissolved o2 were measured for most sampling points the time series are at the moment around 20 years long a few series are longer they started 10 years earlier and are therefore very interesting because they show typical concentration levels before restrictions on fertilizer use were implied data analyses allows for detecting long time trends seasonal fluctuations and inter yearly variations seasonality in time series can easily be recognized by plotting time as a fractional variable given the time in the year this way each analysis is positioned between the start of the year left axis and the end of the year right axis independent of the year of sampling fitting with a goniometric sinus function let easily recognize the average seasonal behavior but it should be kept in mind that no controlling process causes exact such a cyclic pattern many of the sampling points belong to two types fig 1 the first type is characterized by high winter nitrate concentrations often exceeding the 50 mg l norm while summer concentrations are much lower frequently no more than 10 to 20 mg l fig 1 top in this type of time series the long trend often shows an evolution where the winter maxima are decreasing over time this is especially the case in long time series starting earlier in the 1990s fig 2 these long series show very high nitrate levels during the 1990s when no or only very limited restrictions were implied concentration peaks at that time reached hundreds of mg l and indicates that in these period very high nitrate input also to the water table must have occurred the second type is the inverse of type 1 fig 1 bottom here nitrate concentrations are highest in summer period when 50 mg l can be exceeded but lower in winter these series usually do not show any decreasing trend of the summer maxima over the years as a final evaluation the type 1 points were considered as improving from the taken remediation measures limitation on allowed fertilizer amounts it was not understand why type 2 catchments did apparently not react to the restrictions crucial in the understanding of the nitrate distribution and transport in the subsurface is the difference between oxidation and reduction zones when reactive material like organic matter siemens et al 2003 and pyrite in marine sediments is present these will act as electron donors and cause reduction of present nitrate to nitrogen and nitrate will nearly disappear these reduction reactions are microbial remediated when no reactive material is present nitrate can spread with the groundwater flow and hydrodynamic dispersion will homogenize it as it moves downstream typically the upper part of the subsurface is oxidized containing high nitrate concentrations while the deeper part is reduced and nearly nitrate free the depth to which oxidized sediments occur depends on the lithology of the subsurface which is related to the geological and hydrostratigraphical structure and characteristics of the groundwater reservoir differences in thickness of the oxidation layer can result in large differences in nitrate distribution in the groundwater fig 3 this difference will also have its impact on the nitrate contribution from baseflow into streams around and under a stream in the riparian zone radial and upward groundwater flow components will prevail not also draining lateral groundwater but also deeper upwelling water baseflow always consists of a mix of oxidized water from the oxidation zone which can contain high nitrate levels and deeper nitrate free water from the reduction zone the mix ratios depend on the hydrogeological setting thickness of the oxidation layer and the groundwater flow it is possible to recognize typical hydrogeological setups based on the geological map and knowledge of the composition of the sediments and map them on a regional scale this has been done in flanders in a map containing hydrogeological homogeneous zones called the hhz map walraevens et al 2002 eppinger 2008 to help understand the relation between the mechanisms and processes that control nitrate distributions in the groundwater system and the concentrations that have been measured in the monitoring stations of the vmm network on the rivers a tool was needed that could quantify the impact of changes in agricultural practices on the nitrate concentrations leaching to the groundwater system and later on the monitoring stations the tool must account for the delayed response due to slow groundwater transport on the other side the tool must be simple enough that it would be easy to use and fast to apply on a catchment the proposed tool is a lumped parameter model that requires a minimal set of parameters but is able to reproduce the main characteristics of nitrate variations in the surface water monitoring stations like multi year trends and seasonal fluctuations the intention of the model was to develop a tool usable by a wide diversity of people not only experienced modelers as it will be used on the administration level 2 methods and materials 2 1 groundwater travel times and ages groundwater travel times and ages are important as they can cause a time lag between remediation measures and changes in contaminant input concentrations at the land surface and resulting effects on river baseflow concentrations vero et al 2017 wang et al 2016 in a river catchment subsurface water moves along flowlines which start at the water table at the point where the water table is being recharged by infiltrating rain water to the point where the groundwater is discharged into streams and flows out of the catchments river flow as the groundwater moves further it gets older so along flowlines there is a steady increase in age the age of the water when it finally reaches the stream depends on the length of the flow line and the groundwater flow velocity along the flowpath groundwater flow velocities are slow much slower than flow velocities in streams and rivers a typical velocity range is a few meters to a few tens of meters a year the shortest flowlines just start besides streams the longest ones depend on the size of the catchment long flowlines can be as long as kilometers as result each catchment contains a mix of groundwater ages from very recently infiltrated water to sometimes decades or centuries old water groundwater travel times can be derived analytically for simple generic aquifers or numerically for more complex aquifer systems basu et al 2012 jindal 2010 for a generic schematization of a one layer aquifer system between two discharging streams analytical formulations have been developed to compute groundwater flow and travel times and ages meinardi 1994 bruggeman 1999 ernst 1973 developed a solution based on the work of de vries 1967 which takes into account radial flow around the stream and is valid for d l 0 1 brot 2016 t x βd n ln l 2 d 2 x πd 2 l where t x travel time at distance x t d thickness of aquifer layer l l distance between streams l n average groundwater recharge l t β porosity of the aquifer groundwater flow models combined with flowpath tracing programs like the much used modflow modpath combination can easily trace thousands of flowlines and calculate associated travel times also in more complex hydrostratigraphical settings these calculations show that groundwater ages usually follow an exponential distribution which is mathematically rather simple defined as it is a single parameter model using a single parameter lambda the pdf probability density function and cdf cumulative distribution function of the exponential distribution are given by fig 4 pdf λ e λx cdf 1 λ e λx it should be noticed that the average of an exponential distribution is different from the median value mean 1 λ median ln 2 λ fig 5 shows the fitting of an empirical travel time cdf curve obtained with a modflow modpath flow model of test site peer a small catchment in northeastern flanders this test site is not presented in this paper with the exponential distribution model which yields a lambda value of 0 0409 this lambda value is corresponding with a mean groundwater residence time 1 0 0409 or 24 45 years and a median groundwater age of 16 87 years once the lambda value obtained it can e g easily seen that 30 of the groundwater in this catchment has an age of more than 30 years the average groundwater age in a catchment can also be obtained from a mass balance calculation using the average recharge rate of the area which controls the replenishment rate and the volume of groundwater stored in the phreatic aquifer of the catchment which depends on its thickness and porosity haitjema 1995 mean age n x h r where n porosity of phreatic aquifer h thickness of phreatic aquifer l r average recharge rate l t once the mean groundwater age is estimated this way the value of lambda can be calculated with the equation of the cdf curve and the groundwater age distribution in the catchment is defined 2 2 delayed response using the exponential distribution model the concentration observed at a catchment outlet is the combination of contributions from all flowlines that enter the stream s as these streamlines have varying lengths and travel times a delay in response between changing input concentrations and measured outlet concentrations is observed as nitrate input from the land surface will largely depend on crop and soil characteristics the input can be very heterogenous and should be considered on a land parcel level the relation between individual land parcels where the flowlines start and the stream segments where the flowlines end will require tracing lots of pathlines to do this accurately a groundwater flow model would be required in catchments with many land parcels with mixed nitrate input a more statistical approach can be followed instead of generating and using individual pathlines a zonal nitrate input function can be defined which gives the average nitrate input over time for the catchment or part of the catchment and instead of using ages for individual pathlines the exponential distribution can be used to develop a digital filter whose coefficients consist of the values read from the pdf curve of groundwater ages for that catchment or sub catchment using its characteristic lambda value the concentrations at the catchment outlet can then be obtained by simple convolution of the nitrate input time function with the digital filter f g t 0 t f τ g t τ dτ where f τ nitrate input time series g t τ digital filter f g t nitrate conc at catchment outlet this approach has also been proposed and applied by van meter and basu 2015 and van meter 2016 convolution works with discrete time series so the digital filter is developed for a chosen time step like years or months the input concentration series should be provided with the same discretization e g yearly or monthly values or averages the resulting output series is then obtained with the same time steps as groundwater travel times usually are in the range of years or decades sometimes even centuries a filter to work with yearly time steps may often be a good choice 2 3 model description the model is a simple pragmatic tool easily applicable by a wide range of people therefore a parsimonious lumped parameter model was developed which is not based on a distributed but zonal approach the model simulates baseflow nitrate concentrations at the outlet of a catchment not nitrate distributions in the aquifer system itself it does not include a specific runoff component but runoff can be calculated separately and specified on a monthly basis the relation between the different model components is visualized in fig 6 and can help understanding the following description of the model components 2 3 1 spatial discretization the model is not a distributed model based on a grid discretization but uses a zonal approach a catchment can be subdivided in a limited number of zones for each the baseflow flux and nitrate concentration is calculated and the total flux and concentration at the outlet of the catchment is quantified from the contributions of each zone 2 3 2 root zone and unsaturated zone component this component computes the nitrate leaching from the land surface down to the water table it uses the eu rotate n model which enables the assessment of the economic and environmental performance of nitrogen applied to crop rotations in either conventional or organic cropping for a wide range of crops and growing conditions in europe the model can simulate root development the mineralization and release of n from soil organic matter and crop residues the effect of freezing conditions and water movement rahn et al 2010 eu rotate n is a very flexible model with a wide range of capabilities that has been applied on many field cases in different settings and conditions input data soil characteristics crops fertilizer use are available on parcel based resolution because parcel boundaries may change over time the input data are mapped onto a regular grid then the eu rotate n model is run for every grid point resulting in a time series of water nitrogen fluxes and nitrate concentrations over time these grid points series are aggregated to obtain zonal average nitrate input functions at the level of the water table meteorological conditions are entered as daily measured values in nearby stations information related to crops and fertilizer use were obtained from the flemish administration other information like soil texture is available as digital maps 2 3 3 saturated zone component water flow below the water table is treated by fractioning over 3 flow components fig 6 which are with increasing depth shallow water that is captured by drains q1 drains are usually 0 5 to 1 m below ground level and are mostly only working in winter time when water table is high drain water is discharged very fast into a nearby stream so transfer times are very short and are neglected on the scale of the time discretization used in the model groundwater flow through the oxidation zone q2 this water is oxidized and can contain nitrates for this component the groundwater travel times are computed using an exponential age distribution with lambda value that can be given for every zone to define a digital filter used to convolute the input nitrate time series groundwater flow through the reduction zone q3 this water is reduced and contains no nitrates as they have been reduced by reactive material electron donors transport times of this component is not important groundwater recharge at the water table is obtained from the results of the eu rotate n model the quantification of the 3 components is by fractioning coefficients which define the fraction of the recharge that is drained away directly fr drn and the partition of the remaining flux over the oxidation fr ox and reduction zone the 3 components can then be computed with where flux is the groundwater recharge q1 flux fr drn q2 flux 1 fr drn fr ox q3 flux 1 fr drn 1 fr ox where flux the groundwater recharge calculated by the eu rotate n model and fr drn 1 fr drn fr ox 1 fr drn 1 fr ox 1 baseflow flux and nitrate concentration for each zone are then calculated by using the contributions for each component 2 3 4 time discretization the model uses a dual time discretization approach it is based on yearly time steps but allow refinement by applying monthly time weighting factors for some fluxes and contributions monthly factors for aquifer recharge river baseflow and discharge by drains distribute year totals over the 12 months to obtain a pseudo seasonal behavior these monthly factors must be given by the user and are not computed by the model they also remain constant over the whole simulation period this allows the model to reproduce average seasonal variations summarizing the input data of the model use yearly values while the output is produced with monthly values this approach allows to obtain detailed output with a minimum of data input the monthly distribution coefficients can be estimated or obtained from other calculations and analysis not included in the model itself monthly coefficients for groundwater recharge are based on calculations with a soil moisture balance model for different places all over flanders monthly values of groundwater recharge were averaged and normalized to obtain the relative distribution over the year however groundwater recharge itself is varying from year to year as it is calculated by the eu rotate n model monthly coefficients for baseflow are based on results of the modflow models that has been made for 3 of the 10 test sites these models are transient flow models on a monthly basis and reproduce the seasonal variations in groundwater flow and also baseflow to the river network monthly river drainage was averaged and normalized also river discharge flow rates at some monitoring stations were processed minimum daily flow rates in each month were considered as a approximation of the baseflow but these series are only available for larger catchments monthly coefficients for drain discharge are derived from in situ observations and measurements on selected drains most of the rains only work in winter time the contributions of drains with nitrate rich and reduced nitrate free water is derived from nitrate concentration measurements of drain water with a reflectometer all these monthly coefficients are kept constant over the whole simulation period this feature is implemented this way to minimize the amount of input data and was a designer choice 2 3 5 groundwater travel times travel times of groundwater through the oxidation zone is calculated by convolution using a digital filter designed to work with yearly time steps the eu rotate n model is operated with daily time steps but the water and nitrate flux leaking to the water table is accumulated to yearly totals which are passed to the saturated zone model component in geological settings with thick unsaturated zones like hills build up by permeable sands or chalk aquifers with high hydraulic conductivity travel times through the vadose zone can increase significantly orban et al 2010 mattern 2009 in the model a time delay in the vadose zone can be specified which is added to the travel times before use in the convolution process 2 3 6 travel time through the unsaturated zone specially in hilly regions where the hills are buildup of sands with high hydraulic conductivity the water table can be very deep on the top of the hills in flanders this is e g the case in the brabant region where hills consisting of oxidized sands formation of brussels show water table depths up to 30 or even 40 m travel times through the vadose zone can add up to years in these cases indicative travel times for these situations were obtained by doing simulations with the variable saturation model hydrus 1d using 4 different soil textures coarse sand fine sand loamy sand and loam based on typical values for the hydraulic parameters and for an increasing depth of the water table 5 10 20 30 40 m the travel time of a nitrate front from leaching from the soil profile down to the water table was derived from the concentration at the bottom outlet of the vertical column model these travel times were used to fit for each of the 4 soil textures a relation curve between water table depth and travel time in the model an average delay in the thick vadose zone can be added if necessary to the groundwater travel time in the saturated zone the added travel time can be estimated from the 4 fitted curves and a known or measured average value of the water table depth 2 3 7 local denitrification in the riparian zone it was observed that in some settings groundwater seeping out in the riparian zone seems to have been reduced by organic matter removing nearly all nitrate and increasing bicarbonate concentration in the model this local nitrate reduction is activated by a single fractioning coefficient 2 3 8 runoff concentrations at the catchment outlet are not only dependent on groundwater contributions but also on runoff after rain events runoff will cause dilution and thus lower the calculated nitrate concentrations the model itself does not include a module to calculate runoff but monthly peak flow amounts can be defined for the simulation period and are used in the calculation of the monthly concentrations these monthly runoff depths can be calculated with a separate runoff model or approximated from rainfall data and a runoff coefficient however peak flow contribution is strongly variable on a daily basis as is daily rainfall to accurately account for runoff the model should work with daily time steps which is at the moment not the case in measured nitrate time series sometimes abnormal low concentrations show up which are striking in periods with high nitrate levels these measurements are always coupled at heavy rainy events but can never be reproduced by the model 2 3 9 model output model output is in monthly steps and includes both fluxes of the different water flow components like aquifer recharge drain discharge groundwater contribution from the oxidized and from the reduction zone as concentrations of each contribution 2 4 calibration of the model some of the parameters of the model are difficult to exactly quantify from field observations and measurements and need to be finetuned by calibration of the model the calculated concentrations are very sensitive to the fractioning parameter for drain contribution fr drn if there are drains in the catchment of course and to the fractioning of oxidation and reduction zones fr ox the initial fr drn parameter value can be based on drain discharge measurements but these can usually only be done in winter time for the fr ox parameter the lithologic and hydrostratigraphic buildup of the catchment can be checked together with groundwater analyses specifically the concentration of redox species iron from this information the depth position of the oxidation reduction boundary can be set from this position and the total thickness of the phreatic aquifer layer the relative contribution to the total groundwater flow as estimated initial values were further adjusted doing runs with the model and comparing with the measured series but is turned out that using criteria like the rmse values for selecting the best fit did not always give the best visual agreement of the series visual inspection and control of the results was always necessary therefore the calibration was done using trial and error and not by a fully automated optimization algorithm a preference was given to obtain a good fit for the seasonal fluctuations instead of an overall best fit a special problem causes runoff as it is not properly included in the model but can severely affect the concentrations in the rivers runoff causes dilution and is therefore seen as measurements with abnormal low nitrate concentration on the graphs however runoff is not a continuous contribution like baseflow but only occurs significantly after heavy rain events peakflow also decreases fast once the rain event is finished unlike variations in baseflow which act on a longer time scale based on daily precipitation data in roeselare a meteorological station close to the luikbeek test site only 6 2 of the days have a rainfall of more than 10 mm which must be able to generate an important runoff contribution data from 2008 to 2021 that is 22 6 rainy days year or only 1 88 say 2 days a month the nitrate concentrations at the monitoring points are measured once a month so the chance that this happens during a heavy rainy day is rather small reasoning the monitoring planner does not try to avoid bad weather therefore in many series only 1 or 2 values a year a clearly abnormal low because the model calibration was done with trial and error and not by automatic matching these outliers do not necessarily disturb the calibration process 2 5 application on testcases the model has been applied on 10 testcases spread all over flanders and selected in different hydrogeological settings fig 7 the results of 2 sites located in staden test site 1 and wortegem petegem test site 2 are presented here at the outlet of each catchment is a monitoring station which records monthly values of nitrate concentration and some other chemical parameters these series are now ca 20 years long 2 5 1 testcase 1 site with winter peaks and summer lows 2 5 1 1 hydrogeological setting and model input the first test site shows at its outlet high nitrate concentrations in winter time and low in summer period this case is located in the community of staden in the province of west flanders and consists of the molenbeek stream catchment the subsurface consists of a thin cover of quaternary sediments 2 to 3 m thick loamy sandy material underlaid with around 10 m of tertiary marine sands formation of tielt below these sands is a thick compact tertiary clay layer formation of kortrijk which can be considered here as no flow substratum the catchment is located on the east side of a topographic ridge which rises to 20 m above the stream level where the sands of the tielt formation have a larger thickness the molenbeek stream flows to the north as is the general groundwater flow the molenbeek also drains groundwater from the east side of the ridge drillings and water analyses show that nitrate is only found at shallow depth the upper 2 m deeper groundwater is reduced and contains dissolved iron from this it can be concluded that the tertiary sands contain enough reactive material in the form of pyrite to promote nitrate reduction the site has a thin oxidized layer on top max 2 m and a thicker deeper reduction layer below it ca 10 m thick most of the groundwater inflow into the stream will have passed through the reduction layer some of the land parcels have drains to lower water table in winter time these drains tap water from the upper oxidized layer in the quaternary sands measurements of nitrate in drain water confirm concentrations above 100 mg l the downstream monitoring point on the molenbeek stream shows high nitrate levels in winter time but low to very low values in summer period the two main controlling contributions of nitrate to the stream is a low concentration inflow of deeper groundwater and seasonal winter inflow of drain water with high nitrate input combination of both cause a very strong seasonal behavior with low summer concentrations of course the discharge rate of the stream is also much lower in summer the upstream part usually runs dry by that time fractioning coefficients and time weighting factors were optimized using trial and error by fitting calculated and measured nitrate concentrations for the period after 2000 when the monitoring station started the used parameters in the presented simulation may not represent the best possible fitting therefore an automated optimization routine should be used 2 5 2 testcase 2 site with winter lows and summer peaks 2 5 2 1 hydrogeological setting and model input the second test site shows at its outlet the opposite pattern than the first site here high nitrate concentrations are measured in summer time and low in winter this site is located in the community of wortegem petegem in the province of east flanders the catchment is the small upstream waterhead of the molenbeek stream which lies on the east side of a large more than 10 km long northeast southwest oriented hill that consists of marine tertiary sands lying on a thick clay substratum the molenbeek valley runs between two hills rising 20 to 30 m above the valley floor in the hills the tertiary sand are to a large depth oxidized and contain nitrate rich water that has infiltrated locally and has flushed the original water over a decade long time period when intense fertilizer use has caused high nitrate influx despite the restrictions ongoing since the mid 1990s the groundwater in the hills still form a nitrate rich reservoir feeding continuous the molenbeek river 3 results and discussion 3 1 testcase 1 site with winter peaks and summer lows the simulation period is 50 years long the eu rotate n model calculated the water flux and nitrate leaching on a grid with a discretization of 50 m these values were accumulated to an average input function for the whole catchment fig 8a and b the recharge flux depends on the meteorological conditions rainfall and evapotranspiration and change from year to year between 100 mm year in dry years up to ca 300 mm year in wet years with an average of around 180 mm year recognizable are the wet years around 2000 which show 5 subsequent wet years with above average recharge the calculated average nitrate concentration in the water table recharge flux averaged over the entire catchment fig 8b shows a period with much higher values starting in the 1970s till the mid 1990s when the first restrictions on fertilizer use were implemented the concentrations exceeded 1000 mg l in some years during wet years concentrations are lower the last decade concentrations have seriously dropped they are the lowest in the last 50 years but are still higher above 50 mg l nitrate concentrations at the outlet of the catchment are available since 2000 they are plotted together with the measurements in fig 8c the calculated concentrations in the whole simulated period of 50 years are shown in fig 8d comparison of calculated and measured baseflow concentrations fig 8c shows that the seasonal pattern is reproduced both model and monitoring show high peaks around the year 2005 and lower peaks since 2008 but even then the peaks reach values above 50 mg l discrepancy for individual peaks can be caused by several reasons in the model the fractioning coefficients remain constant in time for example the fraction of groundwater recharge that is discharged through drains remain the same in the whole period when changes in the drains have occurred drains abandoned new drains installed it is not possible to represent this in the model on the other side usually these changes are also not known only the actual recent situation can be checked also the time weighting factors monthly coefficients remain constant over time from year to year for example one series of 12 values defines how the drains are working during the year e g high at the end of the winter season when water table is high but this will depend on the rainfall in each year the given coefficients are for an average meteorological year it is a simplification in the model that has been maintained to reduce the amount of input data 3 2 testcase 2 site with winter lows and summer peaks 3 2 1 results and discussion the measured concentrations at the catchment outlet are plotted in fig 9a there is a strong seasonality with summer heights reaching values which are typically at least ca 70 to 80 mg l the winter lows are often round 50 mg l but drop some years to lower values this is a monitoring point which shows nearly always exceedance of the 50 mg l norm and is therefore very problematic the seasonality graph fig 9b where individual analyses are plotted in function of the fractional time in the year and a fitted cyclic sinus curve as a generic seasonal variation function shows that while average winter values are only marginally above 50 mg l in summer they rise to 80 to 90 mg l the root zone model calculates the yearly average groundwater recharge flux fig 9c with an average of 163 mm year over the 50 year simulation period year values mostly lie between 100 and 300 mm year the average nitrate concentration of the recharge fig 9d is 312 mg l for the whole 50 year but periods with high and low concentration alternate in some years in the 1990s they exceeded 600 mg l the last 10 years average concentration has decreased to ca 155 mg l which reflect the ongoing restrictions on fertilizer use this site is an example where the inflowing groundwater has high nitrate concentrations often around 100 mg l which comes from the neighboring hills which have thick oxidized layers on top filled with old nitrate rich water this is observed in multi level monitoring wells around the catchment these show high ca 100 mg l nitrate concentrations in the main part of the sandy sediments in the hills nitrate rich groundwater that seeps out in the wet riparian zone undergoes local nitrate reduction by organic matter this process was identified in half of shallow wells that were installed along the stream nitrate is here nearly absent while bicarbonate concentration is elevated it is defined that half of the seeping groundwater undergoes this reduction because the catchment is located between hillslopes runoff can be important especially in winter when the soil is saturated this runoff may cause a short but intense dilution which is seen in the measurements as the very low concentrations that were recorded some but not all years runoff is added in the model as a fraction of the rainfall measured in the closest meteorological station runoff is quantified with monthly fractions ranging between 1 and 20 the fractioning between oxidation and reduction zone was the only parameter that was estimated during calibration it was expected that most of the groundwater came from the oxidation zone in the neighboring hills a value of 70 contribution from the oxidation zone and the remaining 30 from the reduction zone was obtained the model calculated baseflow concentrations are also included in fig 9a and show the seasonal behavior is reproduced by the model discrepancies in winter lows exist especially before ca 2007 but these are likely related to runoff peaks that strongly dilute the water in the stream in a few summers higher than normal maxima were recorded in the first decade of monitoring which may be related to unknown and undocumented changes in the field situation in the past 4 summary and conclusion diffuse nitrate contamination because of intense fertilizer use often in the past is a common problem in agricultural areas as groundwater gets contaminated also baseflow towards rivers and streams is affected and in many catchments with important baseflow regimes bad surface water quality is found monitoring points on streams usually show a strong seasonal behavior but sometimes peak values occur in winter time and in some other settings in summer time effect of remediation measures are sometimes unnoticed or show long delays related to the long travel times along groundwater flowlines that connect nitrate input at parcel level and groundwater discharge in the streams years later to help understanding the behavior of such monitoring points and catchments a tool was developed implemented and tested on filed cases that calculates nitrate loading in the baseflow towards streams this tool has two components the first component is a state of the art nitrate leaching model for the root and vadose zone that will accurately calculate nitrate leaching at the parcel level using parcel specific characteristics the second component simulates the nitrate transport through the saturated zone this component follows a simple but straightforward approach by fractioning of the groundwater flow into 3 contributions and uses the concept of a groundwater age distribution based on the statistical exponential distribution model combined with the mathematical operation of convolution to incorporate delay of response times of the nitrate input series the modal is a lumped parameter zonal model not a distributed model it requires few parameters but is still able to reproduce the main seasonal variations in baseflow concentration this is demonstrated in this paper with two examples of real field cases in different hydrogeological settings and totally different temporal behavior from the modelling of 10 test sites it can be concluded that the main factors that control nitrate concentrations in the measuring points are in order of importance nitrate concentrations that leach out of the soil profile the model does not use the concentrations on individual land parcels but the average concentrations of a subdomain of the catchment or the whole catchment as a single subdomain fraction of groundwater recharge that is discharged through drains the fr drn fractioning parameter the fraction of the inflowing groundwater that comes from the oxidation zone and thus contains nitrate the fr ox fractioning parameter groundwater travel times if the fr ox fraction is high groundwater travel time in the saturated zone are only important in settings where there is a thick oxidized zone and the main inflow of groundwater into the river is from the oxidized zone so in cases where the fr ox parameter is high the age of water from the reduction zone is not relevant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research was carried out within the project nitrate rich sources impact

1421,diffuse groundwater contamination by intense fertilizer use is a widespread problem in most of the agricultural regions in west europe and in many other countries worldwide as a result elevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater are found and as groundwater is the source of baseflow into rivers and streams also surface waters show increased nitrate levels flanders in the north of belgium is no exception and despite restrictions on the fertilizer use and remediation practices initiated in the mid 1990s and still ongoing in many stream monitoring points peak concentrations are measured above the 50 mg l criterium in many monitoring stations there is apparently a long delay between the start of the restrictions and effect on water quality often this delay is related to high concentrations in the groundwater inflow and long residence and travel times of groundwater feeding the streams to better understand this behavior and estimate response times a tool was developed that incorporates the main water flows in a typical catchment and considers the effects of varying groundwater ages this tool is conceived as a parsimonious lumped parameter model simple and easy enough to be used by many people but still capturing the main mechanisms end processes in this paper the tool is explained and it is applied on two testcases in flanders to show its performance keywords model time lag nitrate pollution groundwater surface water interaction groundwater travel times 1 introduction agricultural land is a major source of nitrate contamination in groundwater and flanders belgium is no exception to that extensive studies in the past of nitrate concentrations in shallow groundwater systems in different geographic regions in flanders and varied hydrogeological settings walraevens et al 2002 walraevens et al 2003 walraevens et al 2005 have identified the distribution patterns and controlling factors and mechanisms in agricultural areas elevated nitrate concentrations are found in most groundwater monitoring wells late 2018 showed in 32 5 of the monitoring wells an exceedance of the 50 mg l norm with an overall average concentration of around 35 mg l vlm 2020 as groundwater inflow in rivers and streams is year round a main contribution to surface water flow groundwater quality itself is a main factor for nitrate levels that are recorded in surface monitoring stations flow velocities of groundwater are low certainly compared to surface water flow and travel times between land parcels as the contamination source and streams as the receptors tend to be in the range of years to decades or even longer the efficacy of water quality policies aiming to reduce or prevent nitrate contamination of waterbodies may be constrained by the inherent delay or time lag of water and solute transport through unsaturated soil and saturated groundwater pathways vero et al 2017 surface water quality monitoring in flanders has revealed that in many control points no significant improvement in water quality are observed despite the fact that remediation measures has been started more than 20 years ago to explain this a thorough understanding of the hydrogeologic functioning of catchments and underlying aquifer systems is necessary to support this simulation models are helpful but are often very complicated and unsuitable for use by a wide range of people therefore there is a need for a simple tool based on parsimonious lumped parameter model but still capturing the main nitrate transport mechanisms and transport pathways including time delay caused by groundwater travel times starting around the year 2000 the flemish administration vmm implemented a monitoring network called map network on streams and rivers consisting of more than 850 sampling points monthly water samples are taken and concentrations of no3 no2 nh4 cl ortho po4 were analyzed and ec and ph and dissolved o2 were measured for most sampling points the time series are at the moment around 20 years long a few series are longer they started 10 years earlier and are therefore very interesting because they show typical concentration levels before restrictions on fertilizer use were implied data analyses allows for detecting long time trends seasonal fluctuations and inter yearly variations seasonality in time series can easily be recognized by plotting time as a fractional variable given the time in the year this way each analysis is positioned between the start of the year left axis and the end of the year right axis independent of the year of sampling fitting with a goniometric sinus function let easily recognize the average seasonal behavior but it should be kept in mind that no controlling process causes exact such a cyclic pattern many of the sampling points belong to two types fig 1 the first type is characterized by high winter nitrate concentrations often exceeding the 50 mg l norm while summer concentrations are much lower frequently no more than 10 to 20 mg l fig 1 top in this type of time series the long trend often shows an evolution where the winter maxima are decreasing over time this is especially the case in long time series starting earlier in the 1990s fig 2 these long series show very high nitrate levels during the 1990s when no or only very limited restrictions were implied concentration peaks at that time reached hundreds of mg l and indicates that in these period very high nitrate input also to the water table must have occurred the second type is the inverse of type 1 fig 1 bottom here nitrate concentrations are highest in summer period when 50 mg l can be exceeded but lower in winter these series usually do not show any decreasing trend of the summer maxima over the years as a final evaluation the type 1 points were considered as improving from the taken remediation measures limitation on allowed fertilizer amounts it was not understand why type 2 catchments did apparently not react to the restrictions crucial in the understanding of the nitrate distribution and transport in the subsurface is the difference between oxidation and reduction zones when reactive material like organic matter siemens et al 2003 and pyrite in marine sediments is present these will act as electron donors and cause reduction of present nitrate to nitrogen and nitrate will nearly disappear these reduction reactions are microbial remediated when no reactive material is present nitrate can spread with the groundwater flow and hydrodynamic dispersion will homogenize it as it moves downstream typically the upper part of the subsurface is oxidized containing high nitrate concentrations while the deeper part is reduced and nearly nitrate free the depth to which oxidized sediments occur depends on the lithology of the subsurface which is related to the geological and hydrostratigraphical structure and characteristics of the groundwater reservoir differences in thickness of the oxidation layer can result in large differences in nitrate distribution in the groundwater fig 3 this difference will also have its impact on the nitrate contribution from baseflow into streams around and under a stream in the riparian zone radial and upward groundwater flow components will prevail not also draining lateral groundwater but also deeper upwelling water baseflow always consists of a mix of oxidized water from the oxidation zone which can contain high nitrate levels and deeper nitrate free water from the reduction zone the mix ratios depend on the hydrogeological setting thickness of the oxidation layer and the groundwater flow it is possible to recognize typical hydrogeological setups based on the geological map and knowledge of the composition of the sediments and map them on a regional scale this has been done in flanders in a map containing hydrogeological homogeneous zones called the hhz map walraevens et al 2002 eppinger 2008 to help understand the relation between the mechanisms and processes that control nitrate distributions in the groundwater system and the concentrations that have been measured in the monitoring stations of the vmm network on the rivers a tool was needed that could quantify the impact of changes in agricultural practices on the nitrate concentrations leaching to the groundwater system and later on the monitoring stations the tool must account for the delayed response due to slow groundwater transport on the other side the tool must be simple enough that it would be easy to use and fast to apply on a catchment the proposed tool is a lumped parameter model that requires a minimal set of parameters but is able to reproduce the main characteristics of nitrate variations in the surface water monitoring stations like multi year trends and seasonal fluctuations the intention of the model was to develop a tool usable by a wide diversity of people not only experienced modelers as it will be used on the administration level 2 methods and materials 2 1 groundwater travel times and ages groundwater travel times and ages are important as they can cause a time lag between remediation measures and changes in contaminant input concentrations at the land surface and resulting effects on river baseflow concentrations vero et al 2017 wang et al 2016 in a river catchment subsurface water moves along flowlines which start at the water table at the point where the water table is being recharged by infiltrating rain water to the point where the groundwater is discharged into streams and flows out of the catchments river flow as the groundwater moves further it gets older so along flowlines there is a steady increase in age the age of the water when it finally reaches the stream depends on the length of the flow line and the groundwater flow velocity along the flowpath groundwater flow velocities are slow much slower than flow velocities in streams and rivers a typical velocity range is a few meters to a few tens of meters a year the shortest flowlines just start besides streams the longest ones depend on the size of the catchment long flowlines can be as long as kilometers as result each catchment contains a mix of groundwater ages from very recently infiltrated water to sometimes decades or centuries old water groundwater travel times can be derived analytically for simple generic aquifers or numerically for more complex aquifer systems basu et al 2012 jindal 2010 for a generic schematization of a one layer aquifer system between two discharging streams analytical formulations have been developed to compute groundwater flow and travel times and ages meinardi 1994 bruggeman 1999 ernst 1973 developed a solution based on the work of de vries 1967 which takes into account radial flow around the stream and is valid for d l 0 1 brot 2016 t x βd n ln l 2 d 2 x πd 2 l where t x travel time at distance x t d thickness of aquifer layer l l distance between streams l n average groundwater recharge l t β porosity of the aquifer groundwater flow models combined with flowpath tracing programs like the much used modflow modpath combination can easily trace thousands of flowlines and calculate associated travel times also in more complex hydrostratigraphical settings these calculations show that groundwater ages usually follow an exponential distribution which is mathematically rather simple defined as it is a single parameter model using a single parameter lambda the pdf probability density function and cdf cumulative distribution function of the exponential distribution are given by fig 4 pdf λ e λx cdf 1 λ e λx it should be noticed that the average of an exponential distribution is different from the median value mean 1 λ median ln 2 λ fig 5 shows the fitting of an empirical travel time cdf curve obtained with a modflow modpath flow model of test site peer a small catchment in northeastern flanders this test site is not presented in this paper with the exponential distribution model which yields a lambda value of 0 0409 this lambda value is corresponding with a mean groundwater residence time 1 0 0409 or 24 45 years and a median groundwater age of 16 87 years once the lambda value obtained it can e g easily seen that 30 of the groundwater in this catchment has an age of more than 30 years the average groundwater age in a catchment can also be obtained from a mass balance calculation using the average recharge rate of the area which controls the replenishment rate and the volume of groundwater stored in the phreatic aquifer of the catchment which depends on its thickness and porosity haitjema 1995 mean age n x h r where n porosity of phreatic aquifer h thickness of phreatic aquifer l r average recharge rate l t once the mean groundwater age is estimated this way the value of lambda can be calculated with the equation of the cdf curve and the groundwater age distribution in the catchment is defined 2 2 delayed response using the exponential distribution model the concentration observed at a catchment outlet is the combination of contributions from all flowlines that enter the stream s as these streamlines have varying lengths and travel times a delay in response between changing input concentrations and measured outlet concentrations is observed as nitrate input from the land surface will largely depend on crop and soil characteristics the input can be very heterogenous and should be considered on a land parcel level the relation between individual land parcels where the flowlines start and the stream segments where the flowlines end will require tracing lots of pathlines to do this accurately a groundwater flow model would be required in catchments with many land parcels with mixed nitrate input a more statistical approach can be followed instead of generating and using individual pathlines a zonal nitrate input function can be defined which gives the average nitrate input over time for the catchment or part of the catchment and instead of using ages for individual pathlines the exponential distribution can be used to develop a digital filter whose coefficients consist of the values read from the pdf curve of groundwater ages for that catchment or sub catchment using its characteristic lambda value the concentrations at the catchment outlet can then be obtained by simple convolution of the nitrate input time function with the digital filter f g t 0 t f τ g t τ dτ where f τ nitrate input time series g t τ digital filter f g t nitrate conc at catchment outlet this approach has also been proposed and applied by van meter and basu 2015 and van meter 2016 convolution works with discrete time series so the digital filter is developed for a chosen time step like years or months the input concentration series should be provided with the same discretization e g yearly or monthly values or averages the resulting output series is then obtained with the same time steps as groundwater travel times usually are in the range of years or decades sometimes even centuries a filter to work with yearly time steps may often be a good choice 2 3 model description the model is a simple pragmatic tool easily applicable by a wide range of people therefore a parsimonious lumped parameter model was developed which is not based on a distributed but zonal approach the model simulates baseflow nitrate concentrations at the outlet of a catchment not nitrate distributions in the aquifer system itself it does not include a specific runoff component but runoff can be calculated separately and specified on a monthly basis the relation between the different model components is visualized in fig 6 and can help understanding the following description of the model components 2 3 1 spatial discretization the model is not a distributed model based on a grid discretization but uses a zonal approach a catchment can be subdivided in a limited number of zones for each the baseflow flux and nitrate concentration is calculated and the total flux and concentration at the outlet of the catchment is quantified from the contributions of each zone 2 3 2 root zone and unsaturated zone component this component computes the nitrate leaching from the land surface down to the water table it uses the eu rotate n model which enables the assessment of the economic and environmental performance of nitrogen applied to crop rotations in either conventional or organic cropping for a wide range of crops and growing conditions in europe the model can simulate root development the mineralization and release of n from soil organic matter and crop residues the effect of freezing conditions and water movement rahn et al 2010 eu rotate n is a very flexible model with a wide range of capabilities that has been applied on many field cases in different settings and conditions input data soil characteristics crops fertilizer use are available on parcel based resolution because parcel boundaries may change over time the input data are mapped onto a regular grid then the eu rotate n model is run for every grid point resulting in a time series of water nitrogen fluxes and nitrate concentrations over time these grid points series are aggregated to obtain zonal average nitrate input functions at the level of the water table meteorological conditions are entered as daily measured values in nearby stations information related to crops and fertilizer use were obtained from the flemish administration other information like soil texture is available as digital maps 2 3 3 saturated zone component water flow below the water table is treated by fractioning over 3 flow components fig 6 which are with increasing depth shallow water that is captured by drains q1 drains are usually 0 5 to 1 m below ground level and are mostly only working in winter time when water table is high drain water is discharged very fast into a nearby stream so transfer times are very short and are neglected on the scale of the time discretization used in the model groundwater flow through the oxidation zone q2 this water is oxidized and can contain nitrates for this component the groundwater travel times are computed using an exponential age distribution with lambda value that can be given for every zone to define a digital filter used to convolute the input nitrate time series groundwater flow through the reduction zone q3 this water is reduced and contains no nitrates as they have been reduced by reactive material electron donors transport times of this component is not important groundwater recharge at the water table is obtained from the results of the eu rotate n model the quantification of the 3 components is by fractioning coefficients which define the fraction of the recharge that is drained away directly fr drn and the partition of the remaining flux over the oxidation fr ox and reduction zone the 3 components can then be computed with where flux is the groundwater recharge q1 flux fr drn q2 flux 1 fr drn fr ox q3 flux 1 fr drn 1 fr ox where flux the groundwater recharge calculated by the eu rotate n model and fr drn 1 fr drn fr ox 1 fr drn 1 fr ox 1 baseflow flux and nitrate concentration for each zone are then calculated by using the contributions for each component 2 3 4 time discretization the model uses a dual time discretization approach it is based on yearly time steps but allow refinement by applying monthly time weighting factors for some fluxes and contributions monthly factors for aquifer recharge river baseflow and discharge by drains distribute year totals over the 12 months to obtain a pseudo seasonal behavior these monthly factors must be given by the user and are not computed by the model they also remain constant over the whole simulation period this allows the model to reproduce average seasonal variations summarizing the input data of the model use yearly values while the output is produced with monthly values this approach allows to obtain detailed output with a minimum of data input the monthly distribution coefficients can be estimated or obtained from other calculations and analysis not included in the model itself monthly coefficients for groundwater recharge are based on calculations with a soil moisture balance model for different places all over flanders monthly values of groundwater recharge were averaged and normalized to obtain the relative distribution over the year however groundwater recharge itself is varying from year to year as it is calculated by the eu rotate n model monthly coefficients for baseflow are based on results of the modflow models that has been made for 3 of the 10 test sites these models are transient flow models on a monthly basis and reproduce the seasonal variations in groundwater flow and also baseflow to the river network monthly river drainage was averaged and normalized also river discharge flow rates at some monitoring stations were processed minimum daily flow rates in each month were considered as a approximation of the baseflow but these series are only available for larger catchments monthly coefficients for drain discharge are derived from in situ observations and measurements on selected drains most of the rains only work in winter time the contributions of drains with nitrate rich and reduced nitrate free water is derived from nitrate concentration measurements of drain water with a reflectometer all these monthly coefficients are kept constant over the whole simulation period this feature is implemented this way to minimize the amount of input data and was a designer choice 2 3 5 groundwater travel times travel times of groundwater through the oxidation zone is calculated by convolution using a digital filter designed to work with yearly time steps the eu rotate n model is operated with daily time steps but the water and nitrate flux leaking to the water table is accumulated to yearly totals which are passed to the saturated zone model component in geological settings with thick unsaturated zones like hills build up by permeable sands or chalk aquifers with high hydraulic conductivity travel times through the vadose zone can increase significantly orban et al 2010 mattern 2009 in the model a time delay in the vadose zone can be specified which is added to the travel times before use in the convolution process 2 3 6 travel time through the unsaturated zone specially in hilly regions where the hills are buildup of sands with high hydraulic conductivity the water table can be very deep on the top of the hills in flanders this is e g the case in the brabant region where hills consisting of oxidized sands formation of brussels show water table depths up to 30 or even 40 m travel times through the vadose zone can add up to years in these cases indicative travel times for these situations were obtained by doing simulations with the variable saturation model hydrus 1d using 4 different soil textures coarse sand fine sand loamy sand and loam based on typical values for the hydraulic parameters and for an increasing depth of the water table 5 10 20 30 40 m the travel time of a nitrate front from leaching from the soil profile down to the water table was derived from the concentration at the bottom outlet of the vertical column model these travel times were used to fit for each of the 4 soil textures a relation curve between water table depth and travel time in the model an average delay in the thick vadose zone can be added if necessary to the groundwater travel time in the saturated zone the added travel time can be estimated from the 4 fitted curves and a known or measured average value of the water table depth 2 3 7 local denitrification in the riparian zone it was observed that in some settings groundwater seeping out in the riparian zone seems to have been reduced by organic matter removing nearly all nitrate and increasing bicarbonate concentration in the model this local nitrate reduction is activated by a single fractioning coefficient 2 3 8 runoff concentrations at the catchment outlet are not only dependent on groundwater contributions but also on runoff after rain events runoff will cause dilution and thus lower the calculated nitrate concentrations the model itself does not include a module to calculate runoff but monthly peak flow amounts can be defined for the simulation period and are used in the calculation of the monthly concentrations these monthly runoff depths can be calculated with a separate runoff model or approximated from rainfall data and a runoff coefficient however peak flow contribution is strongly variable on a daily basis as is daily rainfall to accurately account for runoff the model should work with daily time steps which is at the moment not the case in measured nitrate time series sometimes abnormal low concentrations show up which are striking in periods with high nitrate levels these measurements are always coupled at heavy rainy events but can never be reproduced by the model 2 3 9 model output model output is in monthly steps and includes both fluxes of the different water flow components like aquifer recharge drain discharge groundwater contribution from the oxidized and from the reduction zone as concentrations of each contribution 2 4 calibration of the model some of the parameters of the model are difficult to exactly quantify from field observations and measurements and need to be finetuned by calibration of the model the calculated concentrations are very sensitive to the fractioning parameter for drain contribution fr drn if there are drains in the catchment of course and to the fractioning of oxidation and reduction zones fr ox the initial fr drn parameter value can be based on drain discharge measurements but these can usually only be done in winter time for the fr ox parameter the lithologic and hydrostratigraphic buildup of the catchment can be checked together with groundwater analyses specifically the concentration of redox species iron from this information the depth position of the oxidation reduction boundary can be set from this position and the total thickness of the phreatic aquifer layer the relative contribution to the total groundwater flow as estimated initial values were further adjusted doing runs with the model and comparing with the measured series but is turned out that using criteria like the rmse values for selecting the best fit did not always give the best visual agreement of the series visual inspection and control of the results was always necessary therefore the calibration was done using trial and error and not by a fully automated optimization algorithm a preference was given to obtain a good fit for the seasonal fluctuations instead of an overall best fit a special problem causes runoff as it is not properly included in the model but can severely affect the concentrations in the rivers runoff causes dilution and is therefore seen as measurements with abnormal low nitrate concentration on the graphs however runoff is not a continuous contribution like baseflow but only occurs significantly after heavy rain events peakflow also decreases fast once the rain event is finished unlike variations in baseflow which act on a longer time scale based on daily precipitation data in roeselare a meteorological station close to the luikbeek test site only 6 2 of the days have a rainfall of more than 10 mm which must be able to generate an important runoff contribution data from 2008 to 2021 that is 22 6 rainy days year or only 1 88 say 2 days a month the nitrate concentrations at the monitoring points are measured once a month so the chance that this happens during a heavy rainy day is rather small reasoning the monitoring planner does not try to avoid bad weather therefore in many series only 1 or 2 values a year a clearly abnormal low because the model calibration was done with trial and error and not by automatic matching these outliers do not necessarily disturb the calibration process 2 5 application on testcases the model has been applied on 10 testcases spread all over flanders and selected in different hydrogeological settings fig 7 the results of 2 sites located in staden test site 1 and wortegem petegem test site 2 are presented here at the outlet of each catchment is a monitoring station which records monthly values of nitrate concentration and some other chemical parameters these series are now ca 20 years long 2 5 1 testcase 1 site with winter peaks and summer lows 2 5 1 1 hydrogeological setting and model input the first test site shows at its outlet high nitrate concentrations in winter time and low in summer period this case is located in the community of staden in the province of west flanders and consists of the molenbeek stream catchment the subsurface consists of a thin cover of quaternary sediments 2 to 3 m thick loamy sandy material underlaid with around 10 m of tertiary marine sands formation of tielt below these sands is a thick compact tertiary clay layer formation of kortrijk which can be considered here as no flow substratum the catchment is located on the east side of a topographic ridge which rises to 20 m above the stream level where the sands of the tielt formation have a larger thickness the molenbeek stream flows to the north as is the general groundwater flow the molenbeek also drains groundwater from the east side of the ridge drillings and water analyses show that nitrate is only found at shallow depth the upper 2 m deeper groundwater is reduced and contains dissolved iron from this it can be concluded that the tertiary sands contain enough reactive material in the form of pyrite to promote nitrate reduction the site has a thin oxidized layer on top max 2 m and a thicker deeper reduction layer below it ca 10 m thick most of the groundwater inflow into the stream will have passed through the reduction layer some of the land parcels have drains to lower water table in winter time these drains tap water from the upper oxidized layer in the quaternary sands measurements of nitrate in drain water confirm concentrations above 100 mg l the downstream monitoring point on the molenbeek stream shows high nitrate levels in winter time but low to very low values in summer period the two main controlling contributions of nitrate to the stream is a low concentration inflow of deeper groundwater and seasonal winter inflow of drain water with high nitrate input combination of both cause a very strong seasonal behavior with low summer concentrations of course the discharge rate of the stream is also much lower in summer the upstream part usually runs dry by that time fractioning coefficients and time weighting factors were optimized using trial and error by fitting calculated and measured nitrate concentrations for the period after 2000 when the monitoring station started the used parameters in the presented simulation may not represent the best possible fitting therefore an automated optimization routine should be used 2 5 2 testcase 2 site with winter lows and summer peaks 2 5 2 1 hydrogeological setting and model input the second test site shows at its outlet the opposite pattern than the first site here high nitrate concentrations are measured in summer time and low in winter this site is located in the community of wortegem petegem in the province of east flanders the catchment is the small upstream waterhead of the molenbeek stream which lies on the east side of a large more than 10 km long northeast southwest oriented hill that consists of marine tertiary sands lying on a thick clay substratum the molenbeek valley runs between two hills rising 20 to 30 m above the valley floor in the hills the tertiary sand are to a large depth oxidized and contain nitrate rich water that has infiltrated locally and has flushed the original water over a decade long time period when intense fertilizer use has caused high nitrate influx despite the restrictions ongoing since the mid 1990s the groundwater in the hills still form a nitrate rich reservoir feeding continuous the molenbeek river 3 results and discussion 3 1 testcase 1 site with winter peaks and summer lows the simulation period is 50 years long the eu rotate n model calculated the water flux and nitrate leaching on a grid with a discretization of 50 m these values were accumulated to an average input function for the whole catchment fig 8a and b the recharge flux depends on the meteorological conditions rainfall and evapotranspiration and change from year to year between 100 mm year in dry years up to ca 300 mm year in wet years with an average of around 180 mm year recognizable are the wet years around 2000 which show 5 subsequent wet years with above average recharge the calculated average nitrate concentration in the water table recharge flux averaged over the entire catchment fig 8b shows a period with much higher values starting in the 1970s till the mid 1990s when the first restrictions on fertilizer use were implemented the concentrations exceeded 1000 mg l in some years during wet years concentrations are lower the last decade concentrations have seriously dropped they are the lowest in the last 50 years but are still higher above 50 mg l nitrate concentrations at the outlet of the catchment are available since 2000 they are plotted together with the measurements in fig 8c the calculated concentrations in the whole simulated period of 50 years are shown in fig 8d comparison of calculated and measured baseflow concentrations fig 8c shows that the seasonal pattern is reproduced both model and monitoring show high peaks around the year 2005 and lower peaks since 2008 but even then the peaks reach values above 50 mg l discrepancy for individual peaks can be caused by several reasons in the model the fractioning coefficients remain constant in time for example the fraction of groundwater recharge that is discharged through drains remain the same in the whole period when changes in the drains have occurred drains abandoned new drains installed it is not possible to represent this in the model on the other side usually these changes are also not known only the actual recent situation can be checked also the time weighting factors monthly coefficients remain constant over time from year to year for example one series of 12 values defines how the drains are working during the year e g high at the end of the winter season when water table is high but this will depend on the rainfall in each year the given coefficients are for an average meteorological year it is a simplification in the model that has been maintained to reduce the amount of input data 3 2 testcase 2 site with winter lows and summer peaks 3 2 1 results and discussion the measured concentrations at the catchment outlet are plotted in fig 9a there is a strong seasonality with summer heights reaching values which are typically at least ca 70 to 80 mg l the winter lows are often round 50 mg l but drop some years to lower values this is a monitoring point which shows nearly always exceedance of the 50 mg l norm and is therefore very problematic the seasonality graph fig 9b where individual analyses are plotted in function of the fractional time in the year and a fitted cyclic sinus curve as a generic seasonal variation function shows that while average winter values are only marginally above 50 mg l in summer they rise to 80 to 90 mg l the root zone model calculates the yearly average groundwater recharge flux fig 9c with an average of 163 mm year over the 50 year simulation period year values mostly lie between 100 and 300 mm year the average nitrate concentration of the recharge fig 9d is 312 mg l for the whole 50 year but periods with high and low concentration alternate in some years in the 1990s they exceeded 600 mg l the last 10 years average concentration has decreased to ca 155 mg l which reflect the ongoing restrictions on fertilizer use this site is an example where the inflowing groundwater has high nitrate concentrations often around 100 mg l which comes from the neighboring hills which have thick oxidized layers on top filled with old nitrate rich water this is observed in multi level monitoring wells around the catchment these show high ca 100 mg l nitrate concentrations in the main part of the sandy sediments in the hills nitrate rich groundwater that seeps out in the wet riparian zone undergoes local nitrate reduction by organic matter this process was identified in half of shallow wells that were installed along the stream nitrate is here nearly absent while bicarbonate concentration is elevated it is defined that half of the seeping groundwater undergoes this reduction because the catchment is located between hillslopes runoff can be important especially in winter when the soil is saturated this runoff may cause a short but intense dilution which is seen in the measurements as the very low concentrations that were recorded some but not all years runoff is added in the model as a fraction of the rainfall measured in the closest meteorological station runoff is quantified with monthly fractions ranging between 1 and 20 the fractioning between oxidation and reduction zone was the only parameter that was estimated during calibration it was expected that most of the groundwater came from the oxidation zone in the neighboring hills a value of 70 contribution from the oxidation zone and the remaining 30 from the reduction zone was obtained the model calculated baseflow concentrations are also included in fig 9a and show the seasonal behavior is reproduced by the model discrepancies in winter lows exist especially before ca 2007 but these are likely related to runoff peaks that strongly dilute the water in the stream in a few summers higher than normal maxima were recorded in the first decade of monitoring which may be related to unknown and undocumented changes in the field situation in the past 4 summary and conclusion diffuse nitrate contamination because of intense fertilizer use often in the past is a common problem in agricultural areas as groundwater gets contaminated also baseflow towards rivers and streams is affected and in many catchments with important baseflow regimes bad surface water quality is found monitoring points on streams usually show a strong seasonal behavior but sometimes peak values occur in winter time and in some other settings in summer time effect of remediation measures are sometimes unnoticed or show long delays related to the long travel times along groundwater flowlines that connect nitrate input at parcel level and groundwater discharge in the streams years later to help understanding the behavior of such monitoring points and catchments a tool was developed implemented and tested on filed cases that calculates nitrate loading in the baseflow towards streams this tool has two components the first component is a state of the art nitrate leaching model for the root and vadose zone that will accurately calculate nitrate leaching at the parcel level using parcel specific characteristics the second component simulates the nitrate transport through the saturated zone this component follows a simple but straightforward approach by fractioning of the groundwater flow into 3 contributions and uses the concept of a groundwater age distribution based on the statistical exponential distribution model combined with the mathematical operation of convolution to incorporate delay of response times of the nitrate input series the modal is a lumped parameter zonal model not a distributed model it requires few parameters but is still able to reproduce the main seasonal variations in baseflow concentration this is demonstrated in this paper with two examples of real field cases in different hydrogeological settings and totally different temporal behavior from the modelling of 10 test sites it can be concluded that the main factors that control nitrate concentrations in the measuring points are in order of importance nitrate concentrations that leach out of the soil profile the model does not use the concentrations on individual land parcels but the average concentrations of a subdomain of the catchment or the whole catchment as a single subdomain fraction of groundwater recharge that is discharged through drains the fr drn fractioning parameter the fraction of the inflowing groundwater that comes from the oxidation zone and thus contains nitrate the fr ox fractioning parameter groundwater travel times if the fr ox fraction is high groundwater travel time in the saturated zone are only important in settings where there is a thick oxidized zone and the main inflow of groundwater into the river is from the oxidized zone so in cases where the fr ox parameter is high the age of water from the reduction zone is not relevant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research was carried out within the project nitrate rich sources impact

opportunities to study groundwater recharge and flow in periglacial conditions during the last glacial maximum lgm due to its location in the permanent permafrost area south of the ice sheet at that time a palaeoclimatic record had been set up previously for this aquifer consisting of major ion chemistry stable isotopes radiocarbon and noble gases in this paper methane data have been used to further refine the paleoclimatic model along with revisiting in detail the set of chemical data focusing on the area where groundwaters recharged around the lgm are known to occur it was found that the high methane concentrations corroborate the hypothesis of groundwater recharge taking place during permafrost melting from methane bubbling lakes that had developed to the south of an eolian sand ridge a relict flow path existing in the aquifer during some period as permafrost was thawing has been established starting from these temporary recharge areas based on various chemical parameters radiocarbon model ages and noble gas recharge temperatures 1 introduction the mechanisms of groundwater replenishment and flow in periglacial environments are not well understood utting et al 2013 utting et al 2012 studied groundwater recharge and flow in an unconfined aquifer system discharging along rivers in the western arctic of canada and found that recharge is a mixture of snowmelt and precipitation mcintosh et al 2012 describe three possible sources of pleistocene groundwater recharge ice sheet meltwaters paleolakes that have formed in front of the ice margin and precipitation they made a review of pleistocene recharge in aquifers of europe and north america and distinguished between ice covered regions and regions affected by permafrost edmunds and milne 2001 synthesizing results of the eu funded palaeaux project mentioned recharge gaps during periods of permafrost cover that were found in several european aquifers as well as enhanced recharge into coastal aquifers during sea level low stands the latter explains how fresh groundwater is found at depths up to 250 300 m in the chalk aquifer in southern england along the english channel edmunds and milne 2001 vaikmäe et al 2001 found anomalously high excess air concentrations in the cambro vendian aquifer in estonia which they ascribed to subglacial recharge mcintosh et al 2012 emphasized the importance of confining units to preserve pleistocene meltwaters to prevent flushing of paleowaters by recent recharge thawing permafrost is known to release methane into the atmosphere schuur et al 2015 and nowadays there is large concern about the amounts of methane released into the atmosphere as this greenhouse gas is 25 times stronger than carbon dioxide in causing global warming amap 2015 during climate warming after the last glacial maximum lgm the large increase in global atmospheric methane concentration was contributed for more than 30 by an arctic or boreal source as deduced from polar ice core records walter et al 2007 these authors proposed methane bubbling from thermokarst lakes as the source it is known that permafrost deposits contain vast amounts of organic matter derived from the superficial active layer during glacial summers and prevented from decaying as they are frozen in the next winter period in a warming climate as the permafrost layer thaws this organic matter decomposes quickly releasing methane zimov et al 2006a 2006b the ledo paniselian aquifer in belgium has been proposed to offer unique opportunities to study groundwater recharge and flow in periglacial conditions during the lgm 14 21 ka bp due to its location in the permanent permafrost area south of the ice sheet at that time walraevens et al 2019 a palaeoclimatic record has been set up for this aquifer consisting of major ion chemistry stable isotopes radiocarbon and noble gases methane data were however not available recently methane data became available from three pumping sites of de watergroep the largest public drinking water supply company in flanders in the present paper this set of methane data is presented for this aquifer along with revisiting in detail the set of chemical data focusing on the area where groundwaters recharged around the lgm are known to occur 1 1 the ledo paniselian aquifer the ledo paniselian aquifer is part of an alternating sequence of marine tertiary eocene to oligocene clay and sand deposits gently dipping towards the north according to the inclination of the bedding fig 1 walraevens and cardenal 1994 it consists of pure to clayey unconsolidated marine sands up to 60 m thick and it is a semi confined aquifer as it is overlain by the bartonian clay which thickness can vary between 20 and 60 m underneath the aquifer is separated from the ypresian aquifer by a thin layer of paniselian clay recharge of the semi confined ledo paniselian aquifer takes place in the regions with a higher topographical elevation and where the aquifer is covered by the bartonian clay fig 1 walraevens 1987 discharge occurs partly to the south in the unconfined area where the ledo paniselian crops out beneath the quaternary sediments in this zone the piezometric levels in the aquifer are lower than in the adjacent area where it is semi confined the remaining major part of the recharged groundwater flows to the north where the depth of the aquifer increases walraevens 1987 groundwater flows to the north sea with a n to nne direction this paper focuses on the western part of the aquifer where a major recharge area is present near ursel fig 1 and where the groundwater flow is generally undisturbed a secondary recharge area coincides with a regional eolian sand ridge fig 2 location of sand ridge after de moor and heyse 1978 stretching from maldegem over eeklo zelzate wachtebeke and further to the east blaser et al 2010a and which is roughly expressed by a topographic elevation above 8 m taw above low spring tide sealevel the ledo paniselian aquifer has already been the subject of intensive research over the hydrodynamical and hydrogeochemical processes that occur within it walraevens 1987 1988 1990 cardenal and walraevens 1994 walraevens and cardenal 1994 walraevens et al 2001 2007 blaser et al 2010a in the semi confined ledo paniselian aquifer groundwater is recharged in two main recharge areas near ursel in the west and sint niklaas in the east a third smaller recharge area exists in between fig 1 recharge takes place through overlying clay layers while there is discharge from the semi confined aquifer to the unconfined part from the recharge areas onward groundwater on a pathway to deeper parts of the semi confined aquifer flows in a north direction further on deviating to the northwest towards the north sea basin this aquifer is an example of typical freshening which comprises two main processes dilution and cation exchange walraevens 1987 until the last regression at the end of the tertiary marine conditions prevailed in the sediments of the ledo paniselian aquifer and the bartonian clay walraevens and van camp 2005 infiltration of freshwater within the recharge area causes calcite dissolution while cation exchange takes place through passage of the bartonian clay blaser et al 2010a this resulted in a displacement of the marine cations in flow direction due to cation exchange walraevens 1987 causing a typical sequence of freshening groundwater types nacl nahco3 mghco3 and cahco3 classification after stuyfzand 1991 1 2 paleoclimatic evolution the ledo paniselian aquifer offers an opportunity to study periglacial groundwater recharge during the last glacial maximum lgm as it was located in the continuous permafrost zone to the south of the ice sheet at that time walraevens et al 2019 in the aquifer the occurrence of palaeowaters of holocene and pleistocene ages has been determined figs 1 2 together with a recharge gap which coincides with the lgm 21 14 ka bp blaser et al 2010a in addition residence times modelled from 14c data blaser et al 2010a and recharge paleoconditions blaser et al 2010b have also been determined in a smaller region following a flow line in the aquifer the large flemish valley extending north of the city of ghent figs 1 2 had been eroded since the saalian glacial period during the middle pleni weichselian 61 to 25 ka bp which had milder climatic conditions the flemish valley was refilled with fluviatile deposits in the extremely cold and dry late pleni weichselian an eolian sand ridge consisting of a few meters of eolian deposits developed on top of the fluviatile sediments blaser et al 2010a at least since the eemian interglacial 75 to 120 ka bp possibly since the end of the tertiary already when the sea regressed from large parts of the area groundwater is being recharged in the ursel region fig 1 which is topographically higher 15 to 29 m asl blaser et al 2010a walraevens et al 2019 at the climatic minimum corresponding with the lgm about 20 ka bp the sea level had dropped to 130 m bsl and permafrost is reported to have been present in the area walraevens et al 2019 and references therein it seems very likely that permafrost persisted during the lgm in the study area inhibiting recharge in the aquifer blaser et al 2010b walraevens et al 2019 fig 3 shows the evolution of noble gas temperatures ngt which reflect soil and groundwater temperatures in the recharge area blaser et al 2010b with modelled 14c ages of groundwater the lowest ngts recorded probably do not reflect the coldest period as there is a gap between 14 and 21 ka ago in recharge corresponding with the lgm in the 14c modelled ages walraevens et al 2019 a strong glacial cooling of 8 8 0 8 c was inferred from ngt between the warm modern groundwater and the cold glacial water walraevens et al 2019 however the cooling is not clearly expressed by δ18o which shows a barely positive gradient of 0 1 per c walraevens et al 2019 in line with the findings by loosli et al 2001 who found δ18o t slopes ranging from 0 0 to 0 5 with the lower values near to the coast during the last glacial period an additional secondary infiltration area was created within the eolian sand ridge near eeklo blaser et al 2010a in walraevens et al 2019 the presence of methane was invoked in specific parts of the aquifer but no methane analyses were available the present study reports a first set of methane data for the aquifer found in wells of water supply company de watergroep moreover in walraevens et al 2019 recharge from methane bubbling thermokarst lakes was proposed without actually describing their location and how this recharge had actually entered the aquifer and which flow path had been followed this research aims to shed light on these questions besides from the scientific interest there is also a societal practical importance to understanding the origin of methane in the aquifer methane has a high oxygen demand that can become problematic during the treatment for the production of drinking water therefore knowing what the methane source is and how it is distributed has a high practical value for public water supply company de watergroep 2 methods and available data the data available in the framework of this study consist of datasets from two phd theses carried out at ghent university walraevens 1987 blaser 2007 at one hand and of datasets from pumping sites property of de watergroep which are located nearby the study area of blaser 2007 fig 4 on or near to the eolian sand ridge at one hand the datasets from ghent university comprise chemical and isotopic analyses from the whole ledo paniselian aquifer walraevens 1987 walraevens et al 2001 sampled mostly between 1983 and 2000 and a main flow path of the aquifer studied by blaser 2007 this flow path is along cross section a a fig 1 most of the latter samples were taken between 1996 and 1998 but some locations were resampled in 2001 on the other hand the dataset from de watergroep consists of chemical analyses on samples taken in 2018 2019 from three different water extraction localities pumping sites eeklo and lembeke oosteeklo and prospective study site kluizen the samples from eeklo are located in the middle of the main flow path studied by blaser 2007 while the samples from lembeke oosteeklo and kluizen are located more to the east fig 4 the dataset from de watergroep contained a series of yearly chemical analyses for most of the sites for the purpose of this study only one of the chemical analyses of each sampling point has been selected to be interpreted together with the datasets from ghent university for the selection of the chemical analysis from de watergroep the completeness of the analysis was considered in the first place this was the case of lembeke oosteeklo where for the wells 2003 039 f0 040 f0 041 f0 and 043 f0 only one complete chemical analysis was available in the second place in the locations where multiple analyses were available over time the proximity of the measurement in time to the most recent methane measurements from de watergroep 18 4 2019 and 14 6 2019 was considered an additional series of 7 wells was drilled by de watergroep at kluizen in 2020 and methane and full chemical analysis was performed on the water samples between october and december 2020 for the data sets of ghent university groundwater samples were analysed for hydrochemical composition and in selected samples also for stable isotopes radiocarbon and noble gases for dating and estimation of recharge temperatures sampling of hydrochemistry was performed by pumping selected wells and collecting in pe bottles after passing the water through a flow through cell in which ph ec eh dissolved oxygen o2 and water temperature were measured and after filtration samples for cation analysis were acidified in the field analysis of major cations was done by faas and of major anions by spectrophotometry stable isotopes 2h 18o 13c were measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry 14c activity was measured by means of proportional gas counting low level counting in methane ch4 which had previously been reduced from produced co2 blaser et al 2010a ch4 from de watergroep samples was measured at the commercial laboratory eurofins and was analysed by gas chromatography and flame ionization detection sampling for he and the other noble gases was done in cu tubes gas tight connected to the pump s outlet tube in which the sample was collected by closing two stainless steel clamps noble gas analysis was performed by mass spectrometry according to the methods described by beyerle et al 2000 blaser et al 2010b realized a paleoclimate interpretation of the noble gas and stable isotope data which was further refined by walraevens et al 2019 the analytical results have been further processed in qgis for sampling positioning and the realization of concentration maps the realization of the concentrations maps has been done manually interpreting the trends seen in the cross plots and considering the hydrogeochemical processes that take place in the aquifer phreeqc modelling parkhurst and appelo 1999 has also been carried for a group of selected samples along the main flow path in order to know the saturation indices for specific minerals and compounds 3 results the chemical results from the samples studied by blaser 2007 and the selected samples from de watergroep are presented in table 1 the concentrations of some anions and cations describe different trends along the flowline while sodium na increases along the flow line fig 5a the concentration of calcium ca2 decreases fig 5b there is a sudden decrease in ca2 concentration around 10 km from the main recharge area of the ledo paniselian aquifer at the end of the studied flow line there is a smooth increase in its concentration as well magnesium mg2 and potassium k describe a similar trend along the flow line there is a smooth increase in both concentrations at the beginning followed by a sudden drop between 10 km and 15 km from the main recharge area fig 5c and d after this drop in mg2 and k concentration there is a rise which is higher in k concentration than in mg2 finally chloride cl concentration describes a similar pattern as na increasing along the flow line fig 5e however while na starts to increase from 10 km distance to recharge cl concentration begins to increase only 15 km away from the recharge area and it increases faster on the remaining part of the studied flow line concentration maps for this detailed study area have been made for na ca2 and cl fig 6a b and c respectively these maps reflect the major trends which have already been seen in the cross plots of the anions or cations concentration against the distance from the recharge area however in the na concentration map a zone with a lower concentration than its surroundings can be observed fig 6a this zone is located between the isolines of 100 and 200 mg l and the concentration in those sampling points is lower than 100 mg l in addition cl shows a zone with concentrations lower than 20 mg l fig 6c this zone matches with the restricted area where na concentrations are lower as well anions such as bicarbonate hco3 and sulphate so4 2 show different trends along the main flow line fig 7a and b respectively hco3 shows two increasing trends which are split by a vertical trend located at around 12 km from the main recharge area fig 7a it can also be observed that after the first increasing trend the concentrations of hco3 in the ledo paniselian aquifer are lower than 500 mg l while after the vertical trend split the hco3 concentration is higher than 600 mg l in the aquifer samples from de watergroep show higher concentrations in this second trend line lembeke oosteeklo and kluizen the concentration map did not show any clearly pattern fig 8a sulphate concentration along the aquifer shows three clearly differentiated trends fig 7b first the concentration of so4 2 decreases from 150 mg l to less than 10 mg l during the first 10 km of the flow line between 10 and 15 km from the main recharge area so4 2 concentration remains below 10 mg l after this zone with low sulphate concentration it increases up to 300 mg l at the end of the flow line these patterns are clearly reflected by the concentration map fig 8b where the zone with low sulphate concentrations is clearly delimited methane ch4 was found in high concentrations in the catchment areas of lembeke oosteeklo and kluizen and also in one of both investigated wells at kluizen table 1 these high concentrations of ch4 seem to be present in the area tentative isolines in fig 8c matching with the area of low so4 2 and low cl concentrations hydrogen sulphide h2s was not detected in the analysis from de watergroep all samples were below detection limit 4 discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemical processes the ledo paniselian aquifer is a model example of a freshening aquifer in which freshwater infiltration of cahco3 type is recharged through the bartonian clay replacing the initial marine conditions and resulting in two processes dilution and cation exchange walraevens et al 2019 this is verified by the trends which have been shown in the results section where ca2 decreases along the flow line while na increases consequently it can be observed that ca2 decreases as na increases in the aquifer fig 9 therefore the marine cations na k and mg2 absorbed to clay minerals are successively exchanged for ca2 from the infiltrating waters resulting in a typical chromatographic sequence of groundwater types cahco3 mghco3 and nacl downstream in the aquifer walraevens et al 2019 phreeqc modelling results have shown that the aquifer is saturated with respect to calcite table 2 when cation exchange occurs in calcite saturated waters dissolved ca2 is lowered resulting in undersaturation which leads to a second stage of calcite dissolution causing high hco3 concentrations in the aquifer walraevens 1987 walraevens et al 2019 therefore the observed increase of hco3 in flow direction fig 10 is due to increased cation exchange however in fig 10 the samples outlined with a dashed line show anomalously elevated concentrations of hco3 up to 900 mg l these samples are all located at about 10 km from the main recharge area blaser 2007 attributed this phenomenon to the influence of the secondary recharge area near eeklo at the eolian sand ridge and to mixing corrosion which consists of the mixing of different calcite saturated waters the samples from the catchment area of eeklo fit in the anomalously high concentrations range fig 10 however even though the de watergroep samples from lembeke oosteeklo and kluizen present also hco3 concentrations of up to 900 mg l they do not fit in this trend fig 10 red outlined samples this could be due to their position with respect to the main flow path as they are located more to the east which could lead to the consideration of a radiated flow line and therefore a not very precise projection on the main flow path yet another recharge area might be involved as well a zone with low so4 2 concentrations can be observed in the ledo paniselian aquifer fig 8b the samples which fall into this domain are mainly characterized by a low and negative redox potential eh fig 11 these are indicators for sulphate reduction in the aquifer walraevens et al 2019 associate the low so4 2 values few mg l to completed sulphate reduction the area with low so4 2 concentrations and the area with high ch4 concentrations seem to spatially coincide fig 8 this area can be found between 10 km and 15 km from the main recharge area fig 12 low so4 2 values are due to sulphate reduction therefore in this area of the aquifer anaerobic conditions prevail methane is produced by the reduction of carbon dioxide or the degradation or fermentation of organic carbon and its presence indicates anaerobic conditions and methanogenesis christensen et al 2000 moreover the groundwater has been found to be in equilibrium with a gas phase with high partial pressures of methane pch4 10 0 27 to 10 0 22 atm in the samples from de watergroep table 2 if exposed to the atmosphere this groundwater will degas methane several sources of methane can be distinguished biotic methane can have a microbial or a thermogenic origin the former is formed by the action of methanogenic bacteria the latter is generated by the thermal degradation of organic matter both forms are biotic as they are derived from organic matter in contrast abiotic methane is formed by magma degassing or by geochemical reactions not involving organic matter etiope and schoell 2014 according to etiope and ionescu 2015 abiotic methane can be found in the ocean floor and in continental settings but most is found on continents in low temperature environments even at shallow depth in ultramafic rocks and in the precambrian crystalline basement the conditions for generating abiotic methane do not comply with the ledo paniselian setting thermogenic methane is originating in deep sedimentary basins at high temperatures and pressure causing the decomposition of organic matter frieling et al 2016 investigated thermogenic methane and co2 release from hydrothermal vent complexes associated with volcanic intrusions in the north atlantic igneous province at the paleocene eocene thermal maximum during this period of global warming large amounts of 13c depleted carbon were injected into the ocean atmosphere system schlegel et al 2011 describe both thermogenic and microbial methane in illinois basin the thermogenic methane is found in the central deep parts of the sedimentary basin at depths 700 m while the microbial methane is produced at shallower depth at the basin margins the thermogenic methane is associated with older fluids 4he age on average 1 0 ma while younger groundwaters show microbial methane this microbial methane occurs in association with anomalously low salinity water suggesting deep groundwater recharge as evidenced by δ18o values the source of recharge was not glacial meltwater but paleoprecipitation schlegel et al 2011 groundwater in the ledo paniselian occurs at limited depth usually 100 m and 4he is much smaller that for the groundwaters in illinois basin a thermogenic origin of the methane may be excluded methane in the ledo paniselian is expected to have a microbial origin resulting from the degradation of organic matter in strongly reducing conditions such conditions may be caused by large accumulations of organic matter causing a strong oxygen demand in these methanogenic conditions sulphate is not stable it has already been reduced in less reducing conditions berner 1981 christensen et al 2000 and therefore low sulphate levels are expected van stempvoort et al 2005 discuss oxidation of methane by sulphate reduction in the case of fugitive methane leaking from an oil well into a shallow aquifer milucka et al discuss the microbiology of this process van stempvoort et al 2005 found a strong positive correlation between sulphate and 13c of bicarbonate pointing to this process in the ledo paniselian aquifer such correlation is not found fig 13 and there is no evidence for external sources of the methane 4 2 paleoclimatic constraints it seems very likely that continuous permafrost persisted during the lgm in the study area walraevens et al 2019 14c model ages show a gap in recharge occurring during the lgm 14 21 kyr bp fig 3 which is attributed to the presence of a continuous permafrost layer this continuous permafrost layer with a thickness between 50 and 100 m would have inhibited water to infiltrate in the aquifer walraevens et al 2019 it is known that thawing permafrost can contain large amounts of organic matter contemporaneous with the permafrost layer which is formed during pleni glacial summers in the active layer after its formation this organic matter becomes incorporated into the permafrost in response to surface mineral deposition zimov et al 2006a when thawing of the permafrost occurs massive decomposition of the organic matter contained within it leads to strongly reducing conditions at shallow depths and methane bubbles are formed walter et al 2007 schuur et al 2015 walraevens et al 2019 observed degassing in the noble gas data in some samples which was not an artefact of sampling but methane was not measured in their analysis however the newest analysis from de watergroep at the catchment areas of eeklo lembeke oosteeklo and kluizen have revealed that methane is present in the sulphate reduced zone therefore it can be ascertained that methanogenic conditions which would have caused methane formation and the subsequent degassing were reached in the aquifer during thawing of the permafrost recharge from methane bubbling thermokarst lakes was inferred by walraevens et al 2019 upstream of the age gap the degassed groundwater was found to show deviating signals from the non degassed groundwater bicarbonate is very high which was ascribed to methanogenesis next to calcite dissolution sulfate is strikingly low due to strongly reducing conditions δ13c of tic is strongly enriched as a result of methanogenesis δ18o and δ2h are both enriched due to evaporation from late glacial lakes and swamps before infiltration 14c model ages are too young which may be related to the distorted flow pattern when permafrost opens up ngts are too high as recharge took place only in summer in swampy conditions raidla et al 2019 found methane in the cambrian vendian aquifer in estonia at levels up to 26 mg l comparable to the ledo paniselian aquifer they studied isotopic composition of the methane and concluded that it has a biogenic origin and was produced by reduction of co2 they postulate that methane formed in a periglacial arctic wetland environment covering the outcrop area of the aquifer prior to the advance of the ice sheet in the late weichselian infiltrating glacial meltwater could have transported the methane into the aquifer they hypothesize that the methane was formed during the middle weichselian interstadial from 26 to 32 ka bp raidla et al 2019 our study area was not affected by an ice sheet as long as the permafrost was continuous two independent aquifers developed separated by the frozen permafrost layer with the ledo paniselian being the deepest aquifer of both recharge could not take place in the deeper aquifer and the shallow upper aquifer the active layer during glacial summers discharged at the surface where a braided river system developed at the southern border of the eolian sand ridge during the whole late glacial period several large shallow lakes have been present verbruggen et al 1991 the degassed samples recognized by walraevens et al 2019 and the samples from de watergroep are located within or very near to the eolian sand ridge fig 2 in this area the bartonian clay is thin cfr fig 1 or even missing near to sampling point b28 fig 14 and recharge could have resumed earlier than in other parts of the aquifer walraevens et al 2019 evidences of methane occurring in the deeper aquifer have been found and thus methane might have infiltrated while the permafrost layer was thawing nicolsky and shakhova 2010 discuss the development of open taliks under thermokarst lakes and river paleo valleys where the permafrost has disappeared such conditions may provide gateways to the deeper aquifer and recharge of lake water into the aquifer may take place therefore the origin of the methane found in the ledo paniselian aquifer is postulated to be the methane bubbling periglacial swamps and lakes under which in shallow groundwater conditions degassing could occur walraevens et al 2019 the combined effect of methanogenesis together with the general calcite dissolution and possibly increased by mixing corrosion may have caused the high hco3 concentrations the degassing is indicative for methanogenesis in this part of the ledo paniselian aquifer there are several arguments to propose that the degassing took place during recharge first of all the radiogenic he concentrations in the degassed samples are similar to undegassed samples and thus seem to be unaffected by the degassing this indicates early degassing before the radiogenic he accumulated blaser et al 2010b second degassing is more likely to occur near the surface under limited hydrostatic pressure degassing requires the presence of gas bubbles which could happen in shallow lakes or also in their sediments or shallow parts of the aquifer in the recharge zone further downstream in a confined aquifer the pressure is likely too high for even large amounts of ch4 to form bubbles and finally the observed methane concentrations correspond to equilibrium with a methane pressure of 10 0 27 to 10 0 22 atm and are compatible with a shallow source if the degassing had happened under much higher total pressure deep in the aquifer more methane should have remained dissolved in the water 4 3 new insights an alternative flow path during the lgm the transitional phase during which permafrost thawing occurred may have distorted the flow pattern immediately following the recharge gap walraevens et al 2019 in the present study a possible relict flow path may have been found the exceptionally low concentrations of cl and so4 2 in a delimited zone fig 13 and the trends of some parameters along this possible flow path fig 14 indeed provide indications for such a relict flow path the location of this zone with low concentrations fig 13 suggests that the infiltration took place close to sample b28 blue dot near start of arrow in fig 13 south of the sand ridge with a flow direction to the nw all samples in this alternative flow path present so4 2 concentrations lower than 5 mg l and therefore must have been exposed at least to sulphate reduction conditions moreover this zone corresponds to the area where methane was found in the samples of de watergroep the concentration of na ca2 and cl seem to describe a freshening pattern along this proposed relict flow path fig 15 which would not be expected considering recharge from the main recharge area ca2 and na show opposite trends which could be due to cation exchange cl remains at low concentrations along most of the flow line and increases at the end reflecting the influence of seawater hco3 shows a decreasing trend along the relict flowline the pink isoline in fig 14 delimits the area where so4 2 5 mg l reflecting strong sulphate reduction in this area cl is mostly lower than in the main recharge area which can be ascribed to recharge under conditions where the sea was at larger distance from the recharge area than today cl in precipitation decreases with increasing distance from the sea and probably most importantly absence of recharge through the overlying bartonian clay which has still preserved some minor traces of its marine origin and is even today contributing some cl to the groundwater recharging through it the hypothesis of the alternative flow line during the lgm has been further tested with the 14c model ages from blaser et al 2010a and the noble gas temperature data from blaser et al 2010b what can be observed is that model ages increase along the flow line towards the nw fig 16a which is consistent with the hypothesis moreover noble gas temperatures which indicate recharge conditions decrease along the possible flow path fig 16b and as well with model ages fig 16c as it can be observed in fig 16c the lowest recharge temperatures occur before the gap at an age of 20 000 years approximately just before the lgm moreover the samples found right after the age gap show higher recharge temperatures and degassing which has been ascribed to methanogenic conditions walraevens et al 2019 the higher temperatures may be due to increasing temperature in the recharge area as permafrost was thawing walraevens et al 2019 the fact that the samples along this alternative path have been under sulphate reducing and methanogenic conditions suggests that infiltration took place from the methane bubbling thermokarst lakes verbruggen et al 1991 described the existence of lakes at the southern border of the eolian sand ridge de moor and heyse 1978 who described the morphological evolution of the area mapped geomorphologic depressions topographically lower than the sand ridge to the south of the eolian sand ridge fig 2 according to walraevens et al 2019 the methane bubbling lakes formed south of the sand ridge it thus seems acceptable that these depressions coincided with the thermokarst lakes and that recharge from these methane bubbling lakes took place at the end of the lgm during permafrost thawing giving rise to a short term relict flow path the development of open gateways to the aquifer underneath the thermokarst lakes may have occurred faster in the unconfined part of the aquifer as it takes longer for the frozen porewater in clay to thaw compared to sand therefore during permafrost thawing groundwater infiltrating near b28 in the methanogenic conditions of the lakes would follow this alternative flow path and flow further in the aquifer with a nw direction a cross plot of so4 2 concentration against model ages was established with the indication of cl concentrations dot colours black labels indicating hco3 concentrations mg l and blue labels indicating noble gas recharge temperatures ngt c in order to assess the origin of the groundwater samples in the new paleoclimatic model fig 17 it can be observed that part of the low sulphate waters seem to be older than the lgm this might be due to groundwaters having formed in periglacial conditions before permafrost sealed off recharged it is also striking that these samples show the lowest ngts which could confirm this hypothesis these findings may agree with those of raidla et al 2019 who dated methane in the groundwater of the cambrian vendian aquifer in estonia to have formed in the middle weichselian interstadial although they supposed it to be injected into the aquifer at a later stage by glacial meltwater in the late weichselian nevertheless the radiocarbon age model will have to be revisited in view of the findings of methane in the groundwater which could still cause some changes in the model ages of these samples waters with a higher so4 2 concentration have been interpreted in accordance with the well established hydrogeochemical processes that took place in the ledo paniselian aquifer the origin of the methane found in the ledo paniselian aquifer is postulated to be the methane bubbling periglacial swamps and lakes in or near to the unconfined part of the aquifer that served as a temporary recharge area leading to an alternative flow path during the lgm in the zone of interest these depressions on the geomorphological map are called the depression area of sleidinge de moor and heyse 1994 the organic matter responsible for methane generation may have been formed in the weichselian fluvio periglacial silty facies of the deposit of eeklo de moor and heyse 1974 that were deposited in shallow depressions including those due to thermokarst de moor 1963 this facies is known to contain peaty plates at several levels and has been found in boreholes in sleidinge de moor and van de velde 1995 another origin for the organic matter may be found in the peaty deposits of the tardiglacial early holocene deposits which occur widely in the moervaart depression to the south of the eolian sand ridge but more to the east see fig 2 and its extension just south of the depression area of sleidinge de moor and van de velde 1995 the extensive peat deposits in this area have been dated based on 14c and pollen analysis at 10 14 ka bp verbruggen 1971 in most of the boreholes at kluizen de watergroep in the depression area of sleidinge strongly humic substances are described in the upper 2 3 m while wood fragments are mentioned in some boreholes between 2 and 5 m 5 conclusions the results from this study have further confirmed that within the ledo paniselian freshening of water occurs displaying a typical freshening sequence nacl nahco3 mghco3 and cahco3 this freshening in the aquifer occurs mainly due to cation exchange through the bartonian clay by which ca2 cations are exchanged against marine cations mainly na the occurrence of cation exchange processes combined with the fact that the aquifer contains calcite leads to a second stage of calcite dissolution causing high hco3 concentrations in the aquifer in a zone at 10 km from the main recharge area hco3 concentration rises up to 900 mg l this phenomenon has been attributed to mixing corrosion blaser 2007 which occurs mainly due to the mixing of waters with a different calcite saturation index a zone with low sulphate has been identified in this zone sulphate reducing conditions caused the depletion of so4 2 the samples from de watergroep provided new insights with high methane concentrations the presence of methane indicates that methanogenic conditions have been reached in the aquifer which was postulated by walraevens et al 2019 based on the observation of degassed samples and various chemical and isotopic indicators the presence of methane is consistent the paleoclimatic evolution proposed by walraevens et al 2019 and confirms the presence of methane bubbling glacial lakes after the lgm due to thawing of the permafrost moreover new insights suggest that during the onset of thawing of the permafrost layer groundwater recharge took place from the methane bubbling lakes in an alternative recharge area to the south of the eolian sand ridge developing a relict flow path to the north west while permafrost was present evidences suggest that the methanogenic lakes developed at the southern side of the eolian sand ridge infiltration during the late glacial could have occurred in the unconfined part of the aquifer in the area now coinciding with depressions the waters would infiltrate probably during summer periods already in strongly reducing conditions and flow to the nw it was observed that model ages increase along this flow path also progressing cation exchange processes can be observed along this alternative path strong indications for this alternative flow path are the exceptionally low chloride concentrations which are lower than those in the main recharge area as well as the strikingly low sulphate concentrations matching with the observed high methane declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

opportunities to study groundwater recharge and flow in periglacial conditions during the last glacial maximum lgm due to its location in the permanent permafrost area south of the ice sheet at that time a palaeoclimatic record had been set up previously for this aquifer consisting of major ion chemistry stable isotopes radiocarbon and noble gases in this paper methane data have been used to further refine the paleoclimatic model along with revisiting in detail the set of chemical data focusing on the area where groundwaters recharged around the lgm are known to occur it was found that the high methane concentrations corroborate the hypothesis of groundwater recharge taking place during permafrost melting from methane bubbling lakes that had developed to the south of an eolian sand ridge a relict flow path existing in the aquifer during some period as permafrost was thawing has been established starting from these temporary recharge areas based on various chemical parameters radiocarbon model ages and noble gas recharge temperatures 1 introduction the mechanisms of groundwater replenishment and flow in periglacial environments are not well understood utting et al 2013 utting et al 2012 studied groundwater recharge and flow in an unconfined aquifer system discharging along rivers in the western arctic of canada and found that recharge is a mixture of snowmelt and precipitation mcintosh et al 2012 describe three possible sources of pleistocene groundwater recharge ice sheet meltwaters paleolakes that have formed in front of the ice margin and precipitation they made a review of pleistocene recharge in aquifers of europe and north america and distinguished between ice covered regions and regions affected by permafrost edmunds and milne 2001 synthesizing results of the eu funded palaeaux project mentioned recharge gaps during periods of permafrost cover that were found in several european aquifers as well as enhanced recharge into coastal aquifers during sea level low stands the latter explains how fresh groundwater is found at depths up to 250 300 m in the chalk aquifer in southern england along the english channel edmunds and milne 2001 vaikmäe et al 2001 found anomalously high excess air concentrations in the cambro vendian aquifer in estonia which they ascribed to subglacial recharge mcintosh et al 2012 emphasized the importance of confining units to preserve pleistocene meltwaters to prevent flushing of paleowaters by recent recharge thawing permafrost is known to release methane into the atmosphere schuur et al 2015 and nowadays there is large concern about the amounts of methane released into the atmosphere as this greenhouse gas is 25 times stronger than carbon dioxide in causing global warming amap 2015 during climate warming after the last glacial maximum lgm the large increase in global atmospheric methane concentration was contributed for more than 30 by an arctic or boreal source as deduced from polar ice core records walter et al 2007 these authors proposed methane bubbling from thermokarst lakes as the source it is known that permafrost deposits contain vast amounts of organic matter derived from the superficial active layer during glacial summers and prevented from decaying as they are frozen in the next winter period in a warming climate as the permafrost layer thaws this organic matter decomposes quickly releasing methane zimov et al 2006a 2006b the ledo paniselian aquifer in belgium has been proposed to offer unique opportunities to study groundwater recharge and flow in periglacial conditions during the lgm 14 21 ka bp due to its location in the permanent permafrost area south of the ice sheet at that time walraevens et al 2019 a palaeoclimatic record has been set up for this aquifer consisting of major ion chemistry stable isotopes radiocarbon and noble gases methane data were however not available recently methane data became available from three pumping sites of de watergroep the largest public drinking water supply company in flanders in the present paper this set of methane data is presented for this aquifer along with revisiting in detail the set of chemical data focusing on the area where groundwaters recharged around the lgm are known to occur 1 1 the ledo paniselian aquifer the ledo paniselian aquifer is part of an alternating sequence of marine tertiary eocene to oligocene clay and sand deposits gently dipping towards the north according to the inclination of the bedding fig 1 walraevens and cardenal 1994 it consists of pure to clayey unconsolidated marine sands up to 60 m thick and it is a semi confined aquifer as it is overlain by the bartonian clay which thickness can vary between 20 and 60 m underneath the aquifer is separated from the ypresian aquifer by a thin layer of paniselian clay recharge of the semi confined ledo paniselian aquifer takes place in the regions with a higher topographical elevation and where the aquifer is covered by the bartonian clay fig 1 walraevens 1987 discharge occurs partly to the south in the unconfined area where the ledo paniselian crops out beneath the quaternary sediments in this zone the piezometric levels in the aquifer are lower than in the adjacent area where it is semi confined the remaining major part of the recharged groundwater flows to the north where the depth of the aquifer increases walraevens 1987 groundwater flows to the north sea with a n to nne direction this paper focuses on the western part of the aquifer where a major recharge area is present near ursel fig 1 and where the groundwater flow is generally undisturbed a secondary recharge area coincides with a regional eolian sand ridge fig 2 location of sand ridge after de moor and heyse 1978 stretching from maldegem over eeklo zelzate wachtebeke and further to the east blaser et al 2010a and which is roughly expressed by a topographic elevation above 8 m taw above low spring tide sealevel the ledo paniselian aquifer has already been the subject of intensive research over the hydrodynamical and hydrogeochemical processes that occur within it walraevens 1987 1988 1990 cardenal and walraevens 1994 walraevens and cardenal 1994 walraevens et al 2001 2007 blaser et al 2010a in the semi confined ledo paniselian aquifer groundwater is recharged in two main recharge areas near ursel in the west and sint niklaas in the east a third smaller recharge area exists in between fig 1 recharge takes place through overlying clay layers while there is discharge from the semi confined aquifer to the unconfined part from the recharge areas onward groundwater on a pathway to deeper parts of the semi confined aquifer flows in a north direction further on deviating to the northwest towards the north sea basin this aquifer is an example of typical freshening which comprises two main processes dilution and cation exchange walraevens 1987 until the last regression at the end of the tertiary marine conditions prevailed in the sediments of the ledo paniselian aquifer and the bartonian clay walraevens and van camp 2005 infiltration of freshwater within the recharge area causes calcite dissolution while cation exchange takes place through passage of the bartonian clay blaser et al 2010a this resulted in a displacement of the marine cations in flow direction due to cation exchange walraevens 1987 causing a typical sequence of freshening groundwater types nacl nahco3 mghco3 and cahco3 classification after stuyfzand 1991 1 2 paleoclimatic evolution the ledo paniselian aquifer offers an opportunity to study periglacial groundwater recharge during the last glacial maximum lgm as it was located in the continuous permafrost zone to the south of the ice sheet at that time walraevens et al 2019 in the aquifer the occurrence of palaeowaters of holocene and pleistocene ages has been determined figs 1 2 together with a recharge gap which coincides with the lgm 21 14 ka bp blaser et al 2010a in addition residence times modelled from 14c data blaser et al 2010a and recharge paleoconditions blaser et al 2010b have also been determined in a smaller region following a flow line in the aquifer the large flemish valley extending north of the city of ghent figs 1 2 had been eroded since the saalian glacial period during the middle pleni weichselian 61 to 25 ka bp which had milder climatic conditions the flemish valley was refilled with fluviatile deposits in the extremely cold and dry late pleni weichselian an eolian sand ridge consisting of a few meters of eolian deposits developed on top of the fluviatile sediments blaser et al 2010a at least since the eemian interglacial 75 to 120 ka bp possibly since the end of the tertiary already when the sea regressed from large parts of the area groundwater is being recharged in the ursel region fig 1 which is topographically higher 15 to 29 m asl blaser et al 2010a walraevens et al 2019 at the climatic minimum corresponding with the lgm about 20 ka bp the sea level had dropped to 130 m bsl and permafrost is reported to have been present in the area walraevens et al 2019 and references therein it seems very likely that permafrost persisted during the lgm in the study area inhibiting recharge in the aquifer blaser et al 2010b walraevens et al 2019 fig 3 shows the evolution of noble gas temperatures ngt which reflect soil and groundwater temperatures in the recharge area blaser et al 2010b with modelled 14c ages of groundwater the lowest ngts recorded probably do not reflect the coldest period as there is a gap between 14 and 21 ka ago in recharge corresponding with the lgm in the 14c modelled ages walraevens et al 2019 a strong glacial cooling of 8 8 0 8 c was inferred from ngt between the warm modern groundwater and the cold glacial water walraevens et al 2019 however the cooling is not clearly expressed by δ18o which shows a barely positive gradient of 0 1 per c walraevens et al 2019 in line with the findings by loosli et al 2001 who found δ18o t slopes ranging from 0 0 to 0 5 with the lower values near to the coast during the last glacial period an additional secondary infiltration area was created within the eolian sand ridge near eeklo blaser et al 2010a in walraevens et al 2019 the presence of methane was invoked in specific parts of the aquifer but no methane analyses were available the present study reports a first set of methane data for the aquifer found in wells of water supply company de watergroep moreover in walraevens et al 2019 recharge from methane bubbling thermokarst lakes was proposed without actually describing their location and how this recharge had actually entered the aquifer and which flow path had been followed this research aims to shed light on these questions besides from the scientific interest there is also a societal practical importance to understanding the origin of methane in the aquifer methane has a high oxygen demand that can become problematic during the treatment for the production of drinking water therefore knowing what the methane source is and how it is distributed has a high practical value for public water supply company de watergroep 2 methods and available data the data available in the framework of this study consist of datasets from two phd theses carried out at ghent university walraevens 1987 blaser 2007 at one hand and of datasets from pumping sites property of de watergroep which are located nearby the study area of blaser 2007 fig 4 on or near to the eolian sand ridge at one hand the datasets from ghent university comprise chemical and isotopic analyses from the whole ledo paniselian aquifer walraevens 1987 walraevens et al 2001 sampled mostly between 1983 and 2000 and a main flow path of the aquifer studied by blaser 2007 this flow path is along cross section a a fig 1 most of the latter samples were taken between 1996 and 1998 but some locations were resampled in 2001 on the other hand the dataset from de watergroep consists of chemical analyses on samples taken in 2018 2019 from three different water extraction localities pumping sites eeklo and lembeke oosteeklo and prospective study site kluizen the samples from eeklo are located in the middle of the main flow path studied by blaser 2007 while the samples from lembeke oosteeklo and kluizen are located more to the east fig 4 the dataset from de watergroep contained a series of yearly chemical analyses for most of the sites for the purpose of this study only one of the chemical analyses of each sampling point has been selected to be interpreted together with the datasets from ghent university for the selection of the chemical analysis from de watergroep the completeness of the analysis was considered in the first place this was the case of lembeke oosteeklo where for the wells 2003 039 f0 040 f0 041 f0 and 043 f0 only one complete chemical analysis was available in the second place in the locations where multiple analyses were available over time the proximity of the measurement in time to the most recent methane measurements from de watergroep 18 4 2019 and 14 6 2019 was considered an additional series of 7 wells was drilled by de watergroep at kluizen in 2020 and methane and full chemical analysis was performed on the water samples between october and december 2020 for the data sets of ghent university groundwater samples were analysed for hydrochemical composition and in selected samples also for stable isotopes radiocarbon and noble gases for dating and estimation of recharge temperatures sampling of hydrochemistry was performed by pumping selected wells and collecting in pe bottles after passing the water through a flow through cell in which ph ec eh dissolved oxygen o2 and water temperature were measured and after filtration samples for cation analysis were acidified in the field analysis of major cations was done by faas and of major anions by spectrophotometry stable isotopes 2h 18o 13c were measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry 14c activity was measured by means of proportional gas counting low level counting in methane ch4 which had previously been reduced from produced co2 blaser et al 2010a ch4 from de watergroep samples was measured at the commercial laboratory eurofins and was analysed by gas chromatography and flame ionization detection sampling for he and the other noble gases was done in cu tubes gas tight connected to the pump s outlet tube in which the sample was collected by closing two stainless steel clamps noble gas analysis was performed by mass spectrometry according to the methods described by beyerle et al 2000 blaser et al 2010b realized a paleoclimate interpretation of the noble gas and stable isotope data which was further refined by walraevens et al 2019 the analytical results have been further processed in qgis for sampling positioning and the realization of concentration maps the realization of the concentrations maps has been done manually interpreting the trends seen in the cross plots and considering the hydrogeochemical processes that take place in the aquifer phreeqc modelling parkhurst and appelo 1999 has also been carried for a group of selected samples along the main flow path in order to know the saturation indices for specific minerals and compounds 3 results the chemical results from the samples studied by blaser 2007 and the selected samples from de watergroep are presented in table 1 the concentrations of some anions and cations describe different trends along the flowline while sodium na increases along the flow line fig 5a the concentration of calcium ca2 decreases fig 5b there is a sudden decrease in ca2 concentration around 10 km from the main recharge area of the ledo paniselian aquifer at the end of the studied flow line there is a smooth increase in its concentration as well magnesium mg2 and potassium k describe a similar trend along the flow line there is a smooth increase in both concentrations at the beginning followed by a sudden drop between 10 km and 15 km from the main recharge area fig 5c and d after this drop in mg2 and k concentration there is a rise which is higher in k concentration than in mg2 finally chloride cl concentration describes a similar pattern as na increasing along the flow line fig 5e however while na starts to increase from 10 km distance to recharge cl concentration begins to increase only 15 km away from the recharge area and it increases faster on the remaining part of the studied flow line concentration maps for this detailed study area have been made for na ca2 and cl fig 6a b and c respectively these maps reflect the major trends which have already been seen in the cross plots of the anions or cations concentration against the distance from the recharge area however in the na concentration map a zone with a lower concentration than its surroundings can be observed fig 6a this zone is located between the isolines of 100 and 200 mg l and the concentration in those sampling points is lower than 100 mg l in addition cl shows a zone with concentrations lower than 20 mg l fig 6c this zone matches with the restricted area where na concentrations are lower as well anions such as bicarbonate hco3 and sulphate so4 2 show different trends along the main flow line fig 7a and b respectively hco3 shows two increasing trends which are split by a vertical trend located at around 12 km from the main recharge area fig 7a it can also be observed that after the first increasing trend the concentrations of hco3 in the ledo paniselian aquifer are lower than 500 mg l while after the vertical trend split the hco3 concentration is higher than 600 mg l in the aquifer samples from de watergroep show higher concentrations in this second trend line lembeke oosteeklo and kluizen the concentration map did not show any clearly pattern fig 8a sulphate concentration along the aquifer shows three clearly differentiated trends fig 7b first the concentration of so4 2 decreases from 150 mg l to less than 10 mg l during the first 10 km of the flow line between 10 and 15 km from the main recharge area so4 2 concentration remains below 10 mg l after this zone with low sulphate concentration it increases up to 300 mg l at the end of the flow line these patterns are clearly reflected by the concentration map fig 8b where the zone with low sulphate concentrations is clearly delimited methane ch4 was found in high concentrations in the catchment areas of lembeke oosteeklo and kluizen and also in one of both investigated wells at kluizen table 1 these high concentrations of ch4 seem to be present in the area tentative isolines in fig 8c matching with the area of low so4 2 and low cl concentrations hydrogen sulphide h2s was not detected in the analysis from de watergroep all samples were below detection limit 4 discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemical processes the ledo paniselian aquifer is a model example of a freshening aquifer in which freshwater infiltration of cahco3 type is recharged through the bartonian clay replacing the initial marine conditions and resulting in two processes dilution and cation exchange walraevens et al 2019 this is verified by the trends which have been shown in the results section where ca2 decreases along the flow line while na increases consequently it can be observed that ca2 decreases as na increases in the aquifer fig 9 therefore the marine cations na k and mg2 absorbed to clay minerals are successively exchanged for ca2 from the infiltrating waters resulting in a typical chromatographic sequence of groundwater types cahco3 mghco3 and nacl downstream in the aquifer walraevens et al 2019 phreeqc modelling results have shown that the aquifer is saturated with respect to calcite table 2 when cation exchange occurs in calcite saturated waters dissolved ca2 is lowered resulting in undersaturation which leads to a second stage of calcite dissolution causing high hco3 concentrations in the aquifer walraevens 1987 walraevens et al 2019 therefore the observed increase of hco3 in flow direction fig 10 is due to increased cation exchange however in fig 10 the samples outlined with a dashed line show anomalously elevated concentrations of hco3 up to 900 mg l these samples are all located at about 10 km from the main recharge area blaser 2007 attributed this phenomenon to the influence of the secondary recharge area near eeklo at the eolian sand ridge and to mixing corrosion which consists of the mixing of different calcite saturated waters the samples from the catchment area of eeklo fit in the anomalously high concentrations range fig 10 however even though the de watergroep samples from lembeke oosteeklo and kluizen present also hco3 concentrations of up to 900 mg l they do not fit in this trend fig 10 red outlined samples this could be due to their position with respect to the main flow path as they are located more to the east which could lead to the consideration of a radiated flow line and therefore a not very precise projection on the main flow path yet another recharge area might be involved as well a zone with low so4 2 concentrations can be observed in the ledo paniselian aquifer fig 8b the samples which fall into this domain are mainly characterized by a low and negative redox potential eh fig 11 these are indicators for sulphate reduction in the aquifer walraevens et al 2019 associate the low so4 2 values few mg l to completed sulphate reduction the area with low so4 2 concentrations and the area with high ch4 concentrations seem to spatially coincide fig 8 this area can be found between 10 km and 15 km from the main recharge area fig 12 low so4 2 values are due to sulphate reduction therefore in this area of the aquifer anaerobic conditions prevail methane is produced by the reduction of carbon dioxide or the degradation or fermentation of organic carbon and its presence indicates anaerobic conditions and methanogenesis christensen et al 2000 moreover the groundwater has been found to be in equilibrium with a gas phase with high partial pressures of methane pch4 10 0 27 to 10 0 22 atm in the samples from de watergroep table 2 if exposed to the atmosphere this groundwater will degas methane several sources of methane can be distinguished biotic methane can have a microbial or a thermogenic origin the former is formed by the action of methanogenic bacteria the latter is generated by the thermal degradation of organic matter both forms are biotic as they are derived from organic matter in contrast abiotic methane is formed by magma degassing or by geochemical reactions not involving organic matter etiope and schoell 2014 according to etiope and ionescu 2015 abiotic methane can be found in the ocean floor and in continental settings but most is found on continents in low temperature environments even at shallow depth in ultramafic rocks and in the precambrian crystalline basement the conditions for generating abiotic methane do not comply with the ledo paniselian setting thermogenic methane is originating in deep sedimentary basins at high temperatures and pressure causing the decomposition of organic matter frieling et al 2016 investigated thermogenic methane and co2 release from hydrothermal vent complexes associated with volcanic intrusions in the north atlantic igneous province at the paleocene eocene thermal maximum during this period of global warming large amounts of 13c depleted carbon were injected into the ocean atmosphere system schlegel et al 2011 describe both thermogenic and microbial methane in illinois basin the thermogenic methane is found in the central deep parts of the sedimentary basin at depths 700 m while the microbial methane is produced at shallower depth at the basin margins the thermogenic methane is associated with older fluids 4he age on average 1 0 ma while younger groundwaters show microbial methane this microbial methane occurs in association with anomalously low salinity water suggesting deep groundwater recharge as evidenced by δ18o values the source of recharge was not glacial meltwater but paleoprecipitation schlegel et al 2011 groundwater in the ledo paniselian occurs at limited depth usually 100 m and 4he is much smaller that for the groundwaters in illinois basin a thermogenic origin of the methane may be excluded methane in the ledo paniselian is expected to have a microbial origin resulting from the degradation of organic matter in strongly reducing conditions such conditions may be caused by large accumulations of organic matter causing a strong oxygen demand in these methanogenic conditions sulphate is not stable it has already been reduced in less reducing conditions berner 1981 christensen et al 2000 and therefore low sulphate levels are expected van stempvoort et al 2005 discuss oxidation of methane by sulphate reduction in the case of fugitive methane leaking from an oil well into a shallow aquifer milucka et al discuss the microbiology of this process van stempvoort et al 2005 found a strong positive correlation between sulphate and 13c of bicarbonate pointing to this process in the ledo paniselian aquifer such correlation is not found fig 13 and there is no evidence for external sources of the methane 4 2 paleoclimatic constraints it seems very likely that continuous permafrost persisted during the lgm in the study area walraevens et al 2019 14c model ages show a gap in recharge occurring during the lgm 14 21 kyr bp fig 3 which is attributed to the presence of a continuous permafrost layer this continuous permafrost layer with a thickness between 50 and 100 m would have inhibited water to infiltrate in the aquifer walraevens et al 2019 it is known that thawing permafrost can contain large amounts of organic matter contemporaneous with the permafrost layer which is formed during pleni glacial summers in the active layer after its formation this organic matter becomes incorporated into the permafrost in response to surface mineral deposition zimov et al 2006a when thawing of the permafrost occurs massive decomposition of the organic matter contained within it leads to strongly reducing conditions at shallow depths and methane bubbles are formed walter et al 2007 schuur et al 2015 walraevens et al 2019 observed degassing in the noble gas data in some samples which was not an artefact of sampling but methane was not measured in their analysis however the newest analysis from de watergroep at the catchment areas of eeklo lembeke oosteeklo and kluizen have revealed that methane is present in the sulphate reduced zone therefore it can be ascertained that methanogenic conditions which would have caused methane formation and the subsequent degassing were reached in the aquifer during thawing of the permafrost recharge from methane bubbling thermokarst lakes was inferred by walraevens et al 2019 upstream of the age gap the degassed groundwater was found to show deviating signals from the non degassed groundwater bicarbonate is very high which was ascribed to methanogenesis next to calcite dissolution sulfate is strikingly low due to strongly reducing conditions δ13c of tic is strongly enriched as a result of methanogenesis δ18o and δ2h are both enriched due to evaporation from late glacial lakes and swamps before infiltration 14c model ages are too young which may be related to the distorted flow pattern when permafrost opens up ngts are too high as recharge took place only in summer in swampy conditions raidla et al 2019 found methane in the cambrian vendian aquifer in estonia at levels up to 26 mg l comparable to the ledo paniselian aquifer they studied isotopic composition of the methane and concluded that it has a biogenic origin and was produced by reduction of co2 they postulate that methane formed in a periglacial arctic wetland environment covering the outcrop area of the aquifer prior to the advance of the ice sheet in the late weichselian infiltrating glacial meltwater could have transported the methane into the aquifer they hypothesize that the methane was formed during the middle weichselian interstadial from 26 to 32 ka bp raidla et al 2019 our study area was not affected by an ice sheet as long as the permafrost was continuous two independent aquifers developed separated by the frozen permafrost layer with the ledo paniselian being the deepest aquifer of both recharge could not take place in the deeper aquifer and the shallow upper aquifer the active layer during glacial summers discharged at the surface where a braided river system developed at the southern border of the eolian sand ridge during the whole late glacial period several large shallow lakes have been present verbruggen et al 1991 the degassed samples recognized by walraevens et al 2019 and the samples from de watergroep are located within or very near to the eolian sand ridge fig 2 in this area the bartonian clay is thin cfr fig 1 or even missing near to sampling point b28 fig 14 and recharge could have resumed earlier than in other parts of the aquifer walraevens et al 2019 evidences of methane occurring in the deeper aquifer have been found and thus methane might have infiltrated while the permafrost layer was thawing nicolsky and shakhova 2010 discuss the development of open taliks under thermokarst lakes and river paleo valleys where the permafrost has disappeared such conditions may provide gateways to the deeper aquifer and recharge of lake water into the aquifer may take place therefore the origin of the methane found in the ledo paniselian aquifer is postulated to be the methane bubbling periglacial swamps and lakes under which in shallow groundwater conditions degassing could occur walraevens et al 2019 the combined effect of methanogenesis together with the general calcite dissolution and possibly increased by mixing corrosion may have caused the high hco3 concentrations the degassing is indicative for methanogenesis in this part of the ledo paniselian aquifer there are several arguments to propose that the degassing took place during recharge first of all the radiogenic he concentrations in the degassed samples are similar to undegassed samples and thus seem to be unaffected by the degassing this indicates early degassing before the radiogenic he accumulated blaser et al 2010b second degassing is more likely to occur near the surface under limited hydrostatic pressure degassing requires the presence of gas bubbles which could happen in shallow lakes or also in their sediments or shallow parts of the aquifer in the recharge zone further downstream in a confined aquifer the pressure is likely too high for even large amounts of ch4 to form bubbles and finally the observed methane concentrations correspond to equilibrium with a methane pressure of 10 0 27 to 10 0 22 atm and are compatible with a shallow source if the degassing had happened under much higher total pressure deep in the aquifer more methane should have remained dissolved in the water 4 3 new insights an alternative flow path during the lgm the transitional phase during which permafrost thawing occurred may have distorted the flow pattern immediately following the recharge gap walraevens et al 2019 in the present study a possible relict flow path may have been found the exceptionally low concentrations of cl and so4 2 in a delimited zone fig 13 and the trends of some parameters along this possible flow path fig 14 indeed provide indications for such a relict flow path the location of this zone with low concentrations fig 13 suggests that the infiltration took place close to sample b28 blue dot near start of arrow in fig 13 south of the sand ridge with a flow direction to the nw all samples in this alternative flow path present so4 2 concentrations lower than 5 mg l and therefore must have been exposed at least to sulphate reduction conditions moreover this zone corresponds to the area where methane was found in the samples of de watergroep the concentration of na ca2 and cl seem to describe a freshening pattern along this proposed relict flow path fig 15 which would not be expected considering recharge from the main recharge area ca2 and na show opposite trends which could be due to cation exchange cl remains at low concentrations along most of the flow line and increases at the end reflecting the influence of seawater hco3 shows a decreasing trend along the relict flowline the pink isoline in fig 14 delimits the area where so4 2 5 mg l reflecting strong sulphate reduction in this area cl is mostly lower than in the main recharge area which can be ascribed to recharge under conditions where the sea was at larger distance from the recharge area than today cl in precipitation decreases with increasing distance from the sea and probably most importantly absence of recharge through the overlying bartonian clay which has still preserved some minor traces of its marine origin and is even today contributing some cl to the groundwater recharging through it the hypothesis of the alternative flow line during the lgm has been further tested with the 14c model ages from blaser et al 2010a and the noble gas temperature data from blaser et al 2010b what can be observed is that model ages increase along the flow line towards the nw fig 16a which is consistent with the hypothesis moreover noble gas temperatures which indicate recharge conditions decrease along the possible flow path fig 16b and as well with model ages fig 16c as it can be observed in fig 16c the lowest recharge temperatures occur before the gap at an age of 20 000 years approximately just before the lgm moreover the samples found right after the age gap show higher recharge temperatures and degassing which has been ascribed to methanogenic conditions walraevens et al 2019 the higher temperatures may be due to increasing temperature in the recharge area as permafrost was thawing walraevens et al 2019 the fact that the samples along this alternative path have been under sulphate reducing and methanogenic conditions suggests that infiltration took place from the methane bubbling thermokarst lakes verbruggen et al 1991 described the existence of lakes at the southern border of the eolian sand ridge de moor and heyse 1978 who described the morphological evolution of the area mapped geomorphologic depressions topographically lower than the sand ridge to the south of the eolian sand ridge fig 2 according to walraevens et al 2019 the methane bubbling lakes formed south of the sand ridge it thus seems acceptable that these depressions coincided with the thermokarst lakes and that recharge from these methane bubbling lakes took place at the end of the lgm during permafrost thawing giving rise to a short term relict flow path the development of open gateways to the aquifer underneath the thermokarst lakes may have occurred faster in the unconfined part of the aquifer as it takes longer for the frozen porewater in clay to thaw compared to sand therefore during permafrost thawing groundwater infiltrating near b28 in the methanogenic conditions of the lakes would follow this alternative flow path and flow further in the aquifer with a nw direction a cross plot of so4 2 concentration against model ages was established with the indication of cl concentrations dot colours black labels indicating hco3 concentrations mg l and blue labels indicating noble gas recharge temperatures ngt c in order to assess the origin of the groundwater samples in the new paleoclimatic model fig 17 it can be observed that part of the low sulphate waters seem to be older than the lgm this might be due to groundwaters having formed in periglacial conditions before permafrost sealed off recharged it is also striking that these samples show the lowest ngts which could confirm this hypothesis these findings may agree with those of raidla et al 2019 who dated methane in the groundwater of the cambrian vendian aquifer in estonia to have formed in the middle weichselian interstadial although they supposed it to be injected into the aquifer at a later stage by glacial meltwater in the late weichselian nevertheless the radiocarbon age model will have to be revisited in view of the findings of methane in the groundwater which could still cause some changes in the model ages of these samples waters with a higher so4 2 concentration have been interpreted in accordance with the well established hydrogeochemical processes that took place in the ledo paniselian aquifer the origin of the methane found in the ledo paniselian aquifer is postulated to be the methane bubbling periglacial swamps and lakes in or near to the unconfined part of the aquifer that served as a temporary recharge area leading to an alternative flow path during the lgm in the zone of interest these depressions on the geomorphological map are called the depression area of sleidinge de moor and heyse 1994 the organic matter responsible for methane generation may have been formed in the weichselian fluvio periglacial silty facies of the deposit of eeklo de moor and heyse 1974 that were deposited in shallow depressions including those due to thermokarst de moor 1963 this facies is known to contain peaty plates at several levels and has been found in boreholes in sleidinge de moor and van de velde 1995 another origin for the organic matter may be found in the peaty deposits of the tardiglacial early holocene deposits which occur widely in the moervaart depression to the south of the eolian sand ridge but more to the east see fig 2 and its extension just south of the depression area of sleidinge de moor and van de velde 1995 the extensive peat deposits in this area have been dated based on 14c and pollen analysis at 10 14 ka bp verbruggen 1971 in most of the boreholes at kluizen de watergroep in the depression area of sleidinge strongly humic substances are described in the upper 2 3 m while wood fragments are mentioned in some boreholes between 2 and 5 m 5 conclusions the results from this study have further confirmed that within the ledo paniselian freshening of water occurs displaying a typical freshening sequence nacl nahco3 mghco3 and cahco3 this freshening in the aquifer occurs mainly due to cation exchange through the bartonian clay by which ca2 cations are exchanged against marine cations mainly na the occurrence of cation exchange processes combined with the fact that the aquifer contains calcite leads to a second stage of calcite dissolution causing high hco3 concentrations in the aquifer in a zone at 10 km from the main recharge area hco3 concentration rises up to 900 mg l this phenomenon has been attributed to mixing corrosion blaser 2007 which occurs mainly due to the mixing of waters with a different calcite saturation index a zone with low sulphate has been identified in this zone sulphate reducing conditions caused the depletion of so4 2 the samples from de watergroep provided new insights with high methane concentrations the presence of methane indicates that methanogenic conditions have been reached in the aquifer which was postulated by walraevens et al 2019 based on the observation of degassed samples and various chemical and isotopic indicators the presence of methane is consistent the paleoclimatic evolution proposed by walraevens et al 2019 and confirms the presence of methane bubbling glacial lakes after the lgm due to thawing of the permafrost moreover new insights suggest that during the onset of thawing of the permafrost layer groundwater recharge took place from the methane bubbling lakes in an alternative recharge area to the south of the eolian sand ridge developing a relict flow path to the north west while permafrost was present evidences suggest that the methanogenic lakes developed at the southern side of the eolian sand ridge infiltration during the late glacial could have occurred in the unconfined part of the aquifer in the area now coinciding with depressions the waters would infiltrate probably during summer periods already in strongly reducing conditions and flow to the nw it was observed that model ages increase along this flow path also progressing cation exchange processes can be observed along this alternative path strong indications for this alternative flow path are the exceptionally low chloride concentrations which are lower than those in the main recharge area as well as the strikingly low sulphate concentrations matching with the observed high methane declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

1423,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas contaminated compost materials have been applied over the last few decades to agricultural fields in germany resulting in large scale diffuse pfas plumes the leaching behavior of pfas from the first two identified contaminated agricultural sites in germany were investigated one at brilon scharfenberg north rhine westphalia bs nrw and the other at rastatt mannheim baden württemberg the specific objectives of this study were to assess the longevity of the pfas agricultural sources and compare standardized column percolation tests to long term leaching of pfas from contaminated sites the advection dispersion model adm was used to compare the leaching behavior of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos from standardized column percolation tests and long term field leaching data from the bs nrw site column leaching tests conducted with pfos and pfoa contaminated soil simulated the initial rapid decline but did not predict the long term behavior tailing observed at the field site over 12 years trend analyses of the pfas field data from the bs nrw showed that concentrations had stabilized and that individual pfas exhibited distinct seasonal fluctuations the latter is likely due to the ongoing transformation of precursors and a seasonal influence on production rates of mobile pfas mass balances conducted at both sites indicate that complete removal of these compounds will likely take years to decades to occur which is expected from the results of the column leaching tests keywords pfas

in the environment oecd 2018 degradable pfas e g n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide ethanol based phosphate diesters disampap are often referred to as precursor substances that are transformed to final transformation products such as perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos benskin et al 2013 these final transformation products are persistent against further breakdown and appear to be widespread within the environment chen et al 2019 falk et al 2019 routti et al 2015 primary sources of pfas in the environment are fire fighting training grounds industrial sites landfills and wastewater treatment plants wwtps itrc 2018 however the historical application of biosolids compost has led to known large scale diffuse contamination of agricultural land and adjacent bodies of water in the states of baden wuerttemberg germany and north rhine westphalia germany and has likely occurred in other regions worldwide delschen et al 2007 rastatt 2016 currently only a few studies have characterized the extent of pfas contamination at agricultural sites and their long term fate in the environment lindstrom et al 2011 washington et al 2010 yoo et al 2010 gellrich et al 2012 stahl et al 2018 söhlmann et al 2018 washington et al 2010 and yoo et al 2010 reported the first pfas contaminated agricultural fields in the united states of america usa in decatur alabama pfas contaminated sludges from a wwtp had previously been applied to an agricultural area of approximately 20 km2 for over a decade leading to the pollution of both surface water and groundwater lindstrom et al 2011 washington et al 2010 soil analyses of the polluted agricultural areas showed levels of precursor substances such as fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs up to 166 μg kg and final transformation products such as c6 c14 perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas and pfos with perfluorodecanoic acid pfda up to 990 μg kg washington et al 2010 yoo et al 2010 they found that long chain pfcas resided predominantly in the topsoil while c6 c8 migrated to deeper soil layers lindstrom et al 2011 investigated surface and groundwater for pfas in the vicinity of the agricultural fields in decatur alabama they detected pfcas from c4 c9 and perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas between c4 c8 showing the mobility of these compounds in soils while c10 c14 pfcas remained in the soil and were not detected in groundwater this observation is consistent with the findings of washington et al 2010 and other studies investigating perfluoroalky acids pfaas mobility in soil bräunig et al 2019 gellrich et al 2012 two of the first known pfas contaminated agricultural sites similar to the one described in washington et al 2010 were discovered in germany in 2006 and 2013 after the application of compost and fertilizers mixed with pfas containing waste materials e g paper sludge during the time of application no regulatory limits for pfas existed in the german fertilizer ordinance gfo which regulates the use of fertilizers soil conditioners culture substrates and plant aids in 2012 the gfo was updated to include a limit of 100 μg kg dry weight pfoa pfos to limit the spread of pfas in the environment dümv 2012 while the use of pfos and pfoa are regulated for fertilizing materials germany still has no binding limits for pfas in drinking water and groundwater in 2017 the german federal environmental agency uba released a list with 13 pfas recommending regulatory limits for seven of these compounds in drinking water table s1 s2 in 2020 the european union eu included pfas into their drinking water directive setting a limit value for the sum of 20 distinct pfas of 0 1 μg l and total pfas of 0 5 μg l eu directive 2184 2020 the contaminated agricultural sites discovered in germany triggered laboratory studies combined with clean up and monitoring programs to reduce pfas loads from contaminated agricultural soils to surface and groundwater the primary objective of this study was to assess the long term behavior of pfas in agricultural soils specific objectives of the study were to 1 evaluate the ability of standardized column percolation tests to predict long term leaching of pfas from contaminated agricultural sites 2 to assess the seasonality of pfas leaching behavior in agricultural soil and 3 quantify the longevity of pfas agricultural sources field leaching pfas data of a 10 ha site in brilon scharfenberg north rhine westphalia bs nrw site monitored over a period of more than 12 years were compared to laboratory column studies conducted after the contamination was detected in 2006 earlier studies showed that data from column leaching tests from various types of material e g contaminated soil demolition waste and waste incineration ash for different compounds e g heavy metals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons compared well to lysimeters and could be fitted reasonably well with the advection dispersion model adm grathwohl and susset 2009 as such soil column and field leaching data were fitted with the adm to understand the short and long term leaching behavior trend analyses were also performed using the seasonal kendall test mann kendall test and exponential decay functions to estimate rate constants data from this site are compared with another case of a 644 ha contamination of agricultural land detected more recently in rastatt mannheim baden württemberg southern germany which will further be referred to as the baden site 2 sites and methods 2 1 brilon scharfenberg north rhine westphalia bs nrw site column tests and field data 2 1 1 site history details of the site history and treatment system were previously reported by delschen et al 2007 but a summary is provided here fig 1 a soil screening campaign of agricultural land in the vicinity of the ruhr river around the city of olsberg north rhine westphalia was conducted by the state office for nature environment and consumer protection lanuv in 2006 looking specifically for the source of pfoa and pfos in the ruhr river lanuv 2011 the lanuv soil campaign results showed that 1 802 ha of farmland were likely contaminated with around 420 kg pfas with the 10 ha bs nrw site being the primary source of pfas leaching into the ruhr river fig 2 pfas detected at the bs nrw site primarily resides in the first 0 6 m of topsoil and the maximum pfas concentration detected within the soil was approximately 6 300 μg pfos pfoa kg which would result in an estimated 390 kg pfos pfoa being applied to 90 000 tons of soil delschen et al 2007 the suspected pfas contamination at the site was the result of the application of pfas containing compost which had been applied at the bs nrw site from 2004 to 2006 lanuv 2011 in early 2007 a drainage system connected to an activated carbon ac filtration plant with a capacity to handle 28 m3 h of contaminated water was installed at the 10 ha bs nrw site to remove pfas from the seepage water before being discharged into the steinbecke and the bermecke which are tributaries of the river möhne hölzer et al 2008 fig 3 in january 2009 the water capacity was increased to 80 m3 h lanuv 2011 the monitoring of pfoa and pfos inflow

leaching tests for pfoa and pfos column leaching tests are used to characterize the release behavior of inorganic and organic target compounds from solid materials din 19528 2009 compared to lysimeters which run in real time column leaching tests are conducted as a time lapse material is packed into a column and percolated with water in the up flow mode under saturated conditions samples are taken at the defined liquid to solid ls ratios the ls ratio is the amount of water that has been in contact with the solid material up flow water saturated column leaching tests were conducted in september 2006 before the installation of the ac filtration plant using previously described methods grathwohl and susset 2009 din 19528 2009 the columns had a diameter of 5 5 cm and a length of 30 cm

pfos initial concentrations were 400 μg kg and 1 500 μg kg respectively both contaminated subsoil and topsoil were packed in layers up to a height of 25 cm and covered with a 2 cm thick quartz sand layer at the upper and lower section of the column to ensure that water flows in and evenly across the entire width of the column and to pre filter the eluate the column was flooded from bottom to top

southern germany baden site batch shaking test and soil extraction 2 2 1 site history in 2013 pfaas were detected in a drinking water well near rastatt germany rp karlsruhe 2018 the source of the pfaas was determined to be an upgradient agricultural area 644 ha where pfas contaminated compost was repeatedly applied to topsoils between 2000 and 2008 söhlmann et al 2018 the compost mixture likely consisted of a broad spectrum of pfas used in paper coatings including but not limited to pfaas and precursors e g polyfluorinated dialkylated phosphate ester dipap disampaps bugsel and zwiener 2020 bugsel and zwiener 2020 identified 12 pfas classes in soil samples from the agricultural soils while the majority were dipaps from 4 2 6 2 to 12 2 14 2 and disampaps only c8 c8 the extent of the pfas pollution for each field can vary due to different application rates pfas concentrations in contaminated compost and different mixtures of pfas for further characterization of the groundwater contamination the state of baden württemberg initiated a monitoring campaign analyzing 970 groundwater samples for pfas rastatt 2016 the following pfas were detected during the monitoring at the baden site perfluorododecanoic acid pfdoa perfluoroundecanoic acid pfuna pfba pfpea pfhxa pfhpa pfna pfda pfbs pfhxs pfoa pfos and perfluorooctanesulfonamide fosa these data showed that 98 of pfaas in groundwater were c4 c8 pfcas rastatt 2016 it should be noted that pfas are ultimately discharged into the river rhine 2 2 2 extraction batch shaking tests of top and subsoil samples soil extraction and ls 2 1 batch shaking data sets were obtained from arcadis gmbh to assess the distribution of c4 c14 pfcas and c4 c8 and c10 pfsas in the topsoil and subsoil at the baden site the soil extraction data was obtained in accordance with din 38414 14 whereas ls 2 1 batch shaking studies were conducted in accordance with din 19529 in total over 2 000 different soil samples were analyzed 3 results discussion 3 1 brilon scharfenberg north rhine westphalia bs nrw comparison of column to field data column tests were conducted according to the german standards din 19528 2009 table 1 k d α and c s o were used as fitting parameters for the adm curve fitting was carried out with the matlab tool lsqcurvefit to fit the measured data the application of the adm relies on the local equilibrium assumption which is confirmed by the good fit of the column leaching data to the model fig 5 table 2 with a e 0 97 except for the pfos topsoil column which had a e 0 43 the topsoil initially shows variable pfos concentrations and the model was fitted to average concentrations k d values and arithmetic mean α values fitted in the column tests were used in the adm equation to fit the pfoa and pfos field leaching data with the assumption that the mean annual seepage recharge rate was 600 mm year at the bs nwr site delschen et al 2007 since the pfas concentrations measured in soil samples from the site showed large variability c s o was used as the only fitting parameter for the field models delschen et al 2007 as fig 6 shows the model fits the field data reasonably well but fails to predict the long term tailing observed in the field reasons for that may be manifold e g heterogeneous distribution of pollutants back diffusion from low permeability zone etc but this might also come from the slow but ongoing transformation of precursor substances into the target compounds the model shows that the removal of 90 pfoa takes about five years ls 3 5 and approximately nine years ls 6 5 are needed for the removal of 99 pfoa in terms of pfos ls 10 was not long enough to capture the long term behavior of pfos although the adm is in good agreement with column tests it is a simplistic model that does not account for potential pfas retention processes as described by brusseau 2018 e g accumulation at the air water interface which can additionally increase pfas retention in the vadose zone 3 2 seasonal analysis of field data bs rnw to assess the seasonality of the individual pfas at the site the data were categorized according to the season of the year in which they were measured the monitoring period to construct fig 7 for pfoa and pfos ranged from july 2007 to january 2019 whereas the monitoring period ranged from march 2008 to january 2019 for all other pfas identified at the site the seasonality of the individual pfas detected at the site for the monitoring period were assessed using the kruskal wallis comparison test table s3 the kruskal wallis comparison test confirmed a statistical difference among the seasonal data for all detected pfas except for pfhpa and the long chain compounds pfna and pfos in general concentrations of the short chain pfas were higher in the fall and winter suggesting production and accumulation of these compounds during the spring and summer and mobilization during recharge in fall and winter for long chain pfas seasonal concentration changes might be buffered by sorption in the soil 3 3 assessment of trends at the bs nrw site the individual pfas species data collected from february 2008 to january 2019 at the bs nrw site were considered for analysis although data collection for pfoa and pfos began in january 2007 it was not until february 2008 when additional pfas species were analyzed table 3 shows results for both the seasonal kendall and the mann kendall tests to obtain pfas trends indicating that pfba pfpea pfhxa and pfda are relatively stable whereas pfhpa pfoa pfna pfbs pfhxs and pfos demonstrate a decreasing trend perfluorodecanesulfonic acid pfds was not analyzed since limited data n 6 exists for this compound as monitoring did not begin until july 2017 additionally microsoft excel was used to fit simple exponential decay functions to pfas data to predict k of pfas table 3 fig s1 to s10 which ranged from 0 13 yr 1 to 0 012 yr 1 overall the results of the trend analysis and k calculations suggest that short chain pfas have stabilized most likely caused by the continuous production from unknown precursors at the site long chain pfas seem to decrease possibly reflecting retardation of these compounds initially present in soil compared to short chain pfas 3 4 baden site after the discovery of pfas contamination at the baden site several hundred agricultural fields were sampled at different depths and ls 2 1 batch shaking tests were conducted to determine potential pfas concentrations in the leachate to compare the bs nrw site and the baden site a relative composition profile was created using the mean aqueous phase concentrations derived from the inflow of the ac filtration plant bs nrw site and samples from two different depths from the baden site table s4 contains the values used to determine relative compositions at both sites pfoa and pfos accounted for up 70 and around 44 of the leachate composition at bs nrw site and at the baden site respectively fig 8 at the baden site the composition is more diverse compared to the bs nrw site which could be due to the application of different waste materials and the relatively higher abundance of other precursors as discussed by bugsel and zwiener 2020 the leachate composition between the topsoil and subsoil at the baden site is similar c4 c10 pfcas and pfos dominate the leachate compounds with c11 represent only a minor fraction of pfas found in the seepage water and tend to reside in the topsoil fig s11 this is further supported by groundwater monitoring data from the baden site which showed that 98 of pfas detected were c4 c8 pfcas rastatt 2016 samples for soil extraction and 2 1 batch shaking data were collected between 2014 and 2019 and showed that a major fraction of pfas still resides in topsoils even though the last application of pfas contaminated fertilizer occurred in 2008 short chain pfaas move relatively quickly to deeper soil layers while long chain pfaas will stay in the topsoil due to lower mobility caused by sorption based on the bs nrw column tests bs nrw field leaching data baden site soil extraction data and groundwater monitoring data from the baden site it is expected time scales for the complete leaching of pfas from agricultural soils at both the baden site and bs nrw site will be similar aqueous leachate concentrations of short chain pfcas are higher than for long chain pfcas suggesting that short chain pfcas leach more readily from the soil than long chain pfcas after the application of pfas contaminated material or after short chain pfas have been produced by precursors present within the topsoil additionally these data suggest that long chain pfcas tend to accumulate in topsoils until the degradation of precursors has ceased and transport to groundwater will be retarded compared to short chain pfas the time scales for the degradation of pfaa precursors depend on the type of precursors and their chain length benskin et al 2013 lee et al 2014 pfca precursors 6 2 dipap and 8 2 dipap have an estimated half life in soil of around 12 days to 1 000 days whereas the pfos precursor sampap has an estimated half life of more than 380 days in sediments benskin et al 2013 lee et al 2014 while biodegradation is considered one of the primary transformation pathways for precursors the increasing half life for long chain pfaa precursors have been linked to a decreased solubility of the precursors resulting in reduced bioavailability benskin et al 2013 liu and avendano 2013 3 5 pfas mass fluxes and time scales for leaching as previously described the total amount of pfoa pfos estimated in topsoil and subsoil at the bs nrw site was around 390 kg pfoa pfos and a ratio of 6 1 pfos pfoa suggest that initial reservoir masses were about 56 kg pfoa and 334 kg pfos lanuv 2011 mass flux data for the ac filtration plant obtained from the lanuv fig s12 suggests that 95 kg pfoa pfos has been leached from the site as of january 2019 this agrees reasonably well with the adm results which estimated around nine years for 99 removal of pfoa however pfoa is still observed in the μg l range in the ac filtration plant at the bs nrw site indicating that a precursor reservoir for pfoa exists at the site it would take approximately 76 years to remove the remaining 295 kg assuming a constant mass flux of 3 9 kg a pfoa pfos as observed in 2018 thus it will take many decades under current conditions to completely remove pfas from the site as long as precursor reservoirs in the field are unknown leaching time scales are likely to exhibit high uncertainty at the baden site total pfas fluxes could only be determined by estimating discharges into the river rhine möller et al 2010 investigated the pfas distribution pattern along the river rhine from lake constance to the north sea in 2010 their study included sampling stations up and downstream of the polluted area in rastatt baden württemberg between the upstream rheinmünster germany and downstream station karlsruhe an increase in the total pfas mass flux of around 40 kg a could be observed using an average annual discharge at karlsruhe of 1100 m3 s compounds that had increased at the downstream station were c4 c6 and c9 pfcas as described by söhlmann et al 2018 the baden area s contamination occurred between 2000 and 2008 suggesting that mobile pfas such as c4 c6 pfcas could already have leached into the river rhine when möller et al 2010 conducted their study by 2019 pfas that reached the river rhine from the rastatt area included c4 c9 pfcas c4 c6 and c8 pfsas and 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid 6 2 ftsa and the mass flux had increased to 95 kg a pfas rastatt 2019 4 conclusions being the first of its kind in germany the pfas contaminated agricultural land discovered in the state of north rhine westfalia in germany e g bs nrw site was considered exotic in 2006 however it seems that pfas contamination occur much more frequently than initially expected washington et al 2010 rastatt 2016 stahl et al 2018 while the bs nrw site covered a contaminated area of just 10 ha the second case in baden discovered in 2013 revealed a soil and groundwater contamination of an area of about 644 ha for the bs nrw site bench scale column leaching tests compare reasonably well to the 12 year long field collected seepage water data for pfoa and pfos but underpredict the long term tailing observed in the field even short chain pfas concentrations stay at high levels in the field in contrast to a fast decline expected from the column leaching tests this may be due to the transformation of precursor substances into more mobile pfas such as pfoa and pfos precursor transformation is not captured in laboratory flow through tests since time scales are relatively short compared to the field days vs months to assess the remaining pfas reservoir preserved in the form of precursors of a contaminated site a total oxidizable precursor top assay needs to be applied houtz and sedlak 2012 12 years of bs nrw pfas site data suggest a distinct seasonal pattern for short chain pfas suggesting production and accumulation of these compounds during the spring and summer and mobilization during recharge in fall and winter for long chain pfas seasonal concentration changes seem buffered by sorption in the soil the bs nrw site and the baden case showed both showed higher concentrations of long chain pfas in the topsoil but a different distribution pattern of pfas in leaching tests the bs nrw site data suggest that it will take many decades to completely leach pfas from the topsoil prediction of the long term fate of pfas and time scales of potential seepage water and groundwater contamination requires knowledge of the type

1423,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas contaminated compost materials have been applied over the last few decades to agricultural fields in germany resulting in large scale diffuse pfas plumes the leaching behavior of pfas from the first two identified contaminated agricultural sites in germany were investigated one at brilon scharfenberg north rhine westphalia bs nrw and the other at rastatt mannheim baden württemberg the specific objectives of this study were to assess the longevity of the pfas agricultural sources and compare standardized column percolation tests to long term leaching of pfas from contaminated sites the advection dispersion model adm was used to compare the leaching behavior of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos from standardized column percolation tests and long term field leaching data from the bs nrw site column leaching tests conducted with pfos and pfoa contaminated soil simulated the initial rapid decline but did not predict the long term behavior tailing observed at the field site over 12 years trend analyses of the pfas field data from the bs nrw showed that concentrations had stabilized and that individual pfas exhibited distinct seasonal fluctuations the latter is likely due to the ongoing transformation of precursors and a seasonal influence on production rates of mobile pfas mass balances conducted at both sites indicate that complete removal of these compounds will likely take years to decades to occur which is expected from the results of the column leaching tests keywords pfas

wastewater treatment plant x column length 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are anthropogenic contaminants that comprise over 3 000 individual compounds and are likely widespread in the environment oecd 2018 degradable pfas e g n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide ethanol based phosphate diesters disampap are often referred to as precursor substances that are transformed to final transformation products such as perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos benskin et al 2013 these final transformation products are persistent against further breakdown and appear to be widespread within the environment chen et al 2019 falk et al 2019 routti et al 2015 primary sources of pfas in the environment are fire fighting training grounds industrial sites landfills and wastewater treatment plants wwtps itrc 2018 however the historical application of biosolids compost has led to known large scale diffuse contamination of agricultural land and adjacent bodies of water in the states of baden wuerttemberg germany and north rhine westphalia germany and has likely occurred in other regions worldwide delschen et al 2007 rastatt 2016 currently only a few studies have characterized the extent of pfas contamination at agricultural sites and their long term fate in the environment lindstrom et al 2011 washington et al 2010 yoo et al 2010 gellrich et al 2012 stahl et al 2018 söhlmann et al 2018 washington et al 2010 and yoo et al 2010 reported the first pfas contaminated agricultural fields in the united states of america usa in decatur alabama pfas contaminated sludges from a wwtp had previously been applied to an agricultural area of approximately 20 km2 for over a decade leading to the pollution of both surface water and groundwater lindstrom et al 2011 washington et al 2010 soil analyses of the polluted agricultural areas showed levels of precursor substances such as fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs up to 166 μg kg and final transformation products such as c6 c14 perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas and pfos with perfluorodecanoic acid pfda up to 990 μg kg washington et al 2010 yoo et al 2010 they found that long chain pfcas resided predominantly in the topsoil while c6 c8 migrated to deeper soil layers lindstrom et al 2011 investigated surface and groundwater for pfas in the vicinity of the agricultural fields in decatur alabama they detected pfcas from c4 c9 and perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas between c4 c8 showing the mobility of these compounds in soils while c10 c14 pfcas remained in the soil and were not detected in groundwater this observation is consistent with the findings of washington et al 2010 and other studies investigating perfluoroalky acids pfaas mobility in soil bräunig et al 2019 gellrich et al 2012 two of the first known pfas contaminated agricultural sites similar to the one described in washington et al 2010 were discovered in germany in 2006 and 2013 after the application of compost and fertilizers mixed with pfas containing waste materials e g paper sludge during the time of application no regulatory limits for pfas existed in the german fertilizer ordinance gfo which regulates the use of fertilizers soil conditioners culture substrates and plant aids in 2012 the gfo was updated to include a limit of 100 μg kg dry weight pfoa pfos to limit the spread of pfas in the environment dümv 2012 while the use of pfos and pfoa are regulated for fertilizing materials germany still has no binding limits for pfas in drinking water and groundwater in 2017 the german federal environmental agency uba released a list with 13 pfas recommending regulatory limits for seven of these compounds in drinking water table s1 s2 in 2020 the european union eu included pfas into their drinking water directive setting a limit value for the sum of 20 distinct pfas of 0 1 μg l and total pfas of 0 5 μg l eu directive 2184 2020 the contaminated agricultural sites discovered in germany triggered laboratory studies combined with clean up and monitoring programs to reduce pfas loads from contaminated agricultural soils to surface and groundwater the primary objective of this study was to assess the long term behavior of pfas in agricultural soils specific objectives of the study were to 1 evaluate the ability of standardized column percolation tests to predict long term leaching of pfas from contaminated agricultural sites 2 to assess the seasonality of pfas leaching behavior in agricultural soil and 3 quantify the longevity of pfas agricultural sources field leaching pfas data of a 10 ha site in brilon scharfenberg north rhine westphalia bs nrw site monitored over a period of more than 12 years were compared to laboratory column studies conducted after the contamination was detected in 2006 earlier studies showed that data from column leaching tests from various types of material e g contaminated soil demolition waste and waste incineration ash for different compounds e g heavy metals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons compared well to lysimeters and could be fitted reasonably well with the advection dispersion model adm grathwohl and susset 2009 as such soil column and field leaching data were fitted with the adm to understand the short and long term leaching behavior trend analyses were also performed using the seasonal kendall test mann kendall test and exponential decay functions to estimate rate constants data from this site are compared with another case of a 644 ha contamination of agricultural land detected more recently in rastatt mannheim baden württemberg southern germany which will further be referred to as the baden site 2 sites and methods 2 1 brilon scharfenberg north rhine westphalia bs nrw site column tests and field data 2 1 1 site history details of the site history and treatment system were previously reported by delschen et al 2007 but a summary is provided here fig 1 a soil screening campaign of agricultural land in the vicinity of the ruhr river around the city of olsberg north rhine westphalia was conducted by the state office for nature environment and consumer protection lanuv in 2006 looking specifically for the source of pfoa and pfos in the ruhr river lanuv 2011 the lanuv soil campaign results showed that 1 802 ha of farmland were likely contaminated with around 420 kg pfas with the 10 ha bs nrw site being the primary source of pfas leaching into the ruhr river fig 2 pfas detected at the bs nrw site primarily resides in the first 0 6 m of topsoil and the maximum pfas concentration detected within the soil was approximately 6 300 μg pfos pfoa kg which would result in an estimated 390 kg pfos pfoa being applied to 90 000 tons of soil delschen et al 2007 the suspected pfas contamination at the site was the result of the application of pfas containing compost which had been applied at the bs nrw site from 2004 to 2006 lanuv 2011 in early 2007 a drainage system connected to an activated carbon ac filtration plant with a capacity to handle 28 m3 h of contaminated water was installed at the 10 ha bs nrw site to remove pfas from the seepage water before being discharged into the steinbecke and the bermecke which are tributaries of the river möhne hölzer et al 2008 fig 3 in january 2009 the water capacity was increased to 80 m3 h lanuv 2011 the monitoring of pfoa and pfos inflow concentrations of the ac filtration plant began in january 2007 whereas monitoring of perfluorobutanoic acid pfba perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa perfluorononanoic acid pfna pfda perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs and perfluorohexanesulfonic pfhxs started in february 2008 agricultural activity at the bs nrw site ceased in 2007 2 1 2 column leaching tests for pfoa and pfos column leaching tests are used to characterize the release behavior of inorganic and organic target compounds from solid materials din 19528 2009 compared to lysimeters which run in real time column leaching tests are conducted as a time lapse material is packed into a column and percolated with water in the up flow mode under saturated conditions samples are taken at the defined liquid to solid ls ratios the ls ratio is the amount of water that has been in contact with the solid material up flow water saturated column leaching tests were conducted in september 2006 before the installation of the ac filtration plant using previously described methods grathwohl and susset 2009 din 19528 2009 the columns had a diameter of 5 5 cm and a length of 30 cm contaminated topsoil 0 0 0 30 m and subsoil 0 30 0 60 m were obtained from the bs nrw site topsoil pfoa and pfos initial concentrations were 700 μg kg and 6 600 μg kg respectively subsoil pfoa and pfos initial concentrations were 400 μg kg and 1 500 μg kg respectively both contaminated subsoil and topsoil were packed in layers up to a height of 25 cm and covered with a 2 cm thick quartz sand layer at the upper and lower section of the column to ensure that water flows in and evenly across the entire width of the column and to pre filter the eluate the column was flooded from bottom to top within 2 h and the flow rate was adjusted to ensure a contact time of at least 10 h for equilibration control columns were set up and performed in parallel and consisted of only quartz sand leachate

southern germany baden site batch shaking test and soil extraction 2 2 1 site history in 2013 pfaas were detected in a drinking water well near rastatt germany rp karlsruhe 2018 the source of the pfaas was determined to be an upgradient agricultural area 644 ha where pfas contaminated compost was repeatedly applied to topsoils between 2000 and 2008 söhlmann et al 2018 the compost mixture likely consisted of a broad spectrum of pfas used in paper coatings including but not limited to pfaas and precursors e g polyfluorinated dialkylated phosphate ester dipap disampaps bugsel and zwiener 2020 bugsel and zwiener 2020 identified 12 pfas classes in soil samples from the agricultural soils while the majority were dipaps from 4 2 6 2 to 12 2 14 2 and disampaps only c8 c8 the extent of the pfas pollution for each field can vary due to different application rates pfas concentrations in contaminated compost and different mixtures of pfas for further characterization of the groundwater contamination the state of baden württemberg initiated a monitoring campaign analyzing 970 groundwater samples for pfas rastatt 2016 the following pfas were detected during the monitoring at the baden site perfluorododecanoic acid pfdoa perfluoroundecanoic acid pfuna pfba pfpea pfhxa pfhpa pfna pfda pfbs pfhxs pfoa pfos and perfluorooctanesulfonamide fosa these data showed that 98 of pfaas in groundwater were c4 c8 pfcas rastatt 2016 it should be noted that pfas are ultimately discharged into the river rhine 2 2 2 extraction batch shaking tests of top and subsoil samples soil extraction and ls 2 1 batch shaking data sets were obtained from arcadis gmbh to assess the distribution of c4 c14 pfcas and c4 c8 and c10 pfsas in the topsoil and subsoil at the baden site the soil extraction data was obtained in accordance with din 38414 14 whereas ls 2 1 batch shaking studies were conducted in accordance with din 19529 in total over 2 000 different soil samples were analyzed 3 results discussion 3 1 brilon scharfenberg north rhine westphalia bs nrw comparison of column to field data column tests were conducted according to the german standards din 19528 2009 table 1 k d α and c s o were used as fitting parameters for the adm curve fitting was carried out with the matlab tool lsqcurvefit to fit the measured data the application of the adm relies on the local equilibrium assumption which is confirmed by the good fit of the column leaching data to the model fig 5 table 2 with a e 0 97 except for the pfos topsoil column which had a e 0 43 the topsoil initially shows variable pfos concentrations and the model was fitted to average concentrations k d values and arithmetic mean α values fitted in the column tests were used in the adm equation to fit the pfoa and pfos field leaching data with the assumption that the mean annual seepage recharge rate was 600 mm year at the bs nwr site delschen et al 2007 since the pfas concentrations measured in soil samples from the site showed large variability c s o was used as the only fitting parameter for the field models delschen et al 2007 as fig 6 shows the model fits the field data reasonably well but fails to predict the long term tailing observed in the field reasons for that may be manifold e g heterogeneous distribution of pollutants back diffusion from low permeability zone etc but this might also come from the slow but ongoing transformation of precursor substances into the target compounds the model shows that the removal of 90 pfoa takes about five years ls 3 5 and approximately nine years ls 6 5 are needed for the removal of 99 pfoa in terms of pfos ls 10 was not long enough to capture the long term behavior of pfos although the adm is in good agreement with column tests it is a simplistic model that does not account for potential pfas retention processes as described by brusseau 2018 e g accumulation at the air water interface which can additionally increase pfas retention in the vadose zone 3 2 seasonal analysis of field data bs rnw to assess the seasonality of the individual pfas at the site the data were categorized according to the season of the year in which they were measured the monitoring period to construct fig 7 for pfoa and pfos ranged from july 2007 to january 2019 whereas the monitoring period ranged from march 2008 to january 2019 for all other pfas identified at the site the seasonality of the individual pfas detected at the site for the monitoring period were assessed using the kruskal wallis comparison test table s3 the kruskal wallis comparison test confirmed a statistical difference among the seasonal data for all detected pfas except for pfhpa and the long chain compounds pfna and pfos in general concentrations of the short chain pfas were higher in the fall and winter suggesting production and accumulation of these compounds during the spring and summer and mobilization during recharge in fall and winter for long chain pfas seasonal concentration changes might be buffered by sorption in the soil 3 3 assessment of trends at the bs nrw site the individual pfas species data collected from february 2008 to january 2019 at the bs nrw site were considered for analysis although data collection for pfoa and pfos began in january 2007 it was not until february 2008 when additional pfas species were analyzed table 3 shows results for both the seasonal kendall and the mann kendall tests to obtain pfas trends indicating that pfba pfpea pfhxa and pfda are relatively stable whereas pfhpa pfoa pfna pfbs pfhxs and pfos demonstrate a decreasing trend perfluorodecanesulfonic acid pfds was not analyzed since limited data n 6 exists for this compound as monitoring did not begin until july 2017 additionally microsoft excel was used to fit simple exponential decay functions to pfas data to predict k of pfas table 3 fig s1 to s10 which ranged from 0 13 yr 1 to 0 012 yr 1 overall the results of the trend analysis and k calculations suggest that short chain pfas have stabilized most likely caused by the continuous production from unknown precursors at the site long chain pfas seem to decrease possibly reflecting retardation of these compounds initially present in soil compared to short chain pfas 3 4 baden site after the discovery of pfas contamination at the baden site several hundred agricultural fields were sampled at different depths and ls 2 1 batch shaking tests were conducted to determine potential pfas concentrations in the leachate to compare the bs nrw site and the baden site a relative composition profile was created using the mean aqueous phase concentrations derived from the inflow of the ac filtration plant bs nrw site and samples from two different depths from the baden site table s4 contains the values used to determine relative compositions at both sites pfoa and pfos accounted for up 70 and around 44 of the leachate composition at bs nrw site and at the baden site respectively fig 8 at the baden site the composition is more diverse compared to the bs nrw site which could be due to the application of different waste materials and the relatively higher abundance of other precursors as discussed by bugsel and zwiener 2020 the leachate composition between the topsoil and subsoil at the baden site is similar c4 c10 pfcas and pfos dominate the leachate compounds with c11 represent only a minor fraction of pfas found in the seepage water and tend to reside in the topsoil fig s11 this is further supported by groundwater monitoring data from the baden site which showed that 98 of pfas detected were c4 c8 pfcas rastatt 2016 samples for soil extraction and 2 1 batch shaking data were collected between 2014 and 2019 and showed that a major fraction of pfas still resides in topsoils even though the last application of pfas contaminated fertilizer occurred in 2008 short chain pfaas move relatively quickly to deeper soil layers while long chain pfaas will stay in the topsoil due to lower mobility caused by sorption based on the bs nrw column tests bs nrw field leaching data baden site soil extraction data and groundwater monitoring data from the baden site it is expected time scales for the complete leaching of pfas from agricultural soils at both the baden site and bs nrw site will be similar aqueous leachate concentrations of short chain pfcas are higher than for long chain pfcas suggesting that short chain pfcas leach more readily from the soil than long chain pfcas after the application of pfas contaminated material or after short chain pfas have been produced by precursors present within the topsoil additionally these data suggest that long chain pfcas tend to accumulate in topsoils until the degradation of precursors has ceased and transport to groundwater will be retarded compared to short chain pfas the time scales for the degradation of pfaa precursors depend on the type of precursors and their chain length benskin et al 2013 lee et al 2014 pfca precursors 6 2 dipap and 8 2 dipap have an estimated half life in soil of around 12 days to 1 000 days whereas the pfos precursor sampap has an estimated half life of more than 380 days in sediments benskin et al 2013 lee et al 2014 while biodegradation is considered one of the primary transformation pathways for precursors the increasing half life for long chain pfaa precursors have been linked to a decreased solubility of the precursors resulting in reduced bioavailability benskin et al 2013 liu and avendano 2013 3 5 pfas mass fluxes and time scales for leaching as previously described the total amount of pfoa pfos estimated in topsoil and subsoil at the bs nrw site was around 390 kg pfoa pfos and a ratio of 6 1 pfos pfoa suggest that initial reservoir masses were about 56 kg pfoa and 334 kg pfos lanuv 2011 mass flux data for the ac filtration plant obtained from the lanuv fig s12 suggests that 95 kg pfoa pfos has been leached from the site as of january 2019 this agrees reasonably well with the adm results which estimated around nine years for 99 removal of pfoa however pfoa is still observed in the μg l range in the ac filtration plant at the bs nrw site indicating that a precursor reservoir for pfoa exists at the site it would take approximately 76 years to remove the remaining 295 kg assuming a constant mass flux of 3 9 kg a pfoa pfos as observed in 2018 thus it will take many decades under current conditions to completely remove pfas from the site as long as precursor reservoirs in the field are unknown leaching time scales are likely to exhibit high uncertainty at the baden site total pfas fluxes could only be determined by estimating discharges into the river rhine möller et al 2010 investigated the pfas distribution pattern along the river rhine from lake constance to the north sea in 2010 their study included sampling stations up and downstream of the polluted area in rastatt baden württemberg between the upstream rheinmünster germany and downstream station karlsruhe an increase in the total pfas mass flux of around 40 kg a could be observed using an average annual discharge at karlsruhe of 1100 m3 s compounds that had increased at the downstream station were c4 c6 and c9 pfcas as described by söhlmann et al 2018 the baden area s contamination occurred between 2000 and 2008 suggesting that mobile pfas such as c4 c6 pfcas could already have leached into the river rhine when möller et al 2010 conducted their study by 2019 pfas that reached the river rhine from the rastatt area included c4 c9 pfcas c4 c6 and c8 pfsas and 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid 6 2 ftsa and the mass flux had increased to 95 kg a pfas rastatt 2019 4 conclusions being the first of its kind in germany the pfas contaminated agricultural land discovered in the state of north rhine westfalia in germany e g bs nrw site was considered exotic in 2006 however it seems that pfas contamination occur much more frequently than initially expected washington et al 2010 rastatt 2016 stahl et al 2018 while the bs nrw site covered a contaminated area of just 10 ha the second case in baden discovered in 2013 revealed a soil and groundwater contamination of an area of about 644 ha for the bs nrw site bench scale column leaching tests compare reasonably well to the 12 year long field collected seepage water data for pfoa and pfos but underpredict the long term tailing observed in the field even short chain pfas concentrations stay at high levels in the field in contrast to a fast decline expected from the column leaching tests this may be due to the transformation of precursor substances into more mobile pfas such as pfoa and pfos precursor transformation is not captured in laboratory flow through tests since time scales are relatively short compared to the field days vs months to assess the remaining pfas reservoir preserved in the form of precursors of a contaminated site a total oxidizable precursor top assay needs to be applied houtz and sedlak 2012 12 years of bs nrw pfas site data suggest a distinct seasonal pattern for short chain pfas suggesting production and accumulation of these compounds during the spring and summer and mobilization during recharge in fall and winter for long chain pfas seasonal concentration changes seem buffered by sorption in the soil the bs nrw site and the baden case showed both showed higher concentrations of long chain pfas in the topsoil but a different distribution pattern of pfas in leaching tests the bs nrw site data suggest that it will take many decades to completely leach pfas from the topsoil prediction of the long term fate of pfas and time scales of potential seepage water and groundwater contamination requires knowledge of the type

1424,the brazilian semiarid region is subjected to irregular rainfall prolonged droughts and high temperatures hampering the surface water accumulation the water access is restricted to the alluvium in the valleys which are used for cattle and poultry livestock development these activities trigger the excessive use of veterinary antibiotics as a consequence antibiotics reach sediment surfaces and promote deterioration of groundwater quality this work aims to evaluate the sorption potential of sulfadiazine sdz and to understand the dynamics of water transfer and solute transport processes in a typical alluvial deposit of the capibaribe river in the agreste of pernambuco the sedimentological characterization was performed by miall s code defining four lithofacies scm scm b gcm o scm o kinetics and isotherms experiments allowed the analyses of sdz sorption kinetics sorption showed an equilibrium tendency after 40 h and was better described by a second order model while isotherm sorption data were better fitted by the freundlich model according to the particle size distribution curve scm had the highest number of fine particles and organic matter affecting interaction of sdz in sediments consequently sdz sorption was slightly higher in this lithofacies however overall sdz sorption was low thereby offering a real risk of groundwater contamination for further investigation the dynamics of water transfer and solute transport in a heterogeneous alluvial deposit were simulated with the hydrus 2d the structural heterogeneity influenced the spatial distribution of water storage under unsaturated conditions and provided the emergence of preferential flows the solute dynamic follow a similar behavior of the water flow due to the low retention of sdz in the soil considering a condition near to saturation the contrast of hydraulic and transport properties influences simultaneously in the processes of water transfer and solute transport keywords batch kinetics sorption isotherms antibiotics heterogeneity preferential flow 1 introduction water scarcity has historically plagued the populations of the semiarid region of northeastern brazil this region is affected by irregular rainfall prolonged droughts high temperatures and evaporation rates exceeding the precipitation thereby favoring the negative water balance santos et al 2017 silva et al 2017 these characteristics hamper the surface water storage triggering the exploitation of groundwater resources such as alluvial aquifers usman et al 2015 these aquifers are part of the dry bed of intermittent rivers and have high storage capacity being quickly recharged during the short rainy season walker et al 2018 alluvial aquifers constitute one of the main sources of water supply during the driest periods promoting the sustainability of the semiarid region s population coelho et al 2017 brito et al 2018 from an economic point of view the exploitation of alluvial aquifers in the capibaribe basin in pernambuco s semiarid region is fundamental for the development of the region according to braga 2015 this region is responsible for pernambuco s largest poultry production another important economic activity is the cattle raising which corresponds to the state s second largest herd therefore water availability on the aquifer leads to the establishment of several livestock ranches in the capibaribe s dry riverbed the establishment of farming activities results in the release of a range of contaminants on the alluvial surface increasing the aquifer potential contamination risk lapworth et al 2017 tong et al 2017 hu et al 2019 in this context emerging contaminants such as veterinary antibiotics have taken a leading role in the deterioration of groundwater quality sukul et al 2008 doretto and rath 2013 duwig et al 2014 kivits et al 2018 additionally the vulnerability of the underground system to antibiotics contamination also affects aquifer sediments tong et al 2017 van boeckel et al 2015 pointed out that brazil is the third largest veterinary antibiotic consumer in the world accounting for about 9 of the global amount in 2010 among the veterinary antibiotic classes sulfonamides sas especially sulfadiazine sdz yan et al 2013 are widely administered for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections johnson et al 2015 hu et al 2019 these compounds usually are not fully metabolized by animals being 30 to 90 excreted hu et al 2019 once in the environment these substances can be transported through soil and sediments reaching groundwater and generating serious environmental contamination risks thiele bruhn 2003 doretto and rath 2013 tong et al 2017 rath et al 2019 the fate of sas in the environment is directly related to this contaminant ability to sorb to the solid fraction of soils or sediments in this perspective a reliable mobility assessment involves identifying factors that affect the sas sorption rates such as water solubility solid water partition coefficient kd clay minerals and organic matter contents thiele bruhn et al 2004 doretto and rath 2013 xu et al 2015 boy roura et al 2018 pavlovic et al 2018 huang et al 2020 for example high levels of organic matter as well as clay content may significantly increase the sorption tendency of some sas such as sdz thiele bruhn et al 2004 sukul et al 2008 consequently compounds with low sorption capacity have high mobility in the environment and increase the risk of groundwater contamination strong sorption indicates poor mobility reducing the risk of leaching the aquifer phase lin and gan 2011 pavlovic et al 2018 sukul et al 2008 found low sdz sorption levels for natural soils with kd values ranging from 0 1 to 24 3 l kg 1 suggesting a high risk of groundwater contamination due to the high sdz mobility that was shown for soils it is important to understand its transport and fate in sediments furthermore data indicating this contaminant sorption behavior in sediments of the semiarid region of northeastern brazil are scarce efforts to qualitatively conserve these resources are essential to the survival of the local population which has the alluvium as the only source of water supply during critical scarcity periods besides that the consumption of contaminated water resources can generate a series of public health problems the impact of the intermittent fluvial regime on the dynamics of contaminants in dry riverbeds is a topic that has been little explored thus numerical simulation tools provide support for investigations of water transfer processes in alluvial deposits in this way the use of models is essential to establish relevant hydrological scenarios in addition it allows the exploration of saturation regimes and drying processes of the studied environment among the numerical simulation tools hydrus 2d software has been one of the most widely used computational codes in applications involving water transfer in the soil šimůnek et al 2008 this methodology is important for the understanding of factors that interfere in solute transport processes in alluvial deposits with a high heterogeneity in regions of high water vulnerability therefore this work aims to evaluate the mobility of an emerging contaminant sdz and to understand the dynamics of water transfer an solute transport processes in an alluvial deposit typical of the high capibaribe river in pernambuco s agreste this work also assessed the dynamics of sdz sorption by kinetic and isotherms sorption experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in the capibaribe river basin in the portion belonging to the poço da lama ranche 7 56 57 6 s 36 17 57 2 o the site is located on the border of brejo da madre de deus and santa cruz do capibaribe municipalities in pernambuco s agreste region brazil fig 1 the region has an average rainfall of 600 mm year and potential evapotranspiration of 1900 mm year with a semiarid climatic condition and alluvial soil with caatinga native vegetation cover braga 2015 geologically the study area is located over the borborema province with rocky crystalline features and fissural domain hydrogeology cprm 2015 the capibaribe river is a temporary river with a dry riverbed during several months of the year and an alluvial sediment deposit composes its subsoil these geological formations are highly heterogeneous this fact reveals the need to understand the structural organization of the deposit s vadose zone especially for the study of water transfer and contaminant transport processes perônico 2018 performed a detailed description of the underground architecture of the alluvial deposit the investigation to identify the layers that form the dry riverbed of the deposit was carried out within the river s secondary channel therefore a trench was dug parallel to the natural direction of the river with the aid of a backhoe loader the trench was 12 00 m long 5 00 m wide and 2 00 m deep the trench wall was described according to the methodology proposed by miall 1985 miall s 1985 sedimentological code supported by the particle size distribution curve demonstrated the presence of four main lithofacies in the profile 2 m lithofacies 1 scm lithofacies 2 scm b lithofacies 3 gcm o lithofacies 4 scm o litofácies scm is the upper layer of the profile presenting an abundance of roots and an average thickness of 0 40 m the second layer is litofácies scm b which has an average thickness 0 55 m and little presence of roots the third layer is litofácies gcm in which the most abundant material is gravel supported on a sandy matrix and its average thickness is 0 10 m the last layer of the profile 2 00 m is litofácies scm o with a thickness of 0 95 m according to perônico 2018 scm was the lithofacies with a higher abundance of fine particles often fine contents are indicators of the soil s reactive capacity influencing the contaminant sorption in the solid matrix hu et al 2019 the other lithofacies presented coarser materials than scm the gcm o and scm o have open particle size with an abundance of particles with diameter larger than 2 mm besides that gcm o differs from other lithofacies because of the abundance of particles with diameters larger than 4 mm gravel however according to the architectural description gcm o proportion on the trench wall was smaller than the other lithofacies consequently characteristics such as open particle size inclined geometric arrangement of the pocket and high saturated hydraulic conductivity bring out the hypothesize that the gcm o pockets can act forming preferential flows winiarski et al 2013 prédélus et al 2015 slimene et al 2017 2 2 sediments physical chemical properties among the physicochemical properties were

more polar metabolite with a smaller molecular mass sittig et al 2014 in addition this compound is slightly hydrophilic having a low sorption affinity zhang et al 2018 2 4 chemical analysis of sdz sorption kinetics and isotherms experiments were prepared in triplicate to ensure accuracy of the results and following the oecd 106 technical guideline recommendations oecd 2000 in order to peforme the chemical analysis one used a graduated burette pellet to transfer the sdz solution to 50 ml ambar glasses these were sealed with black phenolic screw caps with ptfe faced rubber liner stirring was performed on a shaker table at 24 c and 200 rpm after stirring three parallel samples were taken of each amber glass resulting in three samples for each of the three parallel experiments conducted on each sediment sample 1 ml aliquots of the supernatant were collected with a graduated pipette and centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 10 min then the supernatant was filtered with 0 45 μm sterile membrane filters and the final sdz concentration was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc uv the chromatographic analysis were performed in the soil physics laboratory in the department of nuclear energy of the federal university of pernambuco ufpe a 510 hplc pump and a uv detector cg 437 b were used operating at 265 nm wavelength the volume of 50 μl was injected using a hamilton 700

were determined based on the literature as sukul et al 2008 and doretto and rath 2013 found that approximately 48 h were required to achieve equilibrium sorption kinetics can be mathematically represented by the first order model eq 1 yaneva and koumanova 2006 1 d s t dt k 1 s el s t where the terms sel and st are the sorption capacities in equilibrium and time respectively and k1 h 1 is the first order constant sorption rate after integration applying the boundaries t 0 to t t and st 0 to st st the integrated form of eq 1 is expressed by eq 2 2 log s el s t log s el p k 1 2 303 t where the k1 constant is obtained by linear regression between log se1 st and t the sorption rate for a second order mechanism can be described by eq 3 yaneva and koumanova 2006 3 d s t dt k 2 s e 2 s t 2 where se2 and st are the equilibrium of sorption capacities and time respectively and k2 kg mg 1 h 1 is the second order sorption rate constant after integration and applying the boundaries t 0 to t t and st 0 to st st the integrated form of eq 3 is demonstrated in eq 4 4 1 s e 2 s t 1 s e 2 k 2 t eq 4 can be rearranged into a linear form as shown by eq 5 5 t s t 1 k s 1 s e 2 t com k s k 2 s e 2 2 where the term ks can be considered at the initial sorption rate when st t 0 the intra particle diffusion rate can be defined by eq 6 yaneva and koumanova 2006 6 s t k i t 0 5 where the ki term is the intra particle diffusion constant rate mg kg 1 h 1 the first order kinetic model values were obtained from a linear regression between ln se st and time h on the other hand the second order model was obtained from the plot of t st as a function of sdz sorption time h for the four lithofacies four statistical criteria were used to analyze the data calculated by the first and second order

samples were shaken for 48 h which corresponds to the equilibration time established by sorption kinetics after stirring and filtration of the supernatant it was analyzed by hplc uv sdz concentrations sorbed to sediment were calculated by eq 11 11 s c 0 c e df where s is the amount of sdz sorbed by the sediment mg kg 1 c0 is the initial sdz concentration in the solution that was in contact with the sediment mg l 1 ce is the sdz concentration in the solution after equilibrium was reached mg l 3 and df is the dilution factor considering the sediment solution ratio in this case df 50 5 10 according to alcântara and camargo 2001 the sorption process can be defined as the distribution of a chemical substance between the sediment liquid and solid phases the sorption isotherm of organic pollutants in the sediment can often be considered linear being represented by eq 12 12 s k d c e where s is the sorbed substance fraction mg kg 1 c is the chemical concentration in the liquid phase mg l 1 and kd is the solid water partition coefficient l kg 1 the om is the most abundant sorbent phase in natural sediments and thereby a more global parameter can be used to describe the sediment sorption

freundlich studied sorption on various compounds and thereby described eq 14 14 s k f c e n where kf is the freundlich coefficient representing the sediment sorption capacity and is equal to the linear solid water partition coefficient kd when n 1 or constant representing the linearity degree of the sorption isotherm 2 7 numerical modeling two modeling conditions were applied in order to show the effect of the ambiente seasonality on the water level the first simulated case aims to evaluate the impact of structural heterogeneity lithological and the contrast of hydrodynamic properties in the water transfer processes in unsaturated conditions the second case on the other hand assesses the impact of structural heterogeneity and reactive properties of the ambiente on the processes of solute transport under conditions close to saturation in the first study case unsaturated water flow and transfer was modeled using the hydrus 2d code this code constitutes of finite elements model to simulate water heat and solute movement in a non saturated and saturated medium for the simulation of variably saturated flow the program numerically solves richards equation eq 15 15 θ t x i k ij h x j k iz where θ is the volumetric water content h is the pressure head x i is the spatial coordinates t is time and k ij and k iz are components of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity tensor the soil in each layer was assumed to be isotropic soil water retention curve eq 16 and conductivity curve eq 17 were determined by van genuchten mualen relations van genuchten 1980 16 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1

scm b scm o lithofacies were determined by simple infiltration experiments using the best method lassabatère et al 2006 perônico 2018 for gcm o the conductivity and retention curves were constructed from the particle size distribution by the arya and paris 1981 the obtained curves were adjusted for the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 using retc by perônico 2018 the hydraulic parameters of the lithofacies are presented in table 3 in the hydrus 2 d software was constructed one section with 40 m long and 4 m depth this section was obtained through the application of the ground penetrating radar geophysical technique with a 200 mhz antenna the upper boundary condition for the simulation in sections was of constant flow with a value of 10 cm day 1 for 30 days the lower boundary condition was of free drainage the lateral boundary conditions were of zero flow and the initial condition was 600 cmh2o the section was discretized into finite elements resulting in a mesh containing 12 900 nodes 1643 one dimensional elements and 25 789 two dimensional triangular elements the thickness of the triangle edge and that of the one dimensional elements corresponds to 15 cm for the second study solute transport was modeled considering the convection dispersion equation cde eq 18 this equation assumes that solutes are transported through convection and dispersion in the liquid and may be retained in the soil through sorption onto solid particles bear 1972 18 θc t ρ d s t x i θd ij c x j q i c x i where c stands for the liquid concentrations and s for the sorbed concentrations dij is the dispersion tensor described as well by the longitudinal and transversal dispersion coefficients dl and dt respectively which account for both molecular diffusion and

medium tortuosity and d0 is the solute molecular diffusion coefficient concerning pollutant retention sorption is assumed to be instantaneous kinetically limited mechanisms being the focus of further research the total sorbed concentration s was determined by the isotherm tests for the simulation of the solute transport processes a hypothetical initial condition was assumed considering a constant concentration of 5 mg l 1 throughout the two dimensional section in addition for this particular study case was adopted an upper boundary condition of constant water rate of 0 4167 cm h 1 for 720 h the lower boundary condition was free drainage while the initial condition at the matrix potential was 2 cmh2o the lateral boundary conditions were considered to be zero flow for solutes we considered a third type boundary this kind of boundary condition controls solute concentrations and the quantity of solute that enters or exits the domain by mass balance considerations for initial condition we considered a zero value over the whole numerical domain model solutes were considered with adsorption coefficients of scm kd 0 6277 l kg 1 scm b kd 0 4713 l kg 1 gcm o kd 0 4830 l kg 1 scm o kd 0 4751 l kg 1 the longitudinal dispersivities of the materials were set at 2 cm for gcm o and at 2 mm for the other lithofacies winiarski et al 2013 and transversal dispersivities were fixed at one tenth of longitudinal dispersivities 3 results and discussion 3 1 sediment properties as depicted in table 1 the ph in water ranged from highly alkaline in scm 8 26 to weakly acid in the other lithofacies the ph values in water were higher than in kcl which indicates a predominance of negative charges because the kcl solution induces cation exchange when in contact with the sediments scm has the highest om content 2 17 which is influenced by the natural accumulation of materials such as dry branches plants and animals on the sediment surface organic matter and the soil particle size composition have a direct influence on the sdz sorption in the sediment because natural organic carbon may increase the sorption due to its high affinity with sulfonamide antibiotics thiele bruhn et al 2004 conde cid et al 2019 as shown in table 1 the values of cec s and v were higher for the scm sediment on the other hand they showed a slight deviation for the other lithofacies which indicates a similarity between their chemical properties according to embrapa 2010 and embrapa 2015 cec values smaller than five cmolc dm 3 indicate low clay content or predominance of 1 1 clay while lower values of exchangeable bases suggest that the sediments suffered more weathering the concentrations of the chemical elements have been certified for the reference material srm 2709 san joaquim soil and their respective uncertainties expanded at a 95 confidence level according to table 1 the highest peculiarities of the studied sediments are the high lead pb and strontium sr content this fact may be linked to the presence in the sediments of residues from the textile industry which is one of the most explored economic activities in the region mapanda et al 2005 noted that textile industrial effluents could contribute to metals deposition in the environment the presence of some heavy metals such as copper may increase the sorption capacity of sulfonamides morel et al 2014 xu et al 2015 3 2 sorption kinetics first order and second order kinetic models were used to help to understand the interaction between sdz and the solid sediment matrix the intraparticle diffusion model was tested but it was not suitable to describe the sorption kinetics for the four analyzed lithofacies the results of sdz sorption kinetics experiments for the four lithofacies and the adjustments for the first and second order kinetic models are reported in fig 2 from the analysis of the graphs in fig 2 one can note that it is possible to separate the sorption kinetics into two levels according to rath et al 2019 a rapid sorption occurs in the first interaction hours followed by a slow change between the water and soil phase which requires several hours to reach equilibrium the equilibrium for the four lithofacies was reached after 40 h corresponding to the interaction time reported by similar works among the studied sediments the highest amount of sdz sorbed at equilibrium was 26 33 mg kg 1 for scm several studies evaluated the sdz sorption in different soils and obtained equilibrium after 48 h of interaction doretto and rath 2013 sukul et al 2008 vieira et al 2017 other studies also found slow sorption of sulfonamides with equilibration time varying from 12 to 48 h figueroa diva et al 2010 srinivasan and sarmah 2013 boxall 2018 table 4 shows the results for the first and second order kinetic models and the adjustments of their statistical parameters for the four lithofaces as displayed in table 4 the regression coefficients r2 values ranged from 0 84 to 0 90 for the first order kinetic model and were higher than 0 99 for all sediments when the second order model was applied therefore based on the regression coefficient r2 and sorption capacity at equilibrium the sorption kinetics were better adjusted to the second order model the r2 of the diffusion model application ranged from 0 68 to 0 91 indicating that the diffusion model does not govern the sorption mechanisms therefore globally the sorption rate is controlled by chemical processes according to second order reaction mechanisms this suggests that sorption was mainly governed by the availability of occupied sorption sites on the sediment surface rather than the solute concentration this happens because the second order model considers that sorption capacity is proportional to the number of active sediment sites thus giving better adjustments to the sorption data by the second order model vieira et al 2017 rath et al 2019 3 3 sorption isotherms sorption isotherms allow the determination of the maximum sorption capacity of the studied sediments the nature of the sorption process and the parameters indicating pollutant mobility in the environment vieira et al 2017 doretto et al 2014 hu et al 2019 the experiments in this study were performed without ph variation the experimental data showed a curve corresponding to a linear trend of the sorption thus the isotherms for the four lithofacies were adjusted to the linear and freundlich models in their exponential form as shown in fig 3 the results from fig 3 showed that scm presented higher sorption capacity than the other lithofacies adjustment of the linear model to the sorption isotherm data was performed from the regression between st mg kg 1 and ce mg l 1 which resulted in a linear regression coefficient of 0 996 for scm 0 976 for scm b 0 926 for gcm o and 0 985 for scm o in general it is possible to emphasize that the scm scm b and scm o sediments isotherms were linear and gcm o suggests a nonlinearity in the sorption process the kd and koc values for the sediments of the studied lithofacies ranged from 0 47 to 0 48 l kg 1 and 49 81 to 81 86 l kg 1 respectively as is shown in table 5 the kf and n freundlich exponent values table 5 were obtained by nonlinear regression the sorption isotherms of the experimental data were soundly adjusted by the freundlich model with r2 values ranging from 0 97 to 0 99 and kf values ranged from 0 009 to 0 49 kg 1 mg1 1 nl1 n a linear behavior of the sorption isotherms was observed in the scm scm b and scm o with n values ranging from 1 06 to 1 13 the gcm o sediment sorption isotherm was the only one that presented the freundlich exponent far from the linearity indicating that the sorption sites in this sediment are very heterogeneous causing a nonlinearity of sorption in this lithofacies doretto and rath 2013 thus the kf value for gcm o 0 009 kg 1 mg1 1 nl1 n was lower than the other lithofacies values similar curves have been described by several sdz sorption studies using kd or kf parameters as representative of sorption capacity doretto and rath 2013 pereira leal et al 2013 conde cid et al 2019 hu et al 2019 hu et al 2019 using the linear model obtained for two soil types r2 between 0 985 and 0 998 and kd between 1 54 and 3 41 l kg 1 values similar to doretto and rath 2013 study on a highly sandy soil with kf of 0 45 μg 1 g1 1 n cm3 1 n the present study had findings similar to conde cid et al 2019 with kd values equivalent to kf values in their study on sdz sorption for 50 different soil types and obtained mean values of kd of 1 6 l kg 1 and kf of 2 0 kg 1 μmol1 1 n l1 n for most cases the freundlich exponent n was close to 1 in which this model is transformed on a linear basis conde cid et al 2019 besides kd values are also within the range founded by xu et al 2015 which are in the order of 0 16 l kg 1 and 1 16 l kg 1 for sdz low kd values indicate poor binding to soil surface sorption sites keeping low site occupancy away from saturation boxall et al 2002 ter laak et al 2006 hu et al 2019 scm had the highest kd value indicating that sediment characteristics directly influence sdz sorption this lithofacies presented total organic carbon toc content of 1 26 g kg 1 organic matter content om of 2 17 g kg 1 clay fraction of 7 6 cation exchange capacity cec of 7 4 cmolc dm 3 and specific surface of 3754 m2 g 1 which were higher than the values for the other lithofacies values resulting in a higher sorption capacity these results can be correlated with leal et al 2013 and doretto and rath 2013 analysis on sdz sorption behavior in different brazilian environments they obtained a positive correlation of kd with clay and organic carbon contents and a negative association with the sand content the sulfonamides tendency of being preferentially retained by fine textured soils and sediments was also highlighted by thiele bruhn et al 2004 besides according to wegst uhrich et al 2014 there are different bonding paths between sulfonamides and the solid sediment surface in which hydrophobic interactions with the organic matter are essential moreover hydrogen bridges electrostatic and π π interactions dominate sdz sorption hu et al 2019 the increase or decrease of sas sorption may be related to the ionic speciation of the compound molecule under different ph values where for this study the speciation varied from 91 neutral and 9 anionic ph 5 48 to 30 neutral and 70 anionic ph 6 87 sulfonamides are amphoteric compounds with two ionizable groups a 4 amine aromatic base pka1 and an acidic base pka2 implying that anionic species have lower sorption capacity than neutral species some authors reported that increased negative charge results in electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged contaminants on the soil particles surface hernández ávila et al 2014 according to srinivasan et al 2013 the contribution of neutral molecules to adsorption capacity in soils is higher than that of charged species sdz hu et al 2019 pointed out that when the ph value reaches 8 5 practically all molecules are in their anionic form although the ph of scm was the most alkaline 8 26 kd values were higher in this lithofacies which indicates that the factors that most contributed to sdz sorption were the organic matter and clay content rather than ph the absence of clay minerals and low levels of organic matter may influence weak sorption of sdz in sediments and soils that is because these materials tend to adsorb organic molecules with different binding energies which depends on the sorption mechanisms and the adsorbent adsorbate interaction forces doretto and rath 2013 thiele bruhn et al 2004 vieira et al 2017 rath et al 2019 sukul et al 2008 and conde cid et al 2019 pointed out that organic matter is one of the prevailing variables in sdz sorption therefore the expectation motivated by previous works that there would be a higher sdz sorption capacity in the scm was met in this study the weak interaction between sdz molecules and the sediment surface observed in this study reveals a high leaching potential of this pollutant to groundwater this behavior of sdz and other sulfonamides in soils and sediments was also verified by tong et al 2017 shen et al 2018 conde cid et al 2019 hu et al 2019 only scm presented a higher retention capacity probably due to its clay and organic matter content however even for this layer the kd and kf values are low the other lithofacies are mainly composed of sand of various diameters and gravel supported on a sand matrix the presence of coarse materials in alluvial deposits is common and results from their natural formation process this characteristic leads to a deficient sdz retention capacity in the deepest lithofacies of the profile because the fine particle contents are practically negligible 3 4 numerical modeling modeling the flow allowed a better understand of the influence of the lithofacies material on the heterogeneity of water flow and solute transport fig 4 shows the results for the numerical modeling considering a non saturated condition to evaluate the impact of the structural heterogeneity on the water transfer processes therefore it is displayed the soil moisture charts for the times of 1 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 days for the section of the alluvial deposit the simulation on the section fig 4 allows easy identification that the advance of the wetting front is disturbed by the presence of heterogeneities there is also the occurrence of wetting fronts with discontinuities and greater spatial variability in the soil moisture distribution the gravel pockets gcm o act as a barrier to moisture advance it is also possible to highlight regions of low moisture that appears below the gcm o layer in addition moisture accumulation is observed above the gravel pockets gcm o resulting in the presence of small suspended water tables slimene et al 2017 performing two dimensional modeling pointed out that for a homogeneous scenario the water flow was uniform however the wetting front had unique and complex shapes for five heterogeneous scenarios reflecting the inclusions that water attempts to bypass although gcm o has high hydraulic conductivity at saturation under low humidity conditions the hydraulic conductivity is not sufficient to promote water flow through the layer thus the water content remains low in the gravel due to its lower water retention capacity this result leads to a drastic drop in the gravel s hydraulic conductivity and deviations in its interfaces this fact demonstrates that the contrast of hydraulic properties influences local flows when heterogeneities occur under unsaturated conditions the literature reports this phenomenon as preferential flow more precisely classified as a capillary barrier miyazaki 1988 walter et al 2000 the capillary barrier is a phenomenon that occurs when there is an interface between fine sand and coarse gravel particle size material where the matrix potential in the textural interface is so low that water is trapped in the fine texture without invading the coarser material alfnes et al 2004 walter et al 2000 these results agree with those observed by goutaland et al 2013 coutinho et al 2015 slimene et al 2015 bien et al 2013 and slimene et al 2017 goutaland et al 2013 demonstrated the presence of preferential flows associated with sedimentary heterogeneity they highlighted that the lithofacies s x and gc o were the sources of a capillary barrier leading to the lateral deviation of the best known flow coutinho et al 2015 observed that sand inclusions changed the flow direction by forcing the water to cross paths between sand lenses constituting an effect of capillary barrier one can highlight that the structural heterogeneity of the alluvial deposit can generate impacts on the solute transport processes nevertheless considerations regarding the mobility of contaminates such as sdz can be related to the dynamics demonstrated in the simulations fig 4 one of the reasons for that is the low kd results found in this study which reflects on minimal retention in the soil then from the results exhibited in the water dynamics hypothetically the solute transport should follow a similar behavior as observed in simulations involving alluvial environments in winiarski et al 2013 prédélus et al 2013 bien et al 2013 and slimene et al 2015 these authors have established that structural heterogeneity simultaneously interferes with water transfer and solute transport processes the fact above mentioned is evident in the second simulation case where heterogenic processes are analyzed for the solute transport in conditions approaching saturation fig 5 a and b present respectively the bidimensional sections which reflects the redistribution dynamics of water and solute throughout the profile considering the soil moisture dynamic one can observe a situation approaching saturation with a flow redistribution process in parallel and horizontal lines for the first simulations time 0 120h this reflects a piston effect besides that one can also observe that there are local perturbations in the moisture redistribution in regions near to the gravel pocket regions in general there is a loss of moisture in the moisture chart this is due to the very conductive soils resulting in drainage rate exceeding the wetting process analyzing fig 5 it is possible to observe that on the gravel layer gcmo o there is a solute retention zone and a decrease in concentration in the layers under the gravel this demonstrates the effect of capillary barrier forming a flow diversion and preferential flow not only in the water redistribution process but also in solute transport process capillary barrier effect on unsaturated flows was observed in several studies that investigated flows in heterogeneous alluvial deposits winiarski et al 2013 prédélus et al 2013 bien et al 2013 slimene et al 2015 it is possible to highlight that the capillary barrier has not been completely broken as demonstrated by the heterogeneity in the moisture distribution this happens because the conductivity of the gcm o layer is lower than the flow received the result is a high effect of capillary barrier of the gravel layer and accumulation of water above the gravel in addition there is the occurrence of a lateral flow however other aspects related to the anisotropy of the environment may be investigated more extensively in future works in addition to the implementation of 3d simulation these may contribute to a better understanding of water dynamics in subsurface of alluvial formations 4 conclusions the sdz sorption kinetics was best described by a second order model which indicates slow sorption for the dour lithofacies on the other hand both linear and freundlich models satisfactorily described sorption isotherms the obtained kd and kf values were considered low translating high mobility of this pollutant in the lithofacies of the alluvial deposit profile only the superficial lithofacies showed a higher retention capacity which represents a higher affinity of the sdz with the organic matter and clay contents the results of this study are alarming because the studied alluvial deposit presents in its composition coarse grained materials low organic matter contents and some lithofacies an insignificant clay content therefore these characteristics indicate that the release of veterinary drugs such as sdz on the deposit surface may lead to the leach of these compounds and increase the contamination risk of the alluvial aquifer the structural heterogeneity of the alluvial deposit influences the spatial distribution of water storage under unsaturated conditions the contrast of hydraulic properties provided the emergence of preferential flows at the interface between the sandy structure and the gravel pockets moreover even at conditions near to satutartion the combined contrast of hydraulic and transport properties interferes simultaneously on water transfer and solute transport processes further influences of anisotropy in the ambiente will require additional experimental and numerical actions in future research this will allow a better understanding of the mechanisms that interfere in the dynamics of water transfer and solute transport

1424,the brazilian semiarid region is subjected to irregular rainfall prolonged droughts and high temperatures hampering the surface water accumulation the water access is restricted to the alluvium in the valleys which are used for cattle and poultry livestock development these activities trigger the excessive use of veterinary antibiotics as a consequence antibiotics reach sediment surfaces and promote deterioration of groundwater quality this work aims to evaluate the sorption potential of sulfadiazine sdz and to understand the dynamics of water transfer and solute transport processes in a typical alluvial deposit of the capibaribe river in the agreste of pernambuco the sedimentological characterization was performed by miall s code defining four lithofacies scm scm b gcm o scm o kinetics and isotherms experiments allowed the analyses of sdz sorption kinetics sorption showed an equilibrium tendency after 40 h and was better described by a second order model while isotherm sorption data were better fitted by the freundlich model according to the particle size distribution curve scm had the highest number of fine particles and organic matter affecting interaction of sdz in sediments consequently sdz sorption was slightly higher in this lithofacies however overall sdz sorption was low thereby offering a real risk of groundwater contamination for further investigation the dynamics of water transfer and solute transport in a heterogeneous alluvial deposit were simulated with the hydrus 2d the structural heterogeneity influenced the spatial distribution of water storage under unsaturated conditions and provided the emergence of preferential flows the solute dynamic follow a similar behavior of the water flow due to the low retention of sdz in the soil considering a condition near to saturation the contrast of hydraulic and transport properties influences simultaneously in the processes of water transfer and solute transport keywords batch kinetics sorption isotherms antibiotics heterogeneity preferential flow 1 introduction water scarcity has historically plagued the populations of the semiarid region of northeastern brazil this region is affected by irregular rainfall prolonged droughts high temperatures and evaporation rates exceeding the precipitation thereby favoring the negative water balance santos et al 2017 silva et al 2017 these characteristics hamper the surface water storage triggering the exploitation of groundwater resources such as alluvial aquifers usman et al 2015 these aquifers are part of the dry bed of intermittent rivers and have high storage capacity being quickly recharged during the short rainy season walker et al 2018 alluvial aquifers constitute one of the main sources of water supply during the driest periods promoting the sustainability of the semiarid region s population coelho et al 2017 brito et al 2018 from an economic point of view the exploitation of alluvial aquifers in the capibaribe basin in pernambuco s semiarid region is fundamental for the development of the region according to braga 2015 this region is responsible for pernambuco s largest poultry production another important economic activity is the cattle raising which corresponds to the state s second largest herd therefore water availability on the aquifer leads to the establishment of several livestock ranches in the capibaribe s dry riverbed the establishment of farming activities results in the release of a range of contaminants on the alluvial surface increasing the aquifer potential contamination risk lapworth et al 2017 tong et al 2017 hu et al 2019 in this context emerging contaminants such as veterinary antibiotics have taken a leading role in the deterioration of groundwater quality sukul et al 2008 doretto and rath 2013 duwig et al 2014 kivits et al 2018 additionally the vulnerability of the underground system to antibiotics contamination also affects aquifer sediments tong et al 2017 van boeckel et al 2015 pointed out that brazil is the third largest veterinary antibiotic consumer in the world accounting for about 9 of the global amount in 2010 among the veterinary antibiotic classes sulfonamides sas especially sulfadiazine sdz yan et al 2013 are widely administered for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections johnson et al 2015 hu et al 2019 these compounds usually are not fully metabolized by animals being 30 to 90 excreted hu et al 2019 once in the environment these substances can be transported through soil and sediments reaching groundwater and generating serious environmental contamination risks thiele bruhn 2003 doretto and rath 2013 tong et al 2017 rath et al 2019 the fate of sas in the environment is directly related to this contaminant ability to sorb to the solid fraction of soils or sediments in this perspective a reliable mobility assessment involves identifying factors that affect the sas sorption rates such as water solubility solid water partition coefficient kd clay minerals and organic matter contents thiele bruhn et al 2004 doretto and rath 2013 xu et al 2015 boy roura et al 2018 pavlovic et al 2018 huang et al 2020 for example high levels of organic matter as well as clay content may significantly increase the sorption tendency of some sas such as sdz thiele bruhn et al 2004 sukul et al 2008 consequently compounds with low sorption capacity have high mobility in the environment and increase the risk of groundwater contamination strong sorption indicates poor mobility reducing the risk of leaching the aquifer phase lin and gan 2011 pavlovic et al 2018 sukul et al 2008 found low sdz sorption levels for natural soils with kd values ranging from 0 1 to 24 3 l kg 1 suggesting a high risk of groundwater contamination due to the high sdz mobility that was shown for soils it is important to understand its transport and fate in sediments furthermore data indicating this contaminant sorption behavior in sediments of the semiarid region of northeastern brazil are scarce efforts to qualitatively conserve these resources are essential to the survival of the local population which has the alluvium as the only source of water supply during critical scarcity periods besides that the consumption of contaminated water resources can generate a series of public health problems the impact of the intermittent fluvial regime on the dynamics of contaminants in dry riverbeds is a topic that has been little explored thus numerical simulation tools provide support for investigations of water transfer processes in alluvial deposits in this way the use of models is essential to establish relevant hydrological scenarios in addition it allows the exploration of saturation regimes and drying processes of the studied environment among the numerical simulation tools hydrus 2d software has been one of the most widely used computational codes in applications involving water transfer in the soil šimůnek et al 2008 this methodology is important for the understanding of factors that interfere in solute transport processes in alluvial deposits with a high heterogeneity in regions of high water vulnerability therefore this work aims to evaluate the mobility of an emerging contaminant sdz and to understand the dynamics of water transfer an solute transport processes in an alluvial deposit typical of the high capibaribe river in pernambuco s agreste this work also assessed the dynamics of sdz sorption by kinetic and isotherms sorption experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area

municipalities in pernambuco s agreste region brazil fig 1 the region has an average rainfall of 600 mm year and potential evapotranspiration of 1900 mm year with a semiarid climatic condition and alluvial soil with caatinga native vegetation cover braga 2015 geologically the study area is located over the borborema province with rocky crystalline features and fissural domain hydrogeology cprm 2015 the capibaribe river is a temporary river with a dry riverbed during several months of the year and an alluvial sediment deposit composes its subsoil these geological formations are highly

2018 performed a detailed description of the underground architecture of the alluvial deposit the investigation to identify the layers that form the dry riverbed of the deposit was carried out within the river s secondary channel therefore a trench was dug parallel to the natural direction of the river with the aid of a backhoe loader the trench was 12 00 m long 5 00 m wide and 2 00 m deep the trench wall was described according to the methodology proposed by miall 1985 miall s 1985 sedimentological code supported by the particle size distribution curve demonstrated the presence of four main lithofacies in the profile 2 m lithofacies 1 scm lithofacies 2 scm b lithofacies 3 gcm o lithofacies 4 scm o litofácies scm is the upper layer of the profile presenting an abundance of roots and an average thickness of 0 40 m the second layer is litofácies scm b which has an average thickness 0 55 m and little presence of roots the third layer is litofácies gcm in which the most abundant material is gravel supported on a sandy matrix and its average thickness is 0 10 m the last layer of the profile 2 00 m is litofácies scm o with a thickness of 0 95 m according to perônico 2018 scm was the lithofacies with a higher abundance of fine particles often fine contents are indicators of the soil s reactive capacity influencing the contaminant sorption in the solid matrix hu et al 2019 the other lithofacies presented coarser materials than scm the gcm o and scm o have open particle size with an abundance of particles with diameter larger than 2 mm besides that gcm o differs from other lithofacies because of the abundance of particles with diameters larger than 4 mm gravel however according to the architectural description gcm o proportion on the trench wall was smaller than the other lithofacies consequently characteristics such as open particle size inclined geometric arrangement of the pocket and high saturated hydraulic conductivity bring out the hypothesize that the gcm o pockets can act forming preferential flows winiarski et al 2013 prédélus et al 2015 slimene et al 2017 2 2 sediments physical chemical properties among the physicochemical properties were

sorption kinetics and isotherms experiments were prepared in triplicate to ensure accuracy of the results and following the oecd 106 technical guideline recommendations oecd 2000 in order to peforme the chemical analysis one used a graduated burette pellet to transfer the sdz solution to 50 ml ambar glasses these were sealed with black phenolic screw caps with ptfe faced rubber liner stirring was performed on a shaker table at 24 c and 200 rpm after stirring three parallel samples were taken of each amber glass resulting in three samples for each of the three parallel experiments conducted on each sediment sample 1 ml aliquots of the supernatant were collected with a graduated pipette and centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 10 min then the supernatant was filtered with 0 45 μm sterile membrane filters and the final sdz concentration was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc uv the chromatographic analysis were performed in the soil physics laboratory in the department of

química fina ltda rio de janeiro brazil the sediment solution ratio was 1 10 m v 5 g of sediment for 50 ml of sdz solution subsequent to the stirring process the solutions were extracted from the flasks after time intervals of 0 solutions were manually shaken to ensure the interaction between sediment and solution 1 2 4 6 8 10 12 24 36 48 60 and 72 h and analyzed in the hplc uv stirring times were determined based on the literature as sukul et al 2008 and doretto and rath 2013 found that approximately 48 h were required to achieve equilibrium sorption kinetics can be mathematically represented by the first order model eq 1 yaneva and koumanova 2006 1 d s t dt k 1 s el s t where the terms sel and st are the sorption capacities in equilibrium and time respectively and k1 h 1 is the first order constant sorption rate after integration applying the boundaries t 0 to t t and st 0 to st st the integrated form of eq 1 is expressed by eq 2 2 log s el s t log s el p k 1 2 303 t where the k1 constant is obtained by linear regression between log se1 st and t the sorption rate for a second order mechanism can be described by eq 3 yaneva and koumanova 2006 3 d s t dt k 2 s e 2 s t 2 where se2 and st are the equilibrium of sorption capacities and time respectively and k2 kg mg 1 h 1 is the second order sorption rate constant after integration and applying the boundaries t 0 to t t and st 0 to st st the integrated form of eq 3 is demonstrated in eq 4 4 1 s e 2 s t 1 s e 2 k 2 t eq 4 can be rearranged into a linear form as shown by eq 5 5 t s t 1 k s 1 s e 2 t com k s k 2 s e 2 2 where the term ks can be considered at the initial sorption rate when st t 0 the intra particle diffusion rate can be defined by eq 6 yaneva and koumanova 2006 6 s t k i t 0 5 where the ki term is the intra particle diffusion constant rate mg kg 1 h 1 the first order kinetic model values were obtained from a linear regression between ln se st and time h on the other hand the second order model was obtained from the plot of t st as a function of sdz sorption time h for the four lithofacies four statistical criteria were used to analyze the data calculated by the first and second order kinetic models the mean square error eq 7 the modeling efficiency eq 8 the deviation ratio eq 9 and the residual mass coefficient eq 10 7 mse i 1 n ti mi 2 n 1 2 100 m 8 me i 1 n mi m 2 i 1 n ti mi 2 i 1 n mi m 2 9 dr i 1 n m i m 2 i 1 n t i m 2 10 rmc i 1 n m i i 1 n t i i 1 n m i where ti are the values calculated by the model mi are the experimental values m is the average of the experimental values and n is the determination number the deviation ratio dr describes the dispersion ratio of the values calculated by the theoretical model and it tends to one in the absence of systematic deviations between the theoretical and experimental values the residual mass coefficient rmc tends to zero it indicates whether the model tends to overestimate or underestimate with negative or positive rmc values respectively the mean square error mse indicates the deviation degree between the experimental determinations and the values calculated by the theoretical model its expected value tends to zero the modeling efficiency em indicates whether the theoretical model provides a better estimation of the experimental determinations than the mean value of these determinations and its value tends to one 2 6 sorption isotherms the sediment solution ratio was 1 10 i e 5 g of sediment and 50 ml of a solution containing sdz at concentrations c0 of 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l 1 the 50 ml samples were shaken for 48 h which corresponds to the equilibration time established by sorption kinetics after stirring and filtration of the supernatant it was analyzed by hplc uv sdz concentrations sorbed to sediment were calculated by eq 11 11 s c 0 c e df where s is the amount of sdz sorbed by the sediment mg kg 1 c0 is the initial sdz concentration in the solution that was in contact with the sediment mg l 1 ce is the sdz concentration in the solution after equilibrium was reached mg l 3 and df is the dilution factor considering the sediment solution ratio in this case df 50 5 10 according to alcântara and camargo 2001 the sorption process can be defined as the distribution of a chemical substance between the sediment liquid and solid phases the sorption isotherm of organic pollutants in the sediment can often be considered linear being represented by eq 12 12 s k d c e where s is the sorbed substance fraction mg kg 1 c is the chemical concentration in the liquid phase mg l 1 and kd is the solid water partition coefficient l kg 1 the om is the most abundant sorbent phase in natural sediments and thereby a more global parameter can be used to describe the sediment sorption capacity which is the koc the contaminant partition coefficient in the sediment organic fraction is calculated using eq 13 where oc is the sediment total organic carbon content 13 k oc k d oc freundlich studied sorption on various compounds and thereby described eq 14 14 s k f c e n where kf is the freundlich coefficient representing the sediment sorption capacity and is equal to the linear solid water partition coefficient kd when n 1 or constant representing the linearity degree of the sorption isotherm 2 7 numerical modeling two modeling conditions were applied in order to show the effect of the ambiente seasonality on the water level the first simulated case aims to evaluate the impact of structural heterogeneity lithological and the contrast of hydrodynamic properties in the water transfer processes in unsaturated conditions the second case on the other hand assesses the impact of structural heterogeneity and reactive properties of the ambiente on the processes of solute transport under conditions close to saturation in the first study case unsaturated water flow and transfer was modeled using the hydrus 2d code this code constitutes of finite elements model to simulate water heat and solute movement in a non saturated and saturated medium for the simulation of variably saturated flow the program numerically solves richards equation eq 15 15 θ t x i k ij h x j k iz where θ is the volumetric water content h is the pressure head x i is the spatial coordinates t is time and k ij and k iz are components of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity tensor the soil in each layer was assumed to be isotropic soil water retention curve eq 16 and conductivity curve eq 17 were determined by van genuchten mualen relations van genuchten 1980 16 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1

scm b scm o lithofacies were determined by simple infiltration experiments using the best method lassabatère et al 2006 perônico 2018 for gcm o the conductivity and retention curves were constructed from the particle size distribution by the arya and paris 1981 the obtained curves were adjusted for the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 using retc by perônico 2018 the hydraulic parameters of the lithofacies are presented in table 3 in the hydrus 2 d software was constructed one section with 40 m long and 4 m depth this section was obtained through the application of the ground penetrating radar geophysical technique with a 200 mhz antenna the upper boundary condition for the simulation in sections was of constant flow with a value of 10 cm day 1 for 30 days the lower boundary condition was of free drainage the lateral boundary conditions were of zero flow and the initial condition was 600 cmh2o the section was discretized into finite elements resulting in a mesh containing 12 900 nodes 1643 one dimensional elements and 25 789 two dimensional triangular elements the thickness of the triangle edge and that of the one dimensional elements corresponds to 15 cm for the second study solute transport was modeled considering the convection dispersion equation cde eq 18 this equation assumes that solutes are transported through convection and dispersion in the liquid and may be retained in the soil through sorption onto solid particles bear 1972 18 θc t ρ d s t x i θd ij c x j q i c x i where c stands for the liquid concentrations and s for the sorbed concentrations dij is the dispersion tensor described as well by the longitudinal and transversal dispersion coefficients dl and dt respectively which account for both molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion they are calculated by eqs 19 and 20 respectively 19 d l λ l q θ τd 0 20 d t λ t q θ τd 0 where λl and λt are the medium longitudinal and transversal dispersivities τ is the medium tortuosity and d0 is the solute molecular diffusion coefficient concerning pollutant retention sorption is assumed to be instantaneous kinetically limited mechanisms being the focus of further research the total sorbed concentration s was determined by the isotherm tests for the simulation of the solute transport processes a hypothetical initial condition was assumed considering a constant concentration of 5 mg l 1 throughout the two dimensional section in addition for this particular study case was adopted an upper boundary condition of constant water rate of 0 4167 cm h 1 for 720 h the lower boundary condition was free drainage while the initial condition at the matrix potential was 2 cmh2o the lateral boundary conditions were considered to be zero flow for solutes we considered a third type boundary this kind of boundary condition controls solute concentrations and the quantity of solute that enters or exits the domain by mass balance considerations for initial condition we considered a zero value over the whole numerical domain model solutes were considered with adsorption coefficients of scm kd 0 6277 l kg 1 scm b kd 0 4713 l kg 1 gcm o kd 0 4830 l kg 1 scm o kd 0 4751 l kg 1 the longitudinal dispersivities of the materials were set at 2 cm for gcm o and at 2 mm for the other lithofacies winiarski et al 2013 and transversal dispersivities were fixed at one tenth of longitudinal dispersivities 3 results and discussion 3 1 sediment properties as depicted in table 1 the ph in water ranged from highly alkaline in scm 8 26 to weakly acid in the other lithofacies the ph values in water were higher than in kcl which indicates a predominance of negative charges because the kcl solution induces cation exchange when in contact with the sediments scm has the highest om content 2 17 which is influenced by the natural accumulation of materials such as dry branches plants and animals on the sediment surface organic matter and the soil particle size composition have a direct influence on the sdz sorption in the sediment because natural organic carbon may increase the sorption due to its high affinity with sulfonamide antibiotics thiele bruhn et al 2004 conde cid et al 2019 as shown in table 1 the values of cec s and v were higher for the scm sediment on the other hand they showed a slight deviation for the other lithofacies which indicates a similarity between their chemical properties according to embrapa 2010 and embrapa 2015 cec values smaller than five cmolc dm 3 indicate low clay content or predominance of 1 1 clay while lower values of exchangeable bases suggest that the sediments suffered more weathering the concentrations of the chemical elements have been certified for the reference material srm 2709 san joaquim soil and their respective uncertainties expanded at a 95 confidence level according to table 1 the highest peculiarities of the studied sediments are the high lead pb and strontium sr content this fact may be linked to the presence in the sediments of residues from the textile industry which is one of the most explored economic activities in the region mapanda et al 2005 noted that textile industrial effluents could contribute to metals deposition in the environment the presence of some heavy metals such as copper may increase the sorption capacity of sulfonamides morel et al 2014 xu et al 2015 3 2 sorption kinetics first order and second order kinetic models were used to help to understand the interaction between sdz and the solid sediment matrix the intraparticle diffusion model was tested but it was not suitable to describe the sorption kinetics for the four analyzed lithofacies the results of sdz sorption kinetics experiments for the four lithofacies and the adjustments for the first and second order kinetic models are reported in fig 2 from the analysis of the graphs in fig 2 one can note that it is possible to separate the sorption kinetics into two levels according to rath et al 2019 a rapid sorption occurs in the first interaction hours followed by a slow change between the water and soil phase which requires several hours to reach equilibrium the equilibrium for the four lithofacies was reached after 40 h corresponding to the interaction time reported by similar works among the studied sediments the highest amount of sdz sorbed at equilibrium was 26 33 mg kg 1 for scm several studies evaluated the sdz sorption in different soils and obtained equilibrium after 48 h of interaction doretto and rath 2013 sukul et al 2008 vieira et al 2017 other studies also found slow sorption of sulfonamides with equilibration time varying from 12 to 48 h figueroa diva et al 2010 srinivasan and sarmah 2013 boxall 2018 table 4 shows the results for the first and second order kinetic models and the adjustments of their statistical parameters for the four lithofaces as displayed in table 4 the regression coefficients r2 values ranged from 0 84 to 0 90 for the first order kinetic model and were higher than 0 99 for all sediments when the second order model was applied therefore based on the regression coefficient r2 and sorption capacity at equilibrium the sorption kinetics were better adjusted to the second order model the r2 of the diffusion model application ranged from 0 68 to 0 91 indicating that the diffusion model does not govern the sorption mechanisms therefore globally the sorption rate is controlled by chemical processes according to second order reaction mechanisms this suggests that sorption was mainly governed by the availability of occupied sorption sites on the sediment surface rather than the solute concentration this happens because the second order model considers that sorption capacity is proportional to the number of active sediment sites thus giving better adjustments to the sorption data by the second order model vieira et al 2017 rath et al 2019 3 3 sorption isotherms sorption isotherms allow the determination of the maximum sorption capacity of the studied sediments the nature of the sorption process and the parameters indicating pollutant mobility in the environment vieira et al 2017 doretto et al 2014 hu et al 2019 the experiments in this study were performed without ph variation the experimental data showed a curve corresponding to a linear trend of the sorption thus the isotherms for the four lithofacies were adjusted to the linear and freundlich models in their exponential form as shown in fig 3 the results from fig 3 showed that scm presented higher sorption capacity than the other lithofacies adjustment of the linear model to the sorption isotherm data was performed from the regression between st mg kg 1 and ce mg l 1 which resulted in a linear regression coefficient of 0 996 for scm 0 976 for scm b 0 926 for gcm o and 0 985 for scm o in general it is possible to emphasize that the scm scm b and scm o sediments isotherms were linear and gcm o suggests a nonlinearity in the sorption process the kd and koc values for the sediments of the studied lithofacies ranged from 0 47 to 0 48 l kg 1 and 49 81 to 81 86 l kg 1 respectively as is shown in table 5 the kf and n freundlich exponent values table 5 were obtained by nonlinear regression the sorption isotherms of the experimental data were soundly adjusted by the freundlich model with r2 values ranging from 0 97 to 0 99 and kf values ranged from 0 009 to 0 49 kg 1 mg1 1 nl1 n a linear behavior of the sorption isotherms was observed in the scm scm b and scm o with n values ranging from 1 06 to 1 13 the gcm o sediment sorption isotherm was the only one that presented the freundlich exponent far from the linearity indicating that the sorption sites in this sediment are very heterogeneous causing a nonlinearity of sorption in this lithofacies doretto and rath 2013 thus the kf value for gcm o 0 009 kg 1 mg1 1 nl1 n was lower than the other lithofacies values similar curves have been described by several sdz sorption studies using kd or kf parameters as representative of sorption capacity doretto and rath 2013 pereira leal et al 2013 conde cid et al 2019 hu et al 2019 hu et al 2019 using the linear model obtained for two soil types r2 between 0 985 and 0 998 and kd between 1 54 and 3 41 l kg 1 values similar to doretto and rath 2013 study on a highly sandy soil with kf of 0 45 μg 1 g1 1 n cm3 1 n the present study had findings similar to conde cid et al 2019 with kd values equivalent to kf values in their study on sdz sorption for 50 different soil types and obtained mean values of kd of 1 6 l kg 1 and kf of 2 0 kg 1 μmol1 1 n l1 n for most cases the freundlich exponent n was close to 1 in which this model is transformed on a linear basis conde cid et al 2019 besides kd values are also within the range founded by xu et al 2015 which are in the order of 0 16 l kg 1 and 1 16 l kg 1 for sdz low kd values indicate poor binding to soil surface sorption sites keeping low site occupancy away from saturation boxall et al 2002 ter laak et al 2006 hu et al 2019 scm had the highest kd value indicating that sediment characteristics directly influence sdz sorption this lithofacies presented total organic carbon toc content of 1 26 g kg 1 organic matter content om of 2 17 g kg 1 clay fraction of 7 6 cation exchange capacity cec of 7 4 cmolc dm 3 and specific surface of 3754 m2 g 1 which were higher than the values for the other lithofacies values resulting in a higher sorption capacity these results can be correlated with leal et al 2013 and doretto and rath 2013 analysis on sdz sorption behavior in different brazilian environments they obtained a positive correlation of kd with clay and organic carbon contents and a negative association with the sand content the sulfonamides tendency of being preferentially retained by fine textured soils and sediments was also highlighted by thiele bruhn et al 2004 besides according to wegst uhrich et al 2014 there are different bonding paths between sulfonamides and the solid sediment surface in which hydrophobic interactions with the organic matter are essential moreover hydrogen bridges electrostatic and π π interactions dominate sdz sorption hu et al 2019 the increase or decrease of sas sorption may be related to the ionic speciation of the compound molecule under different ph values where for this study the speciation varied from 91 neutral and 9 anionic ph 5 48 to 30 neutral and 70 anionic ph 6 87 sulfonamides are amphoteric compounds with two ionizable groups a 4 amine aromatic base pka1 and an acidic base pka2 implying that anionic species have lower sorption capacity than neutral species some authors reported that increased negative charge results in electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged contaminants on the soil particles surface hernández ávila et al 2014 according to srinivasan et al 2013 the contribution of neutral molecules to adsorption capacity in soils is higher than that of charged species sdz hu et al 2019 pointed out that when the ph value reaches 8 5 practically all molecules are in their anionic form although the ph of scm was the most alkaline 8 26 kd values were higher in this lithofacies which indicates that the factors that most contributed to sdz sorption were the organic matter and clay content rather than ph the absence of clay minerals and low levels of organic matter may influence weak sorption of sdz in sediments and soils that is because these materials tend to adsorb organic molecules with different binding energies which depends on the sorption mechanisms and the adsorbent adsorbate interaction forces doretto and rath 2013 thiele bruhn et al 2004 vieira et al 2017 rath et al 2019 sukul et al 2008 and conde cid et al 2019 pointed out that organic matter is one of the prevailing variables in sdz sorption therefore the expectation motivated by previous works that there would be a higher sdz sorption capacity in the scm was met in this study the weak interaction between sdz molecules and the sediment surface observed in this study reveals a high leaching potential of this pollutant to groundwater this behavior of sdz and other sulfonamides in soils and sediments was also verified by tong et al 2017 shen et al 2018 conde cid et al 2019 hu et al 2019 only scm presented a higher retention capacity probably due to its clay and organic matter content however even for this layer the kd and kf values are low the other lithofacies are mainly composed of sand of various diameters and gravel supported on a sand matrix the presence of coarse materials in alluvial deposits is common and results from their natural formation process this characteristic leads to a deficient sdz retention capacity in the deepest lithofacies of the profile because the fine particle contents are practically negligible 3 4 numerical modeling modeling the flow allowed a better understand of the influence of the lithofacies material on the heterogeneity of water flow and solute transport fig 4 shows the results for the numerical modeling considering a non saturated condition to evaluate the impact of the structural heterogeneity on the water transfer processes therefore it is displayed the soil moisture charts for the times of 1 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 days for the section of the alluvial deposit the simulation on the section fig 4 allows easy identification that the advance of the wetting front is disturbed by the presence of heterogeneities there is also the occurrence of wetting fronts with discontinuities and greater spatial variability in the soil moisture distribution the gravel pockets gcm o act as a barrier to moisture advance it is also possible to highlight regions of low moisture that appears below the gcm o layer in addition moisture accumulation is observed above the gravel pockets gcm o resulting in the presence of small suspended water tables slimene et al 2017 performing two dimensional modeling pointed out that for a homogeneous scenario the water flow was uniform however the wetting front had unique and complex shapes for five heterogeneous scenarios reflecting the inclusions that water attempts to bypass although gcm o has high hydraulic conductivity at saturation under low humidity conditions the hydraulic conductivity is not sufficient to promote water flow through the layer thus the water content remains low in the gravel due to its lower water retention capacity this result leads to a drastic drop in the gravel s hydraulic conductivity and deviations in its interfaces this fact demonstrates that the contrast of hydraulic properties influences local flows when heterogeneities occur under unsaturated conditions the literature reports this phenomenon as preferential flow more precisely classified as a capillary barrier miyazaki 1988 walter et al 2000 the capillary barrier is a phenomenon that occurs when there is an interface between fine sand and coarse gravel particle size material where the matrix potential in the textural interface is so low that water is trapped in the fine texture without invading the coarser material alfnes et al 2004 walter et al 2000 these results agree with those observed by goutaland et al 2013 coutinho et al 2015 slimene et al 2015 bien et al 2013 and slimene et al 2017 goutaland et al 2013 demonstrated the presence of preferential flows associated with sedimentary heterogeneity they highlighted that the lithofacies s x and gc o were the sources of a capillary barrier leading to the lateral deviation of the best known flow coutinho et al 2015 observed that sand inclusions changed the flow direction by forcing the water to cross paths between sand lenses constituting an effect of capillary barrier one can highlight that the structural heterogeneity of the alluvial deposit can generate impacts on the solute transport processes nevertheless considerations regarding the mobility of contaminates such as sdz can be related to the dynamics demonstrated in the simulations fig 4 one of the reasons for that is the low kd results found in this study which reflects on minimal retention in the soil then from the results exhibited in the water dynamics hypothetically the solute transport should follow a similar behavior as observed in simulations involving alluvial environments in winiarski et al 2013 prédélus et al 2013 bien et al 2013 and slimene et al 2015 these authors have established that structural heterogeneity simultaneously interferes with water transfer and solute transport processes the fact above mentioned is evident in the second simulation case where heterogenic processes are analyzed for the solute transport in conditions approaching saturation fig 5 a and b present respectively the bidimensional sections which reflects the redistribution dynamics of water and solute throughout the profile considering the soil moisture dynamic one can observe a situation approaching saturation with a flow redistribution process in parallel and horizontal lines for the first simulations time 0 120h this reflects a piston effect besides that one can also observe that there are local perturbations in the moisture redistribution in regions near to the gravel pocket regions in general there is a loss of moisture in the moisture chart this is due to the very conductive soils resulting in drainage rate exceeding the wetting process analyzing fig 5 it is possible to observe that on the gravel layer gcmo o there is a solute retention zone and a decrease in concentration in the layers under the gravel this demonstrates the effect of capillary barrier forming a flow diversion and preferential flow not only in the water redistribution process but also in solute transport process capillary barrier effect on unsaturated flows was observed in several studies that investigated flows in heterogeneous alluvial deposits winiarski et al 2013 prédélus et al 2013 bien et al 2013 slimene et al 2015 it is possible to highlight that the capillary barrier has not been completely broken as demonstrated by the heterogeneity in the moisture distribution this happens because the conductivity of the gcm o layer is lower than the flow received the result is a high effect of capillary barrier of the gravel layer and accumulation of water above the gravel in addition there is the occurrence of a lateral flow however other aspects related to the anisotropy of the environment may be investigated more extensively in future works in addition to the implementation of 3d simulation these may contribute to a better understanding of water dynamics in subsurface of alluvial formations 4 conclusions the sdz sorption kinetics was best described by a second order model which indicates slow sorption for the dour lithofacies on the other hand both linear and freundlich models satisfactorily described sorption isotherms the obtained kd and kf values were considered low translating high mobility of this pollutant in the lithofacies of the alluvial deposit profile only the superficial lithofacies showed a higher retention capacity which represents a higher affinity of the sdz with the organic matter and clay contents the results of this study are alarming because the studied alluvial deposit presents in its composition coarse grained materials low organic matter contents and some lithofacies an insignificant clay content therefore these characteristics indicate that the release of veterinary drugs such as sdz on the deposit surface may lead to the leach of these compounds and increase the contamination risk of the alluvial aquifer the structural heterogeneity of the alluvial deposit influences the spatial distribution of water storage under unsaturated conditions the contrast of hydraulic properties provided the emergence of preferential flows at the interface between the sandy structure and the gravel pockets moreover even at conditions near to satutartion the combined contrast of hydraulic and transport properties interferes simultaneously on water transfer and solute transport processes further influences of anisotropy in the ambiente will require additional experimental and numerical actions in future research this will allow a better understanding of the mechanisms that interfere in the dynamics of water transfer and solute transport
