7575,the availability of reliable water supplies is a key factor limiting development in northern australia however characterising groundwater resources in this remote part of australia is challenging due to a lack of existing infrastructure and data here direct push technology dpt was used to characterise shallow alluvial aquifers at two locations in the semiarid flinders river catchment dpt was used to evaluate the saturated thickness of the aquifer and estimate recharge rates by sampling for environmental tracers in groundwater major ions 2h 18o 3h and 14c the alluvium at fifteen mile reserve and glendalough station consisted of a mixture of permeable coarse sandy and gravely sediments and less permeable clays and silts the alluvium was relatively thin i e 20 m and at the time of the investigation was only partially saturated tritium 3h concentrations in groundwater was 1 tritium unit tu corresponding to a mean residence time for groundwater of about 12 years the lack of an evaporation signal for the 2h and 18o of groundwater suggests rapid localised recharge from overbank flood events as the primary recharge mechanism using the chloride mass balance technique cmb and lumped parameter models to interpret patterns in 3h in the aquifer the mean annual recharge rate varied between 21 and 240 mm yr whilst this recharge rate is relatively high for a semiarid climate the alluvium is thin and heterogeneous hosting numerous alluvial aquifers with varied connectivity and limited storage capacity combining dpt and environmental tracers is a cost effective strategy to characterise shallow groundwater resources in unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers in remote data sparse areas keywords groundwater direct push technology environmental tracers alluvium 1 introduction sustainable regional development globally requires understanding the water balance of catchments the location and amount of land suitable for agriculture the viability of different crop and livestock farming systems as well as the potential constraints to individual development scenarios however the remote nature of many locations makes characterising groundwater resources challenging due to a lack of existing infrastructure and data mobilisation costs can be high tens of thousands of dollars and inefficiencies associated with conventional drilling can be expensive and time consuming when conducting preliminary or exploratory investigations where hydrogeological investigations are shallow up to 30 m depth and sediments predominantly unconsolidated direct push technology dpt is a cost effective approach adopted widely internationally butler et al 2007 2002 charette and allen 2006 dietrich et al 2008 schulmeister et al 2003 sellwood et al 2005 vienken et al 2012 but is seldom used in australia for water resource assessments direct push technology fig 1 is the driving hammering pushing and or vibrating of small diameter hollow steel rods with attached tools or probes into the ground these can be used to i collect soil soil gas and groundwater samples ii measure the physical and geochemical properties of the subsurface and iii install temporary or permanent monitoring equipment us epa 2005 this technology is particularly suited for investigations where infrastructure that is wells and piezometers is sparse or lacking where a high spatial density of measurements is required or when leaving permanent instrumentation is logistically or culturally undesirable the aim of this study was to demonstrate the use of dpt to characterise shallow alluvial aquifers in a remote data sparse region the semiarid flinders river catchment the flinders catchment the subject of a recent comprehensive agricultural resource assessment has both the capacity to supply surface water as well as portions of suitable land to support some future irrigated agricultural development petheram et al 2013 groundwater investigations by jolly et al 2013 were part of the recent study by petheram et al 2013 but focused mainly on characterising the nature of groundwater surface water interactions at the regional scale nevertheless the knowledge acquired by jolly et al 2013 as well as from the study s regional airborne geophysical survey munday et al 2013 suggested that alluvial groundwater may also support economic development particularly during extended dry seasons and prolonged periods of drought where ephemeral river flows are absent despite several previous investigations cochrane 1967 jolly et al 2013 laycock 1973 lloyd 1970 qiwsc 1973 whether the flinders alluvium and the alluvial aquifers it hosts is a reliable water supply was unclear as their spatial extent and water balance is yet to be determined the approach with dpt was twofold i to determine the saturated thickness and lithology of the alluvium and ii to collect vertical profiles through the saturated zone of the alluvium for several environmental tracers in groundwater that is compounds dissolved in groundwater giving indications of its mean residence time and origin clark and fritz 1997 cook and herczeg 2000 here vertical profiles for major ions and the stable isotopes of water deuterium 2h and oxygen 18 18o were used to evaluate the origin of the alluvial groundwater and tritium 3h and carbon 14 14c were used to evaluate its mean residence time cook and herczeg 2000 the sources of water to an alluvial aquifer typically include rainfall recharge bank infiltration during low flow periods flood recharge during overbank flow events and regional groundwater discharge lamontagne et al 2005 lamontagne et al 2015 these different sources frequently have characteristic signatures in environmental tracers that can be used to evaluate their relative contribution to aquifer recharge tritium and 14c are two radionuclides with half lives of 12 32 and 5730 years respectively godwin 1962 lucas and unterweger 2000 they are both naturally produced in the upper atmosphere by cosmic rays but were also released in large quantities in the 1950s and 1960s by atmospheric thermonuclear weapon testing fox and parker 1968 in the southern hemisphere the 3h bomb peak has now largely decayed or dispersed so most of the 3h now found in aquifers is from natural sources morgenstern et al 2010 stewart et al 2012 the current 3h activity in southern hemisphere rainfall is approximately 2 tritium units tu tadros et al 2014 the activity of 14c in the atmosphere was 100 percent modern carbon pmc prior to 1890 clark and fritz 1997 it increased to near 200 pmc at the peak of the thermonuclear weapon testing in the late 1960s and is currently 104 pmc hua et al 2013 tritium and 14c can be used to estimate and evaluate the recharge rate to an aquifer cook and böhlke 2000 in the following the information collected by dpt is used to evaluate the recharge rate and the recharge source for the flinders alluvium at two locations also discussed is the potential of the alluvial aquifers for development as a water resource as well as the applicability of dpt sampling to further characterising the flinders alluvium at other locations 2 study area the flinders catchment encompasses a total area of approximately 109 000 km2 in north queensland fig 2 the flinders river is the primary river in the catchment and with an overall length 1004 km is the longest river in queensland petheram et al 2013 the catchment has a hot dry semiarid climate which is highly seasonal including an extended dry season the climate as reported in hughenden hughenden post office has mean annual minimum and maximum temperatures of 16 6 c and 31 6 c respectively mean annual rainfall is 492 mm with the majority of precipitation occurring in december february 1884 2001 bom 2015 mean annual potential evaporation is 2467 mm and mean annual fao56 penman monteith reference evapotranspiration is 1935 mm 1970 2015 dsitia 2015 emphasising a large rainfall deficit and the semiarid nature of the catchment the river is ephemeral with measurable discharge for approximately 7 months of the year 1972 2012 flinders river at glendower the geometric mean annual discharge is 78 gl 1972 2012 flinders river at glendower fig 3 and large events 267 gl yr exceed the mean by one standard deviation occur approximately every seven years dnrm 2015 aquifers of the flinders catchment include the regionally extensive and consolidated mesozoic sedimentary aquifers of the carpentaria basin great artesian basin gab the cainozoic and palaeozoic fractured rock aquifers and shallow unconsolidated alluvial aquifers the main aquifers utilised for water supply in the area include the mesozoic gilbert river formation aquifer and to a lesser extent the alluvial aquifers the gilbert river formation aquifer is a regionally extensive quartzose sandstone that unconformably overlies the basement rock of the etheridge province in the east of the catchment fig 2 the aquifer is unconfined in and near the outcrop zone where it receives recharge via infiltration of intense wet season rainfall and some infiltration of streamflow where steams traverse the outcrop zone west of the outcrop zone the aquifer becomes confined and artesian as it dips steeply in the subsurface horn et al 1995 smerdon and welsh 2012 groundwater flow is generally from east to west based on regional hydraulic head data for the entire carpentaria region of the gab smerdon and welsh 2012 the alluvial aquifers are typically shallow 20 m sequences of sand silt gravel and clay and are entrenched with bed sands associated with the streambed of current and previous rivers and their tributaries fig 2 the alluvial sediments overly and are incised into the lower cretaceous rolling downs group which includes the allaru mudstone toolebuc limestone and the wallumbilla formation very little information currently exists on groundwater flow processes in the alluvial aquifers other than historical baseline water level water quality and lithological information initial hydrogeological work on the shallow alluvial aquifers by cochrane 1967 lloyd 1970 and qiwsc 1973 concluded the mean thickness of the alluvium to be 20 m and the saturated thickness to range from 0 to 6 m water quality was found to be fair with total dissolved salts being generally less than 800 mg l bores yields were as high as 25 l s but highly variable potentially due to distinct channelling of the system further work by laycock 1973 and huxley 1989 was conducted on the alluvial aquifers near cloncurry where the alluvial aquifers had progressively been developed as a town water supply this work concluded that the mean saturated thickness of the alluvium there was 5 m though the survey also inferred that there were significant variations in the groundwater level longitudinally along the valley these were interpreted to be related to the presence of rock bars across the valley and were speculated to act as impermeable barriers to down river groundwater flow hence groundwater in the alluvium may be isolated in distinct basins this work also carried out the only known pump tests on the alluvial aquifers where transmissivities derived from five tests exhibited values ranging between 275 and 2140 m2 day groundwater storage was also derived for aquifers in three different locations with estimated volumes ranging between 570 and 3400 ml 3 study sites at the study sites fifteen mile reserve fmr and glendalough station gs fig 4 a b the flinders river floodplain is 2 5 km wide with a veneer of predominantly cracking clay soils bartley et al 2013 and is vegetated with a wattle open forest acacia cambagei and a pendula cochrane 1967 these two sites were selected for investigation because they are among potential locations considered for future irrigated agriculture had some existing geophysical data cook 2015 munday et al 2013 as well as some historical hydrogeological data available from previous investigations cochrane 1967 dnrm 2016 jolly et al 2013 qiwsc 1973 4 methods 4 1 groundwater and surface water sampling measurements of the depth to bedrock and hydraulic head as well as the collection of a vertical profile of 3 4 groundwater samples in the saturated zone was conducted at five drilling locations spanning from the edge of the floodplain to the edge of the river at fmr and four drilling locations at gs table 1 fig 4a b the drilling equipment consisted of a geoprobe systems 7822dt capable of rotary air drilling hydraulically pushing or hammering of a variety of tools rod strings augers and core barrels into unconsolidated sediments to a maximum depth of approximately 20 m the main instrument used in this study was a protected screen sampler consisting of a rod string that could be pushed in place and its outer casing then lifted to expose an internal groundwater sampling screen geoprobe systems sp16 at each site depth to bedrock was evaluated using a combination of previous lithological surveys and depth to refusal drilling encountered consolidated basement rock during dpt sampling at the maximum depth the rod string was pulled back by 0 5 m and the screen deployed the presence and depth of groundwater in the rod string was then checked with a very slim 1 4 inch water level probe heron instruments inc skinny dipper that could be deployed within the 16 mm diameter rod string if water was present purging began otherwise the external casing was pulled back a further 0 5 m to fully expose the 1 m screen if no water was present the whole rod string was lifted by 1 m intervals until water could enter the screen once a water sample could be collected at a given depth the drill string was removed and the hole backfilled with bentonite chips the next groundwater sample in the vertical profile was then collected by drilling a new hole 1 m next to and 1 2 m shallower than the previous sampling depth the same hole could not be used for collecting a whole vertical profile because the outer casing could not be pushed back onto the screen once deployed in the subsurface therefore the use of vertically nested holes adjacent each other was employed similar to a set of nested piezometers once water entered the screen the hydraulic head in the rod string was recorded and at least three volumes 3 l of the water column were purged from the rod string using an inertia pump tritium 14c major ions 2h and 18o samples were each collected in 1 l plastic bottles major ions 2h and 18o samples were then subsampled and 0 45 μm filtered after suspended sediments were allowed to settle subsamples for the analysis of cations were acidified to ph 2 using nitric acid noble gas chlorofluorocarbons cfc 11 and cfc 12 and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 samples were also collected at several sites however due to the presence of free gas encountered during sampling at most locations these dissolved gas samples were not collected at all depths resulting in limited and possibly unreliable data therefore those results are not presented here further sampling to collect additional information was conducted at gs table 1 fig 4b to evaluate the potential for stratification of tracer concentrations in the aquifer alluvial groundwater samples were collected from one existing adjacent floodplain well b4s4 to compare with an adjacent dpt vertical profile collected at g s2 shallow groundwater samples were also collected from an existing riverbed well g sw approximately 3 km downstream north of the main gs transect as an end member for very shallow groundwater near g sw a measurement of the water table directly below the riverbed was taken from an existing riverbed pit that had been used for sand and gravel extraction finally surface water samples were collected from the flinders river in february 2016 during an ephemeral flow event for a surface water end member this sample was collected at alderley crossing approximately 12 km downstream of the main gs transect 4 2 sample analysis major ion chemistry was measured by the csiro analytical services unit asu waite campus adelaide major and minor cations were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icpoes and major anions were analysed by ion chromatography with a measurement precision of 0 05 mg l for most analytes for simplicity the major ion results are only reported for chloride and total dissolved solids tds here tds the sum of all major anions and cations in the sample deuterium 18o and 3h were analysed by gns science te pü ao new zealand deuterium and 18o were analysed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry deuterium was measured using a gv instruments isoprime coupled with pryoh providing a measurement precision of 1 0 oxygen 18 was measured using a gv instruments coupled with aquaprep providing a measurement precision of 0 1 tritium was measured by electrolytic enrichment and liquid scintillation counting reported with a detection limit of 0 025 tu the most accurate tritium dating lab globally morgenstern and taylor 2009 carbon 14 samples were measured by single stage accelerator mass spectrometry ams at the australian national university anu canberra samples were prepared by first precipitating the dissolved inorganic carbon from 5 l of groundwater as strontium carbonate srco3 under alkaline conditions ph 11 the srco3 precipitate is then acidified and then purified cryogenically into aliquots of carbon dioxide co2 for measurement by ams fallon et al 2010 values were reported with a measurement precision of 0 2 pmc 4 3 evaluation of recharge rates two methods were used to evaluate mean annual recharge rates to the alluvium a chloride mass balance cmb and lumped parameter models lpms for 3h tritium was used in the latter as i it was present at all locations in the aquifer ii is a radioactive tracer therefore derived mean residence times include transport through the vadose zone and iii there is no requirement for the flow system to be in steady state each method has different assumptions for the representation of the hydrogeological system and may not necessarily provide the same recharge rate the cmb method estimates recharge based on the evapoconcentration of rainfall chloride in groundwater and assumes one dimensional vertical groundwater flow the lpms exponential and exponential piston flow models are simplified representations of a groundwater flow system assuming advective flow in a homogenous aquifer cook and böhlke 2000 maloszewski and zuber 1982 1996 zuber 1986 the two approaches to estimate recharge rate are described in further detail below 4 4 chloride mass balance groundwater recharge rates can be estimated by comparing chloride concentrations in rainfall and groundwater eriksson and khunakasem 1969 chloride is a conservative ion which generally does not have any sources aside from precipitation in unconfined aquifers free of halite herczeg et al 2001 the mean annual rate of recharge using the chloride mass balance was estimated using eq 1 1 c p p s c gw r where cp and cgw are the chloride concentrations in precipitation and groundwater mg l p is precipitation mm yr s is surface runoff mm yr and r is the recharge rate mm yr the cmb method is intended for use in the recharge area of catchments i e uplands where rainfall is the only source of water and recharge is predominantly vertical cmb is less useful in discharge areas such as floodplains because the chloride mass balance can be more complex overbank floods bank discharge etc 4 5 lumped parameter models groundwater travels in aquifers along flow paths and increases in residence time with the distance travelled to better constrain recharge rates based on mean residence times two simple lpms were considered the exponential and exponential piston flow models for the exponential model the alluvial aquifer is simplified into a homogenous unconfined aquifer of constant thickness maximum saturated thickness with a uniform recharge rate and an impermeable base with this model groundwater recharges across the streambed and floodplain groundwater flow is initially vertical but as the water gets deeper it is eventually horizontal the mean residence time of the groundwater exponentially increases with depth vogel 1967 using this conceptual model and assumptions vogel 1967 developed the following analytical solution eq 2 for mean residence time t which can be rearranged to derive an average recharge rate r mm yr using the mean residence time of groundwater estimated using the 3h concentration in the aquifer the 3h concentration in rainfall iaea wmo 2016 tadros et al 2014 and the half life of 3h 2 t h ε r ln h h z where h is the aquifer thickness m ε is the porosity and z the depth m in the exponential piston flow model recharge is assumed to only occur through the streambed because of an impermeable clay layer in the floodplain using this conceptual model and assumptions the mean annual recharge rate r mm yr can be derived using the mean residence time of groundwater t estimated as described above and used in the following analytical solution eq 3 3 t h ε r ln h h z x h ε rx where x is the width of the recharge area m and x is the distance from the recharge area m modelled and observed tritium concentrations were compared and the best fit was found by minimising the sum of squared residuals eq 4 4 y y 2 where y is the modelled tritium concentration and ŷ is the observed 5 results 5 1 lithology and water table at fmr depth to refusal consolidated basement rock ranged between 17 and 20 m below ground surface whilst at gs depth to refusal ranged between 12 to 16 m the mean hydraulic head was generally 10 m below the ground surface at fmr and closely reflects the changes in topography at the scale of the floodplain fig 5 table 1 the mean hydraulic head was generally 9 m below the ground surface gs table 1 thus assuming depth to refusal corresponds to depth to bedrock the saturated thickness of the alluvium was 7 10 m at fmr and 3 7 m at gs whilst a mixture of coarse water recovered and fine no water recovered lithology was encountered at all sampling locations more sites yielded water at fmr see dark and grey casings sections on fig 5 where the majority of field sampling took place than at gs fig 4a b in addition there was a distinct shallow part of the aquifer at intermediate distances from the river at fmr but not at gs an attempt was made to drill the alluvium on the northern side of the river at gs but depth to refusal was 9 5 m and the site yielded no water one attempt at coring sediment profiles at fm p3 was only partially successful due to unconsolidated sediments data not shown but the material recovered was consistent with a mixture in lithology from clay and silt to coarse sand and gravel similar to lithological records for a number of nearby disused wells at both sites dnrm 2016 5 2 environmental tracers groundwater tds at fmr varied between 253 mg l at a shallow depth near the river to 2741 mg l at a shallow depth 500 m away from the river deeper in the aquifer groundwater tds varied between 403 mg l near the river to 1225 mg l 1000 m away from the river fig 5a at gs groundwater tds was higher varying between 749 mg l and 4420 mg l fig 7 there was a distinct spatial pattern in the stable isotopes of water at fmr with 2h values highest less negative at shallow depths near the river 25 1 and lowest at depth down to 50 2 in the aquifer fig 5b there was little evidence of an evaporation signal in the stable isotopes of water at both sites fig 6 with most samples falling on the mt isa meteoric water line slope of 7 1 whereas the effect of evaporation can be readily seen in instream water hole samples for the flinders river fig 6 collected in the fgara study by jolly et al 2013 these sit on a slope of 5 the absence of groundwater with a similar evaporation signal to instream water holes suggests riverbed infiltration during low flow periods is not a large component of recharge groundwater 3h concentrations varied between 0 08 and 1 90 tu with most samples 1 tu at both sites tritium concentrations tended to be higher near the water table than at the base of the aquifer at fmr for example from top to bottom of the aquifer 3h was 1 24 1 27 0 97 and 0 73 tu at fm p1 fig 5c indicating a downward component to groundwater flow note that the tritium concentrations from gs in very shallow groundwater g sw and in surface water a sw have been shown in fig 5c for comparison as 3h has a half life of 12 32 years and has a current activity of 2 tu in rainfall most of the groundwater in the alluvium at both sites has a mean residence time 20 years carbon 14 concentrations in groundwater were generally 90 105 percent modern carbon pmc at fmr fig 5d and 100 pmc at gs fig 7 also indicating the presence of groundwater with predominantly short mean residence times two samples at the base of the aquifer at fmr had 14c concentrations in groundwater of 83 and 87 pmc respectively fig 5d potentially suggesting longer mean residence times 200 years however 14c concentrations can be diluted by the input of dead low 14c carbon sources from the production of co2 in the aquifer from older carbon sources by the dissolution of carbonates or by diffusion of pore water with lower 14c from surrounding low permeability formations fontes and garnier 1979 sudicky and frind 1981 as alkalinity is high in the aquifer 200 800 mg l as hco3 dilution by dead 14c is possible corrections for the 14c concentrations in groundwater were not carried out here however correction with the δ13c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic table 2 clark and fritz 1997 would lower the initial 14c activity ao by a few pmc in comparison to measured 14c values this correction would equally apply if the source of inorganic carbon is from carbonate dissolution in the alluvial aquifers or diffusion from surrounding low permeability aquifers in all cases the corrections would yield slightly more contemporary groundwater residence times because most samples were at 100 pmc no further interpretation was attempted because even without correction for dead c the 14c was consistent with a large contemporary groundwater component in the alluvium despite the presence of a potential confining layer at fmr this was absent at gs and there was no evidence of stratification in 3h and 14c at gs 2 fig 7 the concentrations of both 3h and 14c varied little with depth in dpt samples and were similar to well b4s4 suggesting the groundwater is well mixed or was recharged by a single event at that location overall the environmental tracers at fmr and gs indicated the bulk of the groundwater has mean residence times 100 years 5 3 recharge rate 5 3 1 chloride mass balance rearranging eq 1 to solve for the recharge rate yields 5 r c p p s c gw assuming s 0 mm year a chloride deposition rate cpp of 5 6 kg ha yr for the study area davies and crosbie 2014 and using cgw varying between 8 8 and 920 mg l the cmb recharge rate varied between 1 9 and 58 mm yr at fmr and between 0 60 and 64 mm yr at gs with a mean values for both sites of 21 mm yr 5 4 lumped parameter models assuming a maximum saturated thickness of the aquifer h of 16 m and a porosity ε of 20 we can rearrange eq 2 to solve for z 6 z h h e x τ r h ε the best fit recharge rate according to an exponential flow model is 240 mm yr fig 8 a interpretation of the sum of squared residuals suggests limited sensitivity to recharge rates of 190 340 mm yr fig 8c the exponential piston flow model not shown here did not fit the 3h data 6 discussion 6 1 conceptual model the flinders alluvium hosts multiple alluvial aquifers that exhibit localised groundwater flow paths with short mean residence times some aquifers are small and separated by clay layers some are slightly larger palaeochannels or palaeo oxbow lakes they all vary in connectivity and storage based on the long term stream hydrographs and the concentrations of 3h in the aquifer major recharge events occur at decadal scales the relatively depleted 2h 50 2 to 36 2 in the aquifer is also consistent with recharge during larger events as these tend to be isotopically depleted harrington et al 2002 however higher 2h values at sampling sites closer to the river at fmr 26 8 to 25 1 suggest that smaller flow events also contribute some bank recharge locally a water table below the base of the river the lack of an evaporation signal in the 2h and 18o data and higher salinities in shallower groundwater in the floodplain suggest transpiration by phreatophytes is the main groundwater discharge mechanism this is because the export of groundwater downstream in the alluvium is thought to be limited in some places by the presence of numerous bedrock bars present across the river valley laycock 1973 and because transpiration by phreatophytes concentrates salts but does not impart an evaporation signal on the stable isotopes of water walker et al 2001 whilst transpiration by phreatophytes may not be substantial given the overall high potential evapotranspiration in the catchment it could be an important component of the water balance for these aquifers with limited storage thus the flinders alluvium should be considered as a series of small aquifers each potentially having its own recharge rate and water residence time as a function of the physical properties of the floodplain 6 2 aquifer recharge the range in recharge rates estimated here 0 61 240 mm year is within the range estimated for the flinders alluvium 0 10 200 mm year by jolly et al 2013 the long term mean annual recharge rate for the alluvium is probably at the mid to higher end of this range due to the larger localised recharge events from episodic flooding the lowest recharge rates estimated for the alluvium were obtained using the cmb method which was designed to be used in the recharge areas of catchments and may be less suitable for a floodplain environment wood 2011 neglecting the cmb estimates the best fit recharge rate according to an exponential flow model is 240 mm yr the exponential flow model tested here provides a reasonable fit to the observed data with the exception of some of the heavily decayed 3h concentrations near the bottom of the aquifer close to the pre and post bomb 3h peak 1960 1970 some uncertainty is associated with the accuracy of the pre bomb 3h concentrations in precipitation used here which were estimated from data published by tadros et al 2014 due to the poor temporal monitoring of 3h in precipitation australia wide the model sensitivity to a porosity ranging between 0 15 and 0 22 based on literature values for alluvial sediments i e silty gravels silty sandy gravels geotechdata 2013 was negligible as was the sensitivity to variations in the recharge rate ranging between 190 and 340 mm despite the uncertainty the recharge rates are high for a semi arid climate the exponential piston flow model tested did not fit the 3h data regardless of what recharge rate was used this demonstrates that this conceptual model is not representative of the flow system the model predicts high 3h very short mean residence times near the river and low 3h longer mean residence times far from the river which does not agree with the observations fig 8 this indicates that the dominant recharge process operates at the scale of the floodplain and not the scale of the streambed at fmr and gs there is no evidence from sampling environmental tracers in groundwater of inflow from regional aquifers to the alluvium but this process cannot be ruled at present at least two sources of regional groundwater inflow are possible in this environment including aquifers of the underlying carpentaria basin and the adjacent sturgeon basalt the carpentaria basin is separated from the alluvium by the low permeability rolling downs group 60 m thick in well 118219 at gs dnrm 2016 which would tend to restrict discharge this is also supported by inspection of conductivity depth sections for these study sites collected in the recent regional aem survey undertaken by munday et al 2013 based on other regional aquifers in australia groundwater discharge from the carpentaria basin would result in an input of 3h free and low 14c groundwater gardner et al 2011 harrington et al 2014 smerdon et al 2012 the mixing of regional groundwater containing low levels of 3h and 14c with contemporary groundwater may not be evident if the amount of old groundwater in the alluvium is low because of small amounts of diffuse discharge therefore groundwater inflow from the carpentaria basin remains possible the noble gas concentrations in groundwater potentially would have provided additional evidence to have a stronger conclusion on this but the free gas encountered during sampling rendered these samples unviable the presence of free gas in the aquifer could be from oxidation of large amounts of organic material in the subsurface and also possibly excess air entrapped during flood recharge however further investigations would be required to make credible conclusions on this theory the sturgeon basalt is locally present to the north of the flinders river and caps a series of plateaus an aerial electromagnetic aem survey of the area suggests an elevated water table below the basalt and discharge occurring along the perimeter of the plateau munday et al 2013 if groundwater from the basalt aquifer flows into the alluvium this mixing of sources may or may not be evident from chemistry or environmental tracers therefore this groundwater source cannot be excluded if inflows from the basalt did occur it would likely be initially into the alluvium north of the river and potentially as flow through to the alluvium south of the river where this study focussed an attempt was made to investigate this by drilling and sampling the alluvium on the northern side of the river at g s5 but this was unsuccessful the dpt could not penetrate to a depth 9 6 m presumably hitting consolidated basalt groundwater sampling north of the river may reveal higher recharge due to the influence of the basalt plateau but would potentially need to be done using conventional drilling whilst little evidence of regional groundwater inflow from adjacent aquifers was found at fmr and gs groundwater inflow could still contribute to the water balance of the aquifer elsewhere in the alluvial plain 7 conclusion despite relatively high recharge rates for a semi arid environment the alluvial aquifers at fmr and gs are small and vary in connectivity and storage rendering them useful only as a small localised water resource the main limiting factors are the limited storage due to a combination of small size 2 5 km 20 m and partial saturation outside of flood periods secondly larger alluvial aquifers associated with palaeochannels and paleo oxbow lakes that may be spatially better connected could be impacted by the presence of bedrock ridges across the river valley these would effectively decrease the transmissivity of the aquifer resulting in drawdown propagation over smaller areas i e requiring a large number of extraction bores for a given volume extracted relative to an otherwise more extensive aquifer a third factor is the potential risk of secondary salinisation if groundwater salinity outside of the floodplains is higher in this environment because of low recharge rates groundwater extraction in floodplains could induce salinisation by drawing in saline water from the rest of the landscape finally groundwater extraction would tend to compete with phreatophytes for a limited water resource during drought periods which may be a deciding factor for water allocation planning overall based on the two locations investigated the flinders alluvium appears only suitable as a conjunctive water resource for mosaic style irrigated agriculture that is as a component to other water sources this study also demonstrated that dpt is a practical and cost effective technique to characterise shallow alluvial aquifers in a remote environment where infrastructure is limited direct push technology could be further used for mapping and characterising the productive areas of the flinders alluvium at the scale of the river valley in particular it could be used to characterise those parts of the alluvium where there is a coincidence of overlying land suitable for agricultural development and where the aquifer potentially has a larger storage capacity a sequential evaluation strategy could be used where suitable areas are first identified by remote sensing techniques such as airborne electromagnetics munday et al 2013 further constrained using aerial photography cochrane 1967 and finally characterised by dpt a key limitation to applying dpt in the flinders alluvium and elsewhere is its effective depth range 30 m and inability to be used in consolidated geology a further suggested improvement to the dpt capability would be the ability to collect groundwater samples at in situ gas pressures to avoid the risk of degassing during sample collection this is especially important when groundwater is super saturated in dissolved gases due to high decomposition rates in the aquifer or some other process groundwater sampling without degassing would enable sampling for a suite of other environmental tracers including

7575,the availability of reliable water supplies is a key factor limiting development in northern australia however characterising groundwater resources in this remote part of australia is challenging due to a lack of existing infrastructure and data here direct push technology dpt was used to characterise shallow alluvial aquifers at two locations in the semiarid flinders river catchment dpt was used to evaluate the saturated thickness of the aquifer and estimate recharge rates by sampling for environmental tracers in groundwater major ions 2h 18o 3h and 14c the alluvium at fifteen mile reserve and glendalough station consisted of a mixture of permeable coarse sandy and gravely sediments and less permeable clays and silts the alluvium was relatively thin i e 20 m and at the time of the investigation was only partially saturated tritium 3h concentrations in groundwater was 1 tritium unit tu corresponding to a mean residence time for groundwater of about 12 years the lack of an evaporation signal for the 2h and 18o of groundwater suggests rapid localised recharge from overbank flood events as the primary recharge mechanism using the chloride mass balance technique cmb and lumped parameter models to interpret patterns in 3h in the aquifer the mean annual recharge rate varied between 21 and 240 mm yr whilst this recharge rate is relatively high for a semiarid climate the alluvium is thin and heterogeneous hosting numerous alluvial aquifers with varied connectivity and limited storage capacity combining dpt and environmental tracers is a cost effective strategy to characterise shallow groundwater resources in unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers in remote data sparse areas keywords groundwater direct push technology environmental tracers alluvium 1 introduction sustainable regional development globally requires understanding the water balance of catchments the location and amount of land suitable for agriculture the viability of different crop and livestock farming systems as well as the potential constraints to individual development scenarios however the remote nature of many locations makes characterising groundwater resources challenging due to a lack of existing infrastructure and data mobilisation costs can be high tens of thousands of dollars and inefficiencies associated with conventional drilling can be expensive and time consuming when conducting preliminary or exploratory investigations where hydrogeological investigations are shallow up to 30 m depth and sediments predominantly unconsolidated direct push technology dpt is a cost effective approach adopted widely internationally butler et al 2007 2002 charette and allen 2006 dietrich et al 2008 schulmeister et al 2003 sellwood et al 2005 vienken et al 2012 but is seldom used in australia for water resource assessments direct push technology fig 1 is the driving hammering pushing and or vibrating of small diameter hollow steel rods with attached tools or probes into the ground these can be used to i collect soil soil gas and groundwater samples ii measure the physical and geochemical properties of the subsurface and iii install temporary or permanent monitoring equipment us epa 2005 this technology is particularly suited for investigations where infrastructure that is wells and piezometers is sparse or lacking where a high spatial density of measurements is required or when leaving permanent instrumentation is logistically or culturally undesirable the aim of this study was to demonstrate the use of dpt to characterise shallow alluvial aquifers in a remote data sparse region the semiarid flinders river catchment the flinders catchment the subject of a recent comprehensive agricultural resource assessment has both the capacity to supply surface water as well as portions of suitable land to support some future irrigated agricultural development petheram et al 2013 groundwater investigations by jolly et al 2013 were part of the recent study by petheram et al 2013 but focused mainly on characterising the nature of groundwater surface water interactions at the regional scale nevertheless the knowledge acquired by jolly et al 2013 as well as from the study s regional airborne geophysical survey munday et al 2013 suggested that alluvial groundwater may also support economic development particularly during extended dry seasons and prolonged periods of drought where ephemeral river flows are absent despite several previous investigations cochrane 1967 jolly et al 2013 laycock 1973 lloyd 1970 qiwsc 1973 whether the flinders alluvium and the alluvial aquifers it hosts is a reliable water supply was unclear as their spatial extent and water balance is yet to be determined the approach with dpt was twofold i to determine the saturated thickness and lithology of the alluvium and ii to collect vertical profiles through the saturated zone of the alluvium for several environmental tracers in groundwater that is compounds dissolved in groundwater giving indications of its mean residence time and origin clark and fritz 1997 cook and herczeg 2000 here vertical profiles for major ions and the stable isotopes of water deuterium 2h and oxygen 18 18o were used to evaluate the origin of the alluvial groundwater and tritium 3h and carbon 14 14c were used to evaluate its mean residence time cook and herczeg 2000 the sources of water to an alluvial aquifer typically include rainfall recharge bank infiltration during low flow periods flood recharge during overbank flow events and regional groundwater discharge lamontagne et al 2005 lamontagne et al 2015 these different sources frequently have characteristic signatures in environmental tracers that can be used to evaluate their relative contribution to aquifer recharge tritium and 14c are two radionuclides with half lives of 12 32 and 5730 years respectively godwin 1962 lucas and unterweger 2000 they are both naturally produced in the upper atmosphere by cosmic rays but were also released in large quantities in the 1950s and 1960s by atmospheric thermonuclear weapon testing fox and parker 1968 in the southern hemisphere the 3h bomb peak has now largely decayed or dispersed so most of the 3h now found in aquifers is from natural sources morgenstern et al 2010 stewart et al 2012 the current 3h activity in southern hemisphere rainfall is approximately 2 tritium units tu tadros et al 2014 the activity of 14c in the atmosphere was 100 percent modern carbon pmc prior to 1890 clark and fritz 1997 it increased to near 200 pmc at the peak of the thermonuclear weapon testing in the late 1960s and is currently 104 pmc hua et al 2013 tritium and 14c can be used to estimate and evaluate the recharge rate to an aquifer cook and böhlke 2000 in the following the information collected by dpt is used to evaluate the recharge rate and the recharge source for the flinders alluvium at two locations also discussed is the potential of the alluvial aquifers for development as a water resource as well as the applicability of dpt sampling to further characterising the flinders alluvium at other locations 2 study area the flinders catchment encompasses a total area of approximately 109 000 km2 in north queensland fig 2 the flinders river is the primary river in the catchment and with an overall length 1004 km is the longest river in queensland petheram et al 2013 the catchment has a hot dry semiarid climate which is highly seasonal including an extended dry season the climate as reported in hughenden hughenden post office has mean annual minimum and maximum temperatures of 16 6 c and 31 6 c respectively mean annual rainfall is 492 mm with the majority of precipitation occurring in december february 1884 2001 bom 2015 mean annual potential evaporation is 2467 mm and mean annual fao56 penman monteith reference evapotranspiration is 1935 mm 1970 2015 dsitia 2015 emphasising a large rainfall deficit and the semiarid nature of the catchment the river is ephemeral with measurable discharge for approximately 7 months of the year 1972 2012 flinders river at glendower the geometric mean annual discharge is 78 gl 1972 2012 flinders river at glendower fig 3 and large events 267 gl yr exceed the mean by one standard deviation occur approximately every seven years dnrm 2015 aquifers of the flinders catchment include the regionally extensive and consolidated mesozoic sedimentary aquifers of the carpentaria basin great artesian basin gab the cainozoic and palaeozoic fractured rock aquifers and shallow unconsolidated alluvial aquifers the main aquifers utilised for water supply in the area include the mesozoic gilbert river formation aquifer and to a lesser extent the alluvial aquifers the gilbert river formation aquifer is a regionally extensive quartzose sandstone that unconformably overlies the basement rock of the etheridge province in the east of the catchment fig 2 the aquifer is unconfined in and near the outcrop zone where it receives recharge via infiltration of intense wet season rainfall and some infiltration of streamflow where steams traverse the outcrop zone west of the outcrop zone the aquifer becomes confined and artesian as it dips steeply in the subsurface horn et al 1995 smerdon and welsh 2012 groundwater flow is generally from east to west based on regional hydraulic head data for the entire carpentaria region of the gab smerdon and welsh 2012 the alluvial aquifers are typically shallow 20 m sequences of sand silt gravel and clay and are entrenched with bed sands associated with the streambed of current and previous rivers and their tributaries fig 2 the alluvial sediments overly and are incised into the lower cretaceous rolling downs group which includes the allaru mudstone toolebuc limestone and the wallumbilla formation very little information currently exists on groundwater flow processes in the alluvial aquifers other than historical baseline water level water quality and lithological information initial hydrogeological work on the shallow alluvial aquifers by cochrane 1967 lloyd 1970 and qiwsc 1973 concluded the mean thickness of the alluvium to be 20 m and the saturated thickness to range from 0 to 6 m water quality was found to be fair with total dissolved salts being generally less than 800 mg l bores yields were as high as 25 l s but highly variable potentially due to distinct channelling of the system further work by laycock 1973 and huxley 1989 was conducted on the alluvial aquifers near cloncurry where the alluvial aquifers had progressively been developed as a town water supply this work concluded that the mean saturated thickness of the alluvium there was 5 m though the survey also inferred that there were significant variations in the groundwater level longitudinally along the valley these were interpreted to be related to the presence of rock bars across the valley and were speculated to act as impermeable barriers to down river groundwater flow hence groundwater in the alluvium may be isolated in distinct basins this work also carried out the only known pump tests on the alluvial aquifers where transmissivities derived from five tests exhibited values ranging between 275 and 2140 m2 day groundwater storage was also derived for aquifers in three different locations with estimated volumes ranging between 570 and 3400 ml 3 study sites at the study sites fifteen mile reserve fmr and glendalough station gs fig 4 a b the flinders river floodplain is 2 5 km wide with a veneer of predominantly cracking clay soils bartley et al 2013 and is vegetated with a wattle open forest acacia cambagei and a pendula cochrane 1967 these two sites were selected for investigation because they are among potential locations considered for future irrigated agriculture had some existing geophysical data cook 2015 munday et al 2013 as well as some historical hydrogeological data available from previous investigations cochrane 1967 dnrm 2016 jolly et al 2013 qiwsc 1973 4 methods 4 1 groundwater and surface water sampling measurements of the depth to bedrock and hydraulic head as well as the collection of a vertical profile of 3 4 groundwater samples in the saturated zone was conducted at five drilling locations spanning from the edge of the floodplain to the edge of the river at fmr and four drilling locations at gs table 1 fig 4a b the drilling equipment consisted of a geoprobe systems 7822dt capable of rotary air drilling hydraulically pushing or hammering of a variety of tools rod strings augers and core barrels into unconsolidated sediments to a maximum depth of approximately 20 m the main instrument used in this study was a protected screen sampler consisting of a rod string that could be pushed in place and its outer casing then lifted to expose an internal groundwater sampling screen geoprobe systems sp16 at each site depth to bedrock was evaluated using a combination of previous lithological surveys and depth to refusal drilling encountered consolidated basement rock during dpt sampling at the maximum depth the rod string was pulled back by 0 5 m and the screen deployed the presence and depth of groundwater in the rod string was then checked with a very slim 1 4 inch water level probe heron instruments inc skinny dipper that could be deployed within the 16 mm diameter rod string if water was present purging began otherwise the external casing was pulled back a further 0 5 m to fully expose the 1 m screen if no water was present the whole rod string was lifted by 1 m intervals until water could enter the screen once a water sample could be collected at a given depth the drill string was removed and the hole backfilled with bentonite chips the next groundwater sample in the vertical profile was then collected by drilling a new hole 1 m next to and 1 2 m shallower than the previous sampling depth the same hole could not be used for collecting a whole vertical profile because the outer casing could not be pushed back onto the screen once deployed in the subsurface therefore the use of vertically nested holes adjacent each other was employed similar to a set of nested piezometers once water entered the screen the hydraulic head in the rod string was recorded and at least three volumes 3 l of the water column were purged from the rod string using an inertia pump tritium 14c major ions 2h and 18o samples were each collected in 1 l plastic bottles major ions 2h and 18o samples were then subsampled and 0 45 μm filtered after suspended sediments were allowed to settle subsamples for the analysis of cations were acidified to ph 2 using nitric acid noble gas chlorofluorocarbons cfc 11 and cfc 12 and sulfur hexafluoride sf6 samples were also collected at several sites however due to the presence of free gas encountered during sampling at most locations these dissolved gas samples were not collected at all depths resulting in limited and possibly unreliable data therefore those results are not presented here further sampling to collect additional information was conducted at gs table 1 fig 4b to evaluate the potential for stratification of tracer concentrations in the aquifer alluvial groundwater samples were collected from one existing adjacent floodplain well b4s4 to compare with an adjacent dpt vertical profile collected at g s2 shallow groundwater samples were also collected from an existing riverbed well g sw approximately 3 km downstream north of the main gs transect as an end member for very shallow groundwater near g sw a measurement of the water table directly below the riverbed was taken from an existing riverbed pit that had been used for sand and gravel extraction finally surface water samples were collected from the flinders river in february 2016 during an ephemeral flow event for a surface water end member this sample was collected at alderley crossing approximately 12 km downstream of the main gs transect 4 2 sample analysis major ion chemistry was measured by the csiro analytical services unit asu waite campus adelaide major and minor cations were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icpoes and major anions were analysed by ion chromatography with a measurement precision of 0 05 mg l for most analytes for simplicity the major ion results are only reported for chloride and total dissolved solids tds here tds the sum of all major anions and cations in the sample deuterium 18o and 3h were analysed by gns science te pü ao new zealand deuterium and 18o were analysed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry deuterium was measured using a gv instruments isoprime coupled with pryoh providing a measurement precision of 1 0 oxygen 18 was measured using a gv instruments coupled with aquaprep providing a measurement precision of 0 1 tritium was measured by electrolytic enrichment and liquid scintillation counting reported with a detection limit of 0 025 tu the most accurate tritium dating lab globally morgenstern and taylor 2009 carbon 14 samples were measured by single stage accelerator mass spectrometry ams at the australian national university anu canberra samples were prepared by first precipitating the dissolved inorganic carbon from 5 l of groundwater as strontium carbonate srco3 under alkaline conditions ph 11 the srco3 precipitate is then acidified and then purified cryogenically into aliquots of carbon dioxide co2 for measurement by ams fallon et al 2010 values were reported with a measurement precision of 0 2 pmc 4 3 evaluation of recharge rates two methods were used to evaluate mean annual recharge rates to the alluvium a chloride mass balance cmb and lumped parameter models lpms for 3h tritium was used in the latter as i it was present at all locations in the aquifer ii is a radioactive tracer therefore derived mean residence times include transport through the vadose zone and iii there is no requirement for the flow system to be in steady state each method has different assumptions for the representation of the hydrogeological system and may not necessarily provide the same recharge rate the cmb method estimates recharge based on the evapoconcentration of rainfall chloride in groundwater and assumes one dimensional vertical groundwater flow the lpms exponential and exponential piston flow models are simplified representations of a groundwater flow system assuming advective flow in a homogenous aquifer cook and böhlke 2000 maloszewski and zuber 1982 1996 zuber 1986 the two approaches to estimate recharge rate are described in further detail below 4 4 chloride mass balance groundwater recharge rates can be estimated by comparing chloride concentrations in rainfall and groundwater eriksson and khunakasem 1969 chloride is a conservative ion which generally does not have any sources aside from precipitation in unconfined aquifers free of halite herczeg et al 2001 the mean annual rate of recharge using the chloride mass balance was estimated using eq 1 1 c p p s c gw r where cp and cgw are the chloride concentrations in precipitation and groundwater mg l p is precipitation mm yr s is surface runoff mm yr and r is the recharge rate mm yr the cmb method is intended for use in the recharge area of catchments i e uplands where rainfall is the only source of water and recharge is predominantly vertical cmb is less useful in discharge areas such as floodplains because the chloride mass balance can be more complex overbank floods bank discharge etc 4 5 lumped parameter models groundwater travels in aquifers along flow paths and increases in residence time with the distance travelled to better constrain recharge rates based on mean residence times two simple lpms were considered the exponential and exponential piston flow models for the exponential model the alluvial aquifer is simplified into a homogenous unconfined aquifer of constant thickness maximum saturated thickness with a uniform recharge rate and an impermeable base with this model groundwater recharges across the streambed and floodplain groundwater flow is initially vertical but as the water gets deeper it is eventually horizontal the mean residence time of the groundwater exponentially increases with depth vogel 1967 using this conceptual model and assumptions vogel 1967 developed the following analytical solution eq 2 for mean residence time t which can be rearranged to derive an average recharge rate r mm yr using the mean residence time of groundwater estimated using the 3h concentration in the aquifer the 3h concentration in rainfall iaea wmo 2016 tadros et al 2014 and the half life of 3h 2 t h ε r ln h h z where h is the aquifer thickness m ε is the porosity and z the depth m in the exponential piston flow model recharge is assumed to only occur through the streambed because of an impermeable clay layer in the floodplain using this conceptual model and assumptions the mean annual recharge rate r mm yr can be derived using the mean residence time of groundwater t estimated as described above and used in the following analytical solution eq 3 3 t h ε r ln h h z x h ε rx where x is the width of the recharge area m and x is the distance from the recharge area m modelled and observed tritium concentrations were compared and the best fit was found by minimising the sum of squared residuals eq 4 4 y y 2 where y is the modelled tritium concentration and ŷ is the observed 5 results 5 1 lithology and water table at fmr depth to refusal consolidated basement rock ranged between 17 and 20 m below ground surface whilst at gs depth to refusal ranged between 12 to 16 m the mean hydraulic head was generally 10 m below the ground surface at fmr and closely reflects the changes in topography at the scale of the floodplain fig 5 table 1 the mean hydraulic head was generally 9 m below the ground surface gs table 1 thus assuming depth to refusal corresponds to depth to bedrock the saturated thickness of the alluvium was 7 10 m at fmr and 3 7 m at gs whilst a mixture of coarse water recovered and fine no water recovered lithology was encountered at all sampling locations more sites yielded water at fmr see dark and grey casings sections on fig 5 where the majority of field sampling took place than at gs fig 4a b in addition there was a distinct shallow part of the aquifer at intermediate distances from the river at fmr but not at gs an attempt was made to drill the alluvium on the northern side of the river at gs but depth to refusal was 9 5 m and the site yielded no water one attempt at coring sediment profiles at fm p3 was only partially successful due to unconsolidated sediments data not shown but the material recovered was consistent with a mixture in lithology from clay and silt to coarse sand and gravel similar to lithological records for a number of nearby disused wells at both sites dnrm 2016 5 2 environmental tracers groundwater tds at fmr varied between 253 mg l at a shallow depth near the river to 2741 mg l at a shallow depth 500 m away from the river deeper in the aquifer groundwater tds varied between 403 mg l near the river to 1225 mg l 1000 m away from the river fig 5a at gs groundwater tds was higher varying between 749 mg l and 4420 mg l fig 7 there was a distinct spatial pattern in the stable isotopes of water at fmr with 2h values highest less negative at shallow depths near the river 25 1 and lowest at depth down to 50 2 in the aquifer fig 5b there was little evidence of an evaporation signal in the stable isotopes of water at both sites fig 6 with most samples falling on the mt isa meteoric water line slope of 7 1 whereas the effect of evaporation can be readily seen in instream water hole samples for the flinders river fig 6 collected in the fgara study by jolly et al 2013 these sit on a slope of 5 the absence of groundwater with a similar evaporation signal to instream water holes suggests riverbed infiltration during low flow periods is not a large component of recharge groundwater 3h concentrations varied between 0 08 and 1 90 tu with most samples 1 tu at both sites tritium concentrations tended to be higher near the water table than at the base of the aquifer at fmr for example from top to bottom of the aquifer 3h was 1 24 1 27 0 97 and 0 73 tu at fm p1 fig 5c indicating a downward component to groundwater flow note that the tritium concentrations from gs in very shallow groundwater g sw and in surface water a sw have been shown in fig 5c for comparison as 3h has a half life of 12 32 years and has a current activity of 2 tu in rainfall most of the groundwater in the alluvium at both sites has a mean residence time 20 years carbon 14 concentrations in groundwater were generally 90 105 percent modern carbon pmc at fmr fig 5d and 100 pmc at gs fig 7 also indicating the presence of groundwater with predominantly short mean residence times two samples at the base of the aquifer at fmr had 14c concentrations in groundwater of 83 and 87 pmc respectively fig 5d potentially suggesting longer mean residence times 200 years however 14c concentrations can be diluted by the input of dead low 14c carbon sources from the production of co2 in the aquifer from older carbon sources by the dissolution of carbonates or by diffusion of pore water with lower 14c from surrounding low permeability formations fontes and garnier 1979 sudicky and frind 1981 as alkalinity is high in the aquifer 200 800 mg l as hco3 dilution by dead 14c is possible corrections for the 14c concentrations in groundwater were not carried out here however correction with the δ13c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic table 2 clark and fritz 1997 would lower the initial 14c activity ao by a few pmc in comparison to measured 14c values this correction would equally apply if the source of inorganic carbon is from carbonate dissolution in the alluvial aquifers or diffusion from surrounding low permeability aquifers in all cases the corrections would yield slightly more contemporary groundwater residence times because most samples were at 100 pmc no further interpretation was attempted because even without correction for dead c the 14c was consistent with a large contemporary groundwater component in the alluvium despite the presence of a potential confining layer at fmr this was absent at gs and there was no evidence of stratification in 3h and 14c at gs 2 fig 7 the concentrations of both 3h and 14c varied little with depth in dpt samples and were similar to well b4s4 suggesting the groundwater is well mixed or was recharged by a single event at that location overall the environmental tracers at fmr and gs indicated the bulk of the groundwater has mean residence times 100 years 5 3 recharge rate 5 3 1 chloride mass balance rearranging eq 1 to solve for the recharge rate yields 5 r c p p s c gw assuming s 0 mm year a chloride deposition rate cpp of 5 6 kg ha yr for the study area davies and crosbie 2014 and using cgw varying between 8 8 and 920 mg l the cmb recharge rate varied between 1 9 and 58 mm yr at fmr and between 0 60 and 64 mm yr at gs with a mean values for both sites of 21 mm yr 5 4 lumped parameter models assuming a maximum saturated thickness of the aquifer h of 16 m and a porosity ε of 20 we can rearrange eq 2 to solve for z 6 z h h e x τ r h ε the best fit recharge rate according to an exponential flow model is 240 mm yr fig 8 a interpretation of the sum of squared residuals suggests limited sensitivity to recharge rates of 190 340 mm yr fig 8c the exponential piston flow model not shown here did not fit the 3h data 6 discussion 6 1 conceptual model the flinders alluvium hosts multiple alluvial aquifers that exhibit localised groundwater flow paths with short mean residence times some aquifers are small and separated by clay layers some are slightly larger palaeochannels or palaeo oxbow lakes they all vary in connectivity and storage based on the long term stream hydrographs and the concentrations of 3h in the aquifer major recharge events occur at decadal scales the relatively depleted 2h 50 2 to 36 2 in the aquifer is also consistent with recharge during larger events as these tend to be isotopically depleted harrington et al 2002 however higher 2h values at sampling sites closer to the river at fmr 26 8 to 25 1 suggest that smaller flow events also contribute some bank recharge locally a water table below the base of the river the lack of an evaporation signal in the 2h and 18o data and higher salinities in shallower groundwater in the floodplain suggest transpiration by phreatophytes is the main groundwater discharge mechanism this is because the export of groundwater downstream in the alluvium is thought to be limited in some places by the presence of numerous bedrock bars present across the river valley laycock 1973 and because transpiration by phreatophytes concentrates salts but does not impart an evaporation signal on the stable isotopes of water walker et al 2001 whilst transpiration by phreatophytes may not be substantial given the overall high potential evapotranspiration in the catchment it could be an important component of the water balance for these aquifers with limited storage thus the flinders alluvium should be considered as a series of small aquifers each potentially having its own recharge rate and water residence time as a function of the physical properties of the floodplain 6 2 aquifer recharge the range in recharge rates estimated here 0 61 240 mm year is within the range estimated for the flinders alluvium 0 10 200 mm year by jolly et al 2013 the long term mean annual recharge rate for the alluvium is probably at the mid to higher end of this range due to the larger localised recharge events from episodic flooding the lowest recharge rates estimated for the alluvium were obtained using the cmb method which was designed to be used in the recharge areas of catchments and may be less suitable for a floodplain environment wood 2011 neglecting the cmb estimates the best fit recharge rate according to an exponential flow model is 240 mm yr the exponential flow model tested here provides a reasonable fit to the observed data with the exception of some of the heavily decayed 3h concentrations near the bottom of the aquifer close to the pre and post bomb 3h peak 1960 1970 some uncertainty is associated with the accuracy of the pre bomb 3h concentrations in precipitation used here which were estimated from data published by tadros et al 2014 due to the poor temporal monitoring of 3h in precipitation australia wide the model sensitivity to a porosity ranging between 0 15 and 0 22 based on literature values for alluvial sediments i e silty gravels silty sandy gravels geotechdata 2013 was negligible as was the sensitivity to variations in the recharge rate ranging between 190 and 340 mm despite the uncertainty the recharge rates are high for a semi arid climate the exponential piston flow model tested did not fit the 3h data regardless of what recharge rate was used this demonstrates that this conceptual model is not representative of the flow system the model predicts high 3h very short mean residence times near the river and low 3h longer mean residence times far from the river which does not agree with the observations fig 8 this indicates that the dominant recharge process operates at the scale of the floodplain and not the scale of the streambed at fmr and gs there is no evidence from sampling environmental tracers in groundwater of inflow from regional aquifers to the alluvium but this process cannot be ruled at present at least two sources of regional groundwater inflow are possible in this environment including aquifers of the underlying carpentaria basin and the adjacent sturgeon basalt the carpentaria basin is separated from the alluvium by the low permeability rolling downs group 60 m thick in well 118219 at gs dnrm 2016 which would tend to restrict discharge this is also supported by inspection of conductivity depth sections for these study sites collected in the recent regional aem survey undertaken by munday et al 2013 based on other regional aquifers in australia groundwater discharge from the carpentaria basin would result in an input of 3h free and low 14c groundwater gardner et al 2011 harrington et al 2014 smerdon et al 2012 the mixing of regional groundwater containing low levels of 3h and 14c with contemporary groundwater may not be evident if the amount of old groundwater in the alluvium is low because of small amounts of diffuse discharge therefore groundwater inflow from the carpentaria basin remains possible the noble gas concentrations in groundwater potentially would have provided additional evidence to have a stronger conclusion on this but the free gas encountered during sampling rendered these samples unviable the presence of free gas in the aquifer could be from oxidation of large amounts of organic material in the subsurface and also possibly excess air entrapped during flood recharge however further investigations would be required to make credible conclusions on this theory the sturgeon basalt is locally present to the north of the flinders river and caps a series of plateaus an aerial electromagnetic aem survey of the area suggests an elevated water table below the basalt and discharge occurring along the perimeter of the plateau munday et al 2013 if groundwater from the basalt aquifer flows into the alluvium this mixing of sources may or may not be evident from chemistry or environmental tracers therefore this groundwater source cannot be excluded if inflows from the basalt did occur it would likely be initially into the alluvium north of the river and potentially as flow through to the alluvium south of the river where this study focussed an attempt was made to investigate this by drilling and sampling the alluvium on the northern side of the river at g s5 but this was unsuccessful the dpt could not penetrate to a depth 9 6 m presumably hitting consolidated basalt groundwater sampling north of the river may reveal higher recharge due to the influence of the basalt plateau but would potentially need to be done using conventional drilling whilst little evidence of regional groundwater inflow from adjacent aquifers was found at fmr and gs groundwater inflow could still contribute to the water balance of the aquifer elsewhere in the alluvial plain 7 conclusion despite relatively high recharge rates for a semi arid environment the alluvial aquifers at fmr and gs are small and vary in connectivity and storage rendering them useful only as a small localised water resource the main limiting factors are the limited storage due to a combination of small size 2 5 km 20 m and partial saturation outside of flood periods secondly larger alluvial aquifers associated with palaeochannels and paleo oxbow lakes that may be spatially better connected could be impacted by the presence of bedrock ridges across the river valley these would effectively decrease the transmissivity of the aquifer resulting in drawdown propagation over smaller areas i e requiring a large number of extraction bores for a given volume extracted relative to an otherwise more extensive aquifer a third factor is the potential risk of secondary salinisation if groundwater salinity outside of the floodplains is higher in this environment because of low recharge rates groundwater extraction in floodplains could induce salinisation by drawing in saline water from the rest of the landscape finally groundwater extraction would tend to compete with phreatophytes for a limited water resource during drought periods which may be a deciding factor for water allocation planning overall based on the two locations investigated the flinders alluvium appears only suitable as a conjunctive water resource for mosaic style irrigated agriculture that is as a component to other water sources this study also demonstrated that dpt is a practical and cost effective technique to characterise shallow alluvial aquifers in a remote environment where infrastructure is limited direct push technology could be further used for mapping and characterising the productive areas of the flinders alluvium at the scale of the river valley in particular it could be used to characterise those parts of the alluvium where there is a coincidence of overlying land suitable for agricultural development and where the aquifer potentially has a larger storage capacity a sequential evaluation strategy could be used where suitable areas are first identified by remote sensing techniques such as airborne electromagnetics munday et al 2013 further constrained using aerial photography cochrane 1967 and finally characterised by dpt a key limitation to applying dpt in the flinders alluvium and elsewhere is its effective depth range 30 m and inability to be used in consolidated geology a further suggested improvement to the dpt capability would be the ability to collect groundwater samples at in situ gas pressures to avoid the risk of degassing during sample collection this is especially important when groundwater is super saturated in dissolved gases due to high decomposition rates in the aquifer or some other process groundwater sampling without degassing would enable sampling for a suite of other environmental tracers including

7576,diffuse nitrate losses from agricultural land pollute groundwater resources worldwide but can be attenuated under reducing subsurface conditions in new zealand the ability to predict where groundwater denitrification occurs is important for understanding the linkage between land use and discharges of nitrate bearing groundwater to streams this study assesses the application of linear discriminant analysis lda for predicting groundwater redox status for southland a major dairy farming region in new zealand data cases were developed by assigning a redox status to samples derived from a regional groundwater quality database pre existing regional scale geospatial databases were used as training variables for the discriminant functions the predictive accuracy of the discriminant functions was slightly improved by optimising the thresholds between sample depth classes the models predict 23 of the region as being reducing at shallow depths 15 m and 37 at medium depths 15 75 m predictions were made at a sub regional level to determine whether improvements could be made with discriminant functions trained by local data the results indicated that any gains in predictive success were offset by loss of confidence in the predictions due to the reduction in the number of samples used the regional scale model predictions indicate that subsurface reducing conditions predominate at low elevations on the coastal plains where poorly drained soils are widespread additional indicators for subsurface denitrification are a high carbon content of the soil a shallow water table and low permeability clastic sediments the coastal plains are an area of widespread groundwater discharge and the soil and hydrology characteristics require the land to be artificially drained to render the land suitable for farming for the improvement of water quality in coastal areas it is therefore important that land and water management efforts focus on understanding hydrological bypassing that may occur via artificial drainage systems abbreviations lda linear discriminant analysis do dissolved oxygen keywords nitrate redox status statistical modelling new zealand 1 introduction nitrate is a key groundwater contaminant in new zealand mfe 2017 and many other parts of the world spalding and exner 1993 in new zealand increasing land use intensity particularly in the dairy sector has led to increasing levels of nitrate in groundwater systems and impacts on receiving surface waters such as streams rivers and lakes pce 2013 mfe 2017 these concerns have led to the establishment of a land and water forum land and water forum 2010 2012 reforms in freshwater management including a national policy statement for freshwater management and a legislative framework that will require the setting of limits in fresh water for contaminants including nitrate mfe 2014 in the context of meeting limits for environmental protection a key natural attenuation process for nitrate is denitrification the ability to predict the distribution of reducing conditions in the subsurface is essential for predicting the fate of nitrate along groundwater flow paths previous approaches for estimating the subsurface distribution of denitrification at the regional scale can be broadly divided into vulnerability mapping and statistical prediction methods the vulnerability mapping approach involves the analysis and integration of geochemical geological and hydrological datasets hansen and thorling 2008 hojberg et al 2017 and can incorporate geophysical survey data refsgaard et al 2014 vulnerability mapping relies on the availability of large datasets with good spatial coverage across the region being studied to predict the presence of reducing conditions in areas where there is lesser data availability and determine the key controlling variables statistical models are used nolan et al 2002 gurdak and qi 2012 tesoriero et al 2015 close et al 2016 rosecrans et al 2017 however both the vulnerability and statistical approaches are premised on understanding the relationship between the redox status of groundwater samples and local environmental variables such as geology or soil drainage for denitrification to occur four environmental conditions need to be present anoxic or low oxygen conditions the presence of a suitable electron donor sufficient nitrate to act as an electron acceptor and denitrifying microbes to mediate the reduction reaction korom 1992 böhlke 2002 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 rivett et al 2008 the most important electron donor minerals in groundwater systems are organic carbon pyrite and the ferrous iron associated with iron oxides pedersen et al 1991 korom 1992 rodvang and simpkins 2001 appelo and postma 2005 microbes capable of denitrification are considered to be ubiquitous in the environment as a result the first two conditions are coupled in the presence of suitable electron donors such as carbon since the microbes are usually able to reduce oxygen levels so that nitrate is the next electron acceptor and denitrification is able to take place thus the redox status of groundwater provides a good indicator of where denitrification can occur gurdak and qi 2012 this information on redox status can be combined with information on groundwater flow paths and nitrate concentrations to assess if denitrification is likely to occur in a particular groundwater zone due to difficulties in sampling in the subsurface there is considerable uncertainty as to the spatial and temporal distribution of reducing zones and even more uncertainty on how much denitrification is occurring knowledge of where denitrification can potentially occur in groundwater systems would assist water resource managers with assessment of where reductions in nitrate loads may occur within the subsurface prior to the fluxes reaching receiving waters observations of subsurface redox conditions in new zealand are limited to the availability of groundwater samples from wells which can be characterised with respect to redox state a method to extrapolate these groundwater data to the remainder of the region was proposed and applied by close et al 2016 the method used was linear discriminant analysis lda a multivariate statistical method used to distinguish between two or more groups lda involves the formation of a model from linear combinations of discriminating variables representing physical characteristics for which the groups redox classes are expected to differ the resulting model is then applied by extrapolation to the remainder of the region the method presented by close et al 2016 included a number of predictive parameters for elevation slope drainage class carbon content soil order geology geological age and land use potential limitations of the approach were the exclusion of hydrological indicators of redox status and the use of somewhat arbitrary depth thresholds close et al 2016 also suggested that further work be carried out to test the appropriate scale for application of the lda method this paper refines the work of close et al 2016 by investigating some key aspects of the methodology and its application additional parameters have been included to represent depth to water table and hydraulic conductivity as measures of waterlogging and groundwater flow potential respectively the discriminating potential of land surface recharge estimates has also been tested within a subset of the region for which recharge data were available this paper also assesses the depth for which the model predictions can be considered to be valid and optimises the representative depth ranges to overcome the use of subjective depth thresholds finally the effect that scale has on the predictive success of the model is tested to determine the number of samples required to have confidence in the model predictions 2 methodology 2 1 study area redox assignment was carried out for existing groundwater monitoring data from the 29 800 km2 southland region of the south island of new zealand fig 1 sample data were supplied by the regional water management authority environment southland the population of southland is mostly settled on pastoral farms or rural communities many of which rely on groundwater for a drinking water supply a recent increase in dairy farming ledgard 2013 and the resulting deterioration of water quality has led to groundwater quality being a particular important issue for the region rissmann et al 2016 qualitative approaches to determine areas of denitrification potential have previously been carried out in the southland region rissmann 2011 assigned geological units with a denitrification potential category high to low to produce a map of denitrification potential of southland aquifers the classification was based on the expected denitrification potential of main rock and sub rock categories in the new zealand 1 250 000 geological database qmap rattenbury and heron 1997 areas of soil denitrification potential sdp were mapped by killick et al 2014 using a ranking system with organic and gley soil classes having high sdp ratings soils with moderately high or high sdp were found to occur in areas of restricted drainage suggesting a relationship between denitrification potential and soil drainage recently these geology and soil based studies have been combined to form a regional map of combined reduction potential rissmann et al 2016 the classification provided by this approach involved a twelve fold categorisation of soil redox potential overlying geological redox potential e g low over high 2 2 regional hydrogeology the geology of the southland region has a high spatial variability from relatively inert plutonic rocks to more reactive organic and volcaniclastic sediments this variability prompted rissmann 2011 to map five denitrification categories ranging from very low to very high based on main rock and sub rock characteristics in the qmap geological database rattenbury and heron 1997 the basement geology of the southland region is centred on the southland syncline formed by indurated mesozoic clastic and volcanoclastic sediments turnbull and allibone 2003 basement geology to the northeast of the syncline consists of permian to triassic schist and semi schist along the northern boundary of the region turnbull 2000 the mountainous country in the western part of the region is known as fiordland which consists of mostly crystalline mesozoic to palaeozoic rocks turnbull et al 2010 there are very few wells intercepting the basement geology since the productivity of these rocks is low even when fractured and the associated terrane is typically unsuitable for high production pasture or cropping the basement rocks are overlain by a regional paleogene to neogene marine transgression sequence of conglomerate sandstone mudstone and limestone these sediments host coal and lignite measures as well as glauconitic sandstones which can provide electron donors for denitrification in areas where they occur overlying the paleogene to neogene sandstones are sequences of quaternary sediments with a complex depositional history determined by climatic and sea level fluctuations tectonics catchment vegetation and the availability of and distance from sediment sources as a result the quaternary sediments represent a diversity of lithologies emplaced within in a wide range of overlapping depositional environments including proximal to distal alluvial fans and glacial outwash gravels interglacial marine and marginal marine silts the total thickness of the quaternary in southland is typically less than 25 m and has been deposited within the southland syncline and valleys formed by basement rock structure the majority of wells in the region intercept these highly productive gravel units which are predominantly holocene in age turnbull and allibone 2003 land elevation in the southern part of the southland syncline is close to sea level and poorly drained soils in this area have resulted in widespread holocene wetlands and peat deposits along the coastline several authors have identified a relationship between nitrate concentrations and depth to the water table böhlke 2002 nolan et al 2002 gurdak and qi 2012 rosecrans et al 2017 with shallow water tables being indicative of waterlogging conditions conducive to denitrification in southland the predicted water level depth fig 2 is predominantly determined by the distribution of unconsolidated quaternary sediments and areas of fractured rock areas of clastic sediment are characterised by a shallow water table blue green areas whereas areas of consolidated rock are characterised by a deep water table red areas the depth to the water table is considered to be shallow across most of the southland region and is less than 5 m beneath the main groundwater systems 2 3 assignment of redox status the grouping class used for lda is the groundwater redox status which must be assigned prior to the development of the model the principles and method used for the assignment of redox status are presented in mcmahon and chapelle 2008 in summary a series of microbially mediated redox reactions naturally occur in groundwater systems which successively use o2 no3 mn iv fe iii so4 and co2 as electron acceptors there is a decrease in energy available to the microbes from each successive electron acceptor so they are utilised in the above order in cases where the system is in equilibrium however the reaction process is not strictly linear and there can be considerable overlap between adjacent processes in the redox sequence the redox reaction succession provides a framework for assigning groundwater redox status according to the presence of electron acceptors and the resulting reaction products mcmahon and chapelle 2008 used sample concentrations of o2 no3 mn ii fe ii and so4 in their redox assignment framework these solutes are relatively easy and inexpensive to measure and are commonly included in regional water quality monitoring programmes the redox thresholds derived by mcmahon and chapelle 2008 for each solute were based on the typically observed concentrations found for particular redox environments in a range of united states studies the thresholds were designed to be broadly applicable to a range of different hydrologic conditions at the regional scale they noted that while sometimes application of the framework would result in a unique assignment of redox status other instances would result in a mixed or ambiguous indication of redox status this ambiguity could result from aquifer heterogeneity flow path complexity or long well screens that resulted in water sampled coming from a mixture of redox environments mcmahon and chapelle 2008 there may also be mixing induced by well pumping and some assignments of mixed where concentrations are close to the thresholds this study follows the redox assignment procedure developed by close et al 2016 which has been slightly modified from mcmahon and chapelle 2008 to suit new zealand conditions the use of no3 n to indicate reducing conditions is problematic since nitrate concentrations can depend on source contributions and travel times in addition to redox status we have therefore used mn as an additional indicator of reducing conditions and assume that elevated mn concentrations are evidence that nitrate reduction has occurred the relevant redox status proposed by mcmahon and chapelle 2008 for application to this study is therefore manganese reduction rather than nitrate reduction the use of three indicators for redox status do no3 n and mn increases confidence in the assignation and also enables the identification of samples with mixed redox status close et al 2016 observed that dissolved fe concentrations are highly correlated with mn values and mn values are less susceptible to contamination from corrosion of the iron well casing accordingly only the mn data were used for the redox assignment since they are considered to be more robust the selection of a suitable do threshold to indicate denitrification potentially has a bearing on the results of statistical model predictions the do data for this study were collected by environment southland using a galvanic do field sensor the sensor is capable of accurately estimating do to 0 5 mg with regular calibration however it is recognised that confidence in do values collected in the field decreases at low concentrations the onset of denitrification processes has been reported to occur at do concentrations ranging from 0 2 to 2 mg l and denitrification occurring at higher do concentrations may be caused by mixing of multiple flow paths at the sampling scale of well screens see mcmahon and chapelle 2008 the measurement of dissolved oxygen do at low levels is also acknowledged to be difficult in well water and the results can vary depending on the staff member and time periods that are considered accordingly the criterion for anoxic conditions proposed by mcmahon and chapelle 2008 of do 0 5 mg l has been increased to a value of 1 0 mg l scatter plots of do vs no3 n and mn confirm that this threshold is appropriate for indicating reducing groundwater in the southland region there are only two samples with a do concentration between 0 5 and 1 mg l and these samples have no3 n and mn concentrations indicative of reducing conditions we can therefore conclude that the choice of a higher do threshold is not expected to make a significant difference to our model predictions the final criteria proposed by close et al 2016 to represent reducing conditions in new zealand groundwater were concentrations of no3 n 0 5 mg l do 1 mg l dissolved mn 0 05 mg l mean concentrations for no3 n do and mn were calculated from the groundwater data for each well using samples from 2006 when a national groundwater sampling protocol was implemented to 2015 the criteria and the attributed redox states used in this study are presented in table 1 note that mcmahon and chapelle 2008 consider a wider range of redox states and use more terms for the redox states than are needed for this study the inclusion of so4 to the list of solutes was tested and found to be of negligible benefit for the purpose of redox assignment in southland as found by mcmahon and chapelle 2008 a number of well samples result in conflicting or mixed results during redox assignment such as samples having high nitrate levels combined with high mn or low do levels these samples are classed into the mixed category for the three redox state system and probably reflect a system that is not in redox equilibrium or where there are well screens that draw water from two redox environments 2 4 selection of predictive variables the purpose of deriving an lda model is to predict subsurface redox status spatially across a region to do this requires discriminating variables in the form of classified gis layers which have complete or nearly complete coverage across the region the arcgis package esri arcmap software was used to extract discriminating variable values from a number of gis layers at locations where the redox class assignment had been made the results of the lda could then be applied to these layers in order to extrapolate across the region and produce maps of predicted redox status it is acknowledged that some of the land surface parameters e g land use at the well locations may not reflect the recharge source because of lateral flow paths the uncertainty of relating samples to overlying spatial parameters increases with depth since a vertical component of flow will only predominate in the near surface and the influence of land surface recharge from the source area above the sample will decrease with depth böhlke 2002 to some extent this issue has been addressed by optimising the depth threshold for which the shallow 15 m and medium 15 75 m depth predictions may be considered valid and excluding deeper predictions following close et al 2016 nine discriminating variable sets have been selected for predicting redox states these are the qmap main rock and sub rock categories geological age land use nz soil drainage class minimum and maximum soil carbon status elevation and slope to incorporate hydrological factors these variables have been supplemented by depth to groundwater and hydraulic conductivity of the medium which are available for clastic sediments from a previous hydrological study of the southland region wilson et al 2014 hydraulic conductivity values for the paleogene to mesozoic rocks were attributed using estimates from domenico and schwartz 1998 values of depth to the water table in the clastic sediments were derived from wilson et al 2014 these data were extended to the remainder of the region by generating a composite dataset of groundwater level and stream elevation data that could be used for variogram analysis stream nodes were extracted from the niwa river environment classification rec database snelder et al 2010 rec classes 1 and 2 were removed as they are considered to be ephemeral or perched and are therefore not representative of the emergence of the water table at the surface the upstream node for each of the remaining reaches was queried from the dem and appended to the groundwater level data the composite dataset was then log transformed for variogram analysis using genstat vsn international 2011 an experimental variogram was formed in genstat using a max lag of 3500 m and a step length of 250 m a gaussian model accounted for 99 9 of the variance in the experimental variogram dataset the standard error of the observations was 0 731 the variogram parameters were entered in arcgis for kriging and the raster exponentially transformed to generate a regional scale static water level this surface was subtracted from the dem to create a map of depth to groundwater land surface recharge data are also available for the main aquifers from wilson et al 2014 however it was considered too difficult to extend this dataset to cover the whole region since these values were derived for clastic sediments and much of the region is underlain by hard rock the land surface recharge dataset has therefore not been used at the regional scale but has been included at a sub regional level to assess its discriminating potential the geological variables included in the regional model are sourced from qmap a national geodatabase based on data collected at 1 50 000 scale and presented at 1 250 000 scale qmap represents geological units as a pragmatic combination of lithology and chronology with an intention to add information without cluttering the map presentation rattenbury and heron 1997 greater detail is provided by qmap for quaternary deposits because of their widespread surface distribution these are mapped according to their marine oxygen isotope stages martinson et al 1987 to differentiate them by age and are further differentiated according to constituent materials and broad depositional environments such as alluvial fan scree and beach the qmap variables that have been used are categories for main rock dominant lithology and sub rock subordinate lithologies as well as the geological age of the formation the land use variable was sourced from the new zealand land use map newsome et al 2013 topography variables included the elevation and slope which were sourced from an 8 m dem geographx 2012 soil data were taken from a combination of the 1 63 360 scale fundamental soil layers newsome et al 2008 and the 1 50 000 scale s map database lilburne et al 2012 both collected and compiled at 1 50 000 scale soil variables used were soil carbon minimum and maximum and drainage class new zealand soil order the highest level in the new zealand soil classification hewitt 2010 was not found to be a discriminating variable in this study and has therefore been excluded from the analysis some of the discriminating variables have numerical values such as soil carbon elevation and slope soil carbon percent organic matter content of the top 20 cm min and max is provided as the lower and upper thresholds respectively of the relevant soil carbon classes the soil drainage class values range from 1 being very poorly drained to 5 being well drained newsome et al 2008 elevation slope and depth to the water table have continuous data distributions these were assigned into ranges bins to ensure that all of the discriminating variables were compatible with a vector gis model development and to simplify spatial processing the raw values for all four of the continuous datasets and the hydraulic conductivity values were skewed these data have been log transformed before setting bin thresholds using the jenks natural breaks method jenks 1963 ten groups or bins were created for the five variables and the thresholds are given in table 2 the bin numbers were used as the parameter values for development of the lda models other variables were categorical and required that numerical values be assigned to each class or category the assignments for the geological rock type and soil order were carried out by giving a low score to categories that tended to be inert or retain oxidising conditions and giving a higher score to categories that were more reactive with respect to oxygen and nitrate and thus promote more reducing conditions the scales ranged between 1 and 5 for example geological units such as gravels were given a score of 1 whereas peats were given a score of 5 table 3 the land use classification variable provided a very rough measure of potential nitrate inputs with high nitrate inputs associated with cropland and high productivity grassland given scores of 1 and 2 respectively compared to low nitrate inputs associated with forest and wetlands given scores of 4 and 5 respectively mountainous terrain i e land with a land use capability class of 7 or 8 or land with a slope 19 degrees was excluded from the models and maps a final gis layer 14 520 km2 was created for a dataset representing each unique physical combination of discriminating variables in the southland region this layer was queried at well locations to create an input dataset for discriminant analysis 2 5 linear discriminant analysis discriminant analysis seeks to statistically distinguish between two or more groups using a set of discriminating variables representing physical characteristics for which the groups are expected to differ discriminant analysis attempts to do this by forming one or more linear combinations of the discriminating variables these discriminant functions are of the form d i d 0 d i 1 z 1 d i 2 z 2 d i p z p where di is the score on the discriminant function i the d s are scaling or weighting coefficients and the z s are the standardised values of the p discriminant variables used in the analysis the functions are formed in such a way as to maximise the separation of the groups while minimising the variation within the groups once a combination of variables is found which provides satisfactory discrimination for cases samples with known group memberships a set of classification functions can be derived which enables the classification of new cases with unknown memberships the procedure for classification uses a separate linear combination of the discriminating variables for each group these produce a probability of membership in the respective group and the case is assigned to the group with the highest probability for the prediction of redox status the group categories used are the redox class and their prediction is dependent on the discriminating variables which are in this case gis layers of different physical characteristics of the regional environment the discriminant analysis was performed using systat 13 1 systat 2010 initially all of the discriminating variables were used and then the least significant using the f statistic measure of sample variances discriminant variables were successively removed this process was continued until the discriminating success classified correct decreased and all discriminating variables had f 1 a more detailed description of discriminant analysis is given in tabachnick and fidell 2013 discriminant functions for each depth and redox state were initially developed using a random selection of 67 of the well data and then tested on the remaining 33 of the data to test the robustness of the models results from the discriminant analyses using the full dataset were used to extrapolate across the southland region this was done by applying each discriminant function to each unique combination of physical variables and assigning it the redox status with the highest probability the resulting redox predictions were then imported into gis for generating maps 2 6 depth intervals the southland datasets were initially separated into three arbitrary depth classes shallow 25 m medium 25 100 m and deep 100 m and a discriminant analysis was carried out separately for each class wilson et al 2016 suitable depth thresholds were then established by assessing the predictive success of the lda at different depth intervals this process was started by determining the optimum shallow depth threshold and working downwards to determine thresholds for medium and then deep well samples the criteria used to determine the optimal threshold for each depth class are a high percentage of successful predictions and a balance between accurately predicted oxidised and reduced categories the optimal thresholds for successful predictions tend to coincide with a change in the variables used for discrimination as determined by the f statistic the optimisation process showed that the variables used are consistent for ranges of depths however at the point where the optimal depth is found there is a change in the combination of variables used for example the shallow threshold was determined to be 15 m and the geological age and water table depth scores were not discriminating variables within this range at greater depths the hydraulic conductivity values were not found to be a discriminating variable the final thresholds used for lda are shallow 15 m medium 15 75 m deep 75 m 2 7 sub regional analysis a sub region of southland was selected to test the scale dependence of the lda model the area chosen is 2005 km2 14 of the full dataset area and includes the makarewa waihopai lower mataura and edendale groundwater zones this area is predominantly composed of clastic sediment and shows the most variability in redox status in the region the selection of this area also gives the opportunity to test the utility of land surface recharge as a discriminating variable since data are only available for clastic sediments wilson et al 2014 to do this the land surface recharge values were log transformed and binned into 10 classes using the jenks natural breaks method and included in the parameter dataset for discriminant analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 redox assignment redox classes were assigned for groundwater at 843 well sites in the southland region the sample sources were 50 in the shallow depth class 45 in the medium depth class 15 75 m and only 5 in the deep class table 4 the majority of samples were oxidised 71 with 11 being classified as mixed and 18 representative of reducing conditions the percentage of reducing samples increased with depth which is consistent with observations from the united states mcmahon and chapelle 2008 in the southland region the presence of reduced groundwater in the deeper samples is likely to be the result of water interaction with neogene lignite deposits which underlie quaternary clastic gravels throughout much of the region the percentage of mixed well samples did not change significantly between depth classes the distribution of the assigned redox status for the southland region is shown in fig 1 most wells are drilled to intercept the clastic gravel material on the alluvial plains which constitute the main productive groundwater resource a few wells intercept fractured jurassic sandstone and medium to deep depths and these are mostly located in the catlins area in the far eastern part of the region oxidised conditions predominate in the region particularly in the northern alluvial basins and also along the terraces associated with the major southwards flowing river systems the majority of reducing well samples are situated in the vicinity of outcropping neogene or older lignite and coal deposits or quaternary peat deposits near the coast the spatial distribution of mixed category samples does not appear to follow a clear geological pattern these samples are expected to either represent a groundwater system that is not in a state of redox equilibrium or are sourced from wells with screens that draw from two redox zones 3 2 sample size assessment there are only 41 samples in total from the deep well category and such a small sample size suggests that the results of lda for deep well samples may not be representative the minimum sample size required for a level of confidence can be tested by applying central limit theory if the well samples are assumed to be a random selection from the total population of discriminant variable values an assumption which is also made for the lda this assumption is not exactly correct since wells in southland tend to be drilled in clastic sediments in order to achieve the highest well productivity nonetheless by assuming random sampling an estimate can be made of the minimum number of samples required to be representative of the wider region to do this the number of samples required to give a value that is within half a variable category e with 95 confidence has been determined this test was conducted for each depth and redox status combination and the results are shown in table 5 the variables which require the most samples are the continuous datasets which require binning the category with the greatest sample variance overall is the geological age which requires at least 150 samples for most depths and redox classes however this variable was not found to be a strong discriminator in any of the depth classes as determined by the f statistic f 0 2 1 8 variables with f values less than 2 5 were found to have little influence on the predictive success of the discriminant functions it can be seen that the samples from deep wells fail the confidence test for the number of samples required for deep samples in the oxic and mixed categories and barely pass for the reduced category the deeper samples have therefore been removed from further analysis 3 3 discriminant analysis maps of predicted redox status derived from the classification functions are shown in fig 3 the overall distribution of redox states remains fairly consistent between shallow and medium depths however the predicted area of reducing conditions is much greater at medium depths and the area of mixed redox conditions is more homogenised these results indicate that groundwater in southland generally becomes more reducing with depth however 3 5 of the area is predicted by the lda model to have oxidising underlying reducing conditions a comparison between the sample redox status and discriminating variable scores at these locations gives no clear indication why this would be the case the most likely explanation for this discrepancy is that the discriminating parameters for predicting redox status at shallow and medium depths are not the same for example slope and depth to water are discriminating variables for medium but not shallow depth predictions whereas the reverse is true for sub rock as summary of the discriminant function redox predictions for the southland region compared to the well redox assignment is given in table 6 the models predict that groundwater is reducing in 23 of the region at shallow depths and 37 of the region at medium depths for mixed redox conditions the estimates are 20 and 11 of shallow and medium depths respectively the proportion of oxic groundwater predicted by the models is considerably lower than that of the samples this difference is expected since wells tend to be drilled in areas of higher productivity and higher quality oxic groundwater which introduces a bias to the available empirical data sets a measure of the discriminating power of each variable in the predictive model is expressed by its f statistic value table 5 the soil drainage variable was found to be the most strongly discriminating parameter for all depth classes f 4 9 15 7 followed by elevation the next most discriminating variables are sub rock for shallow depths and the depth to the water table for medium depths the coefficients derived by lda for each classification function are listed in table 7 variables with f values 1 were removed from the classification dataset and are represented by null values most of the variables were used in the lda for both shallow and medium depths the only discriminating variable not used in the shallow predictive model is hydraulic conductivity shallow redox predictions are most influenced by land use and soil related parameters the influence of the near surface variables representing soil and land use is diminished in the medium depth predictive model variables with greater discriminating power higher f values in table 7 show a relationship between their discriminant function coefficient and redox state the best example of this is the soil drainage class which shows a progressive increase in the coefficient from slow draining reduced conditions to well drained oxidised conditions for both shallow and deep samples similarly the sub rock coefficient increases from oxidised to reduced states for shallow wells reflecting an association between redox state and lithology however some coefficients do not show clear associations with redox status despite having being considered a discriminating variable f 2 5 an example of this is the elevation variable for shallow wells f 10 2 which has the potential to distinguish reduced from oxic conditions but indicates an inability to correctly classify mixed conditions all three geological variables have less influence on the predictive power of the discriminant functions than expected the only instance where a geological variable has been clearly identified as a discriminating variable is the sub rock parameter for shallow samples f 7 9 this suggests a limitation of the qmap database which lacks the detailed spatial variability provided by the soils databases for example each quaternary gravel unit consists of multiple facies as evidenced in the lithological descriptions in the sub rock category however the distribution and relative abundance of each lithology within the unit is unknown since multiple facies are aggregated into mappable units this was done to suit the intended scale of the geological maps but also because the predominant hydrogeology consists of rapidly deposited alluvial gravel sequences which are extremely difficult to separate into distinct facies this simplification at the geological unit scale greatly reduces the discriminating power of the available geological data in the discriminant functions geological age has little discriminating power in the analysis because the presence of electron donors depends more on the depositional setting of the stratigraphy rather than its age for example much of the southland region is covered in quaternary sediments which are predominantly comprised of glacial outwash gravels within inland areas and these deposits contain few electron donors regardless of their age conversely sediments in coastal areas can be of a similar age to the inland glacial outwash gravels but consist of marine sediments with pyrite or wetland deposits with organic carbon which provide the electron donors required for denitrification as a consequence parameters which have the ability to distinguish low energy depositional environments e g soil drainage have more discriminating power than age for predicting subsurface reducing conditions the lda method predicts that only 23 of the southland region has the reducing conditions required for denitrification to occur at higher elevations oxic conditions are predicted to be widespread and we can conclude that denitrification will have little effect on water quality however reducing conditions predominate in lower elevation areas particularly on the coastal plains which are an area of widespread groundwater discharge to sensitive aquatic environments these areas are characterised by poorly drained soils low permeability sediments and low land slopes physical traits which promote low hydraulic gradients and less dynamic subsurface hydrology the prevalence of these characteristics on the coastal plains indicates that the potential benefit of denitrification for naturally mitigating nitrate leaching in these areas could be substantial the hydrological significance of this result is that water quality management could benefit greatly by focussing on the effect that widespread artificial drainage systems have on the nitrate load to coastal streams and estuaries subsurface drains can cause flow pathways to bypass denitrifying environments böhlke 2002 thereby lessening the potential benefit to water quality provided by the presence of subsurface denitrification 3 4 predictive accuracy the percentage of samples correctly predicted by the redox status models are shown in table 8 the discriminant models were re tested by re calibration on a randomly selected portion of the training dataset 67 and also on the remaining 33 of the dataset the test data the change in the predictive success between using the full model and either of the test datasets was only 1 6 1 2 overall which indicates that the models are robust however a larger dataset does greatly improve the predictive success of the model this is evident in the comparison between shallow oxic conditions 235 samples 90 success and shallow reduced conditions 81 samples 40 success an overall predictive success of 59 or more could be achieved with 6 7 discriminating variables f values 2 5 made little difference to the predictive success of the model 4 change the discriminating variables common to both shallow and medium datasets were soil drainage class elevation sub rock c max and slope despite the improvements made to the discriminating variable datasets compared to previous studies close et al 2016 the models have only correctly predicted redox status for 65 and 59 for shallow and medium depth samples respectively we would expect the predictive success to decrease with depth since there is increased uncertainty of the recharge source for deeper samples and there are also fewer samples available for training the lda model optimisation of the sample depth thresholds increased the overall predictive success of the discriminant functions by 5 for the shallow samples 15 m depth but did not significantly improve the success rate for the much thicker and more diverse medium depth range 15 75 m depth wilks lambda values a measure of the residual discrimination have been calculated for the discriminant functions the results are 0 76 and 0 80 for shallow and medium depths respectively and indicate that the variables used are only mildly effective at discriminating between redox classes substantive improvement to the predictive success of the models would therefore require more detailed predictive variable datasets e g at the geological facies scale or additional datasets that are specifically collected for discrimination of redox status recent research by rosecrans et al 2017 demonstrates that predictive success could also be increased by including a flow path component in the lda however a regional scale groundwater flow model of the southland region is not currently available 3 5 sub regional analysis the question of what scale is suitable for redox predictions using the lda method was raised by close et al 2016 to have confidence in the results of statistical methods used to predict redox status we expect that the observation sample dataset would represent a wide range of combinations of the predictive variables furthermore it is likely that some parameters will be more scale dependant than others and the significance of their dependence will depend on their discriminating contribution to the lda the scale dependence of a number of physical variables was tested by gurdak et al 2017 who concluded that nitrate concentrations were sensitive to both the scale of the model domain and the contributing variables gurdack et al 2017 found that the variables do soil thickness and farm fertilizer nitrogen source were scale invariant while many of the transport variables showed some scale dependence for this study we have assumed that do is a scale invariant factor since do has been used as a criterion for assigning the redox status to samples the scale dependant factors in our study are assumed to consist of all the predictive variables land use geology soil etc since these are used in the lda to extend the redox status observed at sample locations to a larger area the scale dependence of these parameters is a function of both their discriminating power and the number of samples required to provide confidence in the model predictions parameters which require fewer samples are expected to be less scale dependent and these are the soil properties geology land use and elevation for the southland region table 5 the effect that the model domain scale on the predictive success was tested by applying the discriminant models to a sub regional dataset while this produces a smaller dataset to train the lda the samples used to derive the discriminant function coefficients are likely to be more representative of local conditions and intuitively should improve predictive success a 2000 km2 test model domain was chosen which displayed a mixture of redox conditions the data from this region was used to derive new discriminant functions based on the regional scale discriminating variable dataset land surface recharge was included as an additional hydrological variable because of its availability for this sub region however land surface recharge was not found to be a discriminating parameter for shallow and medium depths of the sub regional dataset f 1 the predicted redox state for the original and revised discriminant models is shown fig 4 for shallow well samples the general distribution of redox status remains similar between the two models although the local scale dataset predicts a greater area of oxic and mixed redox states the percentages of samples correctly predicted by the original and revised models are shown in table 9 the sub regional dataset shows an improvement in the predictive success of the discriminant models for mixed and reduced conditions however the sample size assessment has shown that there are insufficient samples in these redox categories for the predictions to be reliable while predictions for oxic conditions have been found to be reliable by the sample size assessment the sub regional model has not improved the predictive success of the models we can conclude from this study that the most important scale consideration for redox status prediction using lda is to ensure there is a sufficiently large number of samples to represent a wide range of combinations of the most discriminating variables it is therefore advantageous to apply lda to an area which is larger than that of immediate interest because a larger area potentially provides additional combinations of variables which can increase confidence in the predictions a caveat to this conclusion is that a larger area could potentially introduce different driving forces for determining redox status for example the inclusion of marine sediments in a regional redox assessment may introduce inorganic electron donors supporting autotrophic denitrification to a region where heterotrophic denitrification dominates however the effect of additional redox drivers on the model results could be tested by applying the lda to sub regions of the model domain where such differences are expected the results for both shallow and medium depth datasets using the original regional scale and revised sub regional scale model domains are shown in table 10 the revised model for shallow samples 136 wells shows a shift in the predicted redox state towards proportions that are similar to those obtained for the well assignment conversely the results for medium depth samples 114 wells using the revised discriminant model are less similar to the well assignment values than the original model a comparison of the number of samples used in the sub regional dataset and the minimum required sample size table 5 indicates that the sample size is likely to be too small to have confidence in the discriminant model predictions the sample size fails the confidence test for all redox states using the age slope and hydraulic conductivity variables however these parameters do not have much discriminating power the mixed redox state fails the confidence test for two key discriminating variables soil drainage class and elevation and the reduced redox state fails for elevation while there are sufficient samples to have confidence in the sub regional model predictions for oxic conditions we conclude there are insufficient sample data to have confidence in the model results overall 3 6 comparison with previous studies in new zealand table 11 shows the predictive success of the southland discriminant functions compared to those of the canterbury and waikato regions developed in close et al 2016 the success of the southland model is comparable to that of the waikato region modifications of the variables and depth thresholds used have only slightly improved the predictive success of the discriminant functions for the southland region optimising the depth thresholds has improved the predictive success of the southland discriminant models from 54 to 60 for shallow and 42 to 59 for medium sample categories however the improved models were still not as successful as those originally developed for the canterbury area most likely due to the large sample dataset available for that region 4 conclusions the benefit of applying a statistical approach to predict redox status is twofold firstly the approach enables predictions of denitrification potential to be made in areas where few samples are available in southland the majority of groundwater quality samples are located in the inland alluvial aquifers where land use is most intensive due to free draining soils conversely the aquatic ecosystems which are most vulnerable to nitrate pollution occur along the coastal plains where land is artificially drained to make it productive these coastal areas have insufficient groundwater samples to carry out vulnerability mapping without a means of spatial prediction using lda or an alternative statistical method however lda is a data driven method and relies on a large dataset representing a wide range of discriminating variable combinations for good predictive success and to have confidence in those predictions when considering application of lda in a region an assessment needs to be made as to whether there is adequate sample data available to be able to have confidence in the model predictions to make predictions at a sub regional scale it is therefore recommended that a regional scale discriminant model be developed first this enables a sample size assessment to be carried out first to determine if there are sufficient samples in the region to train the discriminant functions the predictive success of statistical models can be improved by targeted sampling in areas where combinations of the key discriminating variables are absent in this study the classification functions were found to be dependent on just 6 7 key discriminating variables as determined by the f statistic soil drainage class and elevation were found to be the most discriminating parameters regardless of depth the influence of the remaining variables depended on the sample depth threshold used although sub rock c max and slope were discriminating parameters for both shallow and medium depths some parameters that were expected to be influential soil type hydraulic conductivity land surface recharge were not found to be discriminating at all although this can be explained by their being closely correlated with more discriminating datasets e g hydraulic conductivity is expected to be correlated with sub rock the second perhaps more significant benefit of the lda approach is the insight provided for understanding the causative physical conditions associated with denitrification our study has predicted that reducing conditions will occur in groundwaters at low elevations beneath poorly drained soils additional indicators for subsurface denitrification are a high carbon content of the soil a shallow water table and clastic sediments deposited in low energy environments e g mudstone or peat the implication of these conclusions for land and water management in new zealand and potentially in other parts of the world is that reducing conditions can be expected on coastal plains where artificial drainage is required to make the land productive for farming barkle et al 2017 the utility of natural attenuation capacity located in these settings therefore relies on finding an optimal balance between land drainage for agricultural production and hydrological bypassing of denitrifying zones that is likely to occur as a result of installation of artificial drainage

7576,diffuse nitrate losses from agricultural land pollute groundwater resources worldwide but can be attenuated under reducing subsurface conditions in new zealand the ability to predict where groundwater denitrification occurs is important for understanding the linkage between land use and discharges of nitrate bearing groundwater to streams this study assesses the application of linear discriminant analysis lda for predicting groundwater redox status for southland a major dairy farming region in new zealand data cases were developed by assigning a redox status to samples derived from a regional groundwater quality database pre existing regional scale geospatial databases were used as training variables for the discriminant functions the predictive accuracy of the discriminant functions was slightly improved by optimising the thresholds between sample depth classes the models predict 23 of the region as being reducing at shallow depths 15 m and 37 at medium depths 15 75 m predictions were made at a sub regional level to determine whether improvements could be made with discriminant functions trained by local data the results indicated that any gains in predictive success were offset by loss of confidence in the predictions due to the reduction in the number of samples used the regional scale model predictions indicate that subsurface reducing conditions predominate at low elevations on the coastal plains where poorly drained soils are widespread additional indicators for subsurface denitrification are a high carbon content of the soil a shallow water table and low permeability clastic sediments the coastal plains are an area of widespread groundwater discharge and the soil and hydrology characteristics require the land to be artificially drained to render the land suitable for farming for the improvement of water quality in coastal areas it is therefore important that land and water management efforts focus on understanding hydrological bypassing that may occur via artificial drainage systems abbreviations lda linear discriminant analysis do dissolved oxygen keywords nitrate redox status statistical modelling new zealand 1 introduction nitrate is a key groundwater contaminant in new zealand mfe 2017 and many other parts of the world spalding and exner 1993 in new zealand increasing land use intensity particularly in the dairy sector has led to increasing levels of nitrate in groundwater systems and impacts on receiving surface waters such as streams rivers and lakes pce 2013 mfe 2017 these concerns have led to the establishment of a land and water forum land and water forum 2010 2012 reforms in freshwater management including a national policy statement for freshwater management and a legislative framework that will require the setting of limits in fresh water for contaminants including nitrate mfe 2014 in the context of meeting limits for environmental protection a key natural attenuation process for nitrate is denitrification the ability to predict the distribution of reducing conditions in the subsurface is essential for predicting the fate of nitrate along groundwater flow paths previous approaches for estimating the subsurface distribution of denitrification at the regional scale can be broadly divided into vulnerability mapping and statistical prediction methods the vulnerability mapping approach involves the analysis and integration of geochemical geological and hydrological datasets hansen and thorling 2008 hojberg et al 2017 and can incorporate geophysical survey data refsgaard et al 2014 vulnerability mapping relies on the availability of large datasets with good spatial coverage across the region being studied to predict the presence of reducing conditions in areas where there is lesser data availability and determine the key controlling variables statistical models are used nolan et al 2002 gurdak and qi 2012 tesoriero et al 2015 close et al 2016 rosecrans et al 2017 however both the vulnerability and statistical approaches are premised on understanding the relationship between the redox status of groundwater samples and local environmental variables such as geology or soil drainage for denitrification to occur four environmental conditions need to be present anoxic or low oxygen conditions the presence of a suitable electron donor sufficient nitrate to act as an electron acceptor and denitrifying microbes to mediate the reduction reaction korom 1992 böhlke 2002 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 rivett et al 2008 the most important electron donor minerals in groundwater systems are organic carbon pyrite and the ferrous iron associated with iron oxides pedersen et al 1991 korom 1992 rodvang and simpkins 2001 appelo and postma 2005 microbes capable of denitrification are considered to be ubiquitous in the environment as a result the first two conditions are coupled in the presence of suitable electron donors such as carbon since the microbes are usually able to reduce oxygen levels so that nitrate is the next electron acceptor and denitrification is able to take place thus the redox status of groundwater provides a good indicator of where denitrification can occur gurdak and qi 2012 this information on redox status can be combined with information on groundwater flow paths and nitrate concentrations to assess if denitrification is likely to occur in a particular groundwater zone due to difficulties in sampling in the subsurface there is considerable uncertainty as to the spatial and temporal distribution of reducing zones and even more uncertainty on how much denitrification is occurring knowledge of where denitrification can potentially occur in groundwater systems would assist water resource managers with assessment of where reductions in nitrate loads may occur within the subsurface prior to the fluxes reaching receiving waters observations of subsurface redox conditions in new zealand are limited to the availability of groundwater samples from wells which can be characterised with respect to redox state a method to extrapolate these groundwater data to the remainder of the region was proposed and applied by close et al 2016 the method used was linear discriminant analysis lda a multivariate statistical method used to distinguish between two or more groups lda involves the formation of a model from linear combinations of discriminating variables representing physical characteristics for which the groups redox classes are expected to differ the resulting model is then applied by extrapolation to the remainder of the region the method presented by close et al 2016 included a number of predictive parameters for elevation slope drainage class carbon content soil order geology geological age and land use potential limitations of the approach were the exclusion of hydrological indicators of redox status and the use of somewhat arbitrary depth thresholds close et al 2016 also suggested that further work be carried out to test the appropriate scale for application of the lda method this paper refines the work of close et al 2016 by investigating some key aspects of the methodology and its application additional parameters have been included to represent depth to water table and hydraulic conductivity as measures of waterlogging and groundwater flow potential respectively the discriminating potential of land surface recharge estimates has also been tested within a subset of the region for which recharge data were available this paper also assesses the depth for which the model predictions can be considered to be valid and optimises the representative depth ranges to overcome the use of subjective depth thresholds finally the effect that scale has on the predictive success of the model is tested to determine the number of samples required to have confidence in the model predictions 2 methodology 2 1 study area redox assignment was carried out for existing groundwater monitoring data from the 29 800 km2 southland region of the south island of new zealand fig 1 sample data were supplied by the regional water management authority environment southland the population of southland is mostly settled on pastoral farms or rural communities many of which rely on groundwater for a drinking water supply a recent increase in dairy farming ledgard 2013 and the resulting deterioration of water quality has led to groundwater quality being a particular important issue for the region rissmann et al 2016 qualitative approaches to determine areas of denitrification potential have previously been carried out in the southland region rissmann 2011 assigned geological units with a denitrification potential category high to low to produce a map of denitrification potential of southland aquifers the classification was based on the expected denitrification potential of main rock and sub rock categories in the new zealand 1 250 000 geological database qmap rattenbury and heron 1997 areas of soil denitrification potential sdp were mapped by killick et al 2014 using a ranking system with organic and gley soil classes having high sdp ratings soils with moderately high or high sdp were found to occur in areas of restricted drainage suggesting a relationship between denitrification potential and soil drainage recently these geology and soil based studies have been combined to form a regional map of combined reduction potential rissmann et al 2016 the classification provided by this approach involved a twelve fold categorisation of soil redox potential overlying geological redox potential e g low over high 2 2 regional hydrogeology the geology of the southland region has a high spatial variability from relatively inert plutonic rocks to more reactive organic and volcaniclastic sediments this variability prompted rissmann 2011 to map five denitrification categories ranging from very low to very high based on main rock and sub rock characteristics in the qmap geological database rattenbury and heron 1997 the basement geology of the southland region is centred on the southland syncline formed by indurated mesozoic clastic and volcanoclastic sediments turnbull and allibone 2003 basement geology to the northeast of the syncline consists of permian to triassic schist and semi schist along the northern boundary of the region turnbull 2000 the mountainous country in the western part of the region is known as fiordland which consists of mostly crystalline mesozoic to palaeozoic rocks turnbull et al 2010 there are very few wells intercepting the basement geology since the productivity of these rocks is low even when fractured and the associated terrane is typically unsuitable for high production pasture or cropping the basement rocks are overlain by a regional paleogene to neogene marine transgression sequence of conglomerate sandstone mudstone and limestone these sediments host coal and lignite measures as well as glauconitic sandstones which can provide electron donors for denitrification in areas where they occur overlying the paleogene to neogene sandstones are sequences of quaternary sediments with a complex depositional history determined by climatic and sea level fluctuations tectonics catchment vegetation and the availability of and distance from sediment sources as a result the quaternary sediments represent a diversity of lithologies emplaced within in a wide range of overlapping depositional environments including proximal to distal alluvial fans and glacial outwash gravels interglacial marine and marginal marine silts the total thickness of the quaternary in southland is typically less than 25 m and has been deposited within the southland syncline and valleys formed by basement rock structure the majority of wells in the region intercept these highly productive gravel units which are predominantly holocene in age turnbull and allibone 2003 land elevation in the southern part of the southland syncline is close to sea level and poorly drained soils in this area have resulted in widespread holocene wetlands and peat deposits along the coastline several authors have identified a relationship between nitrate concentrations and depth to the water table böhlke 2002 nolan et al 2002 gurdak and qi 2012 rosecrans et al 2017 with shallow water tables being indicative of waterlogging conditions conducive to denitrification in southland the predicted water level depth fig 2 is predominantly determined by the distribution of unconsolidated quaternary sediments and areas of fractured rock areas of clastic sediment are characterised by a shallow water table blue green areas whereas areas of consolidated rock are characterised by a deep water table red areas the depth to the water table is considered to be shallow across most of the southland region and is less than 5 m beneath the main groundwater systems 2 3 assignment of redox status the grouping class used for lda is the groundwater redox status which must be assigned prior to the development of the model the principles and method used for the assignment of redox status are presented in mcmahon and chapelle 2008 in summary a series of microbially mediated redox reactions naturally occur in groundwater systems which successively use o2 no3 mn iv fe iii so4 and co2 as electron acceptors there is a decrease in energy available to the microbes from each successive electron acceptor so they are utilised in the above order in cases where the system is in equilibrium however the reaction process is not strictly linear and there can be considerable overlap between adjacent processes in the redox sequence the redox reaction succession provides a framework for assigning groundwater redox status according to the presence of electron acceptors and the resulting reaction products mcmahon and chapelle 2008 used sample concentrations of o2 no3 mn ii fe ii and so4 in their redox assignment framework these solutes are relatively easy and inexpensive to measure and are commonly included in regional water quality monitoring programmes the redox thresholds derived by mcmahon and chapelle 2008 for each solute were based on the typically observed concentrations found for particular redox environments in a range of united states studies the thresholds were designed to be broadly applicable to a range of different hydrologic conditions at the regional scale they noted that while sometimes application of the framework would result in a unique assignment of redox status other instances would result in a mixed or ambiguous indication of redox status this ambiguity could result from aquifer heterogeneity flow path complexity or long well screens that resulted in water sampled coming from a mixture of redox environments mcmahon and chapelle 2008 there may also be mixing induced by well pumping and some assignments of mixed where concentrations are close to the thresholds this study follows the redox assignment procedure developed by close et al 2016 which has been slightly modified from mcmahon and chapelle 2008 to suit new zealand conditions the use of no3 n to indicate reducing conditions is problematic since nitrate concentrations can depend on source contributions and travel times in addition to redox status we have therefore used mn as an additional indicator of reducing conditions and assume that elevated mn concentrations are evidence that nitrate reduction has occurred the relevant redox status proposed by mcmahon and chapelle 2008 for application to this study is therefore manganese reduction rather than nitrate reduction the use of three indicators for redox status do no3 n and mn increases confidence in the assignation and also enables the identification of samples with mixed redox status close et al 2016 observed that dissolved fe concentrations are highly correlated with mn values and mn values are less susceptible to contamination from corrosion of the iron well casing accordingly only the mn data were used for the redox assignment since they are considered to be more robust the selection of a suitable do threshold to indicate denitrification potentially has a bearing on the results of statistical model predictions the do data for this study were collected by environment southland using a galvanic do field sensor the sensor is capable of accurately estimating do to 0 5 mg with regular calibration however it is recognised that confidence in do values collected in the field decreases at low concentrations the onset of denitrification processes has been reported to occur at do concentrations ranging from 0 2 to 2 mg l and denitrification occurring at higher do concentrations may be caused by mixing of multiple flow paths at the sampling scale of well screens see mcmahon and chapelle 2008 the measurement of dissolved oxygen do at low levels is also acknowledged to be difficult in well water and the results can vary depending on the staff member and time periods that are considered accordingly the criterion for anoxic conditions proposed by mcmahon and chapelle 2008 of do 0 5 mg l has been increased to a value of 1 0 mg l scatter plots of do vs no3 n and mn confirm that this threshold is appropriate for indicating reducing groundwater in the southland region there are only two samples with a do concentration between 0 5 and 1 mg l and these samples have no3 n and mn concentrations indicative of reducing conditions we can therefore conclude that the choice of a higher do threshold is not expected to make a significant difference to our model predictions the final criteria proposed by close et al 2016 to represent reducing conditions in new zealand groundwater were concentrations of no3 n 0 5 mg l do 1 mg l dissolved mn 0 05 mg l mean concentrations for no3 n do and mn were calculated from the groundwater data for each well using samples from 2006 when a national groundwater sampling protocol was implemented to 2015 the criteria and the attributed redox states used in this study are presented in table 1 note that mcmahon and chapelle 2008 consider a wider range of redox states and use more terms for the redox states than are needed for this study the inclusion of so4 to the list of solutes was tested and found to be of negligible benefit for the purpose of redox assignment in southland as found by mcmahon and chapelle 2008 a number of well samples result in conflicting or mixed results during redox assignment such as samples having high nitrate levels combined with high mn or low do levels these samples are classed into the mixed category for the three redox state system and probably reflect a system that is not in redox equilibrium or where there are well screens that draw water from two redox environments 2 4 selection of predictive variables the purpose of deriving an lda model is to predict subsurface redox status spatially across a region to do this requires discriminating variables in the form of classified gis layers which have complete or nearly complete coverage across the region the arcgis package esri arcmap software was used to extract discriminating variable values from a number of gis layers at locations where the redox class assignment had been made the results of the lda could then be applied to these layers in order to extrapolate across the region and produce maps of predicted redox status it is acknowledged that some of the land surface parameters e g land use at the well locations may not reflect the recharge source because of lateral flow paths the uncertainty of relating samples to overlying spatial parameters increases with depth since a vertical component of flow will only predominate in the near surface and the influence of land surface recharge from the source area above the sample will decrease with depth böhlke 2002 to some extent this issue has been addressed by optimising the depth threshold for which the shallow 15 m and medium 15 75 m depth predictions may be considered valid and excluding deeper predictions following close et al 2016 nine discriminating variable sets have been selected for predicting redox states these are the qmap main rock and sub rock categories geological age land use nz soil drainage class minimum and maximum soil carbon status elevation and slope to incorporate hydrological factors these variables have been supplemented by depth to groundwater and hydraulic conductivity of the medium which are available for clastic sediments from a previous hydrological study of the southland region wilson et al 2014 hydraulic conductivity values for the paleogene to mesozoic rocks were attributed using estimates from domenico and schwartz 1998 values of depth to the water table in the clastic sediments were derived from wilson et al 2014 these data were extended to the remainder of the region by generating a composite dataset of groundwater level and stream elevation data that could be used for variogram analysis stream nodes were extracted from the niwa river environment classification rec database snelder et al 2010 rec classes 1 and 2 were removed as they are considered to be ephemeral or perched and are therefore not representative of the emergence of the water table at the surface the upstream node for each of the remaining reaches was queried from the dem and appended to the groundwater level data the composite dataset was then log transformed for variogram analysis using genstat vsn international 2011 an experimental variogram was formed in genstat using a max lag of 3500 m and a step length of 250 m a gaussian model accounted for 99 9 of the variance in the experimental variogram dataset the standard error of the observations was 0 731 the variogram parameters were entered in arcgis for kriging and the raster exponentially transformed to generate a regional scale static water level this surface was subtracted from the dem to create a map of depth to groundwater land surface recharge data are also available for the main aquifers from wilson et al 2014 however it was considered too difficult to extend this dataset to cover the whole region since these values were derived for clastic sediments and much of the region is underlain by hard rock the land surface recharge dataset has therefore not been used at the regional scale but has been included at a sub regional level to assess its discriminating potential the geological variables included in the regional model are sourced from qmap a national geodatabase based on data collected at 1 50 000 scale and presented at 1 250 000 scale qmap represents geological units as a pragmatic combination of lithology and chronology with an intention to add information without cluttering the map presentation rattenbury and heron 1997 greater detail is provided by qmap for quaternary deposits because of their widespread surface distribution these are mapped according to their marine oxygen isotope stages martinson et al 1987 to differentiate them by age and are further differentiated according to constituent materials and broad depositional environments such as alluvial fan scree and beach the qmap variables that have been used are categories for main rock dominant lithology and sub rock subordinate lithologies as well as the geological age of the formation the land use variable was sourced from the new zealand land use map newsome et al 2013 topography variables included the elevation and slope which were sourced from an 8 m dem geographx 2012 soil data were taken from a combination of the 1 63 360 scale fundamental soil layers newsome et al 2008 and the 1 50 000 scale s map database lilburne et al 2012 both collected and compiled at 1 50 000 scale soil variables used were soil carbon minimum and maximum and drainage class new zealand soil order the highest level in the new zealand soil classification hewitt 2010 was not found to be a discriminating variable in this study and has therefore been excluded from the analysis some of the discriminating variables have numerical values such as soil carbon elevation and slope soil carbon percent organic matter content of the top 20 cm min and max is provided as the lower and upper thresholds respectively of the relevant soil carbon classes the soil drainage class values range from 1 being very poorly drained to 5 being well drained newsome et al 2008 elevation slope and depth to the water table have continuous data distributions these were assigned into ranges bins to ensure that all of the discriminating variables were compatible with a vector gis model development and to simplify spatial processing the raw values for all four of the continuous datasets and the hydraulic conductivity values were skewed these data have been log transformed before setting bin thresholds using the jenks natural breaks method jenks 1963 ten groups or bins were created for the five variables and the thresholds are given in table 2 the bin numbers were used as the parameter values for development of the lda models other variables were categorical and required that numerical values be assigned to each class or category the assignments for the geological rock type and soil order were carried out by giving a low score to categories that tended to be inert or retain oxidising conditions and giving a higher score to categories that were more reactive with respect to oxygen and nitrate and thus promote more reducing conditions the scales ranged between 1 and 5 for example geological units such as gravels were given a score of 1 whereas peats were given a score of 5 table 3 the land use classification variable provided a very rough measure of potential nitrate inputs with high nitrate inputs associated with cropland and high productivity grassland given scores of 1 and 2 respectively compared to low nitrate inputs associated with forest and wetlands given scores of 4 and 5 respectively mountainous terrain i e land with a land use capability class of 7 or 8 or land with a slope 19 degrees was excluded from the models and maps a final gis layer 14 520 km2 was created for a dataset representing each unique physical combination of discriminating variables in the southland region this layer was queried at well locations to create an input dataset for discriminant analysis 2 5 linear discriminant analysis discriminant analysis seeks to statistically distinguish between two or more groups using a set of discriminating variables representing physical characteristics for which the groups are expected to differ discriminant analysis attempts to do this by forming one or more linear combinations of the discriminating variables these discriminant functions are of the form d i d 0 d i 1 z 1 d i 2 z 2 d i p z p where di is the score on the discriminant function i the d s are scaling or weighting coefficients and the z s are the standardised values of the p discriminant variables used in the analysis the functions are formed in such a way as to maximise the separation of the groups while minimising the variation within the groups once a combination of variables is found which provides satisfactory discrimination for cases samples with known group memberships a set of classification functions can be derived which enables the classification of new cases with unknown memberships the procedure for classification uses a separate linear combination of the discriminating variables for each group these produce a probability of membership in the respective group and the case is assigned to the group with the highest probability for the prediction of redox status the group categories used are the redox class and their prediction is dependent on the discriminating variables which are in this case gis layers of different physical characteristics of the regional environment the discriminant analysis was performed using systat 13 1 systat 2010 initially all of the discriminating variables were used and then the least significant using the f statistic measure of sample variances discriminant variables were successively removed this process was continued until the discriminating success classified correct decreased and all discriminating variables had f 1 a more detailed description of discriminant analysis is given in tabachnick and fidell 2013 discriminant functions for each depth and redox state were initially developed using a random selection of 67 of the well data and then tested on the remaining 33 of the data to test the robustness of the models results from the discriminant analyses using the full dataset were used to extrapolate across the southland region this was done by applying each discriminant function to each unique combination of physical variables and assigning it the redox status with the highest probability the resulting redox predictions were then imported into gis for generating maps 2 6 depth intervals the southland datasets were initially separated into three arbitrary depth classes shallow 25 m medium 25 100 m and deep 100 m and a discriminant analysis was carried out separately for each class wilson et al 2016 suitable depth thresholds were then established by assessing the predictive success of the lda at different depth intervals this process was started by determining the optimum shallow depth threshold and working downwards to determine thresholds for medium and then deep well samples the criteria used to determine the optimal threshold for each depth class are a high percentage of successful predictions and a balance between accurately predicted oxidised and reduced categories the optimal thresholds for successful predictions tend to coincide with a change in the variables used for discrimination as determined by the f statistic the optimisation process showed that the variables used are consistent for ranges of depths however at the point where the optimal depth is found there is a change in the combination of variables used for example the shallow threshold was determined to be 15 m and the geological age and water table depth scores were not discriminating variables within this range at greater depths the hydraulic conductivity values were not found to be a discriminating variable the final thresholds used for lda are shallow 15 m medium 15 75 m deep 75 m 2 7 sub regional analysis a sub region of southland was selected to test the scale dependence of the lda model the area chosen is 2005 km2 14 of the full dataset area and includes the makarewa waihopai lower mataura and edendale groundwater zones this area is predominantly composed of clastic sediment and shows the most variability in redox status in the region the selection of this area also gives the opportunity to test the utility of land surface recharge as a discriminating variable since data are only available for clastic sediments wilson et al 2014 to do this the land surface recharge values were log transformed and binned into 10 classes using the jenks natural breaks method and included in the parameter dataset for discriminant analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 redox assignment redox classes were assigned for groundwater at 843 well sites in the southland region the sample sources were 50 in the shallow depth class 45 in the medium depth class 15 75 m and only 5 in the deep class table 4 the majority of samples were oxidised 71 with 11 being classified as mixed and 18 representative of reducing conditions the percentage of reducing samples increased with depth which is consistent with observations from the united states mcmahon and chapelle 2008 in the southland region the presence of reduced groundwater in the deeper samples is likely to be the result of water interaction with neogene lignite deposits which underlie quaternary clastic gravels throughout much of the region the percentage of mixed well samples did not change significantly between depth classes the distribution of the assigned redox status for the southland region is shown in fig 1 most wells are drilled to intercept the clastic gravel material on the alluvial plains which constitute the main productive groundwater resource a few wells intercept fractured jurassic sandstone and medium to deep depths and these are mostly located in the catlins area in the far eastern part of the region oxidised conditions predominate in the region particularly in the northern alluvial basins and also along the terraces associated with the major southwards flowing river systems the majority of reducing well samples are situated in the vicinity of outcropping neogene or older lignite and coal deposits or quaternary peat deposits near the coast the spatial distribution of mixed category samples does not appear to follow a clear geological pattern these samples are expected to either represent a groundwater system that is not in a state of redox equilibrium or are sourced from wells with screens that draw from two redox zones 3 2 sample size assessment there are only 41 samples in total from the deep well category and such a small sample size suggests that the results of lda for deep well samples may not be representative the minimum sample size required for a level of confidence can be tested by applying central limit theory if the well samples are assumed to be a random selection from the total population of discriminant variable values an assumption which is also made for the lda this assumption is not exactly correct since wells in southland tend to be drilled in clastic sediments in order to achieve the highest well productivity nonetheless by assuming random sampling an estimate can be made of the minimum number of samples required to be representative of the wider region to do this the number of samples required to give a value that is within half a variable category e with 95 confidence has been determined this test was conducted for each depth and redox status combination and the results are shown in table 5 the variables which require the most samples are the continuous datasets which require binning the category with the greatest sample variance overall is the geological age which requires at least 150 samples for most depths and redox classes however this variable was not found to be a strong discriminator in any of the depth classes as determined by the f statistic f 0 2 1 8 variables with f values less than 2 5 were found to have little influence on the predictive success of the discriminant functions it can be seen that the samples from deep wells fail the confidence test for the number of samples required for deep samples in the oxic and mixed categories and barely pass for the reduced category the deeper samples have therefore been removed from further analysis 3 3 discriminant analysis maps of predicted redox status derived from the classification functions are shown in fig 3 the overall distribution of redox states remains fairly consistent between shallow and medium depths however the predicted area of reducing conditions is much greater at medium depths and the area of mixed redox conditions is more homogenised these results indicate that groundwater in southland generally becomes more reducing with depth however 3 5 of the area is predicted by the lda model to have oxidising underlying reducing conditions a comparison between the sample redox status and discriminating variable scores at these locations gives no clear indication why this would be the case the most likely explanation for this discrepancy is that the discriminating parameters for predicting redox status at shallow and medium depths are not the same for example slope and depth to water are discriminating variables for medium but not shallow depth predictions whereas the reverse is true for sub rock as summary of the discriminant function redox predictions for the southland region compared to the well redox assignment is given in table 6 the models predict that groundwater is reducing in 23 of the region at shallow depths and 37 of the region at medium depths for mixed redox conditions the estimates are 20 and 11 of shallow and medium depths respectively the proportion of oxic groundwater predicted by the models is considerably lower than that of the samples this difference is expected since wells tend to be drilled in areas of higher productivity and higher quality oxic groundwater which introduces a bias to the available empirical data sets a measure of the discriminating power of each variable in the predictive model is expressed by its f statistic value table 5 the soil drainage variable was found to be the most strongly discriminating parameter for all depth classes f 4 9 15 7 followed by elevation the next most discriminating variables are sub rock for shallow depths and the depth to the water table for medium depths the coefficients derived by lda for each classification function are listed in table 7 variables with f values 1 were removed from the classification dataset and are represented by null values most of the variables were used in the lda for both shallow and medium depths the only discriminating variable not used in the shallow predictive model is hydraulic conductivity shallow redox predictions are most influenced by land use and soil related parameters the influence of the near surface variables representing soil and land use is diminished in the medium depth predictive model variables with greater discriminating power higher f values in table 7 show a relationship between their discriminant function coefficient and redox state the best example of this is the soil drainage class which shows a progressive increase in the coefficient from slow draining reduced conditions to well drained oxidised conditions for both shallow and deep samples similarly the sub rock coefficient increases from oxidised to reduced states for shallow wells reflecting an association between redox state and lithology however some coefficients do not show clear associations with redox status despite having being considered a discriminating variable f 2 5 an example of this is the elevation variable for shallow wells f 10 2 which has the potential to distinguish reduced from oxic conditions but indicates an inability to correctly classify mixed conditions all three geological variables have less influence on the predictive power of the discriminant functions than expected the only instance where a geological variable has been clearly identified as a discriminating variable is the sub rock parameter for shallow samples f 7 9 this suggests a limitation of the qmap database which lacks the detailed spatial variability provided by the soils databases for example each quaternary gravel unit consists of multiple facies as evidenced in the lithological descriptions in the sub rock category however the distribution and relative abundance of each lithology within the unit is unknown since multiple facies are aggregated into mappable units this was done to suit the intended scale of the geological maps but also because the predominant hydrogeology consists of rapidly deposited alluvial gravel sequences which are extremely difficult to separate into distinct facies this simplification at the geological unit scale greatly reduces the discriminating power of the available geological data in the discriminant functions geological age has little discriminating power in the analysis because the presence of electron donors depends more on the depositional setting of the stratigraphy rather than its age for example much of the southland region is covered in quaternary sediments which are predominantly comprised of glacial outwash gravels within inland areas and these deposits contain few electron donors regardless of their age conversely sediments in coastal areas can be of a similar age to the inland glacial outwash gravels but consist of marine sediments with pyrite or wetland deposits with organic carbon which provide the electron donors required for denitrification as a consequence parameters which have the ability to distinguish low energy depositional environments e g soil drainage have more discriminating power than age for predicting subsurface reducing conditions the lda method predicts that only 23 of the southland region has the reducing conditions required for denitrification to occur at higher elevations oxic conditions are predicted to be widespread and we can conclude that denitrification will have little effect on water quality however reducing conditions predominate in lower elevation areas particularly on the coastal plains which are an area of widespread groundwater discharge to sensitive aquatic environments these areas are characterised by poorly drained soils low permeability sediments and low land slopes physical traits which promote low hydraulic gradients and less dynamic subsurface hydrology the prevalence of these characteristics on the coastal plains indicates that the potential benefit of denitrification for naturally mitigating nitrate leaching in these areas could be substantial the hydrological significance of this result is that water quality management could benefit greatly by focussing on the effect that widespread artificial drainage systems have on the nitrate load to coastal streams and estuaries subsurface drains can cause flow pathways to bypass denitrifying environments böhlke 2002 thereby lessening the potential benefit to water quality provided by the presence of subsurface denitrification 3 4 predictive accuracy the percentage of samples correctly predicted by the redox status models are shown in table 8 the discriminant models were re tested by re calibration on a randomly selected portion of the training dataset 67 and also on the remaining 33 of the dataset the test data the change in the predictive success between using the full model and either of the test datasets was only 1 6 1 2 overall which indicates that the models are robust however a larger dataset does greatly improve the predictive success of the model this is evident in the comparison between shallow oxic conditions 235 samples 90 success and shallow reduced conditions 81 samples 40 success an overall predictive success of 59 or more could be achieved with 6 7 discriminating variables f values 2 5 made little difference to the predictive success of the model 4 change the discriminating variables common to both shallow and medium datasets were soil drainage class elevation sub rock c max and slope despite the improvements made to the discriminating variable datasets compared to previous studies close et al 2016 the models have only correctly predicted redox status for 65 and 59 for shallow and medium depth samples respectively we would expect the predictive success to decrease with depth since there is increased uncertainty of the recharge source for deeper samples and there are also fewer samples available for training the lda model optimisation of the sample depth thresholds increased the overall predictive success of the discriminant functions by 5 for the shallow samples 15 m depth but did not significantly improve the success rate for the much thicker and more diverse medium depth range 15 75 m depth wilks lambda values a measure of the residual discrimination have been calculated for the discriminant functions the results are 0 76 and 0 80 for shallow and medium depths respectively and indicate that the variables used are only mildly effective at discriminating between redox classes substantive improvement to the predictive success of the models would therefore require more detailed predictive variable datasets e g at the geological facies scale or additional datasets that are specifically collected for discrimination of redox status recent research by rosecrans et al 2017 demonstrates that predictive success could also be increased by including a flow path component in the lda however a regional scale groundwater flow model of the southland region is not currently available 3 5 sub regional analysis the question of what scale is suitable for redox predictions using the lda method was raised by close et al 2016 to have confidence in the results of statistical methods used to predict redox status we expect that the observation sample dataset would represent a wide range of combinations of the predictive variables furthermore it is likely that some parameters will be more scale dependant than others and the significance of their dependence will depend on their discriminating contribution to the lda the scale dependence of a number of physical variables was tested by gurdak et al 2017 who concluded that nitrate concentrations were sensitive to both the scale of the model domain and the contributing variables gurdack et al 2017 found that the variables do soil thickness and farm fertilizer nitrogen source were scale invariant while many of the transport variables showed some scale dependence for this study we have assumed that do is a scale invariant factor since do has been used as a criterion for assigning the redox status to samples the scale dependant factors in our study are assumed to consist of all the predictive variables land use geology soil etc since these are used in the lda to extend the redox status observed at sample locations to a larger area the scale dependence of these parameters is a function of both their discriminating power and the number of samples required to provide confidence in the model predictions parameters which require fewer samples are expected to be less scale dependent and these are the soil properties geology land use and elevation for the southland region table 5 the effect that the model domain scale on the predictive success was tested by applying the discriminant models to a sub regional dataset while this produces a smaller dataset to train the lda the samples used to derive the discriminant function coefficients are likely to be more representative of local conditions and intuitively should improve predictive success a 2000 km2 test model domain was chosen which displayed a mixture of redox conditions the data from this region was used to derive new discriminant functions based on the regional scale discriminating variable dataset land surface recharge was included as an additional hydrological variable because of its availability for this sub region however land surface recharge was not found to be a discriminating parameter for shallow and medium depths of the sub regional dataset f 1 the predicted redox state for the original and revised discriminant models is shown fig 4 for shallow well samples the general distribution of redox status remains similar between the two models although the local scale dataset predicts a greater area of oxic and mixed redox states the percentages of samples correctly predicted by the original and revised models are shown in table 9 the sub regional dataset shows an improvement in the predictive success of the discriminant models for mixed and reduced conditions however the sample size assessment has shown that there are insufficient samples in these redox categories for the predictions to be reliable while predictions for oxic conditions have been found to be reliable by the sample size assessment the sub regional model has not improved the predictive success of the models we can conclude from this study that the most important scale consideration for redox status prediction using lda is to ensure there is a sufficiently large number of samples to represent a wide range of combinations of the most discriminating variables it is therefore advantageous to apply lda to an area which is larger than that of immediate interest because a larger area potentially provides additional combinations of variables which can increase confidence in the predictions a caveat to this conclusion is that a larger area could potentially introduce different driving forces for determining redox status for example the inclusion of marine sediments in a regional redox assessment may introduce inorganic electron donors supporting autotrophic denitrification to a region where heterotrophic denitrification dominates however the effect of additional redox drivers on the model results could be tested by applying the lda to sub regions of the model domain where such differences are expected the results for both shallow and medium depth datasets using the original regional scale and revised sub regional scale model domains are shown in table 10 the revised model for shallow samples 136 wells shows a shift in the predicted redox state towards proportions that are similar to those obtained for the well assignment conversely the results for medium depth samples 114 wells using the revised discriminant model are less similar to the well assignment values than the original model a comparison of the number of samples used in the sub regional dataset and the minimum required sample size table 5 indicates that the sample size is likely to be too small to have confidence in the discriminant model predictions the sample size fails the confidence test for all redox states using the age slope and hydraulic conductivity variables however these parameters do not have much discriminating power the mixed redox state fails the confidence test for two key discriminating variables soil drainage class and elevation and the reduced redox state fails for elevation while there are sufficient samples to have confidence in the sub regional model predictions for oxic conditions we conclude there are insufficient sample data to have confidence in the model results overall 3 6 comparison with previous studies in new zealand table 11 shows the predictive success of the southland discriminant functions compared to those of the canterbury and waikato regions developed in close et al 2016 the success of the southland model is comparable to that of the waikato region modifications of the variables and depth thresholds used have only slightly improved the predictive success of the discriminant functions for the southland region optimising the depth thresholds has improved the predictive success of the southland discriminant models from 54 to 60 for shallow and 42 to 59 for medium sample categories however the improved models were still not as successful as those originally developed for the canterbury area most likely due to the large sample dataset available for that region 4 conclusions the benefit of applying a statistical approach to predict redox status is twofold firstly the approach enables predictions of denitrification potential to be made in areas where few samples are available in southland the majority of groundwater quality samples are located in the inland alluvial aquifers where land use is most intensive due to free draining soils conversely the aquatic ecosystems which are most vulnerable to nitrate pollution occur along the coastal plains where land is artificially drained to make it productive these coastal areas have insufficient groundwater samples to carry out vulnerability mapping without a means of spatial prediction using lda or an alternative statistical method however lda is a data driven method and relies on a large dataset representing a wide range of discriminating variable combinations for good predictive success and to have confidence in those predictions when considering application of lda in a region an assessment needs to be made as to whether there is adequate sample data available to be able to have confidence in the model predictions to make predictions at a sub regional scale it is therefore recommended that a regional scale discriminant model be developed first this enables a sample size assessment to be carried out first to determine if there are sufficient samples in the region to train the discriminant functions the predictive success of statistical models can be improved by targeted sampling in areas where combinations of the key discriminating variables are absent in this study the classification functions were found to be dependent on just 6 7 key discriminating variables as determined by the f statistic soil drainage class and elevation were found to be the most discriminating parameters regardless of depth the influence of the remaining variables depended on the sample depth threshold used although sub rock c max and slope were discriminating parameters for both shallow and medium depths some parameters that were expected to be influential soil type hydraulic conductivity land surface recharge were not found to be discriminating at all although this can be explained by their being closely correlated with more discriminating datasets e g hydraulic conductivity is expected to be correlated with sub rock the second perhaps more significant benefit of the lda approach is the insight provided for understanding the causative physical conditions associated with denitrification our study has predicted that reducing conditions will occur in groundwaters at low elevations beneath poorly drained soils additional indicators for subsurface denitrification are a high carbon content of the soil a shallow water table and clastic sediments deposited in low energy environments e g mudstone or peat the implication of these conclusions for land and water management in new zealand and potentially in other parts of the world is that reducing conditions can be expected on coastal plains where artificial drainage is required to make the land productive for farming barkle et al 2017 the utility of natural attenuation capacity located in these settings therefore relies on finding an optimal balance between land drainage for agricultural production and hydrological bypassing of denitrifying zones that is likely to occur as a result of installation of artificial drainage

7577,hydraulic geometry hg has long enabled daily discharge estimates flood risk monitoring and water resource and habitat assessments among other applications at many stations hg amhg is a newly discovered form of hg with an evolving understanding amhg holds that there are temporally and spatially invariant congruent depth width velocity and discharge values that are shared by all stations of a river furthermore these river wide congruent hydraulics have been shown to link at a station hg ahg in space contrary to previous expectation of ahg as spatially unpredictable to date amhg has only been thoroughly examined on six rivers and its congruent hydraulics are not well understood to address the limited understanding of amhg we calculated amhg for 191 rivers in the united states using usgs field measured data from over 1900 gauging stations these rivers represent nearly all geologic and climatic settings found in the continental u s and allow for a robust assessment of amhg across scales over 60 of rivers were found to have amhg with strong explanatory power to predict ahg across space defined as r2 0 6 118 191 rivers we also found that derived congruent hydraulics bear little relation to their observed time varying counterparts and the strength of amhg did not correlate with any available observed or congruent hydraulic parameters we also found that amhg is expressed at all fluvial scales in this study some statistically significant spatial clusters of rivers with strong and weak amhg were identified but further research is needed to identify why these clusters exist thus this first widespread empirical investigation of amhg leads us to conclude that amhg is indeed a widely prevalent natural fluvial phenomenon and we have identified linkages between known fluvial parameters and amhg our work should give confidence to future researchers seeking to perform the necessary detailed hydraulic analysis of amhg keywords hydraulic geometry at many stations hydraulic geometry fluvial geomorphology congruent hydraulics 1 introduction rivers are essential for many human and ecosystem functions and researchers have long been interested in the form and process of rivers in particular fluvial geomorphologists have used the concept of hydraulic geometry to understand the relationships between discharge and channel geometry for decades leopold and maddock 1953 enabling advances in many fields that aim to monitor and better understand rivers hydraulic geometry augmented development of rating curves already used by agencies throughout the world to relate river stage and discharge and these resultant gauging stations have become essential for monitoring water resources and flood risks this further understanding of hydraulic geometry has allowed agencies such as the united states geological survey usgs to provide daily discharge data for rivers throughout the us in addition hydrologic modeling also uses hydraulic geometry to calculate runoff routing times after large precipitation events and parametrize subgrid channels for streamflow simulation e g paik and kumar 2004 neal et al 2012 and hydraulic geometry has also been utilized to assess paleo flow conditions tinkler and pengelly 1995 larson and lamb 2016 river restoration efforts also rely on hydraulic geometry as an easy to observe metric which can be related to other common fisheries management indices that are difficult to observe lamouroux and souchon 2002 mosley 1982 rosenfeld et al 2007 the study of hydraulic geometry was launched by leopold and maddock in 1953 when they identified three power law equations that related discharge q through a given station of a river with the flow width w mean depth d and mean velocity v of that station they coined these equations eqs 1 3 as at a station hydraulic geometry ahg 1 w aq b 2 d cq f 3 v kq m the coefficients a c and k and exponents b f and m are empirical parameters obtained by calibrating repeated field measurements of width depth and velocity with discharge in log log space ahg is only valid for in bank flows and out of bank flows exhibit distinct shifts in the rating curve that ahg power laws are unable to describe gleason 2015 similarly leopold and maddock proposed downstream hydraulic geometry dhg which relates discharge with river width depth and velocity for stations along a river in the downstream direction for a given flow recurrence frequency they found the relationship between these dhg parameters to take on the same power law form as ahg and used the same nomenclature as eqs 1 3 to describe dhg though the coefficients and exponents in eqs 1 3 represent different fluvial properties between the two forms of hydraulic geometry following leopold and maddock s 1953 paper ahg became an increasingly popular research topic many studies sought to verify the empirical relationships across a range of physiographic settings while others aimed to discover the theoretical basis that explained the empirical observations through empirical analysis park 1977 and rhodes 1977 1978 1987 separately found that ahg exponents are not similar among rivers in similar physiographic settings leaving the question of what physical parameters determine the exponents of ahg unanswered despite objections made to the use of power law equations to describe the observed ahg relationships richards 1973 a definitive theoretical explanation for ahg was provided by ferguson 1986 through the derivation of ahg for different channel geometries using flow resistance equations attempts have been made to derive explicit formulations for the ahg coefficients and exponents and dingman 2007 showed that both the coefficients and exponents can be determined given a flow resistance equation and channel geometry a priori unlike the theoretical basis for ahg no such definitive explanation has been found for dhg resulting in the continued use of empirical data in order to identify factors affecting dhg gleason 2015 calibrating the coefficients and exponents of the ahg and dhg equations requires data specific to discrete river stations limiting the applicability of ahg and dhg to river stations for which these data have been gathered this limitation along with ferguson s 1986 work led to the conclusion that ahg is fundamentally site specific and unrelated through space phillips 1990 dingman 2007 found that coefficients and exponents are related but his first principles analysis holds only at a single station gleason and smith 2014 however discovered a spatial relationship between the ahg coefficients and exponents they termed at many stations hydraulic geometry amhg this finding seemingly contradicts the assumption that these parameters are spatially independent and site specific and states that the ahg coefficient may be determined from the ahg exponent and vice versa thus dingman s 2007 important at a station conclusions cannot predict why multiple stations should have a spatially predictable variation in coefficients and exponents amhg was first introduced as a log linear relationship between a river s ahg coefficients and exponents a and b c and f k and m effectively halving the number of unknown ahg parameters from six to three if amhg were known gleason and smith 2014 gleason and wang 2015 advanced the understanding of amhg when they showed that multiple ahg curves representing different stations on the same river reliably converge to congruent hydraulic quantities when plotted on the same axes coined congruent discharge qc width wc depth dc and velocity vc and they argued that amhg exists as a consequence of this convergence further confirmed by shen et al 2016 gleason and wang argued that the values of the congruent hydraulics are represented by the spatial mode of the time mean for each of these station values and as a result concluded that the strength r2 of amhg was a geomorphic index indicating the degree of convergence of ahg curves shen et al 2016 built upon this work and stated that the similar time mean condition was a sufficient but not necessary condition for amhg leaving open the question of whether or not amhg is a mathematical construct or geomorphic phenomenon finally gleason and wang proposed pint as a topological index indicating the percentage of rating curves intersecting within the range of observed hydraulic quantities they argued that this can indicate the strength of amhg a priori but this hypothesis has never been tested on a wide range of rivers amhg s most prominent application to date has been in remote sensing of river discharge bonnema et al 2016 durand et al 2016 gleason and smith 2014 gleason et al 2014 despite a lack of understanding regarding the physical meaning of amhg and in particular the meaning of the congruent discharge amhg s importance has been demonstrated through its influence on reliable discharge estimation it has been shown that the success of the amhg discharge estimation algorithm strongly relates to whether the congruent discharge is within the range of a river s observed discharge gleason and wang 2015 though the likelihood of this occurrence is unknown these latest developments push amhg toward maturity but large scale testing of the ideas discussed above has not been performed although hydraulic congruence has been shown to exist in theory and from limited datasets the physical hydraulic quantities represented by congruent hydraulics are not currently understood and little research has focused on uncovering their meaning furthermore to date the full width depth and velocity amhg has been robustly examined on only six rivers gleason and smith 2014 amhg has also been demonstrated on 57 other rivers by shen et al 2016 using usgs gauge data though these data were employed without a rigorous verification of the phenomenon additionally fluvial geomorphic or climatic factors that influence the formation of amhg remain poorly understood and possible spatial patterns in amhg have not been identified to these ends we here compile the largest dataset ever used to test the full suite of width depth and velocity amhg in order to address unanswered questions regarding the driving factors of amhg we first calculate amhg for 191 rivers and then analyze spatial patterns and geomorphic climatic controls in these data our work thus parallels that of earlier hydraulic geometry researchers seeking to understand ahg across spatial and climactic scales e g park 1977 richards 1973 rhodes 1977 1978 1987 we then assess previous assumptions conclusions about amhg including the relation of congruent hydraulics to observed hydraulics and critically whether or not the full suite of amhg is observed beyond the six rivers for which it has been previously demonstrated the paper concludes with discussion of the implications of our findings on the application of amhg to a wide range of fluvial problems 2 methods we relied on field measured quantities of width velocity and discharge provided by the usgs to assess amhg the usgs maintains numerous gauging stations across the us and each one of these requires periodic measurements to assess shifts in the rating curve due to sediment scour deposition or other changes to channel geometry these data are provided free to the public by the usgs and two forms of data are available the stage recorded by the gauge and its corresponding computed discharge and the raw measurements of width depth velocity and discharge used to determine the rating curve we rely on these latter data in this paper as gauge reported discharges are typically less accurate than in situ measured discharge and as velocity and width are typically not reported along with the stage the usgs provides a data retrieval package written for the open source r software program for ease of interface with its databases of measured hydraulic quantities https owi usgs gov r information regarding station number name latitude longitude hydrologic unit code and available measured quantities were retrieved from the usgs archives https waterservices usgs gov using a modified version of the r package this allowed us access to measurements made at all usgs stations across the us the next step was to determine which rivers had enough stations from which to derive an amhg since amhg is a spatial phenomenon multiple stations on the same river are needed and we determined that a minimum of six stations were required to assess amhg this falls short of a traditional statistically significant number of stations on which to test amhg but greatly increased the amount of available data furthermore only stations that had at least 20 measurements of river width depth velocity and discharge within a 20 year period were used in order to reduce the impacts of the natural changes to channel geometry over time and ensure that each ahg curve was built from a reasonable amount of data gleason and smith 2014 phillips 1990 ran et al 2012 text files containing measured depth width velocity and discharge data were downloaded from the usgs website for all rivers that met these specified criteria using the r script we then manually filtered these data to ensure station data duplicates had not been retrieved for rivers containing parts of the same name e g root river and bitterroot river the hydrologic unit code of each station was used in order to distinguish between different rivers with the same name as e g dozens of streams named mill creek exist across the us after the above search and filtering were performed a total of 191 rivers were found to have at least 6 gauging stations with a minimum of 20 measurements of river width depth velocity and discharge over a 20 year period analysis of this data allowed us to increase the number of rivers for which amhg has been robustly tested by a factor of more than thirty from 6 to 191 first we calculated the ahg coefficients and exponents for each station using the width velocity and discharge data downloaded from the usgs website we used hydraulic mean depth hereafter depth discharge divided by the product of width and velocity rather than measured depth for this process to derive ahg we fit a linear least squares regression between discharge and each of width depth and velocity in log log space stations that had a b exponent value less than 0 02 were then removed as these low b rivers have widths that vary little with discharge and have been found to exhibit weak amhg gleason et al 2014 amhg was determined following gleason and smith 2014 by fitting a linear regression through a semi log plot of ahg coefficients and exponents for each station along each river the strength of the width depth and velocity amhg was then determined as the goodness of fit r2 of this regression through each of the log linear plots log a b log c f and log k m rivers showing a strong amhg presence were selected for further analysis we extracted the congruent width wc depth dc and velocity vc values from the least squares regression of amhg 4 logw c width amhg intercept width amhg slope the congruent depth and velocity were determined in a parallel manner using their respective intercepts and slopes the congruent discharge qc was calculated as the inverse of the depth amhg slope following gleason and wang 2015 5 logq c 1 depth amhg slope these mathematical definitions of congruent hydraulic quantities prevent a more mechanistic understanding of their origin however these definitions are convenient for the present analysis and allow us to make the tests herein without relying on unavailable data for slope and flow resistance that would be needed for deeper understanding per dingman 2007 further analysis revealed that the width and velocity amhg while often as strong as depth amhg often yield congruent hydraulic parameters e g wc and vc well outside the range of observed values see sections 3 and 4 thus we use the depth qc as representative of the congruent discharge for all three variants finally spatial analyses were conducted using arcgis v10 5 an anselin local moran s i cluster and outlier analysis was performed for all 191 rivers in order to determine areas in the us which had statistically significant p value 05 clusters of rivers with high and low amhg values based on the cluster analysis results regions in the us were identified as having overall strong or weak amhg presence and possible explanations for the observed results are considered below additionally the implications of geologic and climatic settings for amhg are discussed to further the understanding of the congruent parameters discharge width depth and velocity spatial patterns for these variables were examined for rivers that exhibited strong amhg following the above procedure using the global moran s i test we tested for spatial autocorrelation of the congruent parameters and amhg strength for all 191 rivers 3 results the 191 rivers in this study encompass a range of geologic and climatic settings in the us allowing for widespread analysis of amhg and its associated congruent parameters the average reported discharge of all rivers in this study was 415 m3 s and the average peak discharge was 2060 m3 s covering a wide range of rivers in the us fig 1 the mean depth width and velocity of the rivers in this dataset are 2 9 m 112 m and 0 62 m s respectively amhg was calculated for all 191 rivers and those with a depth amhg r2 greater than 0 6 were considered to exhibit a strong amhg presence depth amhg was chosen as representative of amhg for several reasons depth is an important fluvial quantity and the depth velocity relationship in particular was shown by dingman 2007 to give rise to ahg when imposed on channel geometry in addition the depth amhg has less extreme values across our dataset fig 2 and we thus assume that these extreme values of amhg are the result of the sensitive log log fits of amhg and outliers within the data as discussed later finally shen et al 2016 showed in their analysis of over 50 rivers that the depth amhg is almost always the strongest even when width and velocity amhg are poor of the 191 rivers for which amhg was calculated 118 were found to have a depth amhg r2 greater than 0 6 providing evidence for amhg as a widespread fluvial phenomenon additionally these 118 rivers are distributed throughout the us confirming its existence on rivers in various geologic and climatic environments fig 3 this study represents the first time amhg has been calculated and analyzed for such a large range of rivers and can therefore provide new insights into the drivers of amhg and factors that affect its strength gleason and wang 2015 showed that a congruent discharge exists for each of the width depth and velocity amhg these three congruent discharge values they argued correspond to congruent width depth and velocity values and together each pair i e congruent discharge and congruent width represents the point of intersection of rating curves that defines amhg however given the effects of conservation of mass on the unity of ahg coefficients and exponents it may be expected that these three separate congruent discharges in fact represent a single driving qc it is difficult to assess whether these three separate congruent discharges exist or whether there is a single congruent discharge for all quantities fig 2 shows that the depth amhg is quite stable and predictable producing congruent depths and discharges within the range of observed values that correlate with their hydraulic counterparts however the width and velocity amhg produce results with many more outliers and so assessing qc is difficult as it is problematic to determine which outliers are true artifacts of the data and which faithfully represent the congruent hydraulic quantities if we limit the comparison of qc to only those realistic values assuming qc corresponds to a physical flow falling between 1 m3 s and 10 000 m3 s we find that there is a 41 3 difference relative rmse between the velocity and depth qc values and a 139 7 difference between the depth and width qc values reasons for these discrepancies are discussed below and we have used the depth qc for the remaining analysis the congruent hydraulic parameters were also analyzed for rivers with strong amhg to determine their relationship to their observed hydraulic counterparts it was found that the median of each of the congruent parameters qc 343 m3 s dc 3 38 m vc 1 78 m s wc 135 m was higher than the median of the observed parameters q 156 m3 s d 2 16 m v 0 62 m s w 93 m as seen in fig 2 overall vc and wc have many more outliers than qc and dc which results in dissimilar average values to the observed hydraulic counterparts this also highlights the sensitivity to the semi log fits of amhg small changes in a given intercept can manifest as extreme values of congruent hydraulics that would be rare or not possible for a given river we sought correlations between common fluvial parameters and indices to investigate potential driving factors of amhg for rivers with a strong amhg presence using all 191 rivers to make this test no correlation was found between amhg strength and qc and similarly no correlations were found to exist between the strength of amhg and the other congruent hydraulic parameters width depth velocity or with the average values of discharge width depth and velocity we also found no correlation between the number of stations used to calculate amhg and amhg strength taken together these results suggest that amhg is not restricted to rivers of a particular scale or to rivers with a certain amount of available data the physical meaning of qc and the other congruent hydraulic parameters remains poorly understood gleason and wang 2015 proposed that the spatial modes of time mean quantities serves as the congruent hydraulic variable in their argument that amhg was a mathematical construct they concluded that the congruent values must be the spatial mode of time mean quantities if the average discharge and average width are similar along the stations of a river to test this hypothesis we sought correlations between the calculated congruent hydraulics and the spatial modes of time mean quantities the spatial modes of time mean quantities were found by first taking the average of the logged measurements for each station for example if a river had eight stations then eight separate averages would be found for each q w d v the mean values for each hydraulic quantity were then rounded to the nearest tenth of a unit in log space m m s or m3 s the mode of these rounded averages was the final value used to represent the spatial mode of time mean quantities our results found no correlation between the congruent values and their corresponding spatial mode of time mean quantities in this our results agree with shen et al 2016 who suggested that the similar time mean condition for amhg was sufficient but not necessary in addition we investigated the relationships between congruent and observed hydraulics to begin to uncover more about the physical meaning of these congruent parameters a slight positive trend r 0 51 is observed between the congruent discharge and the average discharge as well as between the congruent depth and the average depth r 0 54 after removal of two extreme congruent width outliers a weak positive trend r 0 35 is observed between the congruent width and the average width two extreme congruent velocity outliers were also removed in order to determine if a relationship exists between the congruent velocity and average velocity however no trend is observed fig 4 based on the comparison between the congruent parameters and the observed parameters the results suggest that the congruent discharge depth and width values are much more closely related to their observed counterparts than the velocity parameters to determine if any spatial patterns exist for the 191 rivers a cluster analysis was performed to identify statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low amhg r2 values corresponding to strong and weak amhg respectively the western edge of the rocky mountains was determined to have a statistically significant p values 05 cluster of fourteen rivers with weak amhg a total of five and eleven rivers along the northwest and southeast coasts respectively were identified as having statistically significant p values 05 clusters of strong amhg fig 5 this analysis suggests that climatic factors may indeed affect amhg strength a cluster analysis was also performed to determine if the congruent hydraulic parameters are influenced by physiographic or climatic factors this analysis was restricted to rivers with strong amhg and revealed no spatial patterns in wc dc vc or qc additionally we tested for spatial autocorrelation of amhg strength and the congruent parameters wc dc vc qc and found all to be randomly dispersed we then normalized qc and dc by q and also found these to be randomly dispersed finally an important application of amhg is its use to estimate river discharge from remotely sensed imagery e g durand et al 2016 as discussed in gleason and wang 2015 amhg leads to successful discharge estimation if qc is within the range of observed discharge it is therefore important to understand if there are rivers with strong amhg but with a qc outside the range of observed discharge and determine the frequency of this occurrence to better understand expected discharge accuracy a priori rivers with strong amhg presence r2 0 6 118 191 rivers and weak amhg presence r2 0 6 73 191 rivers were investigated separately over 77 91 118 of rivers with strong amhg had a value of qc that fell within the range of observed discharges conversely only 30 22 73 rivers of rivers with weak amhg had qc values within the range of observed discharges fig 6 gleason and wang 2015 hypothesized that pint the percentage of rating curves intersecting within the observed discharge range can predict the strength of amhg and our results thus confirm their findings 4 discussion amhg is a recently discovered fluvial phenomenon that has been empirically observed but remains theoretically immature prior to this study robust amhg analysis on the full suite of hydraulic parameters had been performed on only six rivers globally gleason and smith 2014 gleason and wang 2015 the newly curated dataset presented in this study has enabled the calculation of the full width depth and velocity amhg for 191 rivers in the continental us representing the first widespread thorough verification of amhg rivers in this study cover a variety of geologic and climatic regions as well as diverse hydraulic geometries and properties discharge width depth and velocity the large geographic and hydraulic range allows us to verify the prevalence of amhg and for the first time perform analysis into its driving factors we can verify amhg s existence as a widespread fluvial phenomenon as over 60 118 191 of all rivers in this study exhibit strong depth amhg the 118 rivers with strong amhg span the entire us providing evidence that amhg is observed for a range of physiographic and climatic settings similar to previous work we find the depth amhg to be more stable than the width or velocity amhg we also sought to further understand congruent hydraulics the slight positive trend r 0 51 observed between q and qc indicates that generally qc increases as q increases though q cannot provide a reliable prediction of qc r2 0 26 in addition gleason and wang 2015 suggested that qc must represent the mode of time mean discharge through space which we do not support as necessary as no such trends were found to exist based on analysis of the 118 rivers with strong amhg these findings may be affected by the tendency of the usgs to take measurements during very high and very low flow events though the extent to which this influences the results is untested the correlation between q and qc in conjunction with the finding that the relation between qc and the observed discharge range greatly impacts the strength of amhg suggests that the physical hydraulic quantity which qc represents is related to the natural flow of the river a positive trend is also observed between d and dc r 0 54 as well as between w and wc r 0 35 further suggesting that observed hydraulic quantities have some bearing on their congruent counterparts other unidentified factors however must also influence the interaction between these parameters our findings emphasize the need to uncover all factors influencing amhg including the important physical controls of slope and flow resistance which were not available for this study thus while congruent hydraulics are a necessary facet of amhg why rivers should exhibit these congruent hydraulics is a further open question we sought predictive variables and indices that can predict the strength of amhg a priori as knowing this strength prior to making measurements has a direct bearing on the application of amhg no direct correlation was found between qc and amhg strength this finding suggests that amhg is not a phenomenon restricted to a particular scale of river similarly no correlation was found between amhg strength and the remaining hydraulic and congruent parameters w d v and wc dc vc we can therefore conclude that amhg is a phenomenon that has equal predictive power across fluvial scales to investigate the potential influence of non hydraulic factors on amhg spatial analysis was performed to determine if physiographic or climatic factors affect its strength initial spatial analysis of the 191 rivers reveals that the western side of the rocky mountains and a few rivers in the midwestern us have statistically significant spatial clusters of rivers with weak amhg in contrast the northwest and southeast coasts have significant clusters of rivers with strong amhg to date the potential correlation between amhg strength and various climactic hydrologic factors has not been explored but the findings of our research indicate that these merit further investigation our results do not suggest the existence of a single qc shared by all amhg variants however the sensitive logged fits of our data may have a significant effect on this conclusion thus amhg is frequently observed and is a robust phenomenon across scales but the resultant congruent hydraulics are difficult to interpret for instance only the depth amhg produces congruent hydraulics with obvious correlation to observed river flows making it difficult to test hypotheses on the number of congruent discharges or characterize the congruent hydraulics beyond the simple summaries presented here as an example qc is calculated from the slope of the best fit coefficient vs exponent relationship and we can track the sensitivity of qc to changes in coefficients and exponents via eq 6 note that in eq 6b we assume that slope is negative per gleason and wang 2015 6a slope def r σ exp σ coeff 6b q c def 10 1 slope 6c q c 10 1 r σ exp σ coeff thus a change in the slope of amhg can lead to dramatic changes in qc per eq 6b a slope of 0 3 produces a qc of 2154 m3 s while a slope of 0 2 produces a qc of 100 000 m3 s the likelihood of such a slope difference is difficult to predict given that it is a function of the ratio of the variance of coefficients and exponents and that each coefficient is geomorphologically a function of its corresponding exponent dingman 2007 but it is evident that it is quite sensitive to variations in the data particularly outliers as can be seen from eq 4 the intercepts of the best fit lines determine the congruent width depth and velocity eq 4 also indicates that there is a direct linear relationship between the log of the congruent quantity and the intercept the direct linear relationship in log space causes small changes in log space to result in exponential changes when brought out of log space thus congruent widths depths and velocities are exponentially sensitive to changes in their respective amhg intercepts this agrees with the findings of shen et al 2016 who also found that the depth amhg was more stable than the other forms of amhg the variations in stability among the width depth and velocity amhg raises the question as to what strong amhg entails we assume that a strong depth amhg is sufficient for the label of strong amhg which does not account for all three variants when attempting to discover more about the fundamental nature of congruent hydraulics future work must be mindful of the congruent hydraulics sensitivity to small changes in their intercepts going forward the issue of sensitivity could be avoided by using a formulation for amhg that does not first calculate slope and intercept but rather fits congruent hydraulics directly the physical hydraulic quantity to which qc corresponds has yet to be uncovered but it is now clear that the relation between qc and observed discharge has a primary influence on the strength of amhg the results of this study have shown through separate analysis of rivers with strong and weak amhg that amhg strength strongly predicts whether or not qc is within a river s observed discharge range this is as previously suspected rivers with strong amhg are much more likely to have a qc value within the range of observed discharges e g these rivers have a high pint since qc is defined as the discharge at which all rating curves intersect gleason and wang 2015 a qc outside of the observed discharge indicates that this intersection happens in a hydraulic parameter space usually at a much higher discharge that is never observed in the river this marks an interesting case and we have shown here that some 23 27 118 of the rivers in this study have a strong amhg and such a qc but these rivers are in the minority this finding is important as gleason and wang 2015 showed that applying amhg to estimate discharge cannot be successful in this situation thus we expect that about a quarter of us rivers with strong amhg are unsuitable for discharge estimation however upon further exploration of the significance of qc in relation to the range of observed discharge we found that the 27 rivers which exhibit strong amhg but have a qc value outside the range of observed discharge have an average b exponent value of 0 15 and a median b value of 0 14 these values are notably lower when compared to an average b value of 0 19 and a median b value of 0 18 for the 91 rivers with strong amhg and qc within the observed discharge range the distribution of b values can be seen in fig 7 for the four combinations of strong weak amhg and qc within outside the observed q range fig 7c shows that for rivers with strong amhg but a qc value outside the observed q range the majority of b values trend toward the low b range rivers in this category strong amhg and qc value outside the observed q range can therefore be considered low b eq 6 shows that a qc of great magnitude is mathematically produced even when b values are highly variable but all low as is the case for the 27 rivers with strong amhg but qc outside the observed q range the fact that a large qc results from low b rivers corroborates our observations that frequently qc qmax when amhg is strong but qc is not within observed q limits these results further bolster the finding that amhg discharge estimation is not suitable for low b rivers gleason et al 2014 and also lead us to conclude that amhg is unlikely to exist in artificially constrained rivers as restricted width variability often indicates imposed control but could also indicate a highly topographically constrained morphology width variability with respect to discharge can be approximated a priori as low b stations will have a much lower coefficient of variation of time varying widths as compared to nearby stations durand et al 2016 therefore the ability to estimate width variability allows for this exception to strong amhg to be identified prior to attempted application of amhg the findings presented here are the result of data gathered solely from usgs gauging stations this data source may introduce a bias in the data as these gauging stations are often placed at locations with large variability in depth rantz et al 1982 and at stable single channel sites such as near permanent structures e g bridges which can affect the width of a river allen and pavelsky 2015 and our data show maximum b values less than 0 6 fig 7 to address potential data bias data sets that do not rely on gauging stations are required due to the large scale nature of this study the use of gauging stations was required to gain access to decades of data from thousands of stations in a variety of settings although this represents the first widespread study of amhg it is restricted to rivers in the continental us and therefore a global assessment of amhg is still needed to understand global trends and spatial factors it has been shown that certain regions of the us generally exhibit weaker amhg and research in other areas of the world is needed for confirmation despite these limitations amhg has been proven to be a commonly occurring phenomenon justifying future research into its driving factors and congruent parameters 5 conclusions amhg is a newly discovered fluvial phenomenon which remains poorly understood despite its implications on conventional ahg and its impact on discharge estimation in ungauged basins robust amhg analysis has previously been limited to six rivers throughout the world limiting the confidence in its widespread existence this research verifies that amhg is in fact a commonly occurring phenomenon and characterizes the congruent hydraulics unique to amhg we have also shown that amhg is not solely defined as a mathematical construct as previously suggested and confirmed earlier work that the depth amhg is the most stable variant of amhg future work should consider rivers outside the us in order to expand the data set for which amhg is calculated and analyzed as amhg is investigated on rivers globally potential physiographic and climatic influences on amhg will continue to be revealed additionally the importance of qc has been demonstrated but much remains unknown about this congruent parameter and therefore further investigation is required to understand its influence on amhg and its physical meaning in addition to the finding of amhg as a naturally occurring fluvial phenomenon and its implications on the understanding of hydraulic geometry our results suggest that amhg should be reliably observed and thus applied opening up a range of potential applications for regions with ungauged rivers acknowledgements the finding of appropriate usgs gauging stations and gauge data was greatly helped through the use of the data retrieval package developed by the usgs for use in the r software program s lawrence dingman and one anonymous reviewer provided review comments which greatly improved the paper this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
7577,hydraulic geometry hg has long enabled daily discharge estimates flood risk monitoring and water resource and habitat assessments among other applications at many stations hg amhg is a newly discovered form of hg with an evolving understanding amhg holds that there are temporally and spatially invariant congruent depth width velocity and discharge values that are shared by all stations of a river furthermore these river wide congruent hydraulics have been shown to link at a station hg ahg in space contrary to previous expectation of ahg as spatially unpredictable to date amhg has only been thoroughly examined on six rivers and its congruent hydraulics are not well understood to address the limited understanding of amhg we calculated amhg for 191 rivers in the united states using usgs field measured data from over 1900 gauging stations these rivers represent nearly all geologic and climatic settings found in the continental u s and allow for a robust assessment of amhg across scales over 60 of rivers were found to have amhg with strong explanatory power to predict ahg across space defined as r2 0 6 118 191 rivers we also found that derived congruent hydraulics bear little relation to their observed time varying counterparts and the strength of amhg did not correlate with any available observed or congruent hydraulic parameters we also found that amhg is expressed at all fluvial scales in this study some statistically significant spatial clusters of rivers with strong and weak amhg were identified but further research is needed to identify why these clusters exist thus this first widespread empirical investigation of amhg leads us to conclude that amhg is indeed a widely prevalent natural fluvial phenomenon and we have identified linkages between known fluvial parameters and amhg our work should give confidence to future researchers seeking to perform the necessary detailed hydraulic analysis of amhg keywords hydraulic geometry at many stations hydraulic geometry fluvial geomorphology congruent hydraulics 1 introduction rivers are essential for many human and ecosystem functions and researchers have long been interested in the form and process of rivers in particular fluvial geomorphologists have used the concept of hydraulic geometry to understand the relationships between discharge and channel geometry for decades leopold and maddock 1953 enabling advances in many fields that aim to monitor and better understand rivers hydraulic geometry augmented development of rating curves already used by agencies throughout the world to relate river stage and discharge and these resultant gauging stations have become essential for monitoring water resources and flood risks this further understanding of hydraulic geometry has allowed agencies such as the united states geological survey usgs to provide daily discharge data for rivers throughout the us in addition hydrologic modeling also uses hydraulic geometry to calculate runoff routing times after large precipitation events and parametrize subgrid channels for streamflow simulation e g paik and kumar 2004 neal et al 2012 and hydraulic geometry has also been utilized to assess paleo flow conditions tinkler and pengelly 1995 larson and lamb 2016 river restoration efforts also rely on hydraulic geometry as an easy to observe metric which can be related to other common fisheries management indices that are difficult to observe lamouroux and souchon 2002 mosley 1982 rosenfeld et al 2007 the study of hydraulic geometry was launched by leopold and maddock in 1953 when they identified three power law equations that related discharge q through a given station of a river with the flow width w mean depth d and mean velocity v of that station they coined these equations eqs 1 3 as at a station hydraulic geometry ahg 1 w aq b 2 d cq f 3 v kq m the coefficients a c and k and exponents b f and m are empirical parameters obtained by calibrating repeated field measurements of width depth and velocity with discharge in log log space ahg is only valid for in bank flows and out of bank flows exhibit distinct shifts in the rating curve that ahg power laws are unable to describe gleason 2015 similarly leopold and maddock proposed downstream hydraulic geometry dhg which relates discharge with river width depth and velocity for stations along a river in the downstream direction for a given flow recurrence frequency they found the relationship between these dhg parameters to take on the same power law form as ahg and used the same nomenclature as eqs 1 3 to describe dhg though the coefficients and exponents in eqs 1 3 represent different fluvial properties between the two forms of hydraulic geometry following leopold and maddock s 1953 paper ahg became an increasingly popular research topic many studies sought to verify the empirical relationships across a range of physiographic settings while others aimed to discover the theoretical basis that explained the empirical observations through empirical analysis park 1977 and rhodes 1977 1978 1987 separately found that ahg exponents are not similar among rivers in similar physiographic settings leaving the question of what physical parameters determine the exponents of ahg unanswered despite objections made to the use of power law equations to describe the observed ahg relationships richards 1973 a definitive theoretical explanation for ahg was provided by ferguson 1986 through the derivation of ahg for different channel geometries using flow resistance equations attempts have been made to derive explicit formulations for the ahg coefficients and exponents and dingman 2007 showed that both the coefficients and exponents can be determined given a flow resistance equation and channel geometry a priori unlike the theoretical basis for ahg no such definitive explanation has been found for dhg resulting in the continued use of empirical data in order to identify factors affecting dhg gleason 2015 calibrating the coefficients and exponents of the ahg and dhg equations requires data specific to discrete river stations limiting the applicability of ahg and dhg to river stations for which these data have been gathered this limitation along with ferguson s 1986 work led to the conclusion that ahg is fundamentally site specific and unrelated through space phillips 1990 dingman 2007 found that coefficients and exponents are related but his first principles analysis holds only at a single station gleason and smith 2014 however discovered a spatial relationship between the ahg coefficients and exponents they termed at many stations hydraulic geometry amhg this finding seemingly contradicts the assumption that these parameters are spatially independent and site specific and states that the ahg coefficient may be determined from the ahg exponent and vice versa thus dingman s 2007 important at a station conclusions cannot predict why multiple stations should have a spatially predictable variation in coefficients and exponents amhg was first introduced as a log linear relationship between a river s ahg coefficients and exponents a and b c and f k and m effectively halving the number of unknown ahg parameters from six to three if amhg were known gleason and smith 2014 gleason and wang 2015 advanced the understanding of amhg when they showed that multiple ahg curves representing different stations on the same river reliably converge to congruent hydraulic quantities when plotted on the same axes coined congruent discharge qc width wc depth dc and velocity vc and they argued that amhg exists as a consequence of this convergence further confirmed by shen et al 2016 gleason and wang argued that the values of the congruent hydraulics are represented by the spatial mode of the time mean for each of these station values and as a result concluded that the strength r2 of amhg was a geomorphic index indicating the degree of convergence of ahg curves shen et al 2016 built upon this work and stated that the similar time mean condition was a sufficient but not necessary condition for amhg leaving open the question of whether or not amhg is a mathematical construct or geomorphic phenomenon finally gleason and wang proposed pint as a topological index indicating the percentage of rating curves intersecting within the range of observed hydraulic quantities they argued that this can indicate the strength of amhg a priori but this hypothesis has never been tested on a wide range of rivers amhg s most prominent application to date has been in remote sensing of river discharge bonnema et al 2016 durand et al 2016 gleason and smith 2014 gleason et al 2014 despite a lack of understanding regarding the physical meaning of amhg and in particular the meaning of the congruent discharge amhg s importance has been demonstrated through its influence on reliable discharge estimation it has been shown that the success of the amhg discharge estimation algorithm strongly relates to whether the congruent discharge is within the range of a river s observed discharge gleason and wang 2015 though the likelihood of this occurrence is unknown these latest developments push amhg toward maturity but large scale testing of the ideas discussed above has not been performed although hydraulic congruence has been shown to exist in theory and from limited datasets the physical hydraulic quantities represented by congruent hydraulics are not currently understood and little research has focused on uncovering their meaning furthermore to date the full width depth and velocity amhg has been robustly examined on only six rivers gleason and smith 2014 amhg has also been demonstrated on 57 other rivers by shen et al 2016 using usgs gauge data though these data were employed without a rigorous verification of the phenomenon additionally fluvial geomorphic or climatic factors that influence the formation of amhg remain poorly understood and possible spatial patterns in amhg have not been identified to these ends we here compile the largest dataset ever used to test the full suite of width depth and velocity amhg in order to address unanswered questions regarding the driving factors of amhg we first calculate amhg for 191 rivers and then analyze spatial patterns and geomorphic climatic controls in these data our work thus parallels that of earlier hydraulic geometry researchers seeking to understand ahg across spatial and climactic scales e g park 1977 richards 1973 rhodes 1977 1978 1987 we then assess previous assumptions conclusions about amhg including the relation of congruent hydraulics to observed hydraulics and critically whether or not the full suite of amhg is observed beyond the six rivers for which it has been previously demonstrated the paper concludes with discussion of the implications of our findings on the application of amhg to a wide range of fluvial problems 2 methods we relied on field measured quantities of width velocity and discharge provided by the usgs to assess amhg the usgs maintains numerous gauging stations across the us and each one of these requires periodic measurements to assess shifts in the rating curve due to sediment scour deposition or other changes to channel geometry these data are provided free to the public by the usgs and two forms of data are available the stage recorded by the gauge and its corresponding computed discharge and the raw measurements of width depth velocity and discharge used to determine the rating curve we rely on these latter data in this paper as gauge reported discharges are typically less accurate than in situ measured discharge and as velocity and width are typically not reported along with the stage the usgs provides a data retrieval package written for the open source r software program for ease of interface with its databases of measured hydraulic quantities https owi usgs gov r information regarding station number name latitude longitude hydrologic unit code and available measured quantities were retrieved from the usgs archives https waterservices usgs gov using a modified version of the r package this allowed us access to measurements made at all usgs stations across the us the next step was to determine which rivers had enough stations from which to derive an amhg since amhg is a spatial phenomenon multiple stations on the same river are needed and we determined that a minimum of six stations were required to assess amhg this falls short of a traditional statistically significant number of stations on which to test amhg but greatly increased the amount of available data furthermore only stations that had at least 20 measurements of river width depth velocity and discharge within a 20 year period were used in order to reduce the impacts of the natural changes to channel geometry over time and ensure that each ahg curve was built from a reasonable amount of data gleason and smith 2014 phillips 1990 ran et al 2012 text files containing measured depth width velocity and discharge data were downloaded from the usgs website for all rivers that met these specified criteria using the r script we then manually filtered these data to ensure station data duplicates had not been retrieved for rivers containing parts of the same name e g root river and bitterroot river the hydrologic unit code of each station was used in order to distinguish between different rivers with the same name as e g dozens of streams named mill creek exist across the us after the above search and filtering were performed a total of 191 rivers were found to have at least 6 gauging stations with a minimum of 20 measurements of river width depth velocity and discharge over a 20 year period analysis of this data allowed us to increase the number of rivers for which amhg has been robustly tested by a factor of more than thirty from 6 to 191 first we calculated the ahg coefficients and exponents for each station using the width velocity and discharge data downloaded from the usgs website we used hydraulic mean depth hereafter depth discharge divided by the product of width and velocity rather than measured depth for this process to derive ahg we fit a linear least squares regression between discharge and each of width depth and velocity in log log space stations that had a b exponent value less than 0 02 were then removed as these low b rivers have widths that vary little with discharge and have been found to exhibit weak amhg gleason et al 2014 amhg was determined following gleason and smith 2014 by fitting a linear regression through a semi log plot of ahg coefficients and exponents for each station along each river the strength of the width depth and velocity amhg was then determined as the goodness of fit r2 of this regression through each of the log linear plots log a b log c f and log k m rivers showing a strong amhg presence were selected for further analysis we extracted the congruent width wc depth dc and velocity vc values from the least squares regression of amhg 4 logw c width amhg intercept width amhg slope the congruent depth and velocity were determined in a parallel manner using their respective intercepts and slopes the congruent discharge qc was calculated as the inverse of the depth amhg slope following gleason and wang 2015 5 logq c 1 depth amhg slope these mathematical definitions of congruent hydraulic quantities prevent a more mechanistic understanding of their origin however these definitions are convenient for the present analysis and allow us to make the tests herein without relying on unavailable data for slope and flow resistance that would be needed for deeper understanding per dingman 2007 further analysis revealed that the width and velocity amhg while often as strong as depth amhg often yield congruent hydraulic parameters e g wc and vc well outside the range of observed values see sections 3 and 4 thus we use the depth qc as representative of the congruent discharge for all three variants finally spatial analyses were conducted using arcgis v10 5 an anselin local moran s i cluster and outlier analysis was performed for all 191 rivers in order to determine areas in the us which had statistically significant p value 05 clusters of rivers with high and low amhg values based on the cluster analysis results regions in the us were identified as having overall strong or weak amhg presence and possible explanations for the observed results are considered below additionally the implications of geologic and climatic settings for amhg are discussed to further the understanding of the congruent parameters discharge width depth and velocity spatial patterns for these variables were examined for rivers that exhibited strong amhg following the above procedure using the global moran s i test we tested for spatial autocorrelation of the congruent parameters and amhg strength for all 191 rivers 3 results the 191 rivers in this study encompass a range of geologic and climatic settings in the us allowing for widespread analysis of amhg and its associated congruent parameters the average reported discharge of all rivers in this study was 415 m3 s and the average peak discharge was 2060 m3 s covering a wide range of rivers in the us fig 1 the mean depth width and velocity of the rivers in this dataset are 2 9 m 112 m and 0 62 m s respectively amhg was calculated for all 191 rivers and those with a depth amhg r2 greater than 0 6 were considered to exhibit a strong amhg presence depth amhg was chosen as representative of amhg for several reasons depth is an important fluvial quantity and the depth velocity relationship in particular was shown by dingman 2007 to give rise to ahg when imposed on channel geometry in addition the depth amhg has less extreme values across our dataset fig 2 and we thus assume that these extreme values of amhg are the result of the sensitive log log fits of amhg and outliers within the data as discussed later finally shen et al 2016 showed in their analysis of over 50 rivers that the depth amhg is almost always the strongest even when width and velocity amhg are poor of the 191 rivers for which amhg was calculated 118 were found to have a depth amhg r2 greater than 0 6 providing evidence for amhg as a widespread fluvial phenomenon additionally these 118 rivers are distributed throughout the us confirming its existence on rivers in various geologic and climatic environments fig 3 this study represents the first time amhg has been calculated and analyzed for such a large range of rivers and can therefore provide new insights into the drivers of amhg and factors that affect its strength gleason and wang 2015 showed that a congruent discharge exists for each of the width depth and velocity amhg these three congruent discharge values they argued correspond to congruent width depth and velocity values and together each pair i e congruent discharge and congruent width represents the point of intersection of rating curves that defines amhg however given the effects of conservation of mass on the unity of ahg coefficients and exponents it may be expected that these three separate congruent discharges in fact represent a single driving qc it is difficult to assess whether these three separate congruent discharges exist or whether there is a single congruent discharge for all quantities fig 2 shows that the depth amhg is quite stable and predictable producing congruent depths and discharges within the range of observed values that correlate with their hydraulic counterparts however the width and velocity amhg produce results with many more outliers and so assessing qc is difficult as it is problematic to determine which outliers are true artifacts of the data and which faithfully represent the congruent hydraulic quantities if we limit the comparison of qc to only those realistic values assuming qc corresponds to a physical flow falling between 1 m3 s and 10 000 m3 s we find that there is a 41 3 difference relative rmse between the velocity and depth qc values and a 139 7 difference between the depth and width qc values reasons for these discrepancies are discussed below and we have used the depth qc for the remaining analysis the congruent hydraulic parameters were also analyzed for rivers with strong amhg to determine their relationship to their observed hydraulic counterparts it was found that the median of each of the congruent parameters qc 343 m3 s dc 3 38 m vc 1 78 m s wc 135 m was higher than the median of the observed parameters q 156 m3 s d 2 16 m v 0 62 m s w 93 m as seen in fig 2 overall vc and wc have many more outliers than qc and dc which results in dissimilar average values to the observed hydraulic counterparts this also highlights the sensitivity to the semi log fits of amhg small changes in a given intercept can manifest as extreme values of congruent hydraulics that would be rare or not possible for a given river we sought correlations between common fluvial parameters and indices to investigate potential driving factors of amhg for rivers with a strong amhg presence using all 191 rivers to make this test no correlation was found between amhg strength and qc and similarly no correlations were found to exist between the strength of amhg and the other congruent hydraulic parameters width depth velocity or with the average values of discharge width depth and velocity we also found no correlation between the number of stations used to calculate amhg and amhg strength taken together these results suggest that amhg is not restricted to rivers of a particular scale or to rivers with a certain amount of available data the physical meaning of qc and the other congruent hydraulic parameters remains poorly understood gleason and wang 2015 proposed that the spatial modes of time mean quantities serves as the congruent hydraulic variable in their argument that amhg was a mathematical construct they concluded that the congruent values must be the spatial mode of time mean quantities if the average discharge and average width are similar along the stations of a river to test this hypothesis we sought correlations between the calculated congruent hydraulics and the spatial modes of time mean quantities the spatial modes of time mean quantities were found by first taking the average of the logged measurements for each station for example if a river had eight stations then eight separate averages would be found for each q w d v the mean values for each hydraulic quantity were then rounded to the nearest tenth of a unit in log space m m s or m3 s the mode of these rounded averages was the final value used to represent the spatial mode of time mean quantities our results found no correlation between the congruent values and their corresponding spatial mode of time mean quantities in this our results agree with shen et al 2016 who suggested that the similar time mean condition for amhg was sufficient but not necessary in addition we investigated the relationships between congruent and observed hydraulics to begin to uncover more about the physical meaning of these congruent parameters a slight positive trend r 0 51 is observed between the congruent discharge and the average discharge as well as between the congruent depth and the average depth r 0 54 after removal of two extreme congruent width outliers a weak positive trend r 0 35 is observed between the congruent width and the average width two extreme congruent velocity outliers were also removed in order to determine if a relationship exists between the congruent velocity and average velocity however no trend is observed fig 4 based on the comparison between the congruent parameters and the observed parameters the results suggest that the congruent discharge depth and width values are much more closely related to their observed counterparts than the velocity parameters to determine if any spatial patterns exist for the 191 rivers a cluster analysis was performed to identify statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low amhg r2 values corresponding to strong and weak amhg respectively the western edge of the rocky mountains was determined to have a statistically significant p values 05 cluster of fourteen rivers with weak amhg a total of five and eleven rivers along the northwest and southeast coasts respectively were identified as having statistically significant p values 05 clusters of strong amhg fig 5 this analysis suggests that climatic factors may indeed affect amhg strength a cluster analysis was also performed to determine if the congruent hydraulic parameters are influenced by physiographic or climatic factors this analysis was restricted to rivers with strong amhg and revealed no spatial patterns in wc dc vc or qc additionally we tested for spatial autocorrelation of amhg strength and the congruent parameters wc dc vc qc and found all to be randomly dispersed we then normalized qc and dc by q and also found these to be randomly dispersed finally an important application of amhg is its use to estimate river discharge from remotely sensed imagery e g durand et al 2016 as discussed in gleason and wang 2015 amhg leads to successful discharge estimation if qc is within the range of observed discharge it is therefore important to understand if there are rivers with strong amhg but with a qc outside the range of observed discharge and determine the frequency of this occurrence to better understand expected discharge accuracy a priori rivers with strong amhg presence r2 0 6 118 191 rivers and weak amhg presence r2 0 6 73 191 rivers were investigated separately over 77 91 118 of rivers with strong amhg had a value of qc that fell within the range of observed discharges conversely only 30 22 73 rivers of rivers with weak amhg had qc values within the range of observed discharges fig 6 gleason and wang 2015 hypothesized that pint the percentage of rating curves intersecting within the observed discharge range can predict the strength of amhg and our results thus confirm their findings 4 discussion amhg is a recently discovered fluvial phenomenon that has been empirically observed but remains theoretically immature prior to this study robust amhg analysis on the full suite of hydraulic parameters had been performed on only six rivers globally gleason and smith 2014 gleason and wang 2015 the newly curated dataset presented in this study has enabled the calculation of the full width depth and velocity amhg for 191 rivers in the continental us representing the first widespread thorough verification of amhg rivers in this study cover a variety of geologic and climatic regions as well as diverse hydraulic geometries and properties discharge width depth and velocity the large geographic and hydraulic range allows us to verify the prevalence of amhg and for the first time perform analysis into its driving factors we can verify amhg s existence as a widespread fluvial phenomenon as over 60 118 191 of all rivers in this study exhibit strong depth amhg the 118 rivers with strong amhg span the entire us providing evidence that amhg is observed for a range of physiographic and climatic settings similar to previous work we find the depth amhg to be more stable than the width or velocity amhg we also sought to further understand congruent hydraulics the slight positive trend r 0 51 observed between q and qc indicates that generally qc increases as q increases though q cannot provide a reliable prediction of qc r2 0 26 in addition gleason and wang 2015 suggested that qc must represent the mode of time mean discharge through space which we do not support as necessary as no such trends were found to exist based on analysis of the 118 rivers with strong amhg these findings may be affected by the tendency of the usgs to take measurements during very high and very low flow events though the extent to which this influences the results is untested the correlation between q and qc in conjunction with the finding that the relation between qc and the observed discharge range greatly impacts the strength of amhg suggests that the physical hydraulic quantity which qc represents is related to the natural flow of the river a positive trend is also observed between d and dc r 0 54 as well as between w and wc r 0 35 further suggesting that observed hydraulic quantities have some bearing on their congruent counterparts other unidentified factors however must also influence the interaction between these parameters our findings emphasize the need to uncover all factors influencing amhg including the important physical controls of slope and flow resistance which were not available for this study thus while congruent hydraulics are a necessary facet of amhg why rivers should exhibit these congruent hydraulics is a further open question we sought predictive variables and indices that can predict the strength of amhg a priori as knowing this strength prior to making measurements has a direct bearing on the application of amhg no direct correlation was found between qc and amhg strength this finding suggests that amhg is not a phenomenon restricted to a particular scale of river similarly no correlation was found between amhg strength and the remaining hydraulic and congruent parameters w d v and wc dc vc we can therefore conclude that amhg is a phenomenon that has equal predictive power across fluvial scales to investigate the potential influence of non hydraulic factors on amhg spatial analysis was performed to determine if physiographic or climatic factors affect its strength initial spatial analysis of the 191 rivers reveals that the western side of the rocky mountains and a few rivers in the midwestern us have statistically significant spatial clusters of rivers with weak amhg in contrast the northwest and southeast coasts have significant clusters of rivers with strong amhg to date the potential correlation between amhg strength and various climactic hydrologic factors has not been explored but the findings of our research indicate that these merit further investigation our results do not suggest the existence of a single qc shared by all amhg variants however the sensitive logged fits of our data may have a significant effect on this conclusion thus amhg is frequently observed and is a robust phenomenon across scales but the resultant congruent hydraulics are difficult to interpret for instance only the depth amhg produces congruent hydraulics with obvious correlation to observed river flows making it difficult to test hypotheses on the number of congruent discharges or characterize the congruent hydraulics beyond the simple summaries presented here as an example qc is calculated from the slope of the best fit coefficient vs exponent relationship and we can track the sensitivity of qc to changes in coefficients and exponents via eq 6 note that in eq 6b we assume that slope is negative per gleason and wang 2015 6a slope def r σ exp σ coeff 6b q c def 10 1 slope 6c q c 10 1 r σ exp σ coeff thus a change in the slope of amhg can lead to dramatic changes in qc per eq 6b a slope of 0 3 produces a qc of 2154 m3 s while a slope of 0 2 produces a qc of 100 000 m3 s the likelihood of such a slope difference is difficult to predict given that it is a function of the ratio of the variance of coefficients and exponents and that each coefficient is geomorphologically a function of its corresponding exponent dingman 2007 but it is evident that it is quite sensitive to variations in the data particularly outliers as can be seen from eq 4 the intercepts of the best fit lines determine the congruent width depth and velocity eq 4 also indicates that there is a direct linear relationship between the log of the congruent quantity and the intercept the direct linear relationship in log space causes small changes in log space to result in exponential changes when brought out of log space thus congruent widths depths and velocities are exponentially sensitive to changes in their respective amhg intercepts this agrees with the findings of shen et al 2016 who also found that the depth amhg was more stable than the other forms of amhg the variations in stability among the width depth and velocity amhg raises the question as to what strong amhg entails we assume that a strong depth amhg is sufficient for the label of strong amhg which does not account for all three variants when attempting to discover more about the fundamental nature of congruent hydraulics future work must be mindful of the congruent hydraulics sensitivity to small changes in their intercepts going forward the issue of sensitivity could be avoided by using a formulation for amhg that does not first calculate slope and intercept but rather fits congruent hydraulics directly the physical hydraulic quantity to which qc corresponds has yet to be uncovered but it is now clear that the relation between qc and observed discharge has a primary influence on the strength of amhg the results of this study have shown through separate analysis of rivers with strong and weak amhg that amhg strength strongly predicts whether or not qc is within a river s observed discharge range this is as previously suspected rivers with strong amhg are much more likely to have a qc value within the range of observed discharges e g these rivers have a high pint since qc is defined as the discharge at which all rating curves intersect gleason and wang 2015 a qc outside of the observed discharge indicates that this intersection happens in a hydraulic parameter space usually at a much higher discharge that is never observed in the river this marks an interesting case and we have shown here that some 23 27 118 of the rivers in this study have a strong amhg and such a qc but these rivers are in the minority this finding is important as gleason and wang 2015 showed that applying amhg to estimate discharge cannot be successful in this situation thus we expect that about a quarter of us rivers with strong amhg are unsuitable for discharge estimation however upon further exploration of the significance of qc in relation to the range of observed discharge we found that the 27 rivers which exhibit strong amhg but have a qc value outside the range of observed discharge have an average b exponent value of 0 15 and a median b value of 0 14 these values are notably lower when compared to an average b value of 0 19 and a median b value of 0 18 for the 91 rivers with strong amhg and qc within the observed discharge range the distribution of b values can be seen in fig 7 for the four combinations of strong weak amhg and qc within outside the observed q range fig 7c shows that for rivers with strong amhg but a qc value outside the observed q range the majority of b values trend toward the low b range rivers in this category strong amhg and qc value outside the observed q range can therefore be considered low b eq 6 shows that a qc of great magnitude is mathematically produced even when b values are highly variable but all low as is the case for the 27 rivers with strong amhg but qc outside the observed q range the fact that a large qc results from low b rivers corroborates our observations that frequently qc qmax when amhg is strong but qc is not within observed q limits these results further bolster the finding that amhg discharge estimation is not suitable for low b rivers gleason et al 2014 and also lead us to conclude that amhg is unlikely to exist in artificially constrained rivers as restricted width variability often indicates imposed control but could also indicate a highly topographically constrained morphology width variability with respect to discharge can be approximated a priori as low b stations will have a much lower coefficient of variation of time varying widths as compared to nearby stations durand et al 2016 therefore the ability to estimate width variability allows for this exception to strong amhg to be identified prior to attempted application of amhg the findings presented here are the result of data gathered solely from usgs gauging stations this data source may introduce a bias in the data as these gauging stations are often placed at locations with large variability in depth rantz et al 1982 and at stable single channel sites such as near permanent structures e g bridges which can affect the width of a river allen and pavelsky 2015 and our data show maximum b values less than 0 6 fig 7 to address potential data bias data sets that do not rely on gauging stations are required due to the large scale nature of this study the use of gauging stations was required to gain access to decades of data from thousands of stations in a variety of settings although this represents the first widespread study of amhg it is restricted to rivers in the continental us and therefore a global assessment of amhg is still needed to understand global trends and spatial factors it has been shown that certain regions of the us generally exhibit weaker amhg and research in other areas of the world is needed for confirmation despite these limitations amhg has been proven to be a commonly occurring phenomenon justifying future research into its driving factors and congruent parameters 5 conclusions amhg is a newly discovered fluvial phenomenon which remains poorly understood despite its implications on conventional ahg and its impact on discharge estimation in ungauged basins robust amhg analysis has previously been limited to six rivers throughout the world limiting the confidence in its widespread existence this research verifies that amhg is in fact a commonly occurring phenomenon and characterizes the congruent hydraulics unique to amhg we have also shown that amhg is not solely defined as a mathematical construct as previously suggested and confirmed earlier work that the depth amhg is the most stable variant of amhg future work should consider rivers outside the us in order to expand the data set for which amhg is calculated and analyzed as amhg is investigated on rivers globally potential physiographic and climatic influences on amhg will continue to be revealed additionally the importance of qc has been demonstrated but much remains unknown about this congruent parameter and therefore further investigation is required to understand its influence on amhg and its physical meaning in addition to the finding of amhg as a naturally occurring fluvial phenomenon and its implications on the understanding of hydraulic geometry our results suggest that amhg should be reliably observed and thus applied opening up a range of potential applications for regions with ungauged rivers acknowledgements the finding of appropriate usgs gauging stations and gauge data was greatly helped through the use of the data retrieval package developed by the usgs for use in the r software program s lawrence dingman and one anonymous reviewer provided review comments which greatly improved the paper this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
7578,the objective of this study is to comprehensively evaluate the new ensemble multi satellite precipitation dataset using the dynamic bayesian model averaging scheme emspd dbma at daily and 0 25 scales from 2001 to 2015 over the tibetan plateau tp error analysis against gauge observations revealed that emspd dbma captured the spatiotemporal pattern of daily precipitation with an acceptable correlation coefficient cc of 0 53 and a relative bias rb of 8 28 moreover emspd dbma outperformed imerg and gsmap mvk in almost all metrics in the summers of 2014 and 2015 with the lowest rb and root mean square error rmse values of 2 88 and 8 01 mm d respectively it also better reproduced the probability density function pdf in terms of daily rainfall amount and estimated moderate and heavy rainfall better than both imerg and gsmap mvk further hydrological evaluation with the coupled routing and excess storage crest model in the upper yangtze river region indicated that the emspd dbma forced simulation showed satisfying hydrological performance in terms of streamflow prediction with nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse values of 0 82 and 0 58 compared to gauge forced simulation 0 88 and 0 60 at the calibration and validation periods respectively emspd dbma also performed a greater fitness for peak flow simulation than a new multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 mswep v2 product indicating a promising prospect of hydrological utility for the ensemble satellite precipitation data this study belongs to early comprehensive evaluation of the blended multi satellite precipitation data across the tp which would be significant for improving the dbma algorithm in regions with complex terrain keywords satellite precipitation dynamic bayesian model averaging dbma scheme hydrological application the coupled routing and excess storage crest model tibetan plateau 1 introduction high quality precipitation data including amount intensity and pattern are essential to improve our understanding of atmospheric hydrological and energy cycles ranging from local regional to global scales however accurate precipitation is a great challenge in remote areas of the world particularly the tibetan plateau tp due to insufficient gauge sites and complex terrain as well as high spatial heterogeneity in precipitation ma et al 2015 there are four primary sources for obtaining precipitation including gauge weather radar satellite and atmospheric reanalysis limited surface instruments i e gauge and weather radar severely hamper knowledge of true precipitation at a vast spatial scale shen and xiong 2016 reanalysis is the output of data assimilation scheme and models which is the primary source of precipitation data in remote northern regions but poorly reflects the variability due to relatively low resolution and biases in the parameterizations of sub grid processes kidd et al 2013 satellite is capable of retrieving precipitation at a high resolution posing a significant asset for mapping precipitation globally ashouri et al 2015 hong et al 2004 hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 ushio et al 2009 global satellite based precipitation products are primarily retrieved from calibrated infrared ir passive active microwave pmw and ir plus pmw measurements hou et al 2014 an ir based algorithm is effective in identifying precipitation patterns at a high temporal resolution but the performance of an ir based estimate is less accurate due to indirect linkage between ir signals and precipitation a pmw sensor is beneficial for precipitation estimation because it is able to measure rain cloud particles more directly this however leads to low temporal sampling thus integrating ir and pmw sensors is recommended to provide high quality precipitation data at short time scales to date multi sensor satellite precipitation data from multiple sources are available to the public including tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 global satellite mapping of

persiann climate data records persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 and day 1 integrated multisatellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm mission imerg hou et al 2014 however satellite retrieval is an indirect estimation of precipitation inevitably inducing regional and temporal systematic biases and random errors tian et al 2009 xie and xiong 2011 yong et al 2015 for example underperformance of current satellite precipitation data still exists across the tp which hampers further hydrological applications gao and liu 2013 ma et al 2016 shen et al 2014 tong et al 2014a xu et al 2017 pursuing high quality precipitation data over a long term period is recognized as being of great urgent across the plateau recently an ensemble multi satellite precipitation dataset using the dynamic bayesian model averaging scheme emspd dbma was developed over the tp it was produced using the optimally weighted sums of four mainstream satellite precipitation data including tmpa 3b42rt and 3b42v7 cmorph and persiann cdr at a daily 0 25 scale from 2001 to 2015 liu et al 2017 ma et al 2017 this algorithm showed better performance than traditional ensemble methods e g simple model averaging sma and one outlier removed oor under various seasonal topographic conditions across the tp ma et al 2017 initial results confirmed that emspd dbma performed better than the individuals over the tp for 2007 2012 ma et al 2017 however some interesting questions remain unanswered 1 how does emspd dbma perform compare to ground measurements in the past 15 years over the tp 2 both imerg and gsmap mvk showed higher skill scores in terms of statistical performance than other satellite products across the plateau guo et al 2016 ma et al 2016 xu et al 2017 however what are the similarities and differences with regard to precipitation characteristics among emspd dbma imerg and gsmap mvk 3 is there any advantage for emspd dbma as compared to multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 mswep v2 a new global 3 hourly 0 25 global gridded precipitation product created by merging gauge satellite and reanalysis data which was developed by beck et al 2017 thus the purpose of this work is to address and offer solutions to the above issues the remainder of this paper is organized below section 2 introduces the study region data and methods sections 3 and 4 present comprehensive evaluation and constructive discussion conclusions and future work are summarized in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region and gauge data the tp is the highest and largest plateau in the world with an average elevation of more than 4000 m and an area of about 2 5 million km2 it is influenced by multiple climate systems which are primarily characterized by the indian monsoon in the warm season and the westerlies in the cold season yao et al 2012 due to complex topography various sub climate and surface environments exist ranging from forest to alpine grassland across the plateau fig 1 the tp also generates many large rivers including the yangtze yellow brahmaputra mekong salween and indus rivers in this study the headwater region of the yangtze river known as the zhimenda basin blue polygon in fig 1 was selected for hydrological evaluation of the ensemble precipitation data over the tp 112 automatic gauges were used for quantitative satellite precipitation estimates black dots in fig 1 which belong to the national network of 2400 gauges in mainland china the related data were obtained from the china meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn to ensure the accuracy of gauge observation all data underwent strict quality control at three levels including 1 extreme values check 2 internal consistency check and 3 spatial consistency check ren et al 2010 the quality controlled hourly data were then converted into daily data because we did not have a procedure to correct for bias in the automatic gauges observed precipitation undercatch was not considered in this study 2 2 emspd dbma data the emspd dbma data were developed by optimally merging four mainstream satellite precipitation estimates including 3b42rt 3b42v7 cmorph and persiann cdr at a daily 0 25 pixel scale for 2001 2015 over the tp during the calculation we initially proposed a dbma algorithm to optimize the weights of individuals on each day the overall framework of dbma was shown in fig 2 first the individual weights were independently fitted using the expectation maximization em algorithm at each gauge and for each day in brief the em algorithm would iterate the optimal parameter through the e or expectation step and m or maximization step until the log likelihood function was maximized the em scheme casts the maximum log likelihood problem as a missing data problem the missing data may not be actual data rather it is a latent variable that needs to be estimated mclachlan and krishnan 2007 next the weights were applied to next day s merging one training period of 40 days in the current year and two 40 day training periods of the same time from the previous two years i e 120 days in total were selected to optimize the weights at each site then the optimal weights of the individuals were interpolated to the entire plateau using the ordinary kriging ok approach lastly the blended data were calculated for each grid by weighted sums of the individuals and corresponding optimal weights over the tp details of emspd dbma can be found from ma et al 2017 2 3 multiple precipitation datasets in order to comprehensively understand the strengths and weaknesses of the emspd dbma data current high quality satellite precipitation products including imerg and gsmap mvk were selected for intercomparison a globally merged precipitation dataset mswep v2 was also used for comparison table 1 gpm provides a new generation of precipitation observations from space at 0 1 and 30 minutes resolutions in february 2014 as the successor of trmm era gpm has four levels of products based on various algorithms where imerg is aimed as a consistently calibrated global precipitation product hou et al 2014 over the tp imerg has proven to be a substitute for 3b42v7 which was the most desirable product of trmm era ma et al 2016 gsmap is originally sponsored by the japan science technology agency jst and is currently sponsored by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa this project proposed to map global precipitation with 0 1 and 1 hour resolutions ushio et al 2009 gsmap used kalman filter to update the precipitation rate after propagating the rain pixels along with atmospheric motion vectors gsmap mvk yielded a higher score than both cmorph and persiann cdr across the tp guo et al 2016 mswep is developed to provide reliable global precipitation with 3 hour and 0 25 scales from 1979 to present data sources with the highest quality were optimally merged bias adjustment for gauge undercatch and orographic effects were introduced by inferring basin mean precipitation from 13762 streamflow sites globally the long term climatic mean value was temporally downscaled first to a monthly timescale and then to daily and finally to 3 hour using the weighted average of precipitation anomalies obtained from gauge satellite and reanalysis data to yield the final ensemble the temporal pattern of mswep was controlled by weighted average of precipitation anomalies from seven datasets which included interpolation of gauge observations cpc unified and gpcc satellite cmorph gsmap mvk and 3b42rt and atmospheric reanalysis era interim and jra 55 details for mswep can be found in beck et al 2017 and version 2 has been released online at http hydrology princeton edu data hylkeb mswep v2 0 2 4

version crest 2 1 was used for hydrological evaluation of emspd dbma and mswep v2 2 5 evaluation indicators in order to quantitatively evaluate the performance of emspd dbma across the tp several statistical metrics including relative bias rb root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient cc were used in this study the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse was used to evaluate the performance of hydrological simulation specific formulas of the above indices can be found in ma et al 2016 tang et al 2016b and xue et al 2013 in addition we calculated the probability of detection pod for satellite products 1 pod h h m where h is the number of precipitation events detected by both gauge and satellite m is the number of precipitation events detected by gauge but not satellite because the current version of dbma algorithm was conducted at each grid where at least one satellite detected the true precipitation there were no false alarm rates far and missing rain volumes for the ensemble data thus the measures of far and missing rain cases were not analyzed in the data performance 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal patterns of emspd dbma the mean annual precipitation of emspd dbma was 543 mm during 2001 2015 ranging from 80 to 2324 mm across the tp spatially precipitation decreased from the southeast to the northwest fig 3 a which was consistent with the satellite products such as 3b42v7 cmorph imerg etc gao and liu 2013 ma et al 2016 tong et al 2014b as well as with gauge interpolated observations ma et al 2015 higher precipitation primarily occurred along the himalayan region with an overall value of more than 2000 mm per year in addition obvious contrast existed between the northern and southern himalayas indicating the orographic effect on mountainous precipitation fig 3a in contrast in most of the north and west where the westerlies does not prevail and the indian monsoon is relatively weaker during the warm period yao et al 2012 less precipitation was observed less than 200 mm per year over the past 15 years emspd dbma precipitation estimates have increased at a rate of 32 5 mm per decade due to inter annual variability across the tp the highest annual precipitation 614 mm occurred in 2013 and the lowest 508 mm in 2009 fig 3b before 2009 annual precipitation increased slightly with a mean rate of 2 47 mm year but it has increased significantly since 2009 with a mean rate of 6 94 mm year precipitation variability across the tp might be driven by large scale atmospheric circulation changes in response to atmospheric warming across the plateau zhang et al 2017 3 2 pixel scale statistical evaluation of emspd dbma to ensure proper error analysis of emspd dbma all evaluations were performed at the grid scale with at least one gauge available over the tp it should be noted that only the hit cases were analyzed and zero event records were excluded as precipitation events in the study overall the emspd dbma data showed a satisfying capability in estimating daily precipitation over the past 15 years with an overall cc of 0 53 for 112 national gauges over the tp fig 4 c higher cc was mainly detected in the eastern tp with abundant precipitation contributed by the indian monsoon yao et al 2012 along the himalayan region cc was lower with a mean value less than 0 45 complex terrain and heavy rainfall were pervasive across the himalayas where the geostationary infrared based retrievals geo ir were not more reliable because the orographic precipitation lacked strong convective signatures for geo ir detection yong et al 2015 and the heavy rainfall events induced by shallow orographic systems were also underestimated owing to weak ice scattering signatures shige et al 2013 therefore accurate retrieval of satellite precipitation data was challenging in this region which further influenced the blended data quality xu et al 2017 the average rb was 8 28 across the tp large overestimation primarily occurred in the south where rainfall was frequent and emspd dbma showed positive rb values fig 4a in contrast negative rb values were distributed in the center and northeast with weak rainfall detection in general emspd dbma showed an overestimation for heavy and moderate precipitation and an underestimation for light precipitation across the plateau although the dbma algorithm inferred consensus predictions by weighting the individuals the involved data s accuracy was vital for the blended result sloughter et al 2007 a positive bias was detected for heavy precipitation presumably due to an overestimation by the pmw based land algorithms for strong convective events in the warm season tian et al 2009 the rmse of the emspd dbma data increased gradually from northwest to southeast ranging from 2 88 to 9 25 mm d with an overall mean value of 6 64 mm d across the tp fig 4b rmse became worse in high mountainous and or persistent snow cover regions e g himalayas where satellite precipitation estimation was challenging bharti and singh 2015 maggioni et al 2016 mei et al 2016 yong et al 2010 2015 emspd dbma showed high pod in the past 15 years with an overall mean value of 0 92 over the tp fig 4d improving the detecting capability from space with the dbma algorithm based on the statistical metrics above the quality of emspd dbma was acceptable at the daily scale during 2001 2015 over the tp 3 3 error intercomparison between emspd dbma and other datasets 3 3 1 satellite datasets imerg and gsmap mvk since the tp s satellite precipitation data exhibits strong uncertainty in the cold season due to erroneous retrievals of snow events from space sensors hou et al 2014 maggioni et al 2016 yong et al 2015 we merely performed the data intercomparison during the summers of 2014 and 2015 to facilitate direct comparison spatial resolutions of satellite data should be consistent first the imerg and gsmap mvk data were resampled to 0 25 0 25 the same as emspd dbma note that potential errors may be introduced in the resampling table 2 shows the statistical metrics of rb rmse cc and pod for emspd dbma imerg and gsmap mvk for the summers of 2014 and 2015 overall emspd dbma performed better than the other two products with the lowest rb and rmse values of 2 88 and 8 01 mm d respectively as well as a satisfying cc value of 0 50 over the tp imerg had the largest errors with rb and rmse values of 14 25 and 8 87 mm d respectively as well as the lowest pod at 0 68 in addition emspd dbma improved rainfall detection with a pod value of 0 92 which is around 1 35 times that of imerg and 1 06 times that of gsmap mvk fig 5 showed box plots of daily statistical metrics for emspd dbma imerg and gsmap mvk where emspd dbma exhibited robust symmetry with the outliers of metrics e g rmse and pod close to the median line fig 5b lower rainfall detection accompanied with higher bias were found in imerg due to its longer box of pod fig 5d higher precipitation uncertainty existed in the gsmap mvk since the outliers of rb and cc were far from the median value fig 5a and c generally 3b42v7 was corrected using the global precipitation climatology center gpcc gauge based dataset and persiann cdr using the gauge satellite based global precipitation climatology project gpcp dataset some of the gauges have been incorporated in those datasets potentially undermining some of the results imerg and gsmap mvk are primarily satellite based data thus emspd dbma showed better performance than both imerg and gsmap mvk for most of the statistical metrics in the summers of 2014 and 2015 probability distribution functions pdfs illustrate the ability of precipitation rate occurrence and the sensitivity of precipitation estimates as a function of precipitation rate which is an important index for understanding satellite precipitation s quality chen et al 2013 tang et al 2016a over the tp emspd dbma imerg and gsmap mvk all showed similar pdf structures of daily precipitation amount fig 6 compared with gauge based trace rainfall 0 1 mm d large bias existed for the three products because the record resolution for gauge is 0 1 mm it is difficult to assess which satellite performs the best in this range when daily rainfall was less than 6 0 mm d 0 1 6 0 mm d an overestimation was detected for emspd dbma and gsmap mvk however imerg showed a satisfactory performance in this range which indicated the advantage of gpm era products in detecting light precipitation across the plateau ma et al 2016 because the predictive distribution of precipitation error was skewed a box cox transformation was performed prior to the dbma algorithm this might induce unexpected errors for emspd dbma especially for light rainfall located in the tails sloughter et al 2007 as for gsmap mvk the current algorithm propagated and applied the kalman filter only for the rainy pixels identified by the microwave radiometer which may ignore some informative signals from the light rainfall ushio et al 2009 the pdfs of the three datasets showed gamma distribution with the top point lower than 1 0 mm the primary differences between the pdfs are clear at the lower ends of bins 6 0 mm d as for moderate and heavy precipitation 6 0 mm d the emspd dbma imerg and gsmap mvk datasets showed similar pdf structures at the daily scale in the summer therefore the performance of emspd dbma in the summers of 2014 and 2015 was deemed acceptable and was even better than both imerg and gsmap mvk for moderate and heavy rainfall in the tp 3 3 2 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 mswep v2 over the tp both emspd dbma and mswep v2 show an apparent overestimation from 2001 to 2015 as compared with the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa which was produced from 2400 national gauge data in mainland china shen and xiong 2016 ma et al 2015 concluded that the average gauge undercatch of annual precipitation amounted to 27 over the tp during 1951 2010 because there was no bias correction for the cgdpa gauges some underestimation may have been induced in determining the true precipitation the mean annual precipitation for cgdpa emspd dbma and mswep v2 were 384 mm 554 mm and 1103 mm respectively during 2001 2015 over the tp fig 7 there was a slightly opposite variability for the two blended data in terms of annual precipitation from 2007 to 2010 and mswep v2 showed an opposite trend as compared to cgdpa as regard to emspd dbma the ensemble weight for each member was optimized from gauge data which might explain the similar performance between emspd dbma and cgdpa as for mswep v2 it sought to combine from various gauge satellite and reanalysis data sources around the global in addition the interpolation of gauge correction factors probably induced higher precipitation estimates across the tp beck et al 2017 as higher discrepancy existed in 2008 and 2009 for mswep v2 opposite trends were detected for the two blended products with respect to the gauge reference between 2007 and 2010 during the summer both blended products showed acceptable performances compared to gauge observations obvious overestimations for mswep v2 existed in the spring fall and winter fig 8 in all seasons the points of emspd dbma were more clustered than those of mswep v2 as compared with gauge data this indicated that emspd dbma performs better than mswep v2 for each season across the tp several factors contribute to higher values of mswep v2 across the tp 1 mswep v2 is focused on the globally gridded precipitation reconstruction and inevitably local climate and complex terrain in the plateau might result in spatiotemporal discontinuities for the long term average 2 you et al 2015 reported that most of reanalysis data e g ncep1 ncep2 era interim era 40 20century and cfsr overestimate precipitation across the tp especially in the southeast where summer convection is dominant tong et al 2014b also showed that higher biases exist in the current reanalysis data e g era interim greatly overestimates gauge observations at both annual and monthly scales in the plateau thus precipitation from reanalysis should be treated with caution for the mswep v2 production due to the complexity of the processes involved in the entire reanalysis model framework 3 mswep v2 used streamflow observations in an attempt to correct for gauge undercatch large precipitation underestimations have been reported in the hindu kush himalaya region immerzeel et al 2015 and the correction factors are indeed high for mswep v2 here beck et al 2017 the interpolation of gauge correction factors might induce higher mswep v2 data over the tp 4 few gauges were used for mswep v2 production in the tp and thus its quality is potentially degraded beck et al 2017 3 4 basin scale hydrological evaluation of emspd dbma with regard to land surface hydrological modeling errors in precipitation sampling can result in unavoidable uncertainties in streamflow simulations and predictions nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 thus emspd dbma was further analyzed to quantify its improvements and error propagations relative to observed discharge as well as mswep v2 using the crest model in the zhimenda basin blue polygon in fig 1 the crest model parameters for gauge based simulation were forced and calibrated using gauge data from january 1 2008 to december 31 2011 and then subsequently validated from january 1 2012 to december 31 2014 the simulated discharge for gauges was misleading since the gauge based network in the zhimenda basin is sparse however the simulated streamflow was within a reasonable range of observed values at both the calibration and validation periods in terms of nse with values of 0 88 and 0 60 respectively thus it was feasible to replace rain gauge forcing with precipitation by emspd dbma and mswep v2 for hydrological simulation in this basin with regard to the hydrological simulations of emspd dbma and mswep v2 their model parameters were respectively forced and calibrated in the calibration period and subsequently used for discharge simulation in the validation period the daily statistical comparisons in both calibration and validation periods showed that the discharge simulation forced by gauge data performed better skills nse 0 88 0 60 cc 0 95 0 85 than those based on emspd dbma and mswep v2 table 3 the mean nse scores for emspd dbma were 0 82 and 0 58 for the calibration and validation periods respectively moreover the emspd dbma forced model simulations performed better than mswep v2 forced simulations nse 0 21 0 11 for the calibration and validation periods respectively interestingly both emspd dbma and mswep v2 forced discharge simulations showed better performances in terms of rb with values of 4 70 13 23 and 4 29 15 69 than gauge forced results at both calibration and validation periods table 3 which was primarily caused by the cancelation of positive negative values during the calculation during the calibration period emspd dbma captured the majority of the flow peaks and fit the observed streamflow well fig 9 in the validation period the emspd dbma curve fit well with that of observations and captured most flow peaks though some peaks were underestimated e g the summer of 2014 the simulated runoff from mswep v2 showed higher bias with underestimations in warm seasons and overestimations in cold seasons higher values for mswep data were not reflected in the streamflow simulation in the crest hydrological model there are a lot of parameters including a precipitation adjustment factor which is designed to adjust the biased precipitation and then optimize the discharge simulation as for the overestimated mswep v2 data its precipitation adjustment parameter was optimized to 0 60 i e the value of mswep v2 used in the hydrological modeling was adjusted into 0 60 times of the input precipitation thus the sce ua shuffled complex evolution method developed at the university of arizona algorithm could merge the high values of mswep v2 duan et al 1993 wang et al 2011 xue et al 2013 emspd dbma showed slightly better performance than mswep v2 and its optimized precipitation adjustment factor was 0 74 as for the considerable higher streamflow in the recession drying phase of the hydrography in mswep v2 the underlying reason was that an overestimation existed at the drying period for mswep v2 because the discharge generation was simulated based on the variable infiltration capacity curve with the input precipitation data higher streamflow would be simulated from higher amount of input precipitation data overall emspd dbma showed better performance for hydrological simulation than mswep v2 further demonstrating the advantage of dbma algorithm for multi satellite precipitation fusion in high elevated regions although our study site was located at a small region of the plateau it indicated a promising prospect of hydrologic utility for emspd dbma over the tp 4 discussion emspd dbma which was developed from several primary satellite precipitation estimates using the dbma algorithm at daily and 0 25 scales for the period of 2001 2015 was comprehensively evaluated over regions of high elevation and complex topography for the first time the reliability and superiority of emspd dbma over the tp as compared to imerg gsmap mvk and mswep v2 were proven by either statistical or hydrological methods note that error analysis in this work was performed between pixel values of satellites and point values of gauges potential errors for the scale discrepancy should be specifically worked out in the next step satellite precipitation data provides new opportunities for understanding and applying remote information tang et al 2016b wang et al 2011 xue et al 2013 basin scale hydrological simulation forced by the crest model with emspd dbma yielded comparable scores to in situ observations and better results than another blended precipitation product mswep v2 however the peaks at the calibration and validation periods were not fully captured by emspd dbma in the headwaters of the yangtze river illustrating the importance of parameter calibration in the crest model to compensate for errors in satellite precipitation forcing and to improve streamflow simulation given the sparse distribution of rain gauges over the tp especially in the central and western regions emspd dbma seems to be reliable for deriving streamflow even without the need of recalibration for a long period although estimation of model parameters in high cold mountainous regions is always challenging since more parameters were involved to simulate snow accumulation and melting in the hydrological model we have to admit that the crest model used in this study did not specially consider the snow related processes potential errors might be induced in winter when snowfall is dominated in the tp emspd dbma is currently blended from 3b42rt 3b42v7 cmorph and persiann cdr at the daily scale over a long term period 2001 2015 the next update of emspd dbma will be intended to take advantage of new and improved satellite data sources for instance trmm era could be replaced by its successor gpm era gsmap mvk is also being considered as an addition to the ensemble dataset an increased scale in temporal resolution from daily to 3 hour and even to 1 hour will benefit multi satellite rainfall data fusion by improving instantaneous flood prediction in remote areas this study also shows major challenges to the algorithm of blended multi satellite precipitation dataset in regions with high mountains and snow dominated seasons for instance larger uncertainty was detected in the himalayan region for emspd dbma though this product performed better than other satellite datasets we recommend that the dbma algorithm be modified to specially consider the orographic effect on the multi satellite precipitation fusion in future studies because uncertainty primarily stems from satellite sensors yong et al 2015 efforts should be made to increase the terrain information utilized by retrieval algorithms through the use of sufficient gauge networks and necessary weather radar systems 5 conclusions this study provided a comprehensive assessment of the newly blended multi satellite precipitation data emspd dbma against gauge based observations and basin scale hydrological simulation over the tp quantitative error analysis and intercomparison were performed among emspd dbma imerg and gsmap mvk in the summers of 2014 and 2015 emspd dbma was also compared with mswep v2 for the period of 2001 2015 across the tp the primary conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the mean annual precipitation estimated by emspd dbma was 543 mm and ranged from 80 to 2324 mm over the tp it increased gradually from southeast to northwest a trend that was similar with mainstream satellite data such as 3b42v7 cmorph and imerg the yearly precipitation of emspd dbma increased slightly with a mean rate of 32 5 mm per decade during 2001 2015 2 emspd dbma has shown reliable performance in the past 15 years over the tp where its mean daily rb rmse cc and pod were 8 28 6 64 mm d 0 53 and 0 92 respectively higher error was primarily distributed in the himalayas indicating that the dbma algorithm needs to be updated in regions with high mountains and snow dominated seasons 3 compared with imerg and gsmap mvk emspd dbma performed better skill with lower rb and rmse values of 2 88 and 8 01 mm d respectively in the summers of 2014 and 2015 across the tp emspd dbma also significantly improved summer rainfall detection with a pod value of 0 92 moreover emspd dbma ideally reproduced the pdf structures of daily precipitation amounts and even better than both imerg and gsmap mvk for moderate and heavy rainfall in the plateau 4 emspd dbma showed greater cluster and better performance than mswep v2 compared to gauge based observations in each season for the periods of 2001 2015 significant overestimation occurred for mswep v2 in the spring fall and winter indicating that the blending algorithm for mswep v2 needs further upgrading in the plateau 5 emspd dbma offered great potential for basin scale hydrological modeling in remote and complex topographic regions the discharge simulation in the headwaters of yangtze river using the crest v2 1 model showed that the emspd dbma forced streamflow simulation had satisfactory nse scores of 0 80 and 0 58 at both calibration and validation periods respectively it also fit fairly well with that from the gauge based benchmark and captured most flow peaks overall the results showed that spatiotemporal characteristics were ideally captured by emspd dbma across the tp however the dbma algorithm needs upgrading especially in regions with high mountains and snow dominated periods to decrease partial systematic bias and random error for emspd dbma acknowledgments this work is financially supported by

7578,the objective of this study is to comprehensively evaluate the new ensemble multi satellite precipitation dataset using the dynamic bayesian model averaging scheme emspd dbma at daily and 0 25 scales from 2001 to 2015 over the tibetan plateau tp error analysis against gauge observations revealed that emspd dbma captured the spatiotemporal pattern of daily precipitation with an acceptable correlation coefficient cc of 0 53 and a relative bias rb of 8 28 moreover emspd dbma outperformed imerg and gsmap mvk in almost all metrics in the summers of 2014 and 2015 with the lowest rb and root mean square error rmse values of 2 88 and 8 01 mm d respectively it also better reproduced the probability density function pdf in terms of daily rainfall amount and estimated moderate and heavy rainfall better than both imerg and gsmap mvk further hydrological evaluation with the coupled routing and excess storage crest model in the upper yangtze river region indicated that the emspd dbma forced simulation showed satisfying hydrological performance in terms of streamflow prediction with nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse values of 0 82 and 0 58 compared to gauge forced simulation 0 88 and 0 60 at the calibration and validation periods respectively emspd dbma also performed a greater fitness for peak flow simulation than a new multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 mswep v2 product indicating a promising prospect of hydrological utility for the ensemble satellite precipitation data this study belongs to early comprehensive evaluation of the blended multi satellite precipitation data across the tp which would be significant for improving the dbma algorithm in regions with complex terrain keywords satellite precipitation dynamic bayesian model averaging dbma scheme hydrological application the coupled routing and excess storage crest model tibetan plateau 1 introduction high quality precipitation data including amount intensity and pattern are essential to improve our understanding of atmospheric hydrological and energy cycles ranging from local regional to global scales however accurate precipitation is a great challenge in remote areas of the world particularly the tibetan plateau tp due to insufficient gauge sites and complex terrain as well as high spatial heterogeneity in precipitation ma et al 2015 there are four primary sources for obtaining precipitation including gauge weather radar satellite and atmospheric reanalysis limited surface instruments i e gauge and weather radar severely hamper knowledge of true precipitation at a vast spatial scale shen and xiong 2016 reanalysis is the output of data assimilation scheme and models which is the primary source of precipitation data in remote northern regions but poorly reflects the variability due to relatively low resolution and biases in the parameterizations of sub grid processes kidd et al 2013 satellite is capable of retrieving precipitation at a high resolution posing a significant asset for mapping precipitation globally ashouri et al 2015 hong et al 2004 hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 ushio et al 2009 global satellite based precipitation products are primarily retrieved from calibrated infrared ir passive active microwave pmw and ir plus pmw measurements hou et al 2014 an ir based algorithm is effective in identifying precipitation patterns at a high temporal resolution but the performance of an ir based estimate is less accurate due to indirect linkage between ir signals and precipitation a pmw sensor is beneficial for precipitation estimation because it is able to measure rain cloud particles more directly this however leads to low temporal sampling thus integrating ir and pmw sensors is recommended to provide high quality precipitation data at short time scales to date multi sensor satellite precipitation data from multiple sources are available to the public including tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 global satellite mapping of precipitation moving vector with kalman filter gsmap mvk ushio et al 2009 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 persiann climate data records persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 and day 1 integrated multisatellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm mission imerg hou et al 2014 however satellite retrieval is an indirect estimation of precipitation inevitably inducing regional and temporal systematic biases and random errors tian et al 2009 xie and xiong 2011 yong et al 2015 for example underperformance of current satellite precipitation data still exists across the tp which hampers further hydrological applications gao and liu 2013 ma et al 2016 shen et al 2014 tong et al 2014a xu et al 2017 pursuing high quality precipitation data over a long term period is recognized as being of great urgent across the plateau recently an ensemble multi satellite precipitation dataset using the dynamic bayesian model averaging scheme emspd dbma was developed over the tp it was produced using the optimally weighted sums of four mainstream satellite precipitation data including tmpa 3b42rt and 3b42v7 cmorph and persiann cdr at a daily 0 25 scale from 2001 to 2015 liu et al 2017 ma et al 2017 this algorithm showed better performance than traditional ensemble methods e g simple model averaging sma and one outlier removed oor under various seasonal topographic conditions across the tp ma et al 2017 initial results confirmed that emspd dbma performed better than the individuals over the tp for 2007 2012 ma et al 2017 however some interesting questions remain unanswered 1 how does emspd dbma perform compare to ground measurements in the past 15 years over the tp 2 both imerg and gsmap mvk showed higher skill scores in terms of statistical performance than other satellite products across the plateau guo et al 2016 ma et al 2016 xu et al 2017 however what are the similarities and differences with regard to precipitation characteristics among emspd dbma imerg and gsmap mvk 3 is there any advantage for emspd dbma as compared to multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 mswep v2 a new global 3 hourly 0 25 global gridded precipitation product created by merging gauge satellite and reanalysis data which was developed by beck et al 2017 thus the purpose of this work is to address and offer solutions to the above issues the remainder of this paper is organized below section 2 introduces the study region data and methods sections 3 and 4 present comprehensive evaluation and constructive discussion conclusions and future work are summarized in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region and gauge data the tp is the highest and largest plateau in the world with an average elevation of more than 4000 m and an area of about 2 5 million km2 it is influenced by multiple climate systems which are primarily characterized by the indian monsoon in the warm season and the westerlies in the cold season yao et al 2012 due to complex topography various sub climate and surface environments exist ranging from forest to alpine grassland across the plateau fig 1 the tp also generates many large rivers including the yangtze yellow brahmaputra mekong salween and indus rivers in this study the headwater region of the yangtze river known as the zhimenda basin blue polygon in fig 1 was selected for hydrological evaluation of the ensemble precipitation data over the tp 112 automatic gauges were used for quantitative satellite precipitation estimates black dots in fig 1 which belong to the national network of 2400 gauges in mainland china the related data were obtained from the china meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn to ensure the accuracy of gauge observation all data underwent strict quality control at three levels including 1 extreme values check 2 internal consistency check and 3 spatial consistency check ren et al 2010 the quality controlled hourly data were then converted into daily data because we did not have a procedure to correct for bias in the automatic gauges observed precipitation undercatch was not considered in this study 2 2 emspd dbma data the emspd dbma data were developed by optimally merging four mainstream satellite precipitation estimates including 3b42rt 3b42v7 cmorph and persiann cdr at a daily 0 25 pixel scale for 2001 2015 over the tp during the calculation we initially proposed a dbma algorithm to optimize the weights of individuals on each day the overall framework of dbma was shown in fig 2 first the individual weights were independently fitted using the expectation maximization em algorithm at each gauge and for each day in brief the em algorithm would iterate the optimal parameter through the e or expectation step and m or maximization step until the log likelihood function was maximized the em scheme casts the maximum log likelihood problem as a missing data problem the missing data may not be actual data rather it is a latent variable that needs to be estimated mclachlan and krishnan 2007 next the weights were applied to next day s merging one training period of 40 days in the current year and two 40 day training periods of the same time from the previous two years i e 120 days in total were selected to optimize the weights at each site then the optimal weights of the individuals were interpolated to the entire plateau using the ordinary kriging ok approach lastly the blended data were calculated for each grid by weighted sums of the individuals and corresponding optimal weights over the tp details of emspd dbma can be found from ma et al 2017 2 3 multiple precipitation datasets in order to comprehensively understand the strengths and weaknesses of the emspd dbma data current high quality satellite precipitation products including imerg and gsmap mvk were selected for intercomparison a globally merged precipitation dataset mswep v2 was also used for comparison table 1 gpm provides a new generation of precipitation observations from space at 0 1 and 30 minutes resolutions in february 2014 as the successor of trmm era gpm has four levels of products based on various algorithms where imerg is aimed as a consistently calibrated global precipitation product hou et al 2014 over the tp imerg has proven to be a substitute for 3b42v7 which was the most desirable product of trmm era ma et al 2016 gsmap is originally sponsored by the japan science technology agency jst and is currently sponsored by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa this project proposed to map global precipitation with 0 1 and 1 hour resolutions ushio et al 2009 gsmap used kalman filter to update the precipitation rate after propagating the rain pixels along with atmospheric motion vectors gsmap mvk yielded a higher score than both cmorph and persiann cdr across the tp guo et al 2016 mswep is developed to provide reliable global precipitation with 3 hour and 0 25 scales from 1979 to present data sources with the highest quality were optimally merged bias adjustment for gauge undercatch and orographic effects were introduced by inferring basin mean precipitation from 13762 streamflow sites globally the long term climatic mean value was temporally downscaled first to a monthly timescale and then to daily and finally to 3 hour using the weighted average of precipitation anomalies obtained from gauge satellite and reanalysis data to yield the final ensemble the temporal pattern of mswep was controlled by weighted average of precipitation anomalies from seven datasets which included interpolation of gauge observations cpc unified and gpcc satellite cmorph gsmap mvk and 3b42rt and atmospheric reanalysis era interim and jra 55 details for mswep can be found in beck et al 2017 and version 2 has been released online at http hydrology princeton edu data hylkeb mswep v2 0 2 4

the variable infiltration capacity curve updated from the xinanjiang model zhao 1992 and variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 it uses gauge and satellite data for multi scale local to global hydrological simulation crest also functions as a core model in some real time flood monitoring systems e g the flooded locations and simulated hydrographs project flash http www nssl noaa gov projects flash moreover the crest model has proven to be reliable for hydrological modeling and various applications tang et al 2016b wu et al 2012 xue et al 2013 in this study the upgraded version crest 2 1 was used for hydrological evaluation of emspd dbma and mswep v2 2 5 evaluation indicators in order to quantitatively evaluate the performance of emspd dbma across the tp several statistical metrics including relative bias rb root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient cc were used in this study the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse was used to evaluate the performance of hydrological simulation specific formulas of the above indices can be found in ma et al 2016 tang et al 2016b and xue et al 2013 in addition we calculated the probability of detection pod for satellite products 1 pod h h m where h is the number of precipitation events detected by both gauge and satellite m is the number of precipitation events detected by gauge but not satellite because the current version of dbma algorithm was conducted at each grid where at least one satellite detected the true precipitation there were no false alarm rates far and missing rain volumes for the ensemble data thus the measures of far and missing rain cases were not analyzed in the data performance 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal patterns of emspd dbma the mean annual precipitation of emspd dbma was 543 mm during 2001 2015 ranging from 80 to 2324 mm across the tp spatially precipitation decreased from the southeast to the northwest fig 3 a which was consistent with the satellite products such as 3b42v7 cmorph imerg etc gao and liu 2013 ma et al 2016 tong et al 2014b as well as with gauge interpolated observations ma et al 2015 higher precipitation primarily occurred along the himalayan region with an overall value of more than 2000 mm per year in addition obvious contrast existed between the northern and southern himalayas indicating the orographic effect on mountainous precipitation fig 3a in contrast in most of the north and west where the westerlies does not prevail and the indian monsoon is relatively weaker during the warm period yao et al 2012 less precipitation was observed less than 200 mm per year over the past 15 years emspd dbma precipitation estimates have increased at a rate of 32 5 mm per decade due to inter annual variability across the tp the highest annual precipitation 614 mm occurred in 2013 and the lowest 508 mm in 2009 fig 3b before 2009 annual precipitation increased slightly with a mean rate of 2 47 mm year but it has increased significantly since 2009 with a mean rate of 6 94 mm year precipitation variability across the tp might be driven by large scale atmospheric circulation changes in response to atmospheric warming across the plateau zhang et al 2017 3 2 pixel scale statistical evaluation of emspd dbma to ensure proper error analysis of emspd dbma all evaluations were performed at the grid scale with at least one gauge available over the tp it should be noted that only the hit cases were analyzed and zero event records were excluded as precipitation events in the study overall the emspd dbma data showed a satisfying capability in estimating daily precipitation over the past 15 years with an overall cc of 0 53 for 112 national gauges over the tp fig 4 c higher cc was mainly detected in the eastern tp with abundant precipitation contributed by the indian monsoon yao et al 2012 along the himalayan region cc was lower with a mean value less than 0 45 complex terrain and heavy rainfall were pervasive across the himalayas where the geostationary infrared based retrievals geo ir were not more reliable because the orographic precipitation lacked strong convective signatures for geo ir detection yong et al 2015 and the heavy rainfall events induced by shallow orographic systems were also underestimated owing to weak ice scattering signatures shige et al 2013 therefore accurate retrieval of satellite precipitation data was challenging in this region which further influenced the blended data quality xu et al 2017 the average rb was 8 28 across the tp large overestimation primarily occurred in the south where rainfall was frequent and emspd dbma showed positive rb values fig 4a in contrast negative rb values were distributed in the center and northeast with weak rainfall detection in general emspd dbma showed an overestimation for heavy and moderate precipitation and an underestimation for light precipitation across the plateau although the dbma algorithm inferred consensus predictions by weighting the individuals the involved data s accuracy was vital for the blended result sloughter et al 2007 a positive bias was detected for heavy precipitation presumably due to an overestimation by the pmw based land algorithms for strong convective events in the warm season tian et al 2009 the rmse of the emspd dbma data increased gradually from northwest to southeast ranging from 2 88 to 9 25 mm d with an overall mean value of 6 64 mm d across the tp fig 4b rmse became worse in high mountainous and or persistent snow cover regions e g himalayas where satellite precipitation estimation was challenging bharti and singh 2015 maggioni et al 2016 mei et al 2016 yong et al 2010 2015 emspd dbma showed high pod in the past 15 years with an overall mean value of 0 92 over the tp fig 4d improving the detecting capability from space with the dbma algorithm based on the statistical metrics above the quality of emspd dbma was acceptable at the daily scale during 2001 2015 over the tp 3 3 error intercomparison between emspd dbma and other datasets 3 3 1 satellite datasets imerg and gsmap mvk since the tp s satellite precipitation data exhibits strong uncertainty in the cold season due to erroneous retrievals of snow events from space sensors hou et al 2014 maggioni et al 2016 yong et al 2015 we merely performed the data intercomparison during the summers of 2014 and 2015 to facilitate direct comparison spatial resolutions of satellite data should be consistent first the imerg and gsmap mvk data were resampled to 0 25 0 25 the same as emspd dbma note that potential errors may be introduced in the resampling table 2 shows the statistical metrics of rb rmse cc and pod for emspd dbma imerg and gsmap mvk for the summers of 2014 and 2015 overall emspd dbma performed better than the other two products with the lowest rb and rmse values of 2 88 and 8 01 mm d respectively as well as a satisfying cc value of 0 50 over the tp imerg had the largest errors with rb and rmse values of 14 25 and 8 87 mm d respectively as well as the lowest pod at 0 68 in addition emspd dbma improved rainfall detection with a pod value of 0 92 which is around 1 35 times that of imerg and 1 06 times that of gsmap mvk fig 5 showed box plots of daily statistical metrics for emspd dbma imerg and gsmap mvk where emspd dbma exhibited robust symmetry with the outliers of metrics e g rmse and pod close to the median line fig 5b lower rainfall detection accompanied with higher bias were found in imerg due to its longer box of pod fig 5d higher precipitation uncertainty existed in the gsmap mvk since the outliers of rb and cc were far from the median value fig 5a and c generally 3b42v7 was corrected using the global precipitation climatology center gpcc gauge based dataset and persiann cdr using the gauge satellite based global precipitation climatology project gpcp dataset some of the gauges have been incorporated in those datasets potentially undermining some of the results imerg and gsmap mvk are primarily satellite based data thus emspd dbma showed better performance than both imerg and gsmap mvk for most of the statistical metrics in the summers of 2014 and 2015 probability distribution functions pdfs illustrate the ability of precipitation rate occurrence and the sensitivity of precipitation estimates as a function of precipitation rate which is an important index for understanding satellite precipitation s quality chen et al 2013 tang et al 2016a over the tp emspd dbma imerg and gsmap mvk all showed similar pdf structures of daily precipitation amount fig 6 compared with gauge based trace rainfall 0 1 mm d large bias existed for the three products because the record resolution for gauge is 0 1 mm it is difficult to assess which satellite performs the best in this range when daily rainfall was less than 6 0 mm d 0 1 6 0 mm d an overestimation was detected for emspd dbma and gsmap mvk however imerg showed a satisfactory performance in this range which indicated the advantage of gpm era products in detecting light precipitation across the plateau ma et al 2016 because the predictive distribution of precipitation error was skewed a box cox transformation was performed prior to the dbma algorithm this might induce unexpected errors for emspd dbma especially for light rainfall located in the tails sloughter et al 2007 as for gsmap mvk the current algorithm propagated and applied the kalman filter only for the rainy pixels identified by the microwave radiometer which may ignore some informative signals from the light rainfall ushio et al 2009 the pdfs of the three datasets showed gamma distribution with the top point lower than 1 0 mm the primary differences between the pdfs are clear at the lower ends of bins 6 0 mm d as for moderate and heavy precipitation 6 0 mm d the emspd dbma imerg and gsmap mvk datasets showed similar pdf structures at the daily scale in the summer therefore the performance of emspd dbma in the summers of 2014 and 2015 was deemed acceptable and was even better than both imerg and gsmap mvk for moderate and heavy rainfall in the tp 3 3 2 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 mswep v2 over the tp both emspd dbma and mswep v2 show an apparent overestimation from 2001 to 2015 as compared with the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa which was produced from 2400 national gauge data in mainland china shen and xiong 2016 ma et al 2015 concluded that the average gauge undercatch of annual precipitation amounted to 27 over the tp during 1951 2010 because there was no bias correction for the cgdpa gauges some underestimation may have been induced in determining the true precipitation the mean annual precipitation for cgdpa emspd dbma and mswep v2 were 384 mm 554 mm and 1103 mm respectively during 2001 2015 over the tp fig 7 there was a slightly opposite variability for the two blended data in terms of annual precipitation from 2007 to 2010 and mswep v2 showed an opposite trend as compared to cgdpa as regard to emspd dbma the ensemble weight for each member was optimized from gauge data which might explain the similar performance between emspd dbma and cgdpa as for mswep v2 it sought to combine from various gauge satellite and reanalysis data sources around the global in addition the interpolation of gauge correction factors probably induced higher precipitation estimates across the tp beck et al 2017 as higher discrepancy existed in 2008 and 2009 for mswep v2 opposite trends were detected for the two blended products with respect to the gauge reference between 2007 and 2010 during the summer both blended products showed acceptable performances compared to gauge observations obvious overestimations for mswep v2 existed in the spring fall and winter fig 8 in all seasons the points of emspd dbma were more clustered than those of mswep v2 as compared with gauge data this indicated that emspd dbma performs better than mswep v2 for each season across the tp several factors contribute to higher values of mswep v2 across the tp 1 mswep v2 is focused on the globally gridded precipitation reconstruction and inevitably local climate and complex terrain in the plateau might result in spatiotemporal discontinuities for the long term average 2 you et al 2015 reported that most of reanalysis data e g ncep1 ncep2 era interim era 40 20century and cfsr overestimate precipitation across the tp especially in the southeast where summer convection is dominant tong et al 2014b also showed that higher biases exist in the current reanalysis data e g era interim greatly overestimates gauge observations at both annual and monthly scales in the plateau thus precipitation from reanalysis should be treated with caution for the mswep v2 production due to the complexity of the processes involved in the entire reanalysis model framework 3 mswep v2 used streamflow observations in an attempt to correct for gauge undercatch large precipitation underestimations have been reported in the hindu kush himalaya region immerzeel et al 2015 and the correction factors are indeed high for mswep v2 here beck et al 2017 the interpolation of gauge correction factors might induce higher mswep v2 data over the tp 4 few gauges were used for mswep v2 production in the tp and thus its quality is potentially degraded beck et al 2017 3 4 basin scale hydrological evaluation of emspd dbma with regard to land surface hydrological modeling errors in precipitation sampling can result in unavoidable uncertainties in streamflow simulations and predictions nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 thus emspd dbma was further analyzed to quantify its improvements and error propagations relative to observed discharge as well as mswep v2 using the crest model in the zhimenda basin blue polygon in fig 1 the crest model parameters for gauge based simulation were forced and calibrated using gauge data from january 1 2008 to december 31 2011 and then subsequently validated from january 1 2012 to december 31 2014 the simulated discharge for gauges was misleading since the gauge based network in the zhimenda basin is sparse however the simulated streamflow was within a reasonable range of observed values at both the calibration and validation periods in terms of nse with values of 0 88 and 0 60 respectively thus it was feasible to replace rain gauge forcing with precipitation by emspd dbma and mswep v2 for hydrological simulation in this basin with regard to the hydrological simulations of emspd dbma and mswep v2 their model parameters were respectively forced and calibrated in the calibration period and subsequently used for discharge simulation in the validation period the daily statistical comparisons in both calibration and validation periods showed that the discharge simulation forced by gauge data performed better skills nse 0 88 0 60 cc 0 95 0 85 than those based on emspd dbma and mswep v2 table 3 the mean nse scores for emspd dbma were 0 82 and 0 58 for the calibration and validation periods respectively moreover the emspd dbma forced model simulations performed better than mswep v2 forced simulations nse 0 21 0 11 for the calibration and validation periods respectively interestingly both emspd dbma and mswep v2 forced discharge simulations showed better performances in terms of rb with values of 4 70 13 23 and 4 29 15 69 than gauge forced results at both calibration and validation periods table 3 which was primarily caused by the cancelation of positive negative values during the calculation during the calibration period emspd dbma captured the majority of the flow peaks and fit the observed streamflow well fig 9 in the validation period the emspd dbma curve fit well with that of observations and captured most flow peaks though some peaks were underestimated e g the summer of 2014 the simulated runoff from mswep v2 showed higher bias with underestimations in warm seasons and overestimations in cold seasons higher values for mswep data were not reflected in the streamflow simulation in the crest hydrological model there are a lot of parameters including a precipitation adjustment factor which is designed to adjust the biased precipitation and then optimize the discharge simulation as for the overestimated mswep v2 data its precipitation adjustment parameter was optimized to 0 60 i e the value of mswep v2 used in the hydrological modeling was adjusted into 0 60 times of the input precipitation thus the sce ua shuffled complex evolution method developed at the university of arizona algorithm could merge the high values of mswep v2 duan et al 1993 wang et al 2011 xue et al 2013 emspd dbma showed slightly better performance than mswep v2 and its optimized precipitation adjustment factor was 0 74 as for the considerable higher streamflow in the recession drying phase of the hydrography in mswep v2 the underlying reason was that an overestimation existed at the drying period for mswep v2 because the discharge generation was simulated based on the variable infiltration capacity curve with the input precipitation data higher streamflow would be simulated from higher amount of input precipitation data overall emspd dbma showed better performance for hydrological simulation than mswep v2 further demonstrating the advantage of dbma algorithm for multi satellite precipitation fusion in high elevated regions although our study site was located at a small region of the plateau it indicated a promising prospect of hydrologic utility for emspd dbma over the tp 4 discussion emspd dbma which was developed from several primary satellite precipitation estimates using the dbma algorithm at daily and 0 25 scales for the period of 2001 2015 was comprehensively evaluated over regions of high elevation and complex topography for the first time the reliability and superiority of emspd dbma over the tp as compared to imerg gsmap mvk and mswep v2 were proven by either statistical or hydrological methods note that error analysis in this work was performed between pixel values of satellites and point values of gauges potential errors for the scale discrepancy should be specifically worked out in the next step satellite precipitation data provides new opportunities for understanding and applying remote information tang et al 2016b wang et al 2011 xue et al 2013 basin scale hydrological simulation forced by the crest model with emspd dbma yielded comparable scores to in situ observations and better results than another blended precipitation product mswep v2 however the peaks at the calibration and validation periods were not fully captured by emspd dbma in the headwaters of the yangtze river illustrating the importance of parameter calibration in the crest model to compensate for errors in satellite precipitation forcing and to improve streamflow simulation given the sparse distribution of rain gauges over the tp especially in the central and western regions emspd dbma seems to be reliable for deriving streamflow even without the need of recalibration for a long period although estimation of model parameters in high cold mountainous regions is always challenging since more parameters were involved to simulate snow accumulation and melting in the hydrological model we have to admit that the crest model used in this study did not specially consider the snow related processes potential errors might be induced in winter when snowfall is dominated in the tp emspd dbma is currently blended from 3b42rt 3b42v7 cmorph and persiann cdr at the daily scale over a long term period 2001 2015 the next update of emspd dbma will be intended to take advantage of new and improved satellite data sources for instance trmm era could be replaced by its successor gpm era gsmap mvk is also being considered as an addition to the ensemble dataset an increased scale in temporal resolution from daily to 3 hour and even to 1 hour will benefit multi satellite rainfall data fusion by improving instantaneous flood prediction in remote areas this study also shows major challenges to the algorithm of blended multi satellite precipitation dataset in regions with high mountains and snow dominated seasons for instance larger uncertainty was detected in the himalayan region for emspd dbma though this product performed better than other satellite datasets we recommend that the dbma algorithm be modified to specially consider the orographic effect on the multi satellite precipitation fusion in future studies because uncertainty primarily stems from satellite sensors yong et al 2015 efforts should be made to increase the terrain information utilized by retrieval algorithms through the use of sufficient gauge networks and necessary weather radar systems 5 conclusions this study provided a comprehensive assessment of the newly blended multi satellite precipitation data emspd dbma against gauge based observations and basin scale hydrological simulation over the tp quantitative error analysis and intercomparison were performed among emspd dbma imerg and gsmap mvk in the summers of 2014 and 2015 emspd dbma was also compared with mswep v2 for the period of 2001 2015 across the tp the primary conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the mean annual precipitation estimated by emspd dbma was 543 mm and ranged from 80 to 2324 mm over the tp it increased gradually from southeast to northwest a trend that was similar with mainstream satellite data such as 3b42v7 cmorph and imerg the yearly precipitation of emspd dbma increased slightly with a mean rate of 32 5 mm per decade during 2001 2015 2 emspd dbma has shown reliable performance in the past 15 years over the tp where its mean daily rb rmse cc and pod were 8 28 6 64 mm d 0 53 and 0 92 respectively higher error was primarily distributed in the himalayas indicating that the dbma algorithm needs to be updated in regions with high mountains and snow dominated seasons 3 compared with imerg and gsmap mvk emspd dbma performed better skill with lower rb and rmse values of 2 88 and 8 01 mm d respectively in the summers of 2014 and 2015 across the tp emspd dbma also significantly improved summer rainfall detection with a pod value of 0 92 moreover emspd dbma ideally reproduced the pdf structures of daily precipitation amounts and even better than both imerg and gsmap mvk for moderate and heavy rainfall in the plateau 4 emspd dbma showed greater cluster and better performance than mswep v2 compared to gauge based observations in each season for the periods of 2001 2015 significant overestimation occurred for mswep v2 in the spring fall and winter indicating that the blending algorithm for mswep v2 needs further upgrading in the plateau 5 emspd dbma offered great potential for basin scale hydrological modeling in remote and complex topographic regions the discharge simulation in the headwaters of yangtze river using the crest v2 1 model showed that the emspd dbma forced streamflow simulation had satisfactory nse scores of 0 80 and 0 58 at both calibration and validation periods respectively it also fit fairly well with that from the gauge based benchmark and captured most flow peaks overall the results showed that spatiotemporal characteristics were ideally captured by emspd dbma across the tp however the dbma algorithm needs upgrading especially in regions with high mountains and snow dominated periods to decrease partial systematic bias and random error for emspd dbma acknowledgments this work is financially supported by

7579,changes in long term montane actual evapotranspiration et in response to climate change could impact future water supplies and forest species composition for scenarios of atmospheric warming predicted changes in long term et tend to differ between studies using space for time substitution sts models and integrated watershed models and the influence of spatially varying factors on these differences is unclear to examine this we compared warming induced 2 to 6 c changes in et simulated by an sts model and an integrated watershed model across zones of elevation substrate available water capacity and slope in the snow influenced upper san joaquin river watershed sierra nevada usa we used the soil water and assessment tool swat for the watershed modeling and a budyko type relationship for the sts modeling spatially averaged increases in et from the sts model increasingly surpassed those from the swat model in the higher elevation zones of the watershed resulting in 2 3 2 6 times greater values from the sts model at the watershed scale in sparse deep colluvium or glacial soils on gentle slopes the swat model produced et increases exceeding those from the sts model however watershed areas associated with these conditions were too localized for swat to produce spatially averaged et gains comparable to the sts model the swat model results nevertheless demonstrate

air temperature snow integrated watershed model space for time substitution soil properties 1 introduction snowmelt derived streamflow from mountain watersheds is a critical water source for ecosystems worldwide barnett et al 2005 snowmelt runoff is particularly important in mediterranean climates such as the sierra nevada of california where approximately 80 90 of precipitation occurs between late fall november and early spring april pandey et al 1999 changes in climate in the western u s since the 1970s have shortened snowmelt seasons harpold et al 2012 and advanced streamflows earlier in the year by as much as four weeks dettinger et al 2004 stewart et al 2005 clow 2010 observed components of climate change include atmospheric warming cayan et al 2008 ipcc 2014 and its relationship with precipitation intensity lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 westra et al 2013 2014 as well as wind speed mcvicar et al 2010 2012 luce et al 2013 radiative fluxes wild 2009 milly and dunne 2011 and atmospheric aerosols and gases milly and dunne 2016 trancoso et al 2017 atmospheric warming is especially relevant in assessments of snowmelt runoff because of its known control on the partitioning of precipitation between snow and rain klos et al 2014 safeeq et al 2016 projected global changes in air temperature from global climate models gcms tend to be consistent in direction but not magnitude ranging from 0 3 to 4 8 c by year 2100 relative to 1986 2005 depending on greenhouse gas emissions ipcc 2014 cayan et al 2008 reported a similar amount of warming possible for california i e 1 5 4 5 c by 2100 using two gcms and two emission scenarios in contrast to air temperature gcm projected changes in precipitation for california are not consistent in direction ficklin et al 2012 seager et al 2013 mainly due to varied representations of extreme precipitation events pierce et al 2013 a potential hydrologic impact of future atmospheric warming will be a shift in timing of the stream hydrograph by as much as six weeks depending on changes in snowfall rainfall partitioning and snowmelt timing null et al 2010 costa cabral et al 2013 he et al 2013 this could lead to increased flooding miller et al 2003 westra et al 2014 and increased stresses on ecosystems in association with reduced summertime soil moisture and baseflows tague et al 2009 godsey et al 2014 another potential hydrologic impact of atmospheric warming addressed in this study is long term change in streamflow volume runoff yield previous studies have reached different conclusions regarding the sensitivity of long term runoff yield to air temperature duell 1994 risbey and entekhabi 1996 jeton and dettinger 1996 dettinger et al 2004 costa cabral et al 2013 he et al 2013 goulden and bales 2014 berghuijs et al 2014 barnhart et al 2016 though reasons for this are not clear they likely include differences in prediction method climate and landscape characteristics models used in previous studies to assess the sensitivity of long term runoff yield to air temperature can be broadly divided into two categories vicuna and dracup 2007 i empirical models built entirely from statistical relationships trained to observations and ii integrated watershed models that include some aspect of physically based algorithms describing water flows and water demands e g darcy s law penman monteith equation of the former category space for time substitution has been a commonly used approach hunsaker et al 2012 berghuijs et al 2014 goulden and bales 2014 reinfelds et al 2014 whereby empirical models are trained to observations distributed over space to predict a system response with respect to time in one example goulden and bales 2014 used long term values of air temperature precipitation and modis derived evapotranspiration et sampled across different elevations space of a mountain watershed to train a regression model to predict temporal responses of long term runoff and et to warming in each elevation band of that watershed a limitation of the space for time substitution approach is that it does not take into account independent changes in the spatially varying factors being considered in a system e g components of climate change listed in section 1 long term changes in et and runoff yield can be related to one another because of the diminished role of water storage change over extended time periods this relationship can be considered in the context of the following water balance 1 q a p et δ s δ t where q a is stream discharge normalized by upstream contributing area mm yr 1 p is precipitation mm yr 1 and δs δt is rate of change in storage mm yr 1 when this water balance expression eq 1 is averaged over several years or more the storage change term becomes relatively insignificant peters and aulenbach 2011 goulden et al 2012 leading to the following long term approximation 2 δ q a δ p δ et previous studies using integrated watershed models have generally predicted more muted long term responses of et and runoff yield to warming than studies using space for time substitution models jepsen et al 2016 supplement section s1 such muted responses of et and runoff yield to warming in snow influenced watersheds are consistent with the concept that advances earlier shifts in timing of the stream hydrograph caused by snow to rain transitions tend to mute or offset responses of stream volume to warming as a result of increased water limitations on et jeton and dettinger 1996 risbey and entekhabi 1996 dettinger et al 2004 tague et al 2009 increased water limitations on et would in general be maximized by reducing soil moisture most during times when potential et is greatest such a reduction in moisture could be brought about by changes in flow path of runoff e g increased overland flow and or asynchronous changes in the seasonal timing of surface water delivery rainfall snowmelt and potential et jepsen et al 2016 showed that water limitations on et in response to a snow to rain transition are strongly mediated by hydrogeologic conditions that vary with elevation jepsen et al 2016 it is understood that subsurface properties influencing storage capacity subsurface residence time and flow velocity play an important mediating role in the effect of interannual climate variability on annual fluxes of et and runoff milly 1994 merz and blöschl 2009 lundquist and loheide 2011 troch et al 2013 tague and peng 2013 garcia and tague 2015 improved understanding is needed however on how shifts from snow to rain soil regolith properties and topography interact to mediate long term responses of runoff yield and et to changes in air temperature such an improved understanding would provide useful insights into potentially differing responses of runoff yield and et to atmospheric warming across mountain landscapes and also about the environmental conditions amenable to a correspondence between predictions from integrated watershed models and space for time substitution models our goal is to understand the influence of landscape characteristics in snow influenced watersheds on the sensitivity of long term et to air temperature landscape characteristics examined here are the capacity of substrates to store water for plants available water capacity ground slope and elevation these are hypothesized to be important factors linking changes in long term energy and water availability to changes in actual et more specifically our objectives are two fold 1 to simulate and analyze using an integrated watershed model variations in warming induced long term change in et across different zones of substrate available water capacity awc slope and elevation and 2 to identify the above landscape characteristics for which there is and is not a correspondence between predictions from the integrated watershed model and a space for time substitution model this work provides an improved understanding of how landscape characteristics mediate long term responses of et to warming in snow influenced watersheds and the landscape characteristics conducive to a correspondence between predictions from integrated watershed models and space for time substitution models 2 study area the study area is the upper san joaquin river watershed in the central sierra nevada of california extending from the crest of the sierra nevada range southwest to the friant dam stream gauge below millerton lake fig 1 elevations in the watershed range from 90 to 4210 m across a total area of 4347 km2 slopes in the watershed increase moderately with elevation from an average of 13 in the lower elevation subbasins to 21 in the upper elevation subbasins fig 1 the watershed is divided into four groups of subbasins based on their mean elevations table 1 these subbasin groups are approximately equal in total area and are hereafter referenced by their elevation bin e g upper elevation bin the watershed is in a mediterranean climate where approximately 76 of annual precipitation 946 mm yr 1 occurs during the months of november through march based on 1950 1999 interpolated observations from maurer et al 2002 table 1 precipitation increases from approximately 690 mm yr 1 in the lower elevations to 1080 mm yr 1 in the upper elevations table 1 mean annual air temperature spatially averaged over the watershed is 7 1 c and is 0 8 c during the november through march wet season table 1 the rain snow transition zone is where precipitation typically occurs as a mix of rain and snow in a proportion that is sensitive to air temperature based on typical wet season air temperatures and a typical snow to rain transition range of 2 to 4 c dai 2008 the rain snow transition zone is located primarily in the mid lower elevation bin of the watershed i e subbasins with 1560 2210 m mean elevation a nearby example of a catchment in the rain snow transition zone is the p301 experimental catchment 1950 m mean elevation located 10 km southeast of shaver lake fig 1 where 35 60 of precipitation fell as snow during 2004 2007 hunsaker et al 2012 the lower elevations of the watershed are covered primarily by sandy loam soils of the ahwahnee and holland soil series while the upper elevations are covered primarily by exposed bedrock and sparse patches of sandy loam soils of the notned and gerle soil series supplement fig s1 exposed bedrock covers an order of magnitude more area than soil in the upper elevation bin of the watershed table 1 a soil map with brief descriptions are given in supplement fig s1 and table s1 with more detailed descriptions available at https soilseries sc egov usda gov the dominant land cover types in the watershed are evergreen forest 53 and shrubland scrubland 24 usgs 2014a table 1 the evergreen forest consists of ponderosa pine sugar pine white fir and incense cedar at elevations below approximately 2000 m giger and schmitt 1993 this forest transitions into white fir red fir jeffrey pine lodgepole pine western white pine and mountain hemlock at higher elevations the shrublands scrublands typically include oak ceanothus manzanita and buckeye grasslands are common in the lowest elevations and in high elevation meadows table 1 streamflows in the watershed are heavily regulated for hydropower flood control and instream flow requirements mah 2003 the watershed contains nine dams built between 1910 and 1960 impounding all of the lakes mapped in fig 1 stream gauges used in this study are located below dams at florence lake huntington lake mammoth pool reservoir and millerton lake friant dam based on these stream gauge locations we divided the watershed into four subwatersheds for purposes of hydrologic modeling in order of decreasing mean elevation these subwatersheds are florence huntington mammoth and friant fig 1 supplement table s2 simulation of all historical reservoir operations are beyond the scope of this study therefore all streamflows used and presented in this study are full natural unimpaired values which are best estimates by operating agencies of the flows that would have occurred in the absence

we simulated changes in long term et in response to three incremental shifts in air temperature applied to a 20 yr baseline climate 1960 1979 0 baseline to 2 c 2 to 4 c and 4 to 6 c these air temperature shifts were applied uniformly to air temperatures of the baseline climate period in order to examine the cause effect relationship between warming and long term et and to directly compare our space for time substitution results to those from previous studies that considered changes in air temperature supplement section s1 meteorological parameters other than air temperature were maintained at baseline values the above warming cases bracket a range in potential 21st century warming scenarios based on gcms and possible greenhouse gas emissions ipcc 2014 we separated outputs of the integrated watershed model into bins of elevation substrate available water capacity awc and slope the elevation bins used for results from both the watershed model and space for time substitution model were defined in terms of the subbasin groups listed in table 1 we selected three bins of substrate awc rock exposed bedrock which has awc values of less than 16 mm h2o supplement table s1 awc 1 soils with 16 mm awc 91 mm and awc 2 soils with awc 91 mm the awc 1 and awc 2 bins were defined in this manner in order to divide the soils in the upper half of the watershed into approximately equal areas 14 and 15 for awc 1 and awc 2 respectively not shown we chose three slope bins of 0 20 20 40 and 40 during construction of the watershed model to represent roughly equal areas of the watershed 38 25 and 38 respectively parameters were input to the integrated watershed model as ranges of values obtained from a calibration procedure using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 method abbaspour et al 2004 2007 section 3 5 output from the calibrated watershed model was in the form of 1000 time series simulations at a monthly time step enclosing approximately 80 90 of monthly flow observations section 4 1 parameters input to each of these 1000 simulations were obtained from latin hypercube random sampling of the parameter ranges determined in the calibration procedure section 3 5 simulated changes in mean annual et were spatially integrated over model hydrologic response units hrus patches of subbasins having a unique combination of land use soil type and slope using hru area weighting this was done over the hrus in each bin of elevation substrate awc and slope following abbaspour et al 2004 2007 we defined the prediction uncertainty as the range between the 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles of the 1000 watershed model simulations and the mean simulation as the average over this range of uncertainty 3 2 watershed model our criteria for selecting a watershed model was that it should simulate relevant hydrologic processes using physically based relationships and from a more pragmatic standpoint that it should be supported by documentation user groups and pre and post processing software tools one relevant hydrologic process is a shift from snowfall to rainfall with increased air temperature as this can influence the long term water balance through asynchronous changes in timing of water availability and water demand milly 1994 tague et al 2009 another relevant process is how changes in timing and intensity of surface water flux rainfall and snowmelt affect the dynamics of soil moisture and flow paths of runoff which include infiltration overland flow interflow and percolation through soil this interaction plays an important role in the availability of subsurface water during the growing season milly 1994 merz and blöschl 2009 lundquist and loheide 2011 troch et al 2013 tague and peng 2013 garcia and tague 2015 based on these considerations we selected the swat version 2012 revision 632 watershed model with the arcswat extension tool for arcgis version 2012 10 2 16 for building the model in arcmap arnold et al 2012 winchell et al 2013 previous studies have demonstrated that swat can effectively capture the dynamics of runoff from snow influenced mountain watersheds fontaine et al 2002 ahl et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 ficklin et al 2012 watson and putz 2014 grusson et al 2015 in swat a snowpack accumulates when new precipitation occurs while air temperature is below a threshold value and melts according to a calibrated model that uses melt factors and multiple elevation bands per subbasin fontaine et al 2002 we applied five elevation bands per subbasin based on cumulative hypsometric curves of elevation snowmelt fluxes in the elevation bands are adjusted for a non uniform snow distribution using a sigmoidal areal depletion curve that relates areally averaged snow water equivalent to fractional snow covered area fontaine et al 2002 neitsch et al 2011 partitioning between infiltration and surface runoff was computed using the scs soil conservation service curve number method which adjusts land use specific daily infiltration volumes based on local values of soil layer permeability antecedent soil moisture and slope neitsch et al 2002 supplement section s2 water within a soil profile can flow laterally as interflow along soil layers that become saturated can percolate vertically downward when soil water content exceeds field capacity and can be uptaken by plant roots water percolating out of the soil column is time lagged across the vadose zone to eventually recharge an aquifer which provides base flow to a stream reach following a linear reservoir model neitsch et al 2002 water can be lost from the watershed as deep aquifer recharge which we left at the model s default value of 5 total aquifer recharge we selected the penman monteith method for computing potential et components of potential et influenced by air temperature are net shortwave and longwave radiation and vapor pressure gradient net shortwave radiation was corrected for a surface albedo of 0 8 when a snow cover is present and an area weighted average for soil and vegetation at other times neitsch et al 2011 p 36 net longwave radiation was computed using a modified version of the stefan boltzmann law to account for vapor pressure effects on atmospheric emittance neitsch et al 2011 p 37 38 aerodynamic resistances in the penman monteith equation were parameterized by canopy height and canopy resistance to vapor flux was parameterized by leaf area index neitsch et al 2011 p 127 128 if soil water storage is insufficient to meet et demands water is extracted directly from the aquifer in a flux referred to as revap this flux is intended to simulate water uptake by deep plant roots and or upward capillary flow from shallow water tables neitsch et al 2002 water storages and fluxes in swat are evaluated for each hru then routed to stream reaches 3 3 space for time substitution model there is no singly accepted space for time substitution sts method for predicting a change in long term et or runoff methods from previous studies have included the use of a linear relationship between runoff ratio and elevation in conjunction with an elevation air temperature lapse rate hunsaker et al 2012 reinfelds et al 2014 use of nonlinear regression between long term et air temperature and precipitation goulden et al 2012 goulden and bales 2014 and use of a budyko type relationship berghuijs et al 2014 between long term evaporation ratio et p and aridity ratio pet p where p is mean annual precipitation and pet is mean annual potential et budyko 1974 pp 317 330 zhou et al 2015 a method common to these studies including ours is the use of long term annual averages which does not explicitly account for seasonal variability in factors such as temperature lapse rate e g mcvicar et al 2007 similar to the approach by berghuijs et al 2014 we assumed that long term et in each subbasin of the watershed fig 1 follows a budyko type relationship between evaporation ratio and aridity ratio in addition we assumed temporal stationarity in the following two lapse rates mean annual air temperature versus elevation based on interpolated coop station observations maurer et al 2002 during the 1960 1979 baseline period 5 2 10 3 c m 1 fig 2 a and mean annual potential et versus elevation during the baseline period 0 365 mm yr 1 m 1 fig 2b potential et was computed using the penman monteith method with the same meteorological data used for swat section 3 4 mean annual et for the budyko plot ordinates fig 2c were estimated as the difference between precipitation and observed net stream discharge from each subwatershed during the 1960 1979 baseline period supplement table s2 in selecting the functional form of the budyko type relationship we tested all functions in zhou et al 2015 and chose their eq 23a because it provided the best fit r2 0 92 to our subwatershed data points fig 2c to make an et change prediction using the sts model we first multiplied the prescribed shift in air temperature by the reciprocal of the air temperature lapse rate 192 m c 1 to produce an equivalent change in elevation we then multiplied this equivalent change in elevation by the potential et lapse rate 0 365 mm yr 1 m 1 to produce an equivalent change in potential et lastly we inserted this equivalent change in potential et into the budyko type relationship fig 2c to predict the corresponding change in long term et this method used elevation as an intermediate parameter relating a change in air temperature to a corresponding change in potential et another method yielding the same result would have been to parameterize potential et by air temperature 70 6 mm yr 1 c 1 r2 0 93 supplement fig s2 rather than elevation 3 4 model inputs each subbasin in swat is assigned a single gauge providing meteorological time series data for air temperature and precipitation we used daily values from the gridded 1 8 product of maurer et al 2002 mapped from noaa coop station observations we projected grid cell values to each subbasin by area weighting overlaps between grid cells and subbasins average grid cell area 154 km2 average subbasin area 91 km2 other daily meteorological forcings needed for the potential et calculations solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were generated internally in swat using the wxgen weather generator parameterized by first order climate stations in the u s neitsch et al 2011 the same subbasin values of air temperature precipitation and potential et were used in both the swat model and sts model ground surface elevations were obtained from a 1 arcsecond digital elevation model of the national elevation dataset usgs 2013 to constrain the calibration ranges of the watershed model parameters controlling the sigmoidal shape of the snow areal depletion curve swat parameters snocovmx and sno50cov we used the satellite based blended snow reconstruction product from guan et al 2013 fig 3 substrate i e soil and exposed bedrock properties input to arcswat were obtained from the usda state soil geographic statsgo database usda 1994 supplement fig s1 and section s2 land cover land use in swat data input to arcswat were obtained from the national land cover database 2001 usgs 2014a the land cover types represented in the watershed model were evergreen forest shrubland scrubland grassland herbaceous plants and barren land covering 95 of the watershed table 1 other more minor land covers covering less than the default threshold of 20 any given subbasin were screened out during hru creation in arcswat winchell et al 2013 p 122 3 5 watershed model calibration and sensitivity analysis we applied a calibration procedure to the watershed model consisting of adjustments to the most important parameters to match simulated and observed streamflows as closely as possible santhi et al 2001 to identify the most important model parameters we compiled from the literature a list of 26 commonly adjusted parameters and their estimated ranges of uncertainty supplement table s3 next we evaluated the relative importance of each parameter by applying a global sensitivity analysis using the sobol method which apportions the variance in an arbitrary model response to each parameter saltelli et al 2008 pp 159 167 supplement section s3 the model responses examined in this analysis were the nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 ns and model percent bias pb equal to the percent error in modeled streamflow volume positive for model overestimates based on results of the sensitivity analysis we selected the 20 model parameters accounting for 99 of total model variance in ns and pb fig 4 filled symbols and included these in the set of parameters to adjust in model calibration we noted the following observations from the sensitivity analysis results i the seven snow parameters of the model supplement table s3 accounted for most 78 of the variance in ns ii more parameters were needed to account for a given variance in pb than ns e g four parameters for 80 of ns variance compared to seven parameters for pb fig 4 and iii one of the parameters sno50cov controlling the sigmoidal shape of the snow areal depletion curve constrained using the guan et al 2013 dataset fig 3 was the second most influential parameter in terms of modeled streamflow volume fig 4 bottom we calibrated the watershed model to the 1955 1967 period of observed monthly full natural streamflow using 1950 1954 for spin up initialization of model states calibrated models were then evaluated using 1968 1979 observations using 1963 1967 for spin up these time periods were selected based on the availability of the meteorological dataset starting in 1950 and the availability of data at all stream gauges until the end of 1979 the temporal misalignment between the swat input datasets for meteorology 1955 1979 and land cover circa 2001 are not likely an issue as land cover change in the vicinity of the study area has been minor since at least the 1980s potter 2015 to calibrate the watershed model we used the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 calibration and uncertainty tool of the swat cup software package arnold et al 2012 in each manual iteration of sufi 2 parameter ranges are contracted by amounts depending on the parameter covariance matrix while being centered about the parameters of the best simulation abbaspour et al 2004 2007 yang et al 2008 the best simulation was the one producing the best goal function i e objective function defined to be ns in this study sufi 2 iterations were repeated until the r factor was reduced to a value of approximately one the r factor in sufi 2 is defined as the temporally averaged width of the 2 5 to 97 5 percentile ranges of model output i e the 95 prediction uncertainty range normalized by the standard deviation of the measured data supplement section s4 the goal of the sufi 2 calibration procedure is to bracket as many measurements as possible in the 95 prediction uncertainty range a fraction referred to as the p factor in addition the statistics ns r2 and pb for the best model simulation should be in acceptable ranges we defined four levels of model performance very good good fair and poor unacceptable for the p factor ns r2 and pb statistics based on conventions from previous studies supplement table s4 we calibrated the watershed model two different ways for the globally calibrated model we adjusted all parameters uniformly across the watershed using only measurements at the friant dam stream gauge to compute the goal function for the locally calibrated model we made separate adjustments to the parameters for each subwatershed fig 1 using the stream gauge at the corresponding subwatershed outlet to compute the goal function see neitsch et al 2002 chapter 33 van liew et al 2005 initial parameter ranges of calibration are listed in supplement table s5 4 results 4 1 watershed model evaluation at the friant dam stream gauge the globally and locally calibrated watershed models showed nearly identical performance in terms of the p factor fraction of measurements bracketed and ns statistic table 2 fig 5 the p factors from calibration validation of the globally calibrated model 0 94 0 90 were similar to values for the locally calibrated model 0 94 0 88 the ns values for the best simulation from calibration validation of the globally calibrated model 0 91 0 92 were similar to values for the locally calibrated model 0 90 0 91 these statistics are all considered to be very good supplement table s4 in terms of model percent bias pb the globally calibrated model performed slightly better than the locally calibrated model table 2 with best simulation values of 7 7 2 2 for the globally calibrated model good

models are listed in supplement tables s6 and s7 respectively at the florence lake and mammoth pool stream gauges which collect most high elevation runoff fig 1 the locally calibrated model did not show a noticeable improvement in performance over the globally calibrated model supplement table s8 this result was somewhat unexpected given that the globally calibrated model was not calibrated to either of these gauges for example the p factors from the validation runs of the globally calibrated model at the florence lake and mammoth pool stream gauges were 0 74 and 0 83 respectively supplement table s8 upper compared to values of 0 75 and 0 76 for the locally calibrated model supplement table s8 lower we did however notice an improvement in the locally calibrated model over the globally calibrated model at the huntington lake stream gauge in terms of p factor ns and r2 supplement table s8 however because this improved performance was limited to a minor 5 portion of the watershed supplement table s2 we chose to use the simpler globally calibrated model for all of our final warming scenarios this choice had the effect of retaining the spatial variability originally present in the land cover and soil datasets input to swat the reader is referred to supplement figs s3 s6 for time series plots of stream discharge at the florence lake huntington lake and mammoth pool stream gauges during the calibration and validation periods for both the globally and locally calibrated models 4 2 simulated δet versus elevation simulated et changes from the space for time substitution sts model showed a markedly greater sensitivity to elevation than those from the swat watershed model fig 6 sts modeled values ranged from 17 mm yr 1 at the lowest elevations 5 change from baseline values supplement table s9 to 51 mm yr 1 at the highest elevations 20 change for the 0 2 c warming case fig 6a in comparison swat modeled values ranged from approximately 20 mm yr 1 at the lowest elevations 5 change to 18 mm yr 1 at the highest elevations 8 change for the same warming case fig 6a supplement table s9 these model differences in et change sensitivity to elevation resulted in a divergence between model predictions with increasing elevation the maximum differences between model predictions occurred at the highest elevations and were 33 mm yr 1 97 difference for 0 2 c warming 32 mm yr 1 114 difference for 2 4 c warming and 30 mm yr 1 130 difference for 4 6 c warming fig 6a c this divergence in modeled et response to temperature with increasing elevation was associated with monotonic increases with elevation in outputs from the sts model and lack of such monotonicity in outputs from the swat model fig 6 the monotonic et responses from the sts model followed from the concave downward shape of the budyko curve fig 2c which predicts stronger et responses to temperature in the more elevated energy limited areas of the watershed this monotonic pattern was not produced in the elevation binned outputs from the swat model sts modeled increases in et averaged across the watershed ranged from 28 mm yr 1 8 change supplement table s9 for the 4 6 c warming case to 36 mm yr 1 11 change for the 0 2 c warming case fig 6 right the corresponding predictions from the swat model were more muted ranging from 13 mm yr 1 4 change for the 4 6 c warming case to 16 mm yr 1 5 change for the 0 2 c warming case fig 6 right these model differences were driven mainly by differing model responses at higher elevations in the sts model the upper elevations of the watershed i e the upper and mid upper bins contributed two thirds of the total volumetric increase in et m3 yr 1 in response to 0 2 c warming fig 6 with the lower elevations contributing the remaining one third in comparison the upper and lower elevations of the swat model contributed similar proportions 54 and 46 of the increased et volumes fig 6 the swat simulations revealed elevational zones of minimum et increase that migrated to higher elevations with progressive warming for 0 2 c warming this elevational zone occurred in the mid lower elevation bin fig 6a min this elevation bin was noted in section 2 to be the primary location of the rain snow transition zone based on historical november march air temperatures with progressive warming the elevational zone of minimum et increase migrated to higher elevations eventually reaching the upper elevation bin for the 4 6 c warming case fig 6c we also observed a scale dependence of prediction uncertainty from the swat model the uncertainties in predicted et change at the scale of elevation bins are greater roughly double than those at the watershed scale lengths of bars in fig 6 as an example for the 4 6 c warming scenario the 95 prediction uncertainty for the mid lower elevation bin is 2 5 times greater than for watershed averaged predictions fig 6c this scale dependency of uncertainty is presumably associated with our method of spatially integrating model outputs over hrus prior to computing simulation means and prediction uncertainties 4 3 simulated δet versus substrate slope and elevation substrate available water capacity awc and slope had a marked influence on et responses to warming in the swat simulations particularly for the mildest warming at the upper elevations fig 7 a left simulated et responses to 2 c warming averaged across slopes of the upper elevation bin ranged from 15 mm yr 1 7 change supplement table s10 for exposed bedrock to 47 mm yr 1 12 change for the highest awc soils box averages in fig 7a left for these soils nearly half 45 not shown of the simulations in the uncertainty range of swat exceeded the sts model prediction fig 7a left this demonstrates that the swat model produces stronger et responses to warming than the sts model in localized upper elevation areas with relatively thick soils fig 7d left simulated changes in et in steeper terrain of the swat model tended to be more muted than in gentler terrain a pattern more apparent at the scale of individual subbasins supplement fig s7 than elevation bins fig 7 exposed bedrock at high elevations where increases in et from swat were muted relative to the sts model occurs in approximately three fourths of the upper watershed table 1 as a result spatially averaged et responses from swat are substantially lower than predictions from the sts model fig 6 the influence of substrate awc on predictions from the swat model became less pronounced with progressive warming fig 7a c an outcome possibly related to increasing water limitations in all substrates as aridity ratios increase fig 2c in these constant precipitation experiments et reductions in response to warming are an extreme example of increased water limitations caused by earlier seasonal shifts in the timing of water availability tague et al 2009 these types of responses were captured in the prediction uncertainty range of the swat model fig 7 elevational zones where these et reductions were most pronounced migrated upward with progressive warming generally following the rain snow transition zone assuming a phase transition range of 2 to 4 c dai 2008 for the mildest warming case 0 2 c decreases in et occurred primarily in the lower half of the watershed fig 7a further warming resulted in the most pronounced decreases in et shifting to the upper elevations fig 7c this upward movement of extreme water limitation followed the zones of minimum et increase mentioned in section 4 2 strong interaction between substrate awc and elevation in the response of long term et to warming was supported by a linear regression analysis on swat outputs fig 8 this analysis showed that trends between et change and substrate awc strengthened from 0 036 mm yr 1 mm 1 r2 0 30 p value 05 in the mid lower elevations to 0 25 mm yr 1 mm 1 r2 0 91 p value 05 in the upper elevations trends were not statistically significant p value 05 in the lowest elevations for the mildest warming case 0 2 c the greatest simulated increases in et from the swat model occurred in high elevation soils falling into the highest awc bin 91 mm offering the most water capacity for plants fig 9 a and b these simulations occurred in subbasins 9 and 22 of the upper elevation bin sandy loam soils of the notned series and subbasins 1 and 2 of the mid upper elevation bin sandy loam soils of the gerle series fig 1 supplement fig s1 for these soils in the upper elevation bin subbasins 9 and 22 over half of the simulations in the prediction uncertainty range of swat exceeded the sts prediction for the mildest warming case supplement fig s7a substrate bin awc 2 these hot spots of et change are localized covering only 6 of these subbasins supplement fig s7d shifting from hot spots to cold spots the lowest simulated increases in et from swat for the mildest warming case occurred in subbasins of the mid lower elevation bin fig 9a and b this elevation range corresponds to the zone of minimum et increase shown in fig 6a these modeled responses occurred in loamy sand toem series of subbasin 20 and sandy loam shaver series of subbasin 34 fig 1 supplement fig s1 with regard to watershed model uncertainty exposed bedrock in the upper elevations of the watershed exhibited relatively low prediction uncertainties from swat fig 9c 5 discussion 5 1 choice of space for time substitution method our finding of substantial differences in high elevation et sensitivity to temperature between a space for time substitution sts model and an integrated watershed model would remain unchanged if we had employed other sts methods e g studies described in supplement section s1 for example the watershed scale et sensitivity to temperature from our sts model was 17 mm yr 1 c 1 over a 0 4 c range of warming fig 6a and b the upper elevations contributed most two thirds to the total volumetric changes in et in comparison using an sts method based on nonlinear regression between et temperature and precipitation goulden and bales 2014 estimated an et sensitivity to temperature of approximately 30 mm yr 1 c 1 in the upper kings river watershed neighboring to the south their prediction was attributed mainly to et responses above 2000 m elevation i e near the median elevation of our study area moreover we showed in supplement section s1 that predicted long term changes in runoff yield based on the sts method of berghuijs et al 2014 would be similar to values based on the above method of goulden and bales 2014 therefore the differences in et sensitivity to air temperature between our sts model and integrated watershed model would likely be greater if we had employed other previously used sts methods 5 2 factors behind δet differences between watershed model and sts model we recognized three possible factors contributing to differences in predicted et sensitivity to air temperature between the sts and swat models the first and perhaps most apparent factor is the strong elevational dependence of substrate awc and ground slope in our study area properties implicitly varied between scenarios of the sts model and sts models in general via translations in budyko space fig 2c but not varied between scenarios of the swat model the range in swat modeled et sensitivities to temperature across the awc bins at upper elevations 16 mm yr 1 c 1 box averages in fig 7a left exceeded the simulated value averaged across those same awc bins 9 mm yr 1 c 1 short dashed line fig 7a left this indicates that the spatial variability in substrate awc is particularly important to consider in predictions of et sensitivity to temperature at high elevations of this watershed however the influence of substrate properties appears to be temperature dependent as the differences in et sensitivity to temperature across different awc bins in fig 7 become smaller with progressive warming in the upper san joaquin river watershed high elevation responses of et to warming are strongly mediated by the abundance of exposed bedrock on steep slopes and the paucity of thick soils on gentle slopes fig 7d these characteristics can determine whether warming induced increases in potential et translate to increases or decreases in actual et in other watersheds exhibiting less variation in substrate awc with elevation substrate properties may play a lesser role in long term et responses to warming the second possible factor is the tendency for a snow to rain transition to mute offset any increases in et relative to the changes that would occur in the absence of such phase transition jeton and dettinger 1996 risbey and entekhabi 1996 dettinger et al 2004 tague et al 2009 this effect would occur if the snow to rain transition causes the timing of water availability to become more out of sync from the seasonal timing of potential et this phenomenon is well illustrated in our swat model results by zones of minimum et increase that follow the rain snow transition zone to higher elevations with progressive warming these zones may correspond to the zones of maximum change in summer water deficit simulated for the upper merced river watershed by tague et al 2009 which also migrated to higher elevations with progressive warming in our simulations mildest warming 2 c in the mid lower elevation bin produced a relatively weak et response fig 7a that was substantially below the sts prediction we attribute this to the above muting effect of a snow to rain transition with further warming et responses in this elevation bin become stronger and more in line with the sts prediction fig 7b and c as this region becomes too warm to remain in the rain snow transition zone the third factor is the effect of warming on the distribution of forest species kelly and goulden 2008 goulden et al 2012 an effect that is implicitly included in sts models including ours we implicitly included this effect by assuming a temporal stationarity in the lapse rate of potential et versus elevation section 3 3 the effect of warming on forest properties represents a potentially important interaction between climate and potential et and was not simulated in our swat model which varied only air temperature while holding all other factors fixed 5 3 effect of landscape properties on high elevation et sensitivities to temperature our swat watershed model results suggest that high elevations of the upper san joaquin river watershed will exhibit a large range in et sensitivities to air temperature owing to the coexistence of exposed bedrock interspersed with sparse soils high topographic relief and energy limited conditions fig 2c widespread areas of bedrock covering approximately three fourths of the upper watershed exhibited muted low et responses to warming in terms of magnitudes and uncertainties figs 7 and 9 this is attributed to limited infiltration and water holding capacities supplement table s1 resulting in an abundance of rapid flow paths i e overland and lateral flow out of subbasins rapid flows are conducive to limited water availability during relatively warm conditions troch et al 2013 garcia and tague 2015 and may also cause snow to rain transitions to produce more asynchronous changes in timing of water availability and water demand tague et al 2009 than would occur for substrates with greater infiltration and water holding capacities weathered bedrock is known to potentially be an important source of water for vegetation witty et al 2003 bales et al 2011 kitajima et al 2013 although this source of water was included in our swat model simulations as revap and was calibrated over the suggested range supplement table s5 controlling parameter gw revap its influence was not sufficient to produce strong et responses to warming in high elevation areas lacking soils the relatively low values and uncertainties in simulated et responses to warming in high elevation areas of exposed bedrock suggests with relative certainty that runoff yields from these areas will be resilient to warming this may provide a useful insight for spatial assessments of future water supplies in high elevation regions predictions of future runoff timing needed for water management and planning would benefit from the use of gcm based climate projections e g miller et al 2003 dettinger et al 2004 ficklin et al 2012 the swat model produced particularly strong et responses to warming in high elevation sandy loams notned and gerle series of the upper and mid upper elevation bins of the watershed section 4 3 figs 1 and 9a the greatest simulated et responses occurred in the notned soil series of subbasin 9 fig 1 for the mildest warming case 0 2 c with a mean simulation of 69 mm yr 1 20 change and a maximum simulation of 83 mm yr 1 20 change in the 95 prediction uncertainty range supplement fig s7a and table s11 vegetation responses to warming in these localized hot spots of et change will likely contrast markedly with vegetation responses in neighboring areas where soils are thin or absent section 4 3 figs 7 9 supplement fig s7 a finding that is consistent with observation based studies demonstrating the important effect of soil and regolith properties on the composition and growth rate of forests witty et al 2003 meyer et al 2007 osborn et al 2014 our findings also expand on the work of tague et al 2009 by clarifying the important role of hydrogeology and slope on warming induced responses of et in high elevation energy limited regions using the rhessys watershed model tague et al 2009 showed that et could increase by approximately 20 in response to 4 c warming at high elevations of the central sierra nevada we showed that similar percent changes in long term et are possible at high elevations of the upper san joaquin river watershed fig 7 supplement table s10 but that they would be limited to sparse areas containing relatively thick soils on gentle slopes high elevation areas of exposed bedrock and sparse soils e g notned gerle series which will likely exhibit contrasting responses of et to warming may provide interesting paired study sites for examining the role of hydrogeology on forest responses to potential climate change high elevation soils in the notned and gerle soil series can be located from the maps in fig 1 and supplement fig s1 and the soil descriptions in supplement table s1 the notned soil series consists of deep exceeding 1 4 m well drained soils formed in colluvium or glacial material consisting of bouldery coarse sandy loam https soilseries sc egov usda gov the gerle soil series consists of deep exceeding 1 5 m well drained soils formed in glacial till glacial outwash and alluvium consisting of sandy loam https soilseries sc egov usda gov we attribute the strong et responses of these soils at high elevations to a combination of low baseline aridity ratios pet p indicative of energy limitations fig 2c and abundant snowmelt to satisfy water demands during the growing season possible reasons for the apparent decreasing influence of soil types on et increases at progressively higher temperatures noted in section 4 3 are not entirely clear but may include large scale shifts from energy to water limitations as per the budyko framework and water limitations associated with upward shifts of the rain snow transition zone to higher elevations with progressive warming section 5 2 6 conclusion our objective in this study was to examine the spatial variability in long term responses of et to increased air temperature across different elevations substrate available water capacities and slopes of a snow influenced watershed we did this by comparing simulations from an integrated watershed model swat to those from a space for time substitution sts model that used the budyko hypothesis in conjunction with long term water flux observations the greatest spatial variability in swat model results occurred for relatively mild warming 0 2 c of subbasins in the highest elevation bin examined 2800 3420 m upper quartile of watershed here simulated increases in et from swat ranged from 17 mm yr 1 7 change in exposed bedrock on all slopes to 69 mm yr 1 20 change in sparsely distributed sandy loam soil on gentle slopes 20 grade the upper end of this range exceeded predictions from the sts model at these elevations demonstrating that the watershed model could produce high elevation et responses at least as strong as the sts model however because of the preponderance of exposed bedrock and steep terrain at the higher elevations the swat and sts models produced markedly different et responses for both the upper elevation bin and watershed as a whole the sts model produced watershed scale increases in et a factor of 2 3 2 6 greater than those from the swat model depending on warming scenarios with the upper half of the watershed contributing most approximately two thirds to these differences these results suggest that watershed scale responses of et to warming from integrated watershed models may be substantially lower by a factor of 2 3 in our study than predictions from space for time substitution models for snow influenced high elevation systems such as the upper san joaquin river watershed our results also suggest that long term responses of vegetation water use and stream runoff to warming in high elevation energy limited regions will depend strongly on local hydrogeologic conditions which can show great variability with

7579,changes in long term montane actual evapotranspiration et in response to climate change could impact future water supplies and forest species composition for scenarios of atmospheric warming predicted changes in long term et tend to differ between studies using space for time substitution sts models and integrated watershed models and the influence of spatially varying factors on these differences is unclear to examine this we compared warming induced 2 to 6 c changes in et simulated by an sts model and an integrated watershed model across zones of elevation substrate available water capacity and slope in the snow influenced upper san joaquin river watershed sierra nevada usa we used the soil water and assessment tool swat for the watershed modeling and a budyko type relationship for the sts modeling spatially averaged increases in et from the sts model increasingly surpassed those from the swat model in the higher elevation zones of the watershed resulting in 2 3 2 6 times greater values from the sts model at the watershed scale in sparse deep colluvium or glacial soils on gentle slopes the swat model produced et increases exceeding those from the sts model however watershed areas associated with these conditions were too localized for swat to produce spatially averaged et gains comparable to the sts model the swat model results nevertheless demonstrate that such soils on high elevation gentle slopes will form et hot spots exhibiting disproportionately large increases in et and concomitant reductions in runoff yield in response to warming predicted et responses to warming from sts models and integrated watershed models may in general substantially differ e g factor of 2 3 for snow influenced watersheds exhibiting an elevational gradient in substrate water holding capacity and slope long term water supplies in these settings may therefore be more resilient to warming than sts model predictions would suggest keywords evapotranspiration air temperature snow integrated watershed model space for time substitution soil properties 1 introduction snowmelt derived streamflow from mountain watersheds is a critical water source for ecosystems worldwide barnett et al 2005 snowmelt runoff is particularly important in mediterranean climates such as the sierra nevada of california where approximately 80 90 of precipitation occurs between late fall november and early spring april pandey et al 1999 changes in climate in the western u s since the 1970s have shortened snowmelt seasons harpold et al 2012 and advanced streamflows earlier in the year by as much as four weeks dettinger et al 2004 stewart et al 2005 clow 2010 observed components of climate change include atmospheric warming cayan et al 2008 ipcc 2014 and its relationship with precipitation intensity lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 westra et al 2013 2014 as well as wind speed mcvicar et al 2010 2012 luce et al 2013 radiative fluxes wild 2009 milly and dunne 2011 and atmospheric aerosols and gases milly and dunne 2016 trancoso et al 2017 atmospheric warming is especially relevant in assessments of snowmelt runoff because of its known control on the partitioning of precipitation between snow and rain klos et al 2014 safeeq et al 2016 projected global changes in air temperature from global climate models gcms tend to be consistent in direction but not magnitude ranging from 0 3 to 4 8 c by year 2100 relative to 1986 2005 depending on greenhouse gas emissions ipcc 2014 cayan et al 2008 reported a similar amount of warming possible for california i e 1 5 4 5 c by 2100 using two gcms and two emission scenarios in contrast to air temperature gcm projected changes in precipitation for california are not consistent in direction ficklin et al 2012 seager et al 2013 mainly due to varied representations of extreme precipitation events pierce et al 2013 a potential hydrologic impact of future atmospheric warming will be a shift in timing of the stream hydrograph by as much as six weeks depending on changes in snowfall rainfall partitioning and snowmelt timing null et al 2010 costa cabral et al 2013 he et al 2013 this could lead to increased flooding miller et al 2003 westra et al 2014 and increased stresses on ecosystems in association with reduced summertime soil moisture and baseflows tague et al 2009 godsey et al 2014 another potential hydrologic impact of atmospheric warming addressed in this study is long term change in streamflow volume runoff yield previous studies have reached different conclusions regarding the sensitivity of long term runoff yield to air temperature duell 1994 risbey and entekhabi 1996 jeton and dettinger 1996 dettinger et al 2004 costa cabral et al 2013 he et al 2013 goulden and bales 2014 berghuijs et al 2014 barnhart et al 2016 though reasons for this are not clear they likely include differences in prediction method climate and landscape characteristics models used in previous studies to assess the sensitivity of long term runoff yield to air temperature can be broadly divided into two categories vicuna and dracup 2007 i empirical models built entirely from statistical relationships trained to observations and ii integrated watershed models that include some aspect of physically based algorithms describing water flows and water demands e g darcy s law penman monteith equation of the former category space for time substitution has been a commonly used approach hunsaker et al 2012 berghuijs et al 2014 goulden and bales 2014 reinfelds et al 2014 whereby empirical models are trained to observations distributed over space to predict a system response with respect to time in one example goulden and bales 2014 used long term values of air temperature precipitation and modis derived evapotranspiration et sampled across different elevations space of a mountain watershed to train a regression model to predict temporal responses of long term runoff and et to warming in each elevation band of that watershed a limitation of the space for time substitution approach is that it does not take into account independent changes in the spatially varying factors being considered in a system e g components of climate change listed in section 1 long term changes in et and runoff yield can be related to one another because of the diminished role of water storage change over extended time periods this relationship can be considered in the context of the following water balance 1 q a p et δ s δ t where q a is stream discharge normalized by upstream contributing area mm yr 1 p is precipitation mm yr 1 and δs δt is rate of change in storage mm yr 1 when this water balance expression eq 1 is averaged over several years or more the storage change term becomes relatively insignificant peters and aulenbach 2011 goulden et al 2012 leading to the following long term approximation 2 δ q a δ p δ et previous studies using integrated watershed models have generally predicted more muted long term responses of et and runoff yield to warming than studies using space for time substitution models jepsen et al 2016 supplement section s1 such muted responses of et and runoff yield to warming in snow influenced watersheds are consistent with the concept that advances earlier shifts in timing of the stream hydrograph caused by snow to rain transitions tend to mute or offset responses of stream volume to warming as a result of increased water limitations on et jeton and dettinger 1996 risbey and entekhabi 1996 dettinger et al 2004 tague et al 2009 increased water limitations on et would in general be maximized by reducing soil moisture most during times when potential et is greatest such a reduction in moisture could be brought about by changes in flow path of runoff e g increased overland flow and or asynchronous changes in the seasonal timing of surface water delivery rainfall snowmelt and potential et jepsen et al 2016 showed that water limitations on et in response to a snow to rain transition are strongly mediated by hydrogeologic conditions that vary with elevation jepsen et al 2016 it is understood that subsurface properties influencing storage capacity subsurface residence time and flow velocity play an important mediating role in the effect of interannual climate variability on annual fluxes of et and runoff milly 1994 merz and blöschl 2009 lundquist and loheide 2011 troch et al 2013 tague and peng 2013 garcia and tague 2015 improved understanding is needed however on how shifts from snow to rain soil regolith properties and topography interact to mediate long term responses of runoff yield and et to changes in air temperature such an improved understanding would provide useful insights into potentially differing responses of runoff yield and et to atmospheric warming across mountain landscapes and also about the environmental conditions amenable to a correspondence between predictions from integrated watershed models and space for time substitution models our goal is to understand the influence of landscape characteristics in snow influenced watersheds on the sensitivity of long term et to air temperature landscape characteristics examined here are the capacity of substrates to store water for plants available water capacity ground slope and elevation these are hypothesized to be important factors linking changes in long term energy and water availability to changes in actual et more specifically our objectives are two fold 1 to simulate and analyze using an integrated watershed model variations in warming induced long term change in et across different zones of substrate available water capacity awc slope and elevation and 2 to identify the above landscape characteristics for which there is and is not a correspondence between predictions from the integrated watershed model and a space for time substitution model this work provides an improved understanding of how landscape characteristics mediate long term responses of et to warming in snow influenced watersheds and the landscape characteristics conducive to a correspondence between predictions from integrated watershed models and space for time substitution models 2 study area the study area is the upper san joaquin river watershed in the central sierra nevada of california extending from the crest of the sierra nevada range southwest to the friant dam stream gauge below millerton lake fig 1 elevations in the watershed range from 90 to 4210 m across a total area of 4347 km2 slopes in the watershed increase moderately with elevation from an average of 13 in the lower elevation subbasins to 21 in the upper elevation subbasins fig 1 the watershed is divided into four groups of subbasins based on their mean elevations table 1 these subbasin groups are approximately equal in total area and are hereafter referenced by their elevation bin e g upper elevation bin the watershed is in a mediterranean climate where approximately 76 of annual precipitation 946 mm yr 1 occurs during the months of november through march based on 1950 1999 interpolated observations from maurer et al 2002 table 1 precipitation increases from approximately 690 mm yr 1 in the lower elevations to 1080 mm yr 1 in the upper elevations table 1 mean annual air temperature spatially averaged over the watershed is 7 1 c and is 0 8 c during the november through march wet season table 1 the rain snow transition zone is where precipitation typically occurs as a mix of rain and snow in a proportion that is sensitive to air temperature based on typical wet season air temperatures and a typical snow to rain transition range of 2 to 4 c dai 2008 the rain snow transition zone is located primarily in the mid lower elevation bin of the watershed i e subbasins with 1560 2210 m mean elevation a nearby example of a catchment in the rain snow transition zone is the p301 experimental catchment 1950 m mean elevation located 10 km southeast of shaver lake fig 1 where 35 60 of precipitation fell as snow during 2004 2007 hunsaker et al 2012 the lower elevations of the watershed are covered primarily by sandy loam soils of the ahwahnee and holland soil series while the upper elevations are covered primarily by exposed bedrock and sparse patches of sandy loam soils of the notned and gerle soil series supplement fig s1 exposed bedrock covers an order of magnitude more area than soil in the upper elevation bin of the watershed table 1 a soil map with brief descriptions are given in supplement fig s1 and table s1 with more detailed descriptions available at https soilseries sc egov usda gov the dominant land cover types in the watershed are evergreen forest 53 and shrubland scrubland 24 usgs 2014a table 1 the evergreen forest consists of ponderosa pine sugar pine white fir and incense cedar at elevations below approximately 2000 m giger and schmitt 1993 this forest transitions into white fir red fir jeffrey pine lodgepole pine western white pine and mountain hemlock at higher elevations the shrublands scrublands typically include oak ceanothus manzanita and buckeye grasslands are common in the lowest elevations and in high elevation meadows table 1 streamflows in the watershed are heavily regulated for hydropower flood control and instream flow requirements mah 2003 the watershed contains nine dams built between 1910 and 1960 impounding all of the lakes mapped in fig 1 stream gauges used in this study are located below dams at florence lake huntington lake mammoth pool reservoir and millerton lake friant dam based on these stream gauge locations we divided the watershed into four subwatersheds for purposes of hydrologic modeling in order of decreasing mean elevation these subwatersheds are florence huntington mammoth and friant fig 1 supplement table s2 simulation of all historical reservoir operations are beyond the scope of this study therefore all streamflows used and presented in this study are full natural unimpaired values which are best estimates by operating agencies of the flows that would have occurred in the absence of regulations mean annual streamflow during 1960 1979 normalized by upstream contributing area supplement table s2 ranged from 485 mm yr 1 at the friant dam stream gauge http cdec water ca gov cgi

we simulated changes in long term et in response to three incremental shifts in air temperature applied to a 20 yr baseline climate 1960 1979 0 baseline to 2 c 2 to 4 c and 4 to 6 c these air temperature shifts were applied uniformly to air temperatures of the baseline climate period in order to examine the cause effect relationship between warming and long term et and to directly compare our space for time substitution results to those from previous studies that considered changes in air temperature supplement section s1 meteorological parameters other than air temperature were maintained at baseline values the above warming cases bracket a range in potential 21st century warming scenarios based on gcms and possible greenhouse gas emissions ipcc 2014 we separated outputs of the integrated watershed model into bins of elevation substrate available water capacity awc and slope the elevation bins used for results from both the watershed model and space for time substitution model were defined in terms of the subbasin groups listed in table 1 we selected three bins of substrate awc rock exposed bedrock which has awc values of less than 16 mm h2o supplement table s1 awc 1 soils with 16 mm awc 91 mm and awc 2 soils with awc 91 mm the awc 1 and awc 2 bins were defined in this manner in order to divide the soils in the upper half of the watershed into approximately equal areas 14 and 15 for awc 1 and awc 2 respectively not shown we chose three slope bins of 0 20 20 40 and 40 during construction of the watershed model to represent roughly equal areas of the watershed 38 25 and 38 respectively parameters were input to the integrated watershed model as ranges of values obtained from a calibration procedure using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 method abbaspour et al 2004 2007 section 3 5 output from the calibrated watershed model was in the form of 1000 time series simulations at a monthly time step enclosing approximately 80 90 of monthly flow observations section 4 1 parameters input to each of these 1000 simulations were obtained from latin hypercube random sampling of the parameter ranges determined in the calibration procedure section 3 5 simulated changes in mean annual et were spatially integrated over model hydrologic response units hrus patches of subbasins having a unique combination of land use soil type and slope using hru area weighting this was done over the hrus in each bin of elevation substrate awc and slope following abbaspour et al 2004 2007 we defined the prediction uncertainty as the range between the 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles of the 1000 watershed model simulations and the mean simulation as the average over this range of uncertainty 3 2 watershed model our criteria for selecting a watershed model was that it should simulate relevant hydrologic processes using physically based relationships and from a more pragmatic standpoint that it should be supported by documentation user groups and pre and post processing software tools one relevant hydrologic process is a shift from snowfall to rainfall with increased air temperature as this can influence the long term water balance through asynchronous changes in timing of water availability and water demand milly 1994 tague et al 2009 another relevant process is how changes in timing and intensity of surface water flux rainfall and snowmelt affect the dynamics of soil moisture and flow paths of runoff which include infiltration overland flow interflow and percolation through soil this interaction plays an important role in the availability of subsurface water during the growing season milly 1994 merz and blöschl 2009 lundquist and loheide 2011 troch et al 2013 tague and peng 2013 garcia and tague 2015 based on these considerations we selected the swat version 2012 revision 632 watershed model with the arcswat extension tool for arcgis version 2012 10 2 16 for building the model in arcmap arnold et al 2012 winchell et al 2013 previous studies have demonstrated that swat can effectively capture the dynamics of runoff from snow influenced mountain watersheds fontaine et al 2002 ahl et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 ficklin et al 2012 watson and putz 2014 grusson et al 2015 in swat a snowpack accumulates when new precipitation occurs while air temperature is below a threshold value and melts according to a calibrated model that uses melt factors and multiple elevation bands per subbasin fontaine et al 2002 we applied five elevation bands per subbasin based on cumulative hypsometric curves of elevation snowmelt fluxes in the elevation bands are adjusted for a non uniform snow distribution using a sigmoidal areal depletion curve that relates areally averaged snow water equivalent to fractional snow covered area fontaine et al 2002 neitsch et al 2011 partitioning between infiltration and surface runoff was computed using the scs soil conservation service curve number method which adjusts land use specific daily infiltration volumes based on local values of soil layer permeability antecedent soil moisture and slope neitsch et al 2002 supplement section s2 water within a soil profile can flow laterally as interflow along soil layers that become saturated can percolate vertically downward when soil water content exceeds field capacity and can be uptaken by plant roots water percolating out of the soil column is time lagged across the vadose zone to eventually recharge an aquifer which provides base flow to a stream reach following a linear reservoir model neitsch et al 2002 water can be lost from the watershed as deep aquifer recharge which we left at the model s default value of 5 total aquifer recharge we selected the penman monteith method for computing potential et components of potential et influenced by air temperature are net shortwave and longwave radiation and vapor pressure gradient net shortwave radiation was corrected for a surface albedo of 0 8 when a snow cover is present and an area weighted average for soil and vegetation at other times neitsch et al 2011 p 36 net longwave radiation was computed using a modified version of the stefan boltzmann law to account for vapor pressure effects on atmospheric emittance neitsch et al 2011 p 37 38 aerodynamic resistances in the penman monteith equation were parameterized by canopy height and canopy resistance to vapor flux was parameterized by leaf area index neitsch et al 2011 p 127 128 if soil water storage is insufficient to meet et demands water is extracted directly from the aquifer in a flux referred to as revap this flux is intended to simulate water uptake by deep plant roots and or upward capillary flow from shallow water tables neitsch et al 2002 water storages and fluxes in swat are evaluated for each hru then routed to stream reaches 3 3 space for time substitution model there is no singly accepted space for time substitution sts method for predicting a change in long term et or runoff methods from previous studies have included the use of a linear relationship between runoff ratio and elevation in conjunction with an elevation air temperature lapse rate hunsaker et al 2012 reinfelds et al 2014 use of nonlinear regression between long term et air temperature and precipitation goulden et al 2012 goulden and bales 2014 and use of a budyko type relationship berghuijs et al 2014 between long term evaporation ratio et p and aridity ratio pet p where p is mean annual precipitation and pet is mean annual potential et budyko 1974 pp 317 330 zhou et al 2015 a method common to these studies including ours is the use of long term annual averages which does not explicitly account for seasonal variability in factors such as temperature lapse rate e g mcvicar et al 2007 similar to the approach by berghuijs et al 2014 we assumed that long term et in each subbasin of the watershed fig 1 follows a budyko type relationship between evaporation ratio and aridity ratio in addition we assumed temporal stationarity in the following two lapse rates mean annual air temperature versus elevation based on interpolated coop station observations maurer et al 2002 during the 1960 1979 baseline period 5 2 10 3 c m 1 fig 2 a and mean annual potential et versus elevation during the baseline period 0 365 mm yr 1 m 1 fig 2b potential et was computed using the penman monteith method with the same meteorological data used for swat section 3 4 mean annual et for the budyko plot ordinates fig 2c were estimated as the difference between precipitation and observed net stream discharge from each subwatershed during the 1960 1979 baseline period supplement table s2 in selecting the functional form of the budyko type relationship we tested all functions in zhou et al 2015 and chose their eq 23a because it provided the best fit r2 0 92 to our subwatershed data points fig 2c to make an et change prediction using the sts model we first multiplied the prescribed shift in air temperature by the reciprocal of the air temperature lapse rate 192 m c 1 to produce an equivalent change in elevation we then multiplied this equivalent change in elevation by the potential et lapse rate 0 365 mm yr 1 m 1 to produce an equivalent change in potential et lastly we inserted this equivalent change in potential et into the budyko type relationship fig 2c to predict the corresponding change in long term et this method used elevation as an intermediate parameter relating a change in air temperature to a corresponding change in potential et another method yielding the same result would have been to parameterize potential et by air temperature 70 6 mm yr 1 c 1 r2 0 93 supplement fig s2 rather than elevation 3 4 model inputs each subbasin in swat is assigned a single gauge providing meteorological time series data for air temperature and precipitation we used daily values from the gridded 1 8 product of maurer et al 2002 mapped from noaa coop station observations we projected grid cell values to each subbasin by area weighting overlaps between grid cells and subbasins average grid cell area 154 km2 average subbasin area 91 km2 other daily meteorological forcings needed for the potential et calculations solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were generated internally in swat using the wxgen weather generator parameterized by first order climate stations in the u s neitsch et al 2011 the same subbasin values of air temperature precipitation and potential et were used in both the swat model and sts model ground surface elevations were obtained from a 1 arcsecond digital elevation model of the national elevation dataset usgs 2013 to constrain the calibration ranges of the watershed model parameters controlling the sigmoidal shape of the snow areal depletion curve swat parameters snocovmx and sno50cov we used the satellite based blended snow reconstruction product from guan et al 2013 fig 3 substrate i e soil and exposed bedrock properties input to arcswat were obtained from the usda state soil geographic statsgo database usda 1994 supplement fig s1 and section s2 land cover land use in swat data input to arcswat were obtained from the national land cover database 2001 usgs 2014a the land cover types represented in the watershed model were evergreen forest shrubland scrubland grassland herbaceous plants and barren land covering 95 of the watershed table 1 other more minor land covers covering less than the default threshold of 20 any given subbasin were screened out during hru creation in arcswat winchell et al 2013 p 122 3 5 watershed model calibration and sensitivity analysis we applied a calibration procedure to the watershed model consisting of adjustments to the most important parameters to match simulated and observed streamflows as closely as possible santhi et al 2001 to identify the most important model parameters we compiled from the literature a list of 26 commonly adjusted parameters and their estimated ranges of uncertainty supplement table s3 next we evaluated the relative importance of each parameter by applying a global sensitivity analysis using the sobol method which apportions the variance in an arbitrary model response to each parameter saltelli et al 2008 pp 159 167 supplement section s3 the model responses examined in this analysis were the nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 ns and model percent bias pb equal to the percent error in modeled streamflow volume positive for model overestimates based on results of the sensitivity analysis we selected the 20 model parameters accounting for 99 of total model variance in ns and pb fig 4 filled symbols and included these in the set of parameters to adjust in model calibration we noted the following observations from the sensitivity analysis results i the seven snow parameters of the model supplement table s3 accounted for most 78 of the variance in ns ii more parameters were needed to account for a given variance in pb than ns e g four parameters for 80 of ns variance compared to seven parameters for pb fig 4 and iii one of the parameters sno50cov controlling the sigmoidal shape of the snow areal depletion curve constrained using the guan et al 2013 dataset fig 3 was the second most influential parameter in terms of modeled streamflow volume fig 4 bottom we calibrated the watershed model to the 1955 1967 period of observed monthly full natural streamflow using 1950 1954 for spin up initialization of model states calibrated models were then evaluated using 1968 1979 observations using 1963 1967 for spin up these time periods were selected based on the availability of the meteorological dataset starting in 1950 and the availability of data at all stream gauges until the end of 1979 the temporal misalignment between the swat input datasets for meteorology 1955 1979 and land cover circa 2001 are not likely an issue as land cover change in the vicinity of the study area has been minor since at least the 1980s potter 2015 to calibrate the watershed model we used the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 calibration and uncertainty tool of the swat cup software package arnold et al 2012 in each manual iteration of sufi 2 parameter ranges are contracted by amounts depending on the parameter covariance matrix while being centered about the parameters of the best simulation abbaspour et al 2004 2007 yang et al 2008 the best simulation was the one producing the best goal function i e objective function defined to be ns in this study sufi 2 iterations were repeated until the r factor was reduced to a value of approximately one the r factor in sufi 2 is defined as the temporally averaged width of the 2 5 to 97 5 percentile ranges of model output i e the 95 prediction uncertainty range normalized by the standard deviation of the measured data supplement section s4 the goal of the sufi 2 calibration procedure is to bracket as many measurements as possible in the 95 prediction uncertainty range a fraction referred to as the p factor in addition the statistics ns r2 and pb for the best model simulation should be in acceptable ranges we defined four levels of model performance very good good fair and poor unacceptable for the p factor ns r2 and pb statistics based on conventions from previous studies supplement table s4 we calibrated the watershed model two different ways for the globally calibrated model we adjusted all parameters uniformly across the watershed using only measurements at the friant dam stream gauge to compute the goal function for the locally calibrated model we made separate adjustments to the parameters for each subwatershed fig 1 using the stream gauge at the corresponding subwatershed outlet to compute the goal function see neitsch et al 2002 chapter 33 van liew et al 2005 initial parameter ranges of calibration are listed in supplement table s5 4 results 4 1 watershed model evaluation at the friant dam stream gauge the globally and locally calibrated watershed models showed nearly identical performance in terms of the p factor fraction of measurements bracketed and ns statistic table 2 fig 5 the p factors from calibration validation of the globally calibrated model 0 94 0 90 were similar to values for the locally calibrated model 0 94 0 88 the ns values for the best simulation from calibration validation of the globally calibrated model 0 91 0 92 were similar to values for the locally calibrated model 0 90 0 91 these statistics are all considered to be very good supplement table s4 in terms of model percent bias pb the globally calibrated model performed slightly better than the locally calibrated model table 2 with best simulation values of 7 7 2 2 for the globally calibrated model good to very good compared to 13 9 7 8 for the locally calibrated model fair to good supplement table s4 the final parameter ranges and best fit parameter values of the globally and locally calibrated models are listed in supplement tables s6 and s7 respectively at the florence lake and mammoth pool stream gauges which collect most high elevation runoff fig 1 the locally calibrated model did not show a noticeable improvement in performance over the globally calibrated model supplement table s8 this result was somewhat unexpected given that the globally calibrated model was not calibrated to either of these gauges for example the p factors from the validation runs of the globally calibrated model at the florence lake and mammoth pool stream gauges were 0 74 and 0 83 respectively supplement table s8 upper compared to values of 0 75 and 0 76 for the locally calibrated model supplement table s8 lower we did however notice an improvement in the locally calibrated model over the globally calibrated model at the huntington lake stream gauge in terms of p factor ns and r2 supplement table s8 however because this improved performance was limited to a minor 5 portion of the watershed supplement table s2 we chose to use the simpler globally calibrated model for all of our final warming scenarios this choice had the effect of retaining the spatial variability originally present in the land cover and soil datasets input to swat the reader is referred to supplement figs s3 s6 for time series plots of stream discharge at the florence lake huntington lake and mammoth pool stream gauges during the calibration and validation periods for both the globally and locally calibrated models 4 2 simulated δet versus elevation simulated et changes from the space for time substitution sts model showed a markedly greater sensitivity to elevation than those from the swat watershed model fig 6 sts modeled values ranged from 17 mm yr 1 at the lowest elevations 5 change from baseline values supplement table s9 to 51 mm yr 1 at the highest elevations 20 change for the 0 2 c warming case fig 6a in comparison swat modeled values ranged from approximately 20 mm yr 1 at the lowest elevations 5 change to 18 mm yr 1 at the highest elevations 8 change for the same warming case fig 6a supplement table s9 these model differences in et change sensitivity to elevation resulted in a divergence between model predictions with increasing elevation the maximum differences between model predictions occurred at the highest elevations and were 33 mm yr 1 97 difference for 0 2 c warming 32 mm yr 1 114 difference for 2 4 c warming and 30 mm yr 1 130 difference for 4 6 c warming fig 6a c this divergence in modeled et response to temperature with increasing elevation was associated with monotonic increases with elevation in outputs from the sts model and lack of such monotonicity in outputs from the swat model fig 6 the monotonic et responses from the sts model followed from the concave downward shape of the budyko curve fig 2c which predicts stronger et responses to temperature in the more elevated energy limited areas of the watershed this monotonic pattern was not produced in the elevation binned outputs from the swat model sts modeled increases in et averaged across the watershed ranged from 28 mm yr 1 8 change supplement table s9 for the 4 6 c warming case to 36 mm yr 1 11 change for the 0 2 c warming case fig 6 right the corresponding predictions from the swat model were more muted ranging from 13 mm yr 1 4 change for the 4 6 c warming case to 16 mm yr 1 5 change for the 0 2 c warming case fig 6 right these model differences were driven mainly by differing model responses at higher elevations in the sts model the upper elevations of the watershed i e the upper and mid upper bins contributed two thirds of the total volumetric increase in et m3 yr 1 in response to 0 2 c warming fig 6 with the lower elevations contributing the remaining one third in comparison the upper and lower elevations of the swat model contributed similar proportions 54 and 46 of the increased et volumes fig 6 the swat simulations revealed elevational zones of minimum et increase that migrated to higher elevations with progressive warming for 0 2 c warming this elevational zone occurred in the mid lower elevation bin fig 6a min this elevation bin was noted in section 2 to be the primary location of the rain snow transition zone based on historical november march air temperatures with progressive warming the elevational zone of minimum et increase migrated to higher elevations eventually reaching the upper elevation bin for the 4 6 c warming case fig 6c we also observed a scale dependence of prediction uncertainty from the swat model the uncertainties in predicted et change at the scale of elevation bins are greater roughly double than those at the watershed scale lengths of bars in fig 6 as an example for the 4 6 c warming scenario the 95 prediction uncertainty for the mid lower elevation bin is 2 5 times greater than for watershed averaged predictions fig 6c this scale dependency of uncertainty is presumably associated with our method of spatially integrating model outputs over hrus prior to computing simulation means and prediction uncertainties 4 3 simulated δet versus substrate slope and elevation substrate available water capacity awc and slope had a marked influence on et responses to warming in the swat simulations particularly for the mildest warming at the upper elevations fig 7 a left simulated et responses to 2 c warming averaged across slopes of the upper elevation bin ranged from 15 mm yr 1 7 change supplement table s10 for exposed bedrock to 47 mm yr 1 12 change for the highest awc soils box averages in fig 7a left for these soils nearly half 45 not shown of the simulations in the uncertainty range of swat exceeded the sts model prediction fig 7a left this demonstrates that the swat model produces stronger et responses to warming than the sts model in localized upper elevation areas with relatively thick soils fig 7d left simulated changes in et in steeper terrain of the swat model tended to be more muted than in gentler terrain a pattern more apparent at the scale of individual subbasins supplement fig s7 than elevation bins fig 7 exposed bedrock at high elevations where increases in et from swat were muted relative to the sts model occurs in approximately three fourths of the upper watershed table 1 as a result spatially averaged et responses from swat are substantially lower than predictions from the sts model fig 6 the influence of substrate awc on predictions from the swat model became less pronounced with progressive warming fig 7a c an outcome possibly related to increasing water limitations in all substrates as aridity ratios increase fig 2c in these constant precipitation experiments et reductions in response to warming are an extreme example of increased water limitations caused by earlier seasonal shifts in the timing of water availability tague et al 2009 these types of responses were captured in the prediction uncertainty range of the swat model fig 7 elevational zones where these et reductions were most pronounced migrated upward with progressive warming generally following the rain snow transition zone assuming a phase transition range of 2 to 4 c dai 2008 for the mildest warming case 0 2 c decreases in et occurred primarily in the lower half of the watershed fig 7a further warming resulted in the most pronounced decreases in et shifting to the upper elevations fig 7c this upward movement of extreme water limitation followed the zones of minimum et increase mentioned in section 4 2 strong interaction between substrate awc and elevation in the response of long term et to warming was supported by a linear regression analysis on swat outputs fig 8 this analysis showed that trends between et change and substrate awc strengthened from 0 036 mm yr 1 mm 1 r2 0 30 p value 05 in the mid lower elevations to 0 25 mm yr 1 mm 1 r2 0 91 p value 05 in the upper elevations trends were not statistically significant p value 05 in the lowest elevations for the mildest warming case 0 2 c the greatest simulated increases in et from the swat model occurred in high elevation soils falling into the highest awc bin 91 mm offering the most water capacity for plants fig 9 a and b these simulations occurred in subbasins 9 and 22 of the upper elevation bin sandy loam soils of the notned series and subbasins 1 and 2 of the mid upper elevation bin sandy loam soils of the gerle series fig 1 supplement fig s1 for these soils in the upper elevation bin subbasins 9 and 22 over half of the simulations in the prediction uncertainty range of swat exceeded the sts prediction for the mildest warming case supplement fig s7a substrate bin awc 2 these hot spots of et change are localized covering only 6 of these subbasins supplement fig s7d shifting from hot spots to cold spots the lowest simulated increases in et from swat for the mildest warming case occurred in subbasins of the mid lower elevation bin fig 9a and b this elevation range corresponds to the zone of minimum et increase shown in fig 6a these modeled responses occurred in loamy sand toem series of subbasin 20 and sandy loam shaver series of subbasin 34 fig 1 supplement fig s1 with regard to watershed model uncertainty exposed bedrock in the upper elevations of the watershed exhibited relatively low prediction uncertainties from swat fig 9c 5 discussion 5 1 choice of space for time substitution method our finding of substantial differences in high elevation et sensitivity to temperature between a space for time substitution sts model and an integrated watershed model would remain unchanged if we had employed other sts methods e g studies described in supplement section s1 for example the watershed scale et sensitivity to temperature from our sts model was 17 mm yr 1 c 1 over a 0 4 c range of warming fig 6a and b the upper elevations contributed most two thirds to the total volumetric changes in et in comparison using an sts method based on nonlinear regression between et temperature and precipitation goulden and bales 2014 estimated an et sensitivity to temperature of approximately 30 mm yr 1 c 1 in the upper kings river watershed neighboring to the south their prediction was attributed mainly to et responses above 2000 m elevation i e near the median elevation of our study area moreover we showed in supplement section s1 that predicted long term changes in runoff yield based on the sts method of berghuijs et al 2014 would be similar to values based on the above method of goulden and bales 2014 therefore the differences in et sensitivity to air temperature between our sts model and integrated watershed model would likely be greater if we had employed other previously used sts methods 5 2 factors behind δet differences between watershed model and sts model we recognized three possible factors contributing to differences in predicted et sensitivity to air temperature between the sts and swat models the first and perhaps most apparent factor is the strong elevational dependence of substrate awc and ground slope in our study area properties implicitly varied between scenarios of the sts model and sts models in general via translations in budyko space fig 2c but not varied between scenarios of the swat model the range in swat modeled et sensitivities to temperature across the awc bins at upper elevations 16 mm yr 1 c 1 box averages in fig 7a left exceeded the simulated value averaged across those same awc bins 9 mm yr 1 c 1 short dashed line fig 7a left this indicates that the spatial variability in substrate awc is particularly important to consider in predictions of et sensitivity to temperature at high elevations of this watershed however the influence of substrate properties appears to be temperature dependent as the differences in et sensitivity to temperature across different awc bins in fig 7 become smaller with progressive warming in the upper san joaquin river watershed high elevation responses of et to warming are strongly mediated by the abundance of exposed bedrock on steep slopes and the paucity of thick soils on gentle slopes fig 7d these characteristics can determine whether warming induced increases in potential et translate to increases or decreases in actual et in other watersheds exhibiting less variation in substrate awc with elevation substrate properties may play a lesser role in long term et responses to warming the second possible factor is the tendency for a snow to rain transition to mute offset any increases in et relative to the changes that would occur in the absence of such phase transition jeton and dettinger 1996 risbey and entekhabi 1996 dettinger et al 2004 tague et al 2009 this effect would occur if the snow to rain transition causes the timing of water availability to become more out of sync from the seasonal timing of potential et this phenomenon is well illustrated in our swat model results by zones of minimum et increase that follow the rain snow transition zone to higher elevations with progressive warming these zones may correspond to the zones of maximum change in summer water deficit simulated for the upper merced river watershed by tague et al 2009 which also migrated to higher elevations with progressive warming in our simulations mildest warming 2 c in the mid lower elevation bin produced a relatively weak et response fig 7a that was substantially below the sts prediction we attribute this to the above muting effect of a snow to rain transition with further warming et responses in this elevation bin become stronger and more in line with the sts prediction fig 7b and c as this region becomes too warm to remain in the rain snow transition zone the third factor is the effect of warming on the distribution of forest species kelly and goulden 2008 goulden et al 2012 an effect that is implicitly included in sts models including ours we implicitly included this effect by assuming a temporal stationarity in the lapse rate of potential et versus elevation section 3 3 the effect of warming on forest properties represents a potentially important interaction between climate and potential et and was not simulated in our swat model which varied only air temperature while holding all other factors fixed 5 3 effect of landscape properties on high elevation et sensitivities to temperature our swat watershed model results suggest that high elevations of the upper san joaquin river watershed will exhibit a large range in et sensitivities to air temperature owing to the coexistence of exposed bedrock interspersed with sparse soils high topographic relief and energy limited conditions fig 2c widespread areas of bedrock covering approximately three fourths of the upper watershed exhibited muted low et responses to warming in terms of magnitudes and uncertainties figs 7 and 9 this is attributed to limited infiltration and water holding capacities supplement table s1 resulting in an abundance of rapid flow paths i e overland and lateral flow out of subbasins rapid flows are conducive to limited water availability during relatively warm conditions troch et al 2013 garcia and tague 2015 and may also cause snow to rain transitions to produce more asynchronous changes in timing of water availability and water demand tague et al 2009 than would occur for substrates with greater infiltration and water holding capacities weathered bedrock is known to potentially be an important source of water for vegetation witty et al 2003 bales et al 2011 kitajima et al 2013 although this source of water was included in our swat model simulations as revap and was calibrated over the suggested range supplement table s5 controlling parameter gw revap its influence was not sufficient to produce strong et responses to warming in high elevation areas lacking soils the relatively low values and uncertainties in simulated et responses to warming in high elevation areas of exposed bedrock suggests with relative certainty that runoff yields from these areas will be resilient to warming this may provide a useful insight for spatial assessments of future water supplies in high elevation regions predictions of future runoff timing needed for water management and planning would benefit from the use of gcm based climate projections e g miller et al 2003 dettinger et al 2004 ficklin et al 2012 the swat model produced particularly strong et responses to warming in high elevation sandy loams notned and gerle series of the upper and mid upper elevation bins of the watershed section 4 3 figs 1 and 9a the greatest simulated et responses occurred in the notned soil series of subbasin 9 fig 1 for the mildest warming case 0 2 c with a mean simulation of 69 mm yr 1 20 change and a maximum simulation of 83 mm yr 1 20 change in the 95 prediction uncertainty range supplement fig s7a and table s11 vegetation responses to warming in these localized hot spots of et change will likely contrast markedly with vegetation responses in neighboring areas where soils are thin or absent section 4 3 figs 7 9 supplement fig s7 a finding that is consistent with observation based studies demonstrating the important effect of soil and regolith properties on the composition and growth rate of forests witty et al 2003 meyer et al 2007 osborn et al 2014 our findings also expand on the work of tague et al 2009 by clarifying the important role of hydrogeology and slope on warming induced responses of et in high elevation energy limited regions using the rhessys watershed model tague et al 2009 showed that et could increase by approximately 20 in response to 4 c warming at high elevations of the central sierra nevada we showed that similar percent changes in long term et are possible at high elevations of the upper san joaquin river watershed fig 7 supplement table s10 but that they would be limited to sparse areas containing relatively thick soils on gentle slopes high elevation areas of exposed bedrock and sparse soils e g notned gerle series which will likely exhibit contrasting responses of et to warming may provide interesting paired study sites for examining the role of hydrogeology on forest responses to potential climate change high elevation soils in the notned and gerle soil series can be located from the maps in fig 1 and supplement fig s1 and the soil descriptions in supplement table s1 the notned soil series consists of deep exceeding 1 4 m well drained soils formed in colluvium or glacial material consisting of bouldery coarse sandy loam https soilseries sc egov usda gov the gerle soil series consists of deep exceeding 1 5 m well drained soils formed in glacial till glacial outwash and alluvium consisting of sandy loam https soilseries sc egov usda gov we attribute the strong et responses of these soils at high elevations to a combination of low baseline aridity ratios pet p indicative of energy limitations fig 2c and abundant snowmelt to satisfy water demands during the growing season possible reasons for the apparent decreasing influence of soil types on et increases at progressively higher temperatures noted in section 4 3 are not entirely clear but may include large scale shifts from energy to water limitations as per the budyko framework and water limitations associated with upward shifts of the rain snow transition zone to higher elevations with progressive warming section 5 2 6 conclusion our objective in this study was to examine the spatial variability in long term responses of et to increased air temperature across different elevations substrate available water capacities and slopes of a snow influenced watershed we did this by comparing simulations from an integrated watershed model swat to those from a space for time substitution sts model that used the budyko hypothesis in conjunction with long term water flux observations the greatest spatial variability in swat model results occurred for relatively mild warming 0 2 c of subbasins in the highest elevation bin examined 2800 3420 m upper quartile of watershed here simulated increases in et from swat ranged from 17 mm yr 1 7 change in exposed bedrock on all slopes to 69 mm yr 1 20 change in sparsely distributed sandy loam soil on gentle slopes 20 grade the upper end of this range exceeded predictions from the sts model at these elevations demonstrating that the watershed model could produce high elevation et responses at least as strong as the sts model however because of the preponderance of exposed bedrock and steep terrain at the higher elevations the swat and sts models produced markedly different et responses for both the upper elevation bin and watershed as a whole the sts model produced watershed scale increases in et a factor of 2 3 2 6 greater than those from the swat model depending on warming scenarios with the upper half of the watershed contributing most approximately two thirds to these differences these results suggest that watershed scale responses of et to warming from integrated watershed models may be substantially lower by a factor of 2 3 in our study than predictions from space for time substitution models for snow influenced high elevation systems such as the upper san joaquin river watershed our results also suggest that long term responses of vegetation water use and stream runoff to warming in high elevation energy limited regions will depend strongly on local hydrogeologic conditions which can show great variability with elevation and exhibit physical evolution on a millennial timescale holbrook et al 2014 acknowledgments technical assistance was provided by karim abbaspour otto alvarez jacob flanagan jon herman
