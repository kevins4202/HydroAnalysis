5895,topography is a key control of mountain ecosystems and the corresponding ecohydrological processes in mountain environments this study examines the influence of topography on variations in mountain ecohydrology under climate warming in the taihang mountains in china the biogeochemicalcycles biome bgc ecosystem model was modified and used to evaluate ecosystem evapotranspiration et and net primary productivity npp for deciduous broadleaf trees shrubs and grass at different elevation gradients and examine the changes in these variables under a 3 c warming scenario with no precipitation changes the results showed that the et and npp of deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs increased with elevation below 1500 m and decreased with elevation above 1500 m the npp and et of deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs decreased in response to warming below 1500 m and increased above 1500 m for grass the et and npp slightly decreased with greater elevation and increased under climate warming combined with the influence of precipitation on et and npp the response to warming can be explained as follows deciduous broadleaf trees are under water stress in low middle elevation and under energy stress in high elevation shrubs were influenced by water conditions with an optimal precipitation of 600 mm at low middle elevation and under energy stress in high elevation grass was under energy stress at all elevations the results of this study are important for identifying topographic and climate change impacts on mountain ecosystem and can provide support for planning and management of future ecosystem restoration in the taihang mountains keywords topography ecosystem evapotranspiration net primary productivity taihang mountains climate warming 1 introduction ecosystems in mountainous areas are an important component of the carbon c cycle mountain topography especially elevation strongly affects ecosystem productivity and vegetation water use in mountainous areas mcnab 1992 panthi et al 2018 mountain topography creates spatial heterogeneities in many environmental characteristics for example mountain topography generates considerable spatial variability in air temperature incoming solar radiation precipitation and soil water content baird and wilby 1999 these variations result in ecohydrological differences along elevation gradients such as differences in evapotranspiration et and net primary productivity npp tague and peng 2013 tague et al 2009 previous studies have identified topography as a main determinant of ecosystem npp and et in mountainous areas braun et al 2018 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 for example bolstad et al 2000 provided empirical evidence indicating that both leaf area index lai and aboveground npp decreased significantly from 700 to 1600 m elevation in southern appalachian deciduous forests the relation between topography and npp or et differs among different mountainous areas because the topographic control on npp and et strongly relies on factors restricting the vegetation growth such as temperature or water limits climate change is anticipated to significantly change mountain ecosystems and corresponding ecohydrological processes tague et al 2009 the changes may include npp or et increase under warmer temperatures and decrease due to water stress case and peterson 2005 found that mid elevation chronologies were negatively correlated with growing season maximum temperature which is related to summer soil moisture stress however high elevation chronologies were positively correlated with annual temperatures in the north cascade range north america increased summer temperature has increased the npp of some high elevation forests because they were previously temperature limited graumlich et al 1989 even within a single species vegetation at high or low elevation may face different growth limitations for example in temperature or water chapin iii et al 2002 for different vegetation species in large mountainous area the mechanisms of their responses to climate change across elevation gradients are complicated zhang et al 2019 the understandings of these mechanisms are important to future ecosystem management however the relative limited monitoring resources in mountainous areas make it a key research challenge mechanistic ecosystem models can serve as useful tools for evaluating the effects of environmental change on vegetation tatarinov et al 2011 given the topographic variations and climate warming influences discussed above mountain ecosystems are logical regions for applying such models ecosystem models have been widely used for studies of climate change impacts on ecosystems dai et al 2015 eastaugh et al 2011 kaplan et al 2012 lagergren et al 2006 olesen et al 2007 dong et al 2019 however few studies have focused on topographic variations because most ecosystem models focus on a single site some regional ecosystem models have shown their ability in studying the interactions between topography and ecosystem tague et al 2009 tatarinov et al 2011 however the differences between species have not been investigated the taihang mountains are a mountainous area in north china which play important roles in ecological service water conservation and climate regulation for surrounding regions hu et al 2019 the chinese government has implemented the virescence project of taihang mountains project to recover vegetation and conserve water understanding the influence of topography and climate change on different vegetation species is important for planning and management of ecosystem restoration as well as increasing the green water use efficiency wue in this study the biogeochemical cycles biome bgc mechanistic ecosystem model of eco hydrological processes white et al 2000 was used to estimate topographic impacts on water and carbon interactions for different vegetation species under climate warming in the taihang mountains china the advantages of biome bgc are that all plant litter and soil c soil nitrogen n and water pools and fluxes are entirely prognostic and it is a process model which algorithms represent physical and biological processes that control fluxes of c n and water the model has been documented to realistically predict npp and et of different ecosystems in china bai et al 2014 han et al 2014 li et al 2013 mao et al 2016 qingling and baolin 2016 sun et al 2017 tian et al 2017 wang et al 2005 2009 yan et al 2016a 2016b therefore biome bgc is a reliable tool to simulate ecosystems in the taihang mountains differently from previous studies we modified biome bgc to perform simulation in large region and we examined the combined impacts from topography and climate change on different vegetation the following questions were addressed in this study 1 how npp and et of different vegetation species deciduous broadleaf trees shrubs and grass vary with elevation 2 how npp and et respond to climate warming in different elevation groups and 3 how the tradeoff between water and energy limits affects the npp and et response to climate warming this study presents insight into the water c interaction in mountainous areas and provides scientific support for ecosystem management under future climate change in the taihang mountains 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area 112 116 e 35 40 n is the taihang mountains in the haihe river basin a mountainous region in north china that is rich in resources the study area is in a temperate monsoon region its annual precipitation is 400 800 mm with high inter annual variability the precipitation is not uniformly distributed throughout the year with the majority falling in the summer from may to october the precipitation in the eastern foothills is larger than that in the western foothills the annual average temperature is 10 3 c with four distinct seasons the elevation of the study area is from 50 to 2942 m and the elevation in the west is greater than that in the east the digital elevation model dem is shown in fig 1 the study area is in a temperate deciduous broadleaf forest zone the vegetation on the windward slope is denser than that on the leeward slope the main vegetation types in this area are deciduous broadleaf trees shrubs and grass and are distributed as shown in fig 1 2 2 model description biome bgc is a mechanistic ecosystem process model that estimates the storage and flux of energy water c and n for the vegetation and soil components of terrestrial ecosystems the physical and biological processes that its algorithms represents include leaf growth and litter fall sunlight interception precipitation routing to leaves and soil snow accumulation and melting drainage and runoff evaporation from soil and wet leaves transpiration photosynthesis uptake of n from the soil distribution of c and n to growing plant parts decomposition mortality and fire running and coughlan 1988 the model is designed to realistically simulate ecosystem water c and n cycling at daily time steps the model is mainly driven by three types of information site specific parameters site latitude elevation soil texture effective soil depth shortwave albedo annual mean deposition and biological fixation of n meteorological data maximum temperature minimum temperature daytime average temperature total precipitation daylight average vapor pressure deficit daylight average shortwave radiation flux density and daylength and eco physiological parameters such as canopy specific leaf area light extinction coefficient and c n of different plant components for a vegetation type in biome bgc npp is based on gross primary production simulated with the farquhar photosynthesis model farquhar et al 1980 minus maintenance respiration mr calculated as a function of tissue n concentration ryan 1991 and growth respiration gr a constant fraction of gross primary production in biome bgc et is the sum of canopy evaporation of intercepted water transpiration from leaves and soil evaporation the penman monteith equation monteith and unsworth 2008 mcnaughton and jarvis 1983 waring and running 2007 which uses characteristics of a particular surface e g surface resistances and current meteorological data e g wind incoming radiation vapor pressure deficit air temperature and air pressure is used to calculate the evaporation of canopy intercepted water the transpiration and the soil evaporation biome bgc is a one dimensional model which means it represents a particular point in space in this study we modified biome bgc version 4 2 to perform ecosystem simulation in the large region the study region was first divided into sub basins each sub basin was then divided into 1 to 10 contour bands the contour bands are the simulation units we added a loop in the biome bgc to perform simulations continuously for all vegetation species in all units input data were prepared for each unit the input modules and data structures were modified to read and store the inputs of all units the output modules were also modified to perform output for each unit 2 3 data processing model inputs included meteorology topography soil and co2 data these data were collected from a variety of sources table 1 the meteorological data were taken from the china meteorological administration cma topographic data were obtained from the global dem gtopo30 data developed by the us geological survey s eros data center http www temis nl data gtopo30 html the soil data comprising a map of soil types and corresponding characteristics including the thickness and composition of every soil type were from national second soil survey data national soil survey office 1995 the soil map scale was 1 1 000 000 the co2 concentration data were from annual co2 concentrations given in the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar4 christensen et al 2007 and wmo greenhouse gas bulletins world meteorological organization 2015 data processing involved 1 dividing the study area into calculation units which were contour bands in sub basins in this study 2 assigning soil information to each unit and 3 creating spatial interpolations of meteorological data jia et al 2006 arcgis esri redlands ca usa was used to prepare the data after data processing all the data layers were allocated to each calculation unit 2 4 calibration and verification most of the biophysical parameters used in the model in this study were taken from white et al 2000 the parameters that showed high control over npp and lai in white et al 2000 were calibrated based on lai observations the biophysical parameter calibration of deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs was based on the lai observations of the chongling experimental station in hebei province china located in the study area at the chongling experimental station the lai of typical deciduous broadleaf tree species in this area robinia pseudoacacia and a typical shrub vitex negundo var heterophylla were measured in the growing season of 2014 tan 2016 the measured site specific parameters site latitude elevation soil texture and effective soil depth and the meteorological data of 2014 at the chongling station were used in the calibration the globally averaged co2 concentration in 2014 of 397 7 ppm world meteorological organization 2015 was used in the calibration the biophysical parameter calibrations for grass were based on the lai observations in 2005 of the beijing forest station sang et al 2010 which is also in the study area the measured site specific parameters at the beijing station and the meteorological data of 2005 from a nearby climate station were used in the calibration we compared these observational data with biome bgc model outputs at the study site the simulation was started using the default parameter values from white et al 2000 which are the mean values from the literature for each vegetation type the c fixation pathway of dominant grass in the study area was c3 and thus the parameters of c3 grass were used for the grass simulation the parameters that showed high control on npp and lai white et al 2000 were adjusted by comparing outputs with observational data the parameters for the three vegetation types deciduous broadleaf trees shrubs and grass were calibrated by trial and error table 2 the simulation results showed that the simulated lai matched well with observed lai with a coefficient of 0 94 fig 2 this indicates that the simulation was reasonable and the parameters were suitable for this area verifying the ecological model over large areas remains a challenge the common method is to compare outputs with other research results or remote sensing data in our model verification process we compared simulated annual npp with results from other studies table 3 shows the values of npp from this study and from other studies which demonstrate that the npp simulation is reasonable 2 5 scenario settings there were two scenarios in this analysis the first was the historical scenario which used historical daily climate records from 1956 to 2005 the second was the warming scenario which used a 3 c temperature increase applied uniformly across the historical daily climate record although future climate change is likely to include both precipitation and temperature we focused on the impact of temperature change according to ipcc ar4 a median warming of about 3 c by the end of the 21st century is projected by the mmd a1b general circulation model christensen et al 2007 thus we used 3 c as a moderate representation of the future temperature increase in each scenario the three main vegetation types in the taihang mountains deciduous broadleaf trees shrubs and grass were simulated by the biome bgc model in 4247 calculation units the annual et and npp of each vegetation type in each unit were calculated from daily model outputs as well as the related elements annual maximum lai and annual wue wue was defined as the ratio of c gain during plant photosynthesis npp to water loss during evapotranspiration et in this study tian et al 2010 1 w u e n p p e t r software r core team 2016 was used to analyze the simulation results and perform statistical analysis the mean elevation of calculation units in the study area ranged from 64 to 2615 m individual calculation units were classified into six elevation groups 0 500 1000 1500 2000 and 2500 m each group contained units with elevations close to the group s labeled elevation for example the 500 m group contained units with elevations ranging from 250 to 749 m boxplots of annual et npp maximum lai and wue in each elevation group were made to examine their median quartiles maximum and minimum values the annual precipitation in this study area ranged from 390 to 772 mm in each elevation group units were classified into five annual precipitation groups 400 500 600 700 and 800 mm the classification rule was the same as for the elevation groups the mean values of annual et and npp in each precipitation group were calculated from the simulation results 3 results 3 1 changes with elevation fig 3 shows the boxplots of changes in annual et npp and wue for deciduous broadleaf trees shrubs and grass in each elevation group in the historical scenario the annual et of different elevation groups for each vegetation type was significantly different kruskal wallis test for deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs the median et of each elevation group increased with increasing elevation below 1500 m above 1500 m the et decreased sharply for grass the median et decreased slightly with the higher elevation the annual npp of different elevation groups for each vegetation type was significantly different kruskal wallis test for deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs the median npp of each elevation group increased with greater elevation below 1500 m whereas the npp decreased sharply above 1500 m for grass the median npp slightly decreased with increasing elevation the wue was significantly different among the different elevation groups for each vegetation type kruskal wallis test the wue changes were similar to et and npp for deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs the median wue of each elevation group increased with elevation below 1500 m above 1500 m the wue decreased sharply for grass the median wue slightly decreased with the elevation increase 3 2 response to warming by elevation fig 4 shows the annual et npp and wue changes for deciduous broadleaf trees shrubs and grass in a 3 c warming scenario for each elevation group the changes represent the differences between mean values of the warming scenario and historical scenario section 3 1 of each elevation group for deciduous broadleaf trees the et decreased in response to warming below 1500 m and the rate of decrease increased as elevation decreased the et increased above 1500 m and the rate of change increased with elevation for shrubs et had similar changes in response to warming except that et decreased around 2500 m for grass et at every elevation showed little change in response to warming the et increased below 2000 m and decreased at 2500 m the npp changes because of warming were similar to those of et for deciduous broadleaf trees the npp decreased in response to warming below 1500 m and increased above 1500 m the npp increased markedly 147 at 2500 m for shrubs the npp had similar changes in response to warming except that npp decreased at 2500 m for grass the npp increased 5 13 at every elevation in response to warming the wue changes because of warming were similar to those of npp for deciduous broadleaf trees the wue decreased in response to warming below 1500 m and increased above 1500 m the wue increased notably 191 at 2500 m for shrubs the wue had similar changes in response to warming except for a small increase at 2500 m for grass the wue increased 2 15 at every elevation in response to warming 3 3 response to warming for precipitation fig 5 shows the changes in the annual et and npp of each elevation group in different annual precipitation groups in the historical scenario there were only 10 units in the 800 mm group so the 800 mm group was not included in the results analysis because of the small sample size for deciduous broadleaf trees annual et and npp below 1500 m showed little change with annual precipitation for shrubs annual et and npp below 1500 m was largest when annual precipitation was around 600 mm except for units with an elevation around 500 m for grass there was no relationship between annual et npp and precipitation in each elevation group fig 6 shows the annual et and npp changes of each elevation group in a 3 c warming scenario in different annual precipitation groups in the warming scenario the annual et and npp change for deciduous broadleaf trees was positive for elevations above 2000 m and negative for elevations below 1500 m for units with elevations above 2000 m the relationship between et or npp changes and precipitation were not unified for shrubs the annual et and npp changes were positive around 2000 m but the changes were less than those for deciduous trees for grass there were no obvious differences among different precipitation groups 4 discussion use of a mechanistic model of ecological processes allowed us to examine the relationships between climate topography and vegetation et and npp the results showed that the response of et and npp to topography and climate warming varied among different vegetation types reflecting the relatively well understood water balance and energy controls on et and npp of different vegetation types deciduous broadleaf trees at high elevations were energy limited because the et and npp were relatively low fig 3 and increased under the warming scenario fig 4 energy control on tree growth at high elevations is common bräuning and mantwill 2004 fan et al 2008 panthi et al 2018 climate warming offers more energy for vegetation growth in an energy limited areas so the et and npp tended to increase at high elevations rogora et al 2018 the et and npp at low elevations tend to decrease in the warming scenario fig 4 which may have been caused by water limitation aggravated by climate warming band 1996 jiao et al 2016 kerns et al 2018 another possible explanation is the narrow climate niche of forest geng et al 2019 found forest had the lowest stability among nature vegetation in the taihang mountains which indicates that forest has a low adaptive capacity to changing temperature gradients compared with shrubs and grass under climate warming the temperature at low elevation may exceed the optimal temperature zone for forest the artificial forest was one of the main measures for ecosystem restoration in the taihang mountains our results suggested the artificial forests at high elevation may be improved under climate warming and those at low elevation may need adaptive management for climate warming for shrubs there was an optimal moisture condition of 600 mm of annual precipitation above or below which the plant growth was limited at low middle elevation fig 5 2458 units were in the 600 mm precipitation group which means the shrubs in more than half of the units are under optimal moisture condition the et and npp at low middle elevation in most of the precipitation groups decreased under warming including the 600 mm group fig 6 the results indicate that the shrubs in the study area are sensitive both to temperature and precipitation there is great uncertainty about future precipitation changes collins et al 2013 therefore the changes of shrubs at low or middle elevation can be expected to rely on both warming and precipitation changes in the future at high elevation similar to the deciduous broadleaf trees the shrubs were under energy limit climate warming was predicted to increase et and npp of the shrubs at high elevation for grass the et and npp slightly decreased with elevation indicating that the energy conditions controlled et and npp because the water demand for grass was less than that for trees precipitation had least impact on grass fig 5 grass also showed wide adaptability at different elevations at high elevation the npp of trees and shrubs decrease sharply with elevation increase whereas the npp grass showed a relatively small decrease grass was the most important vegetation type at high elevation because trees and shrubs are energy limited at high elevation bai and zhang 2018 more attention should be paid to grass in high elevation area during ecosystem management in this area the et and npp of the grass increased slightly at most elevations in the warming scenario this indicates that grass growth would increase under climate warming wue the ratio of npp to et is an essential indicator for studying the interactive effects because it couples the water and carbon cycles very well tian et al 2010 at low middle elevation the wue of different vegetation type decreased in the order deciduous broadleaf trees shrubs grass at high elevation grass had the highest wue different vegetation types responded differently to the elevation gradient however the different vegetation responses were similar under climate warming at a specific elevation within the gradient vegetation at low elevations decreased or only slightly increased their wue however vegetation at high elevations increased their wue our model results showed that different vegetation types responded differently to climate warming these responses may cause ecosystem structure changes in the long term however we only focused on short term responses further studies on ecosystem structure changes should be carried out using species succession models 5 conclusion in this study we examined the topographic variability involved in assessing et and npp responses of different vegetation types in the taihang mountains to climate warming the mechanical ecosystem model biome bgc was modified and used to perform simulation of the study area field data in the study area was used to calibrate and verify the model the model results for et and npp of three main vegetation species deciduous broadleaf trees shrubs and grass of a historical scenario and a 3 c warming scenario are presented by 6 elevation groups the et and npp of deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs increased with elevation below 1500 m and decreased with elevation above 1500 m the npp and et of deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs decreased in response to warming below 1500 m and increased above 1500 m for grass the et and npp slightly decreased with greater elevation and increased under climate warming combined with the influence of precipitation on et and npp the response to warming can be explained as follows deciduous broadleaf trees are under water stress in low middle elevation and under energy stress in high elevation shrubs were influenced by water conditions with an optimal precipitation of 600 mm at low middle elevation and under energy stress in high elevation grass was under energy stress at all elevations the results from this model based study serve as a hypothesis for how actual ecosystems will respond to climate warming based on the results of this study the vegetation in the high elevation of this area will be improved under climate warming however some vegetation in the low middle elevation may face potential risk the water resources and ecosystem carbon budget would also be influenced vegetation in the low middle elevation may need adaptive management for climate warming credit authorship contribution statement hui peng conceptualization

types and corresponding characteristics including the thickness and composition of every soil type were from national second soil survey data national soil survey office 1995 the soil map scale was 1 1 000 000 the co2 concentration data were from annual co2 concentrations given in the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar4 christensen et al 2007 and wmo greenhouse gas bulletins world meteorological organization 2015 data processing involved 1 dividing the study area into calculation units which were contour bands in sub basins in this study 2 assigning soil information to each unit and 3 creating spatial interpolations of meteorological data jia et al 2006 arcgis esri redlands ca usa was used to prepare the data after data processing all the data layers were allocated to each calculation unit 2 4 calibration and verification most of the biophysical parameters used in the model in this study were taken from white et al 2000 the parameters that showed high control over npp and lai in white et al 2000 were calibrated based on lai observations the biophysical parameter calibration of deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs was based on the lai observations of the chongling experimental station in hebei province china located in the study area at the chongling experimental station the lai of typical deciduous broadleaf tree species in this area robinia pseudoacacia and a typical shrub vitex negundo var heterophylla were measured in the growing season of 2014 tan 2016 the measured site specific parameters site latitude elevation soil texture and effective soil depth and the meteorological data of 2014 at the chongling station were used in the calibration the globally averaged co2 concentration in 2014 of 397 7 ppm world meteorological organization 2015 was used in the calibration the biophysical parameter calibrations for grass were based on the lai observations in 2005 of the beijing forest station sang et al 2010 which is also in the study area the measured site specific parameters at the beijing station and the meteorological data of 2005 from a nearby climate station were used in the calibration we compared these observational data with biome bgc model outputs at the study site the simulation was started using the default parameter values from white et al 2000 which are the mean values from the literature for each vegetation type the c fixation pathway of dominant grass in the study area was c3 and thus the parameters of c3 grass were used for the grass simulation the parameters that showed high control on npp and lai white et al 2000 were adjusted by comparing outputs with observational data the parameters for the three vegetation types deciduous broadleaf trees shrubs and grass were calibrated by trial and error table 2 the simulation results showed that the simulated lai matched well with observed lai with a coefficient of 0 94 fig 2 this indicates that the simulation was reasonable and the parameters were suitable for this area verifying the ecological model over large areas remains a challenge the common method is to compare outputs with other research results or remote sensing data in our model verification process we compared simulated annual npp with results from other studies table 3 shows the values of npp from this study and from other studies which demonstrate that the npp simulation is reasonable 2 5 scenario settings there were two scenarios in this analysis the first was the historical scenario which used historical daily climate records from 1956 to 2005 the second was the warming scenario which used a 3 c temperature increase applied uniformly across the historical daily climate record although future climate change is likely to include both precipitation and temperature we focused on the impact of temperature change according to ipcc ar4 a median warming of about 3 c by the end of the 21st century is projected by the mmd a1b general circulation model christensen et al 2007 thus we used 3 c as a moderate representation of the future temperature increase in each scenario the three main vegetation types in the taihang mountains deciduous broadleaf trees shrubs and grass were simulated by the biome bgc model in 4247 calculation units the annual et and npp of each vegetation type in each unit were calculated from daily model outputs as well as the related elements annual maximum lai and annual wue wue was defined as the ratio of c gain during plant photosynthesis npp to water loss during evapotranspiration et in this study tian et al 2010 1 w u e n p p e t r software r core team 2016 was used to analyze the simulation results and perform statistical analysis the mean elevation of calculation units in the study area ranged from 64 to 2615 m individual calculation units were classified into six elevation groups 0 500 1000 1500 2000 and 2500 m each group contained units with elevations close to the group s labeled elevation for example the 500 m group contained units with elevations ranging from 250 to 749 m boxplots of annual et npp maximum lai and wue in each elevation group were made to examine their median quartiles maximum and minimum values the annual precipitation in this study area ranged from 390 to 772 mm in each elevation group units were classified into five annual precipitation groups 400 500 600 700 and 800 mm the classification rule was the same as for the elevation groups the mean values of annual et and npp in each precipitation group were calculated from the simulation results 3 results 3 1 changes with elevation fig 3 shows the boxplots of changes in annual et npp and wue for deciduous broadleaf trees shrubs and grass in each elevation group in the historical scenario the annual et of different elevation groups for each vegetation type was significantly different kruskal wallis test for deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs the median et of each elevation group increased with increasing elevation below 1500 m above 1500 m the et decreased sharply for grass the median et decreased slightly with the higher elevation the annual npp of different elevation groups for each vegetation type was significantly different kruskal wallis test for deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs the median npp of each elevation group increased with greater elevation below 1500 m whereas the npp decreased sharply above 1500 m for grass the median npp slightly decreased with increasing elevation the wue was significantly different among the different elevation groups for each vegetation type kruskal wallis test the wue changes were similar to et and npp for deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs the median wue of each elevation group increased with elevation below 1500 m above 1500 m the wue decreased sharply for grass the median wue slightly decreased with the elevation increase 3 2 response to warming by elevation fig 4 shows the annual et npp and wue changes for deciduous broadleaf trees shrubs and grass in a 3 c warming scenario for each elevation group the changes represent the differences between mean values of the warming scenario and historical scenario section 3 1 of each elevation group for deciduous broadleaf trees the et decreased in response to warming below 1500 m and the rate of decrease increased as elevation decreased the et increased above 1500 m and the rate of change increased with elevation for shrubs et had similar changes in response to warming except that et decreased around 2500 m for grass et at every elevation showed little change in response to warming the et increased below 2000 m and decreased at 2500 m the npp changes because of warming were similar to those of et for deciduous broadleaf trees the npp decreased in response to warming below 1500 m and increased above 1500 m the npp increased markedly 147 at 2500 m for shrubs the npp had similar changes in response to warming except that npp decreased at 2500 m for grass the npp increased 5 13 at every elevation in response to warming the wue changes because of warming were similar to those of npp for deciduous broadleaf trees the wue decreased in response to warming below 1500 m and increased above 1500 m the wue increased notably 191 at 2500 m for shrubs the wue had similar changes in response to warming except for a small increase at 2500 m for grass the wue increased 2 15 at every elevation in response to warming 3 3 response to warming for precipitation fig 5 shows the changes in the annual et and npp of each elevation group in different annual precipitation groups in the historical scenario there were only 10 units in the 800 mm group so the 800 mm group was not included in the results analysis because of the small sample size for deciduous broadleaf trees annual et and npp below 1500 m showed little change with annual precipitation for shrubs annual et and npp below 1500 m was largest when annual precipitation was around 600 mm except for units with an elevation around 500 m for grass there was no relationship between annual et npp and precipitation in each elevation group fig 6 shows the annual et and npp changes of each elevation group in a 3 c warming scenario in different annual precipitation groups in the warming scenario the annual et and npp change for deciduous broadleaf trees was positive for elevations above 2000 m and negative for elevations below 1500 m for units with elevations above 2000 m the relationship between et or npp changes and precipitation were not unified for shrubs the annual et and npp changes were positive around 2000 m but the changes were less than those for deciduous trees for grass there were no obvious differences among different precipitation groups 4 discussion use of a mechanistic model of ecological processes allowed us to examine the relationships between climate topography and vegetation et and npp the results showed that the response of et and npp to topography and climate warming varied among different vegetation types reflecting the relatively well understood water balance and energy controls on et and npp of different vegetation types deciduous broadleaf trees at high elevations were energy limited because the et and npp were relatively low fig 3 and increased under the warming scenario fig 4 energy control on tree growth at high elevations is common bräuning and mantwill 2004 fan et al 2008 panthi et al 2018 climate warming offers more energy for vegetation growth in an energy limited areas so the et and npp tended to increase at high elevations rogora et al 2018 the et and npp at low elevations tend to decrease in the warming scenario fig 4 which may have been caused by water limitation aggravated by climate warming band 1996 jiao et al 2016 kerns et al 2018 another possible explanation is the narrow climate niche of forest geng et al 2019 found forest had the lowest stability among nature vegetation in the taihang mountains which indicates that forest has a low adaptive capacity to changing temperature gradients compared with shrubs and grass under climate warming the temperature at low elevation may exceed the optimal temperature zone for forest the artificial forest was one of the main measures for ecosystem restoration in the taihang mountains our results suggested the artificial forests at high elevation may be improved under climate warming and those at low elevation may need adaptive management for climate warming for shrubs there was an optimal moisture condition of 600 mm of annual precipitation above or below which the plant growth was limited at low middle elevation fig 5 2458 units were in the 600 mm precipitation group which means the shrubs in more than half of the units are under optimal moisture condition the et and npp at low middle elevation in most of the precipitation groups decreased under warming including the 600 mm group fig 6 the results indicate that the shrubs in the study area are sensitive both to temperature and precipitation there is great uncertainty about future precipitation changes collins et al 2013 therefore the changes of shrubs at low or middle elevation can be expected to rely on both warming and precipitation changes in the future at high elevation similar to the deciduous broadleaf trees the shrubs were under energy limit climate warming was predicted to increase et and npp of the shrubs at high elevation for grass the et and npp slightly decreased with elevation indicating that the energy conditions controlled et and npp because the water demand for grass was less than that for trees precipitation had least impact on grass fig 5 grass also showed wide adaptability at different elevations at high elevation the npp of trees and shrubs decrease sharply with elevation increase whereas the npp grass showed a relatively small decrease grass was the most important vegetation type at high elevation because trees and shrubs are energy limited at high elevation bai and zhang 2018 more attention should be paid to grass in high elevation area during ecosystem management in this area the et and npp of the grass increased slightly at most elevations in the warming scenario this indicates that grass growth would increase under climate warming wue the ratio of npp to et is an essential indicator for studying the interactive effects because it couples the water and carbon cycles very well tian et al 2010 at low middle elevation the wue of different vegetation type decreased in the order deciduous broadleaf trees shrubs grass at high elevation grass had the highest wue different vegetation types responded differently to the elevation gradient however the different vegetation responses were similar under climate warming at a specific elevation within the gradient vegetation at low elevations decreased or only slightly increased their wue however vegetation at high elevations increased their wue our model results showed that different vegetation types responded differently to climate warming these responses may cause ecosystem structure changes in the long term however we only focused on short term responses further studies on ecosystem structure changes should be carried out using species succession models 5 conclusion in this study we examined the topographic variability involved in assessing et and npp responses of different vegetation types in the taihang mountains to climate warming the mechanical ecosystem model biome bgc was modified and used to perform simulation of the study area field data in the study area was used to calibrate and verify the model the model results for et and npp of three main vegetation species deciduous broadleaf trees shrubs and grass of a historical scenario and a 3 c warming scenario are presented by 6 elevation groups the et and npp of deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs increased with elevation below 1500 m and decreased with elevation above 1500 m the npp and et of deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs decreased in response to warming below 1500 m and increased above 1500 m for grass the et and npp slightly decreased with greater elevation and increased under climate warming combined with the influence of precipitation on et and npp the response to warming can be explained as follows deciduous broadleaf trees are under water stress in low middle elevation and under energy stress in high elevation shrubs were influenced by water conditions with an optimal precipitation of 600 mm at low middle elevation and under energy stress in high elevation grass was under energy stress at all elevations the results from this model based study serve as a hypothesis for how actual ecosystems will respond to climate warming based on the results of this study the vegetation in the high elevation of this area will be improved under climate warming however some vegetation in the low middle elevation may face potential risk the water resources and ecosystem carbon budget would also be influenced vegetation in the low middle elevation may need adaptive management for climate warming credit authorship contribution statement hui peng conceptualization

5896,total phosphorus tp export in rivers contributes to development of hypoxic conditions in receiving waterbodies and is typically sourced to agricultural nonpoint sources systematic quantification of tp loads and yields at a regional scale is not often reported but tp yields are known to vary considerably in this study tp yields from 46 iowa watersheds were evaluated for the period from 2000 to 2017 to evaluate long term patterns of tp export and quantify the contribution of iowa sourced tp loads to the gulf of mexico using two common load estimation programs annual mean and median tp yields ranged from 0 44 to 7 71 kg ha and 0 32 to 3 75 kg ha respectively highest median yields were found in western and southern iowa the weighted average tp yield for iowa was 1 70 kg ha and on average iowa s tp export contributes approximately 15 of the tp load to the gulf of mexico reducing tp export will require improved quantification and differentiation of sources of tp loads in midwestern rivers and a commitment to find strategies that reduce both tp and no3 n loss from agricultural lands in a complementary and additive approach keywords phosphorus nutrients iowa hypoxia agriculture 1 introduction riverine nutrients consisting principally of nitrogen n predominantly in the form of no3 n and phosphorus p are major contributors to development of hypoxic conditions in the gulf of mexico turner et al 2008 and around the world diaz 2001 although n has received more attention jones et al 2018 p export has been viewed by some researchers as the limiting nutrient in phytoplankton growth in freshwater ecosystems and coastal waters sylvan et al 2006 hecky and kilham 1988 part of the focus placed on n export has been the relative ease of monitoring of n compared to p quantifying n loads in rivers is relatively straightforward since concentrations can be adequately characterized by regular grab sampling jiang et al 2014 tiemeyer et al 2010 or with the use of no3 n sensors davis et al 2014 feng et al 2013 whereas total phosphorus tp concentrations and loads are difficult to measure with much certainty sources of tp sum of particulate and dissolved p vary in watersheds but nonpoint sources of p are considered dominant in agricultural regions jacobson et al 2011 jarvie et al 2013 farm fertilizers manure and urban inputs comprise the largest tp sources jacobson et al 2011 robertson and saad 2013 p losses to the environment can occur through highly episodic event driven transport or through more continuous groundwater or tile drainage discharge stamm et al 2013 episodic p delivery is dominated by surface runoff and erosion of sediment bound p from agricultural fields sharpley and withers 1994 whereas groundwater or tile drainage sources contribute to soluble p losses gentry et al 2007 king et al 2014 2015 smith et al 2015 the proportion of soluble p to tp concentrations and loads in agricultural watersheds can vary greatly schilling et al 2017c gentry et al 2007 schilling et al 2017b found that orthophosphorus op contributions from croplands were greater in watersheds characterized by widespread tile drainage and well drained soils whereas tp export was dominated by particulate p in dissected till plains with poorly drained soils overall tp export from agricultural watersheds reflects contributions from both particulate and dissolved p sources integrated across various spatial and temporal scales systematic quantification of tp loads and yields at a regional scale is not often reported and when done it is usually the output of watershed models i e robertson et al 2009 jacobson et al 2011 robertson and saad 2013 white et al 2014 the united states geological survey usgs developed a sparrow spatially referenced regression on watershed attributes model to estimate tp yields and annual loads robertson et al 2009 in the mississippi atchafalaya basin marb tp yields were found to exceed 1 3 kg ha in many regions of the cornbelt likewise jacobson et al 2011 reported spatial patterns of tp yields across the marb for a january july period 1997 2006 based on estimates derived from regression models and sparrow they estimated annual tp loads ranging from 0 1 to 8 5 kg ha in marb watersheds white et al 2014 used a modeling framework of apex and swat models to evaluate p loading patterns and source in the marb and reported that average annual tp yields across watersheds in the marb ranged from 0 2 to 6 kg ha the diversity of annual tp yields in the marb is not surprising given the range of hydrologic flow pathways across many agricultural regions schilling et al 2015 proposed the idea of agro hydrologic regions to characterize cropland areas in the upper mississippi and ohio river basins using soil and slope categories in regions dominated by high relief slopes greater than or equal to 5 and poorly drained soils surface runoff will dominate tp export in recently glaciated areas the landscape is flat and poorly drained so tp losses will primarily occur via artificial drainage the state of iowa located in the heart of the u s cornbelt contains a cross section of all agro hydrologic regions found throughout the upper mississippi and ohio river basins and the diversity of annual tp yields reported for iowa is typical for the entire region in a small subset of 12 iowa watersheds schilling et al 2017c reported mean tp yields ranging from 0 8 to 4 4 kg ha quantification of annual export of tp from iowa agricultural watersheds would be expected to represent the range and magnitude of tp losses likely encountered from all cropland areas in the marb the goal of this study was to estimate and report on variations in annual tp yields from 46 iowa watersheds for the period from 2000 to 2017 18 years our specific objectives were to 1 evaluate long term statistics of tp export at the watershed and regional state scale 2 quantify the contribution of iowa sourced tp loads to the gulf of mexico and 3 investigate the correlation of median watershed scale tp yields to hydrologic and land cover characteristics study results are also intended to serve as a benchmark for other tp loading studies conducted around the world where annual yields are quantified given iowa s agricultural intensity and landscape diversity a comparison of annual tp yields to iowa based watersheds provides an important comparison for tp temporal and spatial loading patterns 2 methods and materials 2 1 regional setting the state of iowa is the largest producer of corn zea mays l and soybeans glycine max l merr in the u s as well as the leading producer of eggs and pork and the fourth largest producer of feeder cattle usda 2017 the success of the agricultural industry in the state can be sourced to the highly productive glacial derived soils and favorable climate for rain fed crop production the surficial geology of iowa is dominated by pleistocene glacial deposits consisting of fine textured glacial till and loess predominantly silt to silt loam of varying ages prior and iowa 1991 the wisconsin age des moines lobe represents the most recent glacial advance into iowa with maximum extent around 12 000 years ago fig 1 this region is poorly drained with little topographic relief and is dominated by artificial drainage in western and southern iowa the rolling hillslope landscape is comprised of a varying thickness of fine textured silt loess overlying older pre illinoian glacial till northeast iowa is largely devoid of glacial deposits and characterized by shallow carbonate bedrock often with karst topography and incised river valleys together the landscape diversity of iowa mirrors the diversity of agro hydrologic regions found throughout the upper mississippi and ohio river basins schilling et al 2015 iowa has a humid continental climate with hot and humid summers and cold and relatively dry winters average annual precipitation and temperature range from approximately 700 to 900 mm and 6 to 12c across a gradient from northwest to southeast iowa inrs 2015 corn and soybean yields average approximately 10 and 3 3 mg ha respectively typical annual p application to corn soybean and hay areas in iowa is approximately 54 kg ha from fertilizer and manure sources inrs 2015 2 2 monitoring data tp concentrations were measured at an approximate monthly frequency at 46 ambient river monitoring sites across iowa the watershed areas for the 46 sites ranged from 20 155 km2 cedar river near conesville to 88 km2 bloody run fig 1 table 1 monthly measurements are not ideal to characterize tp concentrations but this sampling frequency was established by the iowa department of natural resources idnr for their ambient river monitoring program all the ambient monitoring sites evaluated in this study were specifically located to be beyond the extent of urban areas when the statewide ambient program was established idnr 2000 there were occasional months of missing data but the sample size ranged from approximately 180 to nearly 220 for the 18 years between 2000 and 2015 all surface water samples were collected as unfiltered grab samples from mid stream bridge locations at fixed monitoring sites following an epa approved quality assurance project plan tp was quantified by digesting samples followed by the molybdenum blue procedure with lachat quickchem method lac 10 115 10 1d sample collection methods and laboratory analytical procedures were unchanged during the monitoring period tp concentration data were obtained from the idnrstoret wqx water quality database https programs iowadnr gov iastoret stream discharge data were obtained from usgs gages that are collocated with the iowa dnr monitoring sites annual discharge and tp concentrations from the mississippi atchafalaya rivers were obtained from usgs reports usgs 2017 2 3 load estimation we used two different usgs software programs load estimator or loadest and weighted regressions on time discharge and season or wrtds to estimate annual tp loads at the 46 monitoring sites loadest cohn et al 1992 runkel et al 2004 uses a rating curve approach to estimate daily tp loads using discrete samples and continuous streamflow data we used the loadest program to estimate daily tp loads in the selected rivers using the seven parameter load prediction model ln l β0 β1ln q β2 ln q 2 β3t β4t2 β5sin 2πt β6cos 2πt ε where l cq is the load or flux c is concentration q is discharge t is time in decimal years β0 β1 β6 are regression coefficients and ε is assumed to be an independent and normally distributed error with zero mean and constant variance although the model can perform poorly to estimate no3 n loads stenback et al 2011 found no consistent positive or negative bias for tp load estimation the loadest model has been used to estimate tp loads in many studies e g goolsby et al 1999 hooper et al 2001 aulenbach and hooper 2006 robertson et al 2009 white et al 2014 tp loads were also estimated using the wrtds method from the usgs egret r package hirsch and de cicco 2015 wrtds is a smoothing method to interpret the behavior of the water quality analyte of interest on the basis of four components the relationship to discharge seasonality long term trend and a random component hirsch et al 2010 the method was designed for data sets with two hundred or more measured concentration values that span a period of a decade or more wrtds estimates a gridded surface of concentration for the length of the record and over all discharges by using a regression where the actual measurements are weighted by their distance from the estimated point in time season and discharge within an adjustable window hirsch and de cicco 2014 and thus allows the relationship between concentration and discharge to change over time the grid of estimated concentration is used to estimate flux by using the actual discharge to compute a load for each day of the record wrtds has been used to estimate river loads in many studies e g sprague et al 2011 hirsch 2012 it is recognized that different load estimation methods can produce different results schilling et al 2017a hirsch 2014 and variations in tp loads can occur based on the load estimation method selected we compared the annual estimated tp yields using the two models for all monitoring sites and years n 798 and found close agreement between the two methods at low tp yields 2 kg ha based on loadest but divergence occurred when tp yields were higher fig 2 in particular the wrtds loadest ratio was close to one at low tp yields 1 01 but the ratio was 0 48 when loadest estimated loads exceeded 2 kg ha at higher tp yields the loadest method appeared to produce exceptionally high annual tp yield estimates relative to wrtds for this reason we have chosen to report tp loads and yields using the wrtds methodology in this paper the annual output from the loadest method is provided in the supplementary materials the flux bias statistic bm is a measure of the potential bias of the tp load estimate and it quantifies how well the estimated wrtds load matches the measured load on the sampling days hirsch 2014 hirsch 2014 developed a non linear relation between bm and the true error in the model output in percent em and indicated that bm values between 0 1 to 0 1 likely have a bias within 10 whereas for values near 0 2 the true bias is likely between 5 and 25 values near 0 6 may have a bias on the order of 100 125 the flux bias statistics and diagnostic outputs for the 46 river load datasets analyzed in this study are provided in the supplementary materials on a percentile basis bm for most tp monitoring sites ranged between 0 2 implying a bias of approximately 20 fig 3 a few sites showed positive or negative bm with potential bias of 100 however there was no systematic pattern of bm across the statewide monitoring sites nor were there any statistically significant relations between bm and tp yield statistics or watershed area hence the tp loads estimated using the wrtds model appear to provide reasonable estimates of annual tp loads for iowa rivers 2 4 ancillary data we compiled additional ancillary factors for the watersheds to assess their influence on tp yields precipitation data for a climate station located closest to the centroid of the watershed was obtained from the iowa environmental mesonet https mesonet agron iastate edu hydrograph separation into baseflow and runoff components was performed on the usgs discharge data collected at the 46 sites using the local minimum method sloto and crouse 1996 the hydrograph separation was conducted using the on line program what web based hydrograph analysis tool hosted by purdue university https engineering purdue edu mapserve what average annual water yield and baseflow were normalized to watershed area and reported in mm of discharge land cover information on the percent row crop area combined corn and soybean acreage was obtained using the 2009 high resolution land cover database provided by the idnr as accessed through the iowa water quality information system web site http iwqis iowawis org other variables slope percent manure percent tiled soils were summarized for their watershed areas by nielson 2017 based on compilation from idnr digital gis databases percent manure represents the potential amount of land in a watershed expressed as a percent of the total watershed area needed to utilize the amount of nitrogen in manure generated by the number of animals by confined animal feeding operations cafos assuming an n application rate of 90 kg ha to corn soybean areas similarly present tiled soils represents the percent of land in a watershed with hydric soils under corn soybean rotation tp load data for individual watersheds were compiled and summarized as annual totals in kg and divided by watershed area ha for yields summary statistics of annual yields mean median standard deviation minimum and maximum were computed pearson correlation was used to investigate the relation of hydrologic and land cover variables to watershed scale median tp yields at the 0 05 level of significance statistical analysis was performed using minitab release 18 software mintab inc state college pa 3 results 3 1 tp yields from iowa watersheds mean annual tp yields from iowa watersheds varied considerably over an 18 year period of monitoring ranging from 0 44 kg ha at bloody run creek in northeast iowa to 7 71 kg ha at middle river in southern iowa table 1 mean values were clearly influenced by maximum annual tp loads which exceeded more than 10 kg ha in 14 different watersheds two western iowa rivers draining to the missouri river boyer river and soldier river had maximum annual tp yields of 42 15 and 45 04 kg ha respectively due to large standard deviations and skewness of annual tp yields at most sites long term tp yields in iowa rivers are better represented by median values median annual tp yields ranged from 0 32 to 3 75 kg ha table 1 and as a population were best fit with a log normal distribution the majority of annual tp yields cluster near 1 kg ha but a tail of higher tp yields greater than 2 kg ha was also evident fig 2 highest median tp yields are found in western and southern iowa basins fig 4 five watersheds draining this region of the state had long term median tp yields 3 kg ha and five other watershed areas were greater than 2 kg ha in contrast tp yields in north central and northeast central iowa were 1 kg ha area weighted average tp yields were calculated for watersheds draining to the mississippi river represented by 12 rivers and missouri river 10 rivers watersheds draining to the mississippi river averaged approximately 1 30 kg ha of tp loss whereas watersheds draining to the missouri river were approximately double 2 73 kg ha median values were less but showed similar differences 1 26 vs 1 63 kg ha respectively for the state of iowa a weighted average tp yield was calculated by summing the loads from the largest basins in iowa i e did not include nested watersheds and dividing by the watershed area represented by these basins overall the weighted average tp yield for iowa was 1 70 kg ha median 1 40 kg ha ranging from 0 37 to 4 95 kg ha table 2 total tp export from iowa ranged from 5 377 to 72 182 mg and averaged 24 842 mg comparing the annual iowa tp export to the tp load exported from the mississippi river suggests that iowa s tp export contributes approximately 15 of the tp load to the gulf of mexico table 2 iowa s tp contribution to the gulf ranged from approximately 5 to 34 3 2 temporal patterns tp yields fluctuated during the 18 year period as shown by seven representative watersheds fig 5 tp yields from the boyer and middle rivers in western and southern iowa were clearly much higher than the other iowa watersheds whereas the english and turkey rivers were more intermediate and tp yields from boone beaver and floyd rivers were much lower the temporal pattern of tp yields in the boyer river were most pronounced with values increasing from approximately 1 kg ha in 2005 2006 to 42 15 kg ha in 2008 fig 5 likewise tp yields from the middle river in southern iowa also fluctuated greatly ranging from annual tp yields of 0 13 kg ha during a drought year to 35 03 kg ha during a wet year in contrast tp yields from the boone river and beaver creek fluctuated within a much narrower range during the 18 year period with annual values ranging from 0 07 to 2 10 kg ha and 0 10 to 2 57 kg ha respectively tp yields were correlated with annual precipitation at all sites but the level of correlation varied fig 5 correlation was less in the boyer and turkey rivers where pulses of annual tp loads were evident but tp variations were highly correlated with variations in precipitation at most sites p 0 01 overall the annual tp yield data clearly show that while tp export fluctuates in iowa rivers the range of fluctuations was much higher in western and southern iowa 3 3 correlation of median tp yields to other factors tp yields from 45 watersheds were correlated with watershed hydrologic and land characteristics table 3 bloody run results were excluded from the analyses because of its extremely small size and its very different hydrology karst hydrology compared to the other sites tp yields were found to be significantly positively correlated p 0 01 with mean annual precipitation mean basin slope and mean annual stormflow row crop manure application area tiled soils and mean annual baseflow mm were negatively correlated at the 0 01 probability level tp yields were not significantly correlated to precipitation and discharge but were negatively correlated to baseflow and positively correlated to stormflow fractions table 3 among the ancillary variables row crop manure applications and tile soils were positively correlated with one another and negatively correlated with slope whereas the hydrologic variables water yield baseflow stormflow and q p ratio were positively correlated with each other 4 discussion 4 1 regional patterns the magnitude and range of annual tp yields exported from iowa watersheds are striking and among the highest reported in the literature richards and baker 2002 reported tp export of 1 35 and 1 40 kg ha from the maumee and sandusky watersheds in ohio whereas david and gentry 2000 reported that average annual export from six illinois watersheds varied from 0 7 to 1 1 kg ha likewise royer et al 2006 found similar average annual yields in the embarrass 0 83 kg ha and kaskaskia 0 67 kg ha rivers goolsby et al 1999 quantified much higher yields for the illinois river at marseilles 1 9 kg ha but this river receives very large point source discharges from the city of chicago metropolitan area other higher tp export rivers included the grand river in missouri 1 83 kg ha and the big black river in ms 1 45 kg ha mean annual tp loads from edge of field monitoring in the eastern corn belt averaged 0 72 kg ha and 0 51 kg ha in subsurface and surface runoff respectively pease et al 2018 kalkhoff et al 2016 reported mean tp yields of 0 32 to 0 82 kg ha in two smaller iowa and minnesota watersheds many iowa rivers had median annual tp yields similar to those reported in the midwestern corn belt approximately 1 kg ha fig 4 but it is clearly evident that long term mean values for many watersheds are considerably higher however both mean and median annual tp loads for several western and southern iowa watersheds greatly exceeded these regional values patterns of tp yields in iowa and throughout the midwestern corn belt reflect the landscape and agricultural history of the region in iowa annual tp yields fluctuating around 1 kg ha were found in the recently glaciated des moines lobe region or in flat northern iowa regions on either side of the lobe fig 4 these areas are heavily cropped 70 and many areas are intensely drained by subsurface drainage tiles much of the tp exported from this region likely consists of dissolved p delivered via subsurface tiles smith et al 2015 king et al 2014 schilling et al 2019 examined the ratio of dissolved p to tp in north central iowa and reported that dissolved p accounted for 60 of the tp load these northern iowa regions are similar to much of the northern and eastern cornbelt of the us schilling et al 2015 where the dominant agro hydrologic region is characterized by poorly drained soils with 2 slope median annual tp loads exported from this agro hydrologic region would be expected to range from approximately 0 5 to 1 kg ha which is consistent with tp loads reported from other midwestern states see above in contrast median annual tp yields in western and southern iowa exceeded 2 to 3 kg ha and mean values for some rivers exceeded 5 kg ha maximum annual tp yields were 20 to 40 kg ha in some areas table 1 the geology of western iowa is dominated by thick deposits of highly erodible wind blown silt loess that is highly vulnerable to gully and streambank erosion bradford and piest 1977 thomas et al 2004 as the thick loess thins across southern iowa the region becomes characterized by rolling hills of thinner loess overlying older weathered glacial deposits although the cropping intensity is less in the region particularly in southern iowa widespread sediment erosion from channel sources is contributing to high tp yields in particular recent studies are showing that streambank erosion is a major contributor to watershed sediment and tp loads channel derived sediments totaled between roughly 50 and 80 percent of total sediment load in five midwestern watersheds wilson et al 2008 likewise schilling et al 2011 and palmer et al 2014 estimated that approximately 0 to 68 of the annual suspended sediment load in a south central iowa watershed could be explained by streambank erosion streambank contributions to tp loads have also been documented thoma et al 2005 kronvang et al 2012 walling 2008 beck et al 2018 in the recent study by beck et al 2018 as much as 37 5 of the annual tp load was attributable to streambank erosion in a southern iowa watershed land slopes are also contributing to greater tp loads in western and southern iowa fig 4 indeed this was reflected in the correlation analysis which indicated that median tp yields were significantly positively correlated with mean basin slope r 0 735 related to this was the significant positive relation of annual stormflow runoff on tp yields r 0 480 in iowa watersheds table 3 in contrast tp yields were inversely correlated with many attributes indicative of intensive production agriculture in iowa such as row crop area manure applications and tiled soils this counter intuitive result is a function of intensive agricultural production occurring in flat recently glaciated areas of northern iowa where soil erosion is less and tp yields are lower gelder et al 2018 further several explanatory watershed variables are correlated through the row crop variable for example livestock manure is typically generated in iowa watersheds with greater row crop intensity schilling et al 2017c in western and southern iowa agricultural intensity may be less but soil erosion and tp yields are much higher due to overland runoff and stream bed and bank erosion overall there are many factors contributing to spatial patterns of tp yields in iowa and many of the factors themselves are highly correlated future work will consider using more advanced modeling techniques such as multivariate autoregressive state space marss models e g ward et al 2010 to disentangle effects of multiple co variates it is interesting to note that the correlation results from 45 iowa watersheds are different compared to results from a regional assessment jacobson et al 2011 reported that tp yields in 101 mississippi river basin watersheds were positively correlated with row crop area 0 45 tile drainage 0 45 and manure p 0 36 and negatively correlated with slope 0 39 since the study by jacobson et al 2011 included basins in missouri river basin including some in montana and wyoming along with basins in west virginia kentucky and eastern tennessee some differences in correlations may be due to differences in geography and climate however this also indicates the challenges involved with relying on simple bivariate correlations to characterize complex processes influenced by multiple factors 4 2 iowa contribution of tp to the gulf of mexico on a statewide basis long term tp yields from iowa averaged 1 7 kg ha and iowa s tp contribution to the gulf of mexico averaged 14 9 over a similar 17 year period 1999 2016 iowa was found to contribute 5 9 of the water to the mississippi atchafalaya river basin while occupying 4 5 of the basin jones et al 2018 hence iowa contributes approximately 2 5 times more tp load to the gulf of mexico than the amount of discharge contributed from the state it is interesting to compare iowa s tp contribution to that of nitrogen jones et al 2018 found iowa s long term 1999 2016 no3 n load contribution to be 29 of the total delivered to the mississippi atchafalaya outlet making iowa s phosphorus contribution reported here 14 9 about half that for no3 n this is likely an indication that iowa s intensely tile drained landscape is disproportionately losing nitrogen relative to the upper mississippi basin as a whole and that iowa s phosphorus loss largely linked to overland surface runoff is more typical of the upper mississippi basin as a whole interestingly when a five year running annual average of iowa tp loading is calculated loads were 43 5 higher in 2017 compared to 2004 the first year that this metric can be calculated with our dataset this is very similar to the no3 n increase 40 reported by jones et al 2018 from 2003 to 2016 thus it appears that the land use and climatic drivers of nutrient loss in iowa are affecting nitrogen and phosphorus similarly in light of that statewide p yield data was available for the neighboring state of illinois which is very similar to iowa in terms of cropping systems and climate david and gentry 2000 reported tp yields of 1 0 kg ha for the period 1980 1997 somewhat lower than the iowa yields reported here 1 7 kg ha they also reported statewide contribution to mississippi river discharge to be 9 6 of the total whereas jones et al 2018 found iowa s discharge contribution to be substantially less at 5 9 indicating that the p concentrations in iowa streams are likely 2 3 times higher than illinois streams on average recently the illinois nutrient loss reduction strategy inlrs 2015 estimated statewide p yields to be 1 2 kg ha for the 1997 2011 water years still 0 5 kg ha less than the mean tp loss from iowa despite the larger water yield from that state 4 3 sources of tp in this study our focus was on annual tp loads and yields from 46 iowa watersheds and was not directed towards quantifying various tp sources the iowa nutrient reduction strategy inrs indicated that 79 of the tp loads in iowa rivers was from nonpoint source pollution and 21 was due to point sources mainly wastewater treatment plants or wwtp contributions from wwtps are incorporated into the tp loads reported herein but we did not account for their specific impacts point sources are known to increase tp loads downstream of major urban centers haggard 2010 although improvements in some wwtps are reducing p loads delivered to rivers grizzetti et al 2012 scott et al 2011 in iowa several new wwtp plants were built during the 1998 2014 study timeframe but most were built to comply with more stringent ammonia and e coli limits and may be only incidentally better at removing p nonetheless we cannot rule out the possible influence of wwtp discharges as a contributor for tp loads in iowa rivers overall additional monitoring and modeling is needed to accurately differentiate sources of tp loads in iowa rivers of the nonpoint source load sources most of the tp load in iowa rivers can be attributed to agricultural runoff and sediment erosion jacobson et al 2011 mallarino and wittry 2010 although dissolved p delivered via subsurface tiles can be an important nonpoint source in some areas smith et al 2015 king et al 2014 dissolved p likely dominates the tp load in north central iowa whereas in western and southern iowa particulate p from sediment erosion dominates the high tp loading areas in iowa 4 4 source of error in tp loads estimation of nutrient loads in rivers is a long standing challenge subject to many potential sources of error and uncertainty guo and jia 2012 stenback et al 2011 hirsch 2014 schilling et al 2017a concentrations at many sites are measured on an intermittent frequency i e monthly in this study and there is a need to estimate concentrations during periods when no data was available the estimated concentrations are typically paired with continuously monitored discharge to derive estimates of daily constituent load due to the challenge to estimating daily concentrations there is often no true measured load to report only the best estimated value based on statistical modeling two common rating curve methods loadest wrtds were used in this study to estimate annual tp loads in iowa rivers and while there was good agreement between the two estimation methods at lower tp yields 2 kg ha loadest produced much higher loading estimates at higher tp yields fig 2 these study results point to the complexity of estimating tp loads in iowa rivers but it is important to state that our study goal was not focused on evaluating model performance as this is discussed in more detail elsewhere e g hirsch 2014 stenback et al 2011 specific to iowa stenback et al 2011 examined loadest tp estimation for 44 iowa rivers and reported that while there was no bias in the load prediction 15 of the 44 cases either underestimated or overestimated loads by more than 25 although no consistent positive or negative bias was found in loadest results stenback et al 2011 study results reported herein showed that loadest produced much higher estimates of annual tp export for some years compared to wrtds for this reason we focused on wrtds results in this paper but provide loadest results in the supplementary materials approximately 80 of the wrtds flux bias statistics bm for the studied watersheds were less than 0 2 implying that tp bias in annual loads is on the order of 20 this level of potential bias in the estimated tp loads was consistent with stenback et al 2011 and is considered acceptable herein because the monthly tp concentration monitoring record available for analysis is not ideal for estimating tp loads particularly at high discharge events jones and schilling 2011 the diagnostic output from the wrtds model indicates that for the poorly performing models the observed discharge was considerably higher than the discharge on sampling days fig 6 implying that insufficient sampling during high discharge events was mainly responsible for model performance for this reason we emphasized median tp values more than mean values in this study as a long term measure of the central tendency of tp loading patterns in iowa it should be noted that both loadest and wrtds regression models struggled with capturing tp loads at high discharge events although sensor technology has not been developed yet to measure continuous tp concentrations in rivers turbidity has shown promise as a surrogate for tp concentrations in watersheds grayson et al 1996 kronvang et al 1997 jones and schilling 2011 schilling et al 2017b stubblefield et al 2007 schilling et al 2017b indicated that tp concentrations in many iowa rivers can be estimated very well using turbidity with correlation coefficients between turbidity and tp concentrations averaging 0 78 and exceeding 0 9 in 14 of 43 watersheds analyzed however the researchers also noted that in heavily tiled areas where contributions of tp are dominated by dissolved op the tp turbidity relation is poor and op should be explicitly added to any regression model estimating tp loads schilling et al 2017b 5 conclusions annual tp yields were estimated for the period from 2000 to 2017 18 years for 46 iowa watersheds mean and median tp yields varied considerably ranging from 0 44 to 7 71 kg ha and 0 32 to 3 75 kg ha respectively mean values were clearly influenced by maximum annual tp loads which exceeded 10 kg ha in 14 different watersheds highest median tp yields were found in western and southern iowa with yield from many watersheds exceeding 2 to 3 kg ha whereas in the flatter and more recently glaciated regions of north central iowa median tp yields were often 1 kg ha overall the weighted average tp yield for iowa was 1 70 kg ha median 1 40 kg ha ranging from 0 37 to 4 95 kg ha and iowa s tp export contributes approximately 15 of the tp load to the gulf of mexico median annual tp yields in iowa were positively correlated to precipitation basin slope and stormflow and negatively correlated with row crop manure application areas tiled soils and baseflow this pattern reflects the geologic and land use history of iowa where runoff on steeply sloping croplands along with significant contributions from severe streambank erosion produces soil erosion and high tp yields in western and southern iowa that dwarf the tp contributions from intense agricultural activity row crop manure tile on flatter landscapes in northern iowa finally study results point out the challenges involved with evaluating and reducing tp loads from the agricultural midwest we used two different usgs load estimation programs in this study to estimate annual tp loads but additional monitoring and modeling is needed to better capture high tp loading events and improve load quantification reducing tp loads will require improved quantification and differentiation of sources of tp loads in midwestern rivers and it will be important to find nutrient

5896,total phosphorus tp export in rivers contributes to development of hypoxic conditions in receiving waterbodies and is typically sourced to agricultural nonpoint sources systematic quantification of tp loads and yields at a regional scale is not often reported but tp yields are known to vary considerably in this study tp yields from 46 iowa watersheds were evaluated for the period from 2000 to 2017 to evaluate long term patterns of tp export and quantify the contribution of iowa sourced tp loads to the gulf of mexico using two common load estimation programs annual mean and median tp yields ranged from 0 44 to 7 71 kg ha and 0 32 to 3 75 kg ha respectively highest median yields were found in western and southern iowa the weighted average tp yield for iowa was 1 70 kg ha and on average iowa s tp export contributes approximately 15 of the tp load to the gulf of mexico reducing tp export will require improved quantification and differentiation of sources of tp loads in midwestern rivers and a commitment to find strategies that reduce both tp and no3 n loss from agricultural lands in a complementary and additive approach keywords phosphorus nutrients iowa hypoxia agriculture 1 introduction riverine nutrients consisting principally of nitrogen n predominantly in the form of no3 n and phosphorus p are major contributors to development of hypoxic conditions in the gulf of mexico turner et al 2008 and around the world diaz 2001 although n has received more attention jones et al 2018 p export has been viewed by some researchers as the limiting nutrient in phytoplankton growth in freshwater ecosystems and coastal waters sylvan et al 2006 hecky and kilham 1988 part of the focus placed on n export has been the relative ease of monitoring of n compared to p quantifying n loads in rivers is relatively straightforward since concentrations can be adequately characterized by regular grab sampling jiang et al 2014 tiemeyer et al 2010 or with the use of no3 n sensors davis et al 2014 feng et al 2013 whereas total phosphorus tp concentrations and loads are difficult to measure with much certainty sources of tp sum of particulate and dissolved p vary in watersheds but nonpoint sources of p are considered dominant in agricultural regions jacobson et al 2011 jarvie et al 2013 farm fertilizers manure and urban inputs comprise the largest tp sources jacobson et al 2011 robertson and saad 2013 p losses to the environment can occur through highly episodic event driven transport or through more continuous groundwater or tile drainage discharge stamm et al 2013 episodic p delivery is dominated by surface runoff and erosion of sediment bound p from agricultural fields sharpley and withers 1994 whereas groundwater or tile drainage sources contribute to soluble p losses gentry et al 2007 king et al 2014 2015 smith et al 2015 the proportion of soluble p to tp concentrations and loads in agricultural watersheds can vary greatly schilling et al 2017c gentry et al 2007 schilling et al 2017b found that orthophosphorus op contributions from croplands were greater in watersheds characterized by widespread tile drainage and well drained soils whereas tp export was dominated by particulate p in dissected till plains with poorly drained soils overall tp export from agricultural watersheds reflects contributions from both particulate and dissolved p sources integrated across various spatial and temporal scales systematic quantification of tp loads and yields at a regional scale is not often reported and when done it is usually the output of watershed models i e robertson et al 2009 jacobson et al 2011 robertson and saad 2013 white et al 2014 the united states geological survey usgs developed a sparrow spatially referenced regression on watershed attributes model to estimate tp yields and annual loads robertson et al 2009 in the mississippi atchafalaya basin marb tp yields were found to exceed 1 3 kg ha in many regions of the cornbelt likewise jacobson et al 2011 reported spatial patterns of tp yields across the marb for a january july period 1997 2006 based on estimates derived from regression models and sparrow they estimated annual tp loads ranging from 0 1 to 8 5 kg ha in marb watersheds white et al 2014 used a modeling framework of apex and swat models to evaluate p loading patterns and source in the marb and reported that average annual tp yields across watersheds in the marb ranged from 0 2 to 6 kg ha the diversity of annual tp yields in the marb is not surprising given the range of hydrologic flow pathways across many agricultural regions schilling et al 2015 proposed the idea of agro hydrologic regions to characterize cropland areas in the upper mississippi and ohio river basins using soil and slope categories in regions dominated by high relief slopes greater than or equal to 5 and poorly drained soils surface runoff will dominate tp export in recently glaciated areas the landscape is flat and poorly drained so tp losses will primarily occur via artificial drainage the state of iowa located in the heart of the u s cornbelt contains a cross section of all agro hydrologic regions found throughout the upper mississippi and ohio river basins and the diversity of annual tp yields reported for iowa is typical for the entire region in a small subset of 12 iowa watersheds schilling et al 2017c reported mean tp yields ranging from 0 8 to 4 4 kg ha quantification of annual export of tp from iowa agricultural watersheds would be expected to represent the range and magnitude of tp losses likely encountered from all cropland areas in the marb the goal of this study was to estimate and report on variations in annual tp yields from 46 iowa watersheds for the period from 2000 to 2017 18 years our specific objectives were to 1 evaluate long term statistics of tp export at the watershed and regional state scale 2 quantify the contribution of iowa sourced tp loads to the gulf of mexico and 3 investigate the correlation of median watershed scale tp yields to hydrologic and land cover characteristics study results are also intended to serve as a benchmark for other tp loading studies conducted around the world where annual yields are quantified given iowa s agricultural intensity and landscape diversity a comparison of annual tp yields to iowa based watersheds provides an important comparison for tp temporal and spatial loading patterns 2 methods and materials 2 1 regional setting the state of iowa is the largest producer of corn zea mays l and soybeans glycine max l merr in the u s as well as the leading producer of eggs and pork and the fourth largest producer of feeder cattle usda 2017 the success of the agricultural industry in the state can be sourced to the highly productive glacial derived soils and favorable climate for rain fed crop production the surficial geology of iowa is dominated by pleistocene glacial deposits consisting of fine textured glacial till and loess predominantly silt to silt loam of varying ages prior and iowa 1991 the wisconsin age des moines lobe represents the most recent glacial advance into iowa with maximum extent around 12 000 years ago fig 1 this region is poorly drained with little topographic relief and is dominated by artificial drainage in western and southern iowa the rolling hillslope landscape is comprised of a varying thickness of fine textured silt loess overlying older pre illinoian glacial till northeast iowa is largely devoid of glacial deposits and characterized by shallow carbonate bedrock often with karst topography and incised river valleys together the landscape diversity of iowa mirrors the diversity of agro hydrologic regions found throughout the upper mississippi and ohio river basins schilling et al 2015 iowa has a humid continental climate with hot and humid summers and cold and relatively dry winters average annual precipitation and temperature range from approximately 700 to 900 mm and 6 to 12c across a gradient from northwest to southeast iowa inrs 2015 corn and soybean yields average approximately 10 and 3 3 mg ha respectively typical annual p application to corn soybean and hay areas in iowa is approximately 54 kg ha from fertilizer and manure sources inrs 2015 2 2 monitoring data tp concentrations were measured at an approximate monthly frequency at 46 ambient river monitoring sites across iowa the watershed areas for the 46 sites ranged from 20 155 km2 cedar river near conesville to 88 km2 bloody run fig 1 table 1 monthly measurements are not ideal to characterize tp concentrations but this sampling frequency was established by the iowa department of natural resources idnr for their ambient river monitoring program all the ambient monitoring sites evaluated in this study were specifically located to be beyond the extent of urban areas when the statewide ambient program was established idnr 2000 there were occasional months of missing data but the sample size ranged from approximately 180 to nearly 220 for the 18 years between 2000 and 2015 all surface water samples were collected as unfiltered grab samples from mid stream bridge locations at fixed monitoring sites following an epa approved quality assurance project plan tp was quantified by digesting samples followed by the molybdenum blue procedure with lachat quickchem method lac 10 115 10 1d sample collection methods and laboratory analytical procedures were unchanged during the monitoring period tp concentration data were obtained from the idnrstoret wqx water quality database https programs iowadnr gov iastoret stream discharge data were obtained from usgs gages that are collocated with the iowa dnr monitoring sites annual discharge and tp concentrations from the mississippi atchafalaya rivers were obtained from usgs reports usgs 2017 2 3 load estimation we used two different usgs software programs load estimator or loadest and weighted regressions on time discharge and season or wrtds to estimate annual tp loads at the 46 monitoring sites loadest cohn et al 1992 runkel et al 2004 uses a rating curve approach to estimate daily tp loads using discrete samples and continuous streamflow data we used the loadest program to estimate daily tp loads in the selected rivers using the seven parameter load prediction model ln l β0 β1ln q β2 ln q 2 β3t β4t2 β5sin 2πt β6cos 2πt ε where l cq is the load or flux c is concentration q is discharge t is time in decimal years β0 β1 β6 are regression coefficients and ε is assumed to be an independent and normally distributed error with zero mean and constant variance although the model can perform poorly to estimate no3 n loads stenback et al 2011 found no consistent positive or negative bias for tp load estimation the loadest model has been used to estimate tp loads in many studies e g goolsby et al 1999 hooper et al 2001 aulenbach and hooper 2006 robertson et al 2009 white et al 2014 tp loads were also estimated using the wrtds method from the usgs egret r package hirsch and de cicco 2015 wrtds is a smoothing method to interpret the behavior of the water quality analyte of interest on the basis of four components the relationship to discharge seasonality long term trend and a random component hirsch et al 2010 the method was designed for data sets with two hundred or more measured concentration values that span a period of a decade or more wrtds estimates a gridded surface of concentration for the length of the record and over all discharges by using a regression where the actual measurements are weighted by their distance from the estimated point in time season and discharge within an adjustable window hirsch and de cicco 2014 and thus allows the relationship between concentration and discharge to change over time the grid of estimated concentration is used to estimate flux by using the actual discharge to compute a load for each day of the record wrtds has been used to estimate river loads in many studies e g sprague et al 2011 hirsch 2012 it is recognized that different load estimation methods can produce different results schilling et al 2017a hirsch 2014 and variations in tp loads can occur based on the load estimation method selected we compared the annual estimated tp yields using the two models for all monitoring sites and years n 798 and found close agreement between the two methods at low tp yields 2 kg ha based on loadest but divergence occurred when tp yields were higher fig 2 in particular the wrtds loadest ratio was close to one at low tp yields 1 01 but the ratio was 0 48 when loadest estimated loads exceeded 2 kg ha at higher tp yields the loadest method appeared to produce exceptionally high annual tp yield estimates relative to wrtds for this reason we have chosen to report tp loads and yields using the wrtds methodology in this paper the annual output from the loadest method is provided in the supplementary materials the flux bias statistic bm is a measure of the potential bias of the tp load estimate and it quantifies how well the estimated wrtds load matches the measured load on the sampling days hirsch 2014 hirsch 2014 developed a non linear relation between bm and the true error in the model output in percent em and indicated that bm values between 0 1 to 0 1 likely have a bias within 10 whereas for values near 0 2 the true bias is likely between 5 and 25 values near 0 6 may have a bias on the order of 100 125 the flux bias statistics and diagnostic outputs for the 46 river load datasets analyzed in this study are provided in the supplementary materials on a percentile basis bm for most tp monitoring sites ranged between 0 2 implying a bias of approximately 20 fig 3 a few sites showed positive or negative bm with potential bias of 100 however there was no systematic pattern of bm across the statewide monitoring sites nor were there any statistically significant relations between bm and tp yield statistics or watershed area hence the tp loads estimated using the wrtds model appear to provide reasonable estimates of annual tp loads for iowa rivers 2 4 ancillary data we compiled additional ancillary factors for the watersheds to assess their influence on tp yields precipitation data for a climate station located closest to the centroid of the watershed was obtained from the iowa environmental mesonet https mesonet agron iastate edu hydrograph separation into baseflow and runoff components was performed on the usgs discharge data collected

university https engineering purdue edu mapserve what average annual water yield and baseflow were normalized to watershed area and reported in mm of discharge land cover information on the percent

animals by confined animal feeding operations cafos assuming an n application rate of 90 kg ha to corn soybean areas similarly present tiled soils represents the percent of land in a watershed with hydric soils under corn soybean rotation tp load data for individual watersheds were compiled and summarized as annual totals in kg and divided by watershed area ha for yields summary statistics of annual yields mean median standard deviation minimum and maximum were computed pearson correlation was used to investigate the relation of hydrologic and land cover variables to watershed scale median tp yields at the 0 05 level of significance statistical analysis was performed using minitab release 18 software mintab inc state college pa 3 results 3 1 tp yields from iowa watersheds mean annual tp yields from iowa watersheds varied considerably over an 18 year period of monitoring ranging from 0 44 kg ha at bloody run creek in northeast iowa to 7 71 kg ha at middle river in southern iowa table 1 mean values were clearly influenced by maximum annual tp loads which exceeded more than 10 kg ha in 14 different watersheds two western iowa rivers draining to the missouri river boyer river and soldier river had maximum annual tp yields of 42 15 and 45 04 kg ha respectively due to large standard deviations and skewness of annual tp yields at most sites long term tp yields in iowa rivers are better represented by median values median annual tp yields ranged from 0 32 to 3 75 kg ha table 1 and as a population were best fit with a log normal distribution the majority of annual tp yields cluster near 1 kg ha but a tail of higher tp yields greater than 2 kg ha was also evident fig 2 highest median tp yields are found in western and southern iowa basins fig 4 five watersheds draining this region of the state had long term median tp yields 3 kg ha and five other watershed areas were greater than 2 kg ha in contrast tp yields in north central and northeast central iowa were 1 kg ha area weighted average tp yields were calculated for watersheds draining to the mississippi river represented by 12 rivers and missouri river 10 rivers watersheds draining to the mississippi river averaged approximately 1 30 kg ha of tp loss whereas watersheds draining to the missouri river were approximately double 2 73 kg ha median values were less but showed similar differences 1 26 vs 1 63 kg ha respectively for the state of iowa a weighted average tp yield was calculated by summing the loads from the largest basins in iowa i e did not include nested watersheds and dividing by the watershed area represented by these basins overall the weighted average tp yield for iowa was 1 70 kg ha median 1 40 kg ha ranging from 0 37 to 4 95 kg ha table 2 total tp export from iowa ranged from 5 377 to 72 182 mg and averaged 24 842 mg comparing the annual iowa tp export to the tp load exported from the mississippi river suggests that iowa s tp export contributes approximately 15 of the tp load to the gulf of mexico table 2 iowa s tp contribution to the gulf ranged from approximately 5 to 34 3 2 temporal patterns tp yields fluctuated during the 18 year period as shown by seven representative watersheds fig 5 tp yields from the boyer and middle rivers in western and southern iowa were clearly much higher than the other iowa watersheds whereas the english and turkey rivers were more intermediate and tp yields from boone beaver and floyd rivers were much lower the temporal pattern of tp yields in the boyer river were most pronounced with values increasing from approximately 1 kg ha in 2005 2006 to 42 15 kg ha in 2008 fig 5 likewise tp yields from the middle river in southern iowa also fluctuated greatly ranging from annual tp yields of 0 13 kg ha during a drought year to 35 03 kg ha during a wet year in contrast tp yields from the boone river and beaver creek fluctuated within a much narrower range during the 18 year period with annual values ranging from 0 07 to 2 10 kg ha and 0 10 to 2 57 kg ha respectively tp yields were correlated with annual precipitation at all sites but the level of correlation varied fig 5 correlation was less in the boyer and turkey rivers where pulses of annual tp loads were evident but tp variations were highly correlated with variations in precipitation at most sites p 0 01 overall the annual tp yield data clearly show that while tp export fluctuates in iowa rivers the range of fluctuations was much higher in western and southern iowa 3 3 correlation of median tp yields to other factors tp yields from 45 watersheds were correlated with watershed hydrologic and land characteristics table 3 bloody run results were excluded from the analyses because of its extremely small size and its very different hydrology karst hydrology compared to the other sites tp yields were found to be significantly positively correlated p 0 01 with mean annual precipitation mean basin slope and mean annual stormflow row crop manure application area tiled soils and mean annual baseflow mm were negatively correlated at the 0 01 probability level tp yields were not significantly correlated to precipitation and discharge but were negatively correlated to baseflow and positively correlated to stormflow fractions table 3 among the ancillary variables row crop manure applications and tile soils were positively correlated with one another and negatively correlated with slope whereas the hydrologic variables water yield baseflow stormflow and q p ratio were positively correlated with each other 4 discussion 4 1 regional patterns the magnitude and range of annual tp yields exported from iowa watersheds are striking and among the highest reported in the literature richards and baker 2002 reported tp export of 1 35 and 1 40 kg ha from the maumee and sandusky watersheds in ohio whereas david and gentry 2000 reported that average annual export from six illinois watersheds varied from 0 7 to 1 1 kg ha likewise royer et al 2006 found similar average annual yields in the embarrass 0 83 kg ha and kaskaskia 0 67 kg ha rivers goolsby et al 1999 quantified much higher yields for the illinois river at marseilles 1 9 kg ha but this river receives very large point source discharges from the city of chicago metropolitan area other higher tp export rivers included the grand river in missouri 1 83 kg ha and the big black river in ms 1 45 kg ha mean annual tp loads from edge of field monitoring in the eastern corn belt averaged 0 72 kg ha and 0 51 kg ha in subsurface and surface runoff respectively pease et al 2018 kalkhoff et al 2016 reported mean tp yields of 0 32 to 0 82 kg ha in two smaller iowa and minnesota watersheds many iowa rivers had median annual tp yields similar to those reported in the midwestern corn belt approximately 1 kg ha fig 4 but it is clearly evident that long term mean values for many watersheds are considerably higher however both mean and median annual tp loads for several western and southern iowa watersheds greatly exceeded these regional values patterns of tp yields in iowa and throughout the midwestern corn belt reflect the landscape and agricultural history of the region in iowa annual tp yields fluctuating around 1 kg ha were found in the recently glaciated des moines lobe region or in flat northern iowa regions on either side of the lobe fig 4 these areas are heavily cropped 70 and many areas are intensely drained by subsurface drainage tiles much of the tp exported from this region likely consists of dissolved p delivered via subsurface tiles smith et al 2015 king et al 2014 schilling et al 2019 examined the ratio of dissolved p to tp in north central iowa and reported that dissolved p accounted for 60 of the tp load these northern iowa regions are similar to much of the northern and eastern cornbelt of the us schilling et al 2015 where the dominant agro hydrologic region is characterized by poorly drained soils with 2 slope median annual tp loads exported from this agro hydrologic region would be expected to range from approximately 0 5 to 1 kg ha which is consistent with tp loads reported from other midwestern states see above in contrast median annual tp yields in western and southern iowa exceeded 2 to 3 kg ha and mean values for some rivers exceeded 5 kg ha maximum annual tp yields were 20 to 40 kg ha in some areas table 1 the geology of western iowa is dominated by thick deposits of highly erodible wind blown silt loess that is highly vulnerable to gully and streambank erosion bradford and piest 1977 thomas et al 2004 as the thick loess thins across southern iowa the region becomes characterized by rolling hills of thinner loess overlying older weathered glacial deposits although the cropping intensity is less in the region particularly in southern iowa widespread sediment erosion from channel sources is contributing to high tp yields in particular recent studies are showing that streambank erosion is a major contributor to watershed sediment and tp loads channel derived sediments totaled between roughly 50 and 80 percent of total sediment load in five midwestern watersheds wilson et al 2008 likewise schilling et al 2011 and palmer et al 2014 estimated that approximately 0 to 68 of the annual suspended sediment load in a south central iowa watershed could be explained by streambank erosion streambank contributions to tp loads have also been documented thoma et al 2005 kronvang et al 2012 walling 2008 beck et al 2018 in the recent study by beck et al 2018 as much as 37 5 of the annual tp load was attributable to streambank erosion in a southern iowa watershed land slopes are also contributing to greater tp loads in western and southern iowa fig 4 indeed this was reflected in the correlation analysis which indicated that median tp yields were significantly positively correlated with mean basin slope r 0 735 related to this was the significant positive relation of annual stormflow runoff on tp yields r 0 480 in iowa watersheds table 3 in contrast tp yields were inversely correlated with many attributes indicative of intensive production agriculture in iowa such as row crop area manure applications and tiled soils this counter intuitive result is a function of intensive agricultural production occurring in flat recently glaciated areas of northern iowa where soil erosion is less and tp yields are lower gelder et al 2018 further several explanatory watershed variables are correlated through the row crop variable for example livestock manure is typically generated in iowa watersheds with greater row crop intensity schilling et al 2017c in western and southern iowa agricultural intensity may be less but soil erosion and tp yields are much higher due to overland runoff and stream bed and bank erosion overall there are many factors contributing to spatial patterns of tp yields in iowa and many of the factors themselves are highly correlated future work will consider using more advanced modeling techniques such as multivariate autoregressive state space marss models e g ward et al 2010 to disentangle effects of multiple co variates it is interesting to note that the correlation results from 45 iowa watersheds are different compared to results from a regional assessment jacobson et al 2011 reported that tp yields in 101 mississippi river basin watersheds were positively correlated with row crop area 0 45 tile drainage 0 45 and manure p 0 36 and negatively correlated with slope 0 39 since the study by jacobson et al 2011 included basins in missouri river basin including some in montana and wyoming along with basins in west virginia kentucky and eastern tennessee some differences in correlations may be due to differences in geography and climate however this also indicates the challenges involved with relying on simple bivariate correlations to characterize complex processes influenced by multiple factors 4 2 iowa contribution of tp to the gulf of mexico on a statewide basis long term tp yields from iowa averaged 1 7 kg ha and iowa s tp contribution to the gulf of mexico averaged 14 9 over a similar 17 year period 1999 2016 iowa was found to contribute 5 9 of the water to the mississippi atchafalaya river basin while occupying 4 5 of the basin jones et al 2018 hence iowa contributes approximately 2 5 times more tp load to the gulf of mexico than the amount of discharge contributed from the state it is interesting to compare iowa s tp contribution to that of nitrogen jones et al 2018 found iowa s long term 1999 2016 no3 n load contribution to be 29 of the total delivered to the mississippi atchafalaya outlet making iowa s phosphorus contribution reported here 14 9 about half that for no3 n this is likely an indication that iowa s intensely tile drained landscape is disproportionately losing nitrogen relative to the upper mississippi basin as a whole and that iowa s phosphorus loss largely linked to overland surface runoff is more typical of the upper mississippi basin as a whole interestingly when a five year running annual average of iowa tp loading is calculated loads were 43 5 higher in 2017 compared to 2004 the first year that this metric can be calculated with our dataset this is very similar to the no3 n increase 40 reported by jones et al 2018 from 2003 to 2016 thus it appears that the land use and climatic drivers of nutrient loss in iowa are affecting nitrogen and phosphorus similarly in light of that statewide p yield data was available for the neighboring state of illinois which is very similar to iowa in terms of cropping systems and climate david and gentry 2000 reported tp yields of 1 0 kg ha for the period 1980 1997 somewhat lower than the iowa yields reported here 1 7 kg ha they also reported statewide contribution to mississippi river discharge to be 9 6 of the total whereas jones et al 2018 found iowa s discharge contribution to be substantially less at 5 9 indicating that the p concentrations in iowa streams are likely 2 3 times higher than illinois streams on average recently the illinois nutrient loss reduction strategy inlrs 2015 estimated statewide p yields to be 1 2 kg ha for the 1997 2011 water years still 0 5 kg ha less than the mean tp loss from iowa despite the larger water yield from that state 4 3 sources of tp in this study our focus was on annual tp loads and yields from 46 iowa watersheds and was not directed towards quantifying various tp sources the iowa nutrient reduction strategy inrs indicated that 79 of the tp loads in iowa rivers was from nonpoint source pollution and 21 was due to point sources mainly wastewater treatment plants or wwtp contributions from wwtps are incorporated into the tp loads reported herein but we did not account for their specific impacts point sources are known to increase tp loads downstream of major urban centers haggard 2010 although improvements in some wwtps are reducing p loads delivered to rivers grizzetti et al 2012 scott et al 2011 in iowa several new wwtp plants were built during the 1998 2014 study timeframe but most were built to comply with more stringent ammonia and e coli limits and may be only incidentally better at removing p nonetheless we cannot rule out the possible influence of wwtp discharges as a contributor for tp loads in iowa rivers overall additional monitoring and modeling is needed to accurately differentiate sources of tp loads in iowa rivers of the nonpoint source load sources most of the tp load in iowa rivers can be attributed to agricultural runoff and sediment erosion jacobson et al 2011 mallarino and wittry 2010 although dissolved p delivered via subsurface tiles can be an important nonpoint source in some areas smith et al 2015 king et al 2014 dissolved p likely dominates the tp load in north central iowa whereas in western and southern iowa particulate p from sediment erosion dominates the high tp loading areas in iowa 4 4 source of error in tp loads estimation of nutrient loads in rivers is a long standing challenge subject to many potential sources of error and uncertainty guo and jia 2012 stenback et al 2011 hirsch 2014 schilling et al 2017a concentrations at many sites are measured on an intermittent frequency i e monthly in this study and there is a need to estimate concentrations during periods when no data was available the estimated concentrations are typically paired with continuously monitored discharge to derive estimates of daily constituent load due to the challenge to estimating daily concentrations there is often no true measured load to report only the best estimated value based on statistical modeling two common rating curve methods loadest wrtds were used in this study to estimate annual tp loads in iowa rivers and while there was good agreement between the two estimation methods at lower tp yields 2 kg ha loadest produced much higher loading estimates at higher tp yields fig 2 these study results point to the complexity of estimating tp loads in iowa rivers but it is important to state that our study goal was not focused on evaluating model performance as this is discussed in more detail elsewhere e g hirsch 2014 stenback et al 2011 specific to iowa stenback et al 2011 examined loadest tp estimation for 44 iowa rivers and reported that while there was no bias in the load prediction 15 of the 44 cases either underestimated or overestimated loads by more than 25 although no consistent positive or negative bias was found in loadest results stenback et al 2011 study results reported herein showed that loadest produced much higher estimates of annual tp export for some years compared to wrtds for this reason we focused on wrtds results in this paper but provide loadest results in the supplementary materials approximately 80 of the wrtds flux bias statistics bm for the studied watersheds were less than 0 2 implying that tp bias in annual loads is on the order of 20 this level of potential bias in the estimated tp loads was consistent with stenback et al 2011 and is considered acceptable herein because the monthly tp concentration monitoring record available for analysis is not ideal for estimating tp loads particularly at high discharge events jones and schilling 2011 the diagnostic output from the wrtds model indicates that for the poorly performing models the observed discharge was considerably higher than the discharge on sampling days fig 6 implying that insufficient sampling during high discharge events was mainly responsible for model performance for this reason we emphasized median tp values more than mean values in this study as a long term measure of the central tendency of tp loading patterns in iowa it should be noted that both loadest and wrtds regression models struggled with capturing tp loads at high discharge events although sensor technology has not been developed yet to measure continuous tp concentrations in rivers turbidity has shown promise as a surrogate for tp concentrations in watersheds grayson et al 1996 kronvang et al 1997 jones and schilling 2011 schilling et al 2017b stubblefield et al 2007 schilling et al 2017b indicated that tp concentrations in many iowa rivers can be estimated very well using turbidity with correlation coefficients between turbidity and tp concentrations averaging 0 78 and exceeding 0 9 in 14 of 43 watersheds analyzed however the researchers also noted that in heavily tiled areas where contributions of tp are dominated by dissolved op the tp turbidity relation is poor and op should be explicitly added to any regression model estimating tp loads schilling et al 2017b 5 conclusions annual tp yields were estimated for the period from 2000 to 2017 18 years for 46 iowa watersheds mean and median tp yields varied considerably ranging from 0 44 to 7 71 kg ha and 0 32 to 3 75 kg ha respectively mean values were clearly influenced by maximum annual tp loads which exceeded 10 kg ha in 14 different watersheds highest median tp yields were found in western and southern iowa with yield from many watersheds exceeding 2 to 3 kg ha whereas in the flatter and more recently glaciated regions of north central iowa median tp yields were often 1 kg ha overall the weighted average tp yield for iowa was 1 70 kg ha median 1 40 kg ha ranging from 0 37 to 4 95 kg ha and iowa s tp export contributes approximately 15 of the tp load to the gulf of mexico median annual tp yields in iowa were positively correlated to precipitation basin slope and stormflow and negatively correlated with row crop manure application areas tiled soils and baseflow this pattern reflects the geologic and land use history of iowa where runoff on steeply sloping croplands along with significant contributions from severe streambank erosion produces soil erosion and high tp yields in western and southern iowa that dwarf the tp contributions from intense agricultural activity row crop manure tile on flatter landscapes in northern iowa finally study results point out the challenges involved with evaluating and reducing tp loads from the agricultural midwest we used two different usgs load estimation programs in this study to estimate annual tp loads but additional monitoring and modeling is needed to better capture high tp loading events and improve load quantification reducing tp loads will require improved quantification and differentiation of sources of tp loads in midwestern rivers and it will be important to find nutrient reduction strategies that reduce both tp and no3 n loss from agricultural lands in a complementary and additive approach credit authorship contribution statement keith e schilling conceptualization

5897,the conditional dependence between droughts and hot extremes in many regions tends to lead to compound dry and hot extremes that may cause serious impacts on the ecosystem human society and infrastructure thus it is of particular importance to understand variations of the conditional dependence between droughts and hot extremes under global warming we investigated changes in the dependence between droughts characterized by the standardized precipitation index spi and hot extremes characterized by extreme temperature during summer for two periods 1949 1979 and 1980 2010 in the united states the copula method was employed to construct the conditional distribution of hot extremes under drought conditions to show changed likelihoods of hot extremes results demonstrated increased negative dependence between droughts and hot extremes in large regions in the western southern and northeastern u s leading to a higher likelihood of hot extremes conditional on droughts from the first period 1949 1979 to the recent period 1980 2010 meanwhile decreased negative dependence between droughts and hot extremes was shown in parts of midwest and southeastern u s leading to a decreased likelihood of hot extremes conditional on droughts due to disastrous impacts of both droughts and hot extremes our findings will aid mitigation efforts of extremes in the u s in a warmer climate keywords conditional dependence compound extreme drought hot extreme 1 introduction global warming has been shown to lead to increased frequency and intensity of weather and climate extremes e g drought heat wave in many regions mishra and singh 2010 dai 2013 horton et al 2016 huang et al 2017 in recent decades concerns have been raised on concurrent or consecutive occurrences of multiple extremes i e compound extremes that may pose stronger threats to the society and ecosystems than individual extremes such as the 2003 heat wave in europe and 2010 heat wave in russia that were accompanied by droughts seneviratne et al 2012 leonard et al 2014 wahl et al 2015 hao et al 2018 empirical work using observations and model simulations has shown an increase in the frequency and spatial extent of compound drought and hot extremes in a warming climate at regional and global scales hao et al 2013 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 it is thus important to understand the occurrence and variations of compound droughts and hot extremes the association between precipitation and temperature at different time scales has been evaluated trenberth and shea 2005 adler et al 2008 herath et al 2018 sharma and mujumdar 2019 studies have shown the existence of negative dependence between precipitation and temperature during summer season in regions including the u s and europe which tends to result in a tendency of dry and hot summer and high likelihood of compound droughts and hot extremes koster et al 2009 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 zhou and liu 2018 chen et al 2019 evidence from both observational and modeling products illustrates that one of the main drivers of the negative dependence is the soil moisture temperature feedback especially in the transitional regions of wet and dry climate hirschi et al 2011 mueller and seneviratne 2012 greve et al 2014 gallego elvira et al 2016 holmes et al 2017 specifically soil moisture deficit reduces evaporation and leads to increased sensible heat causing localized increase in temperature which is predominately strong in regimes that are neither moisture nor energy limited and can occur throughout the year hirschi et al 2011 miralles et al 2018 this conditional dependence of hot extremes under drought conditions has been shown to be an important feature of the occurrence of compound droughts and hot extremes seneviratne et al 2012 the soil moisture temperature feedback and potential increase of extremes under climate change play important roles in controlling current and future changes of regional temperature quesada et al 2012 berg et al 2016 lorenz et al 2016 vogel et al 2017 miralles et al 2018 recent studies have shown that climate change may lead to shifts in the hotspots of soil moisture temperature feedback dirmeyer et al 2013 whan et al 2015 for example using the correlation coefficient as a metric of land atmosphere coupling previous studies have shown many processes in the soil moisture temperature feedback may be significantly modified under climate change seneviratne et al 2010 berg and sheffield 2018 vogel et al 2018 berg and sheffield 2019 this is expected to affect the conditional dependence between droughts and hot extremes however assessing the likelihood of variations of hot extremes under drought conditions due to changes in the conditional dependences is rather rare in this study we investigate changes in the conditional likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions during the period 1949 2010 in the united states the copula based conditional distribution model is employed to estimate the likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions incorporating changes in the dependence for two periods 1949 1979 and 1980 2010 we first show the changes in the dependence between droughts and hot extremes during summer in the united states we then quantify changes in the likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions during the two periods using the copula method 2 methods the copula methodology nelsen 2006 which has been widely used in modeling dependence between hydroclimatic variables genest and favre 2007 fang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 was employed in this study to construct the joint conditional distribution of droughts and hot extremes zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 ribeiro et al 2019 for continuous random variables x droughts and y hot extremes with marginal probability distributions u and v the joint probability or the likelihood of compound droughts and hot extremes can be expressed with a copula c as nelsen 2006 1 p x x y y u c u v a variety of copula families such as the elliptical and archimedean have been employed for constructing the joint distribution shown in eq 1 three 2 parameter copulas including clayton gumbel and frank are among the most commonly used copulas for the bivariate case kao and govindaraju 2010 and were used in this study for modeling the joint distribution of droughts and hot extremes a suitable copula for each period was selected based on the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 an estimator of the relative quality of the model and the best model was the one with the minimum aic value zhang and singh 2007 the conditional probability of hot extremes higher than a certain threshold given drought conditions lower than or equal to a certain threshold can be expressed as following hao et al 2017 2 p y y x x p x x y y p x x u c u v u the conditional probability in eq 2 quantifies the impact of droughts on the likelihood of hot extremes note that the numerator i e u c u v is essentially the likelihood of compound dry and hot extremes 3 data and results 3 1 data monthly precipitation and daily maximum temperature tmax data in the u s at 1 8 degree resolution were used in this study maurer et al 2002 which is available for the period from 1949 to 2010 these data were separated into two equal periods 1949 1979 and 1980 2010 for comparisons of results 31 years for each period the joint distribution of droughts and hot extremes is constructed based on the relatively long record of each period to assess changes in the likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions the standardized precipitation index spi mckee 1993 based on accumulated precipitation of different time scales is used as the drought indicator in this study to avoid uncertainties that may arise in the fitting of parametric distributions we computed the spi by using the empirical gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 to estimate the marginal distribution since droughts and hot extremes may lead to large impacts to the water supply and energy consumption in summer we focus on the summer season of june july and august jja for the drought condition we computed the 3 month spi based on accumulated precipitation of jja to represent drought conditions during summer the summertime spi was computed for the two 31 yr periods 1949 1979 and 1980 2010 separately the threshold 0 8 was used to characterize the drought condition which has been used to classify the moderate drought condition in u s drought monitor usdm svoboda et al 2002 for the hot extreme we identified the highest daily maximum temperature for each month during jja respectively and then averaged them to represent the extreme temperature tx during summer the 90th percentile of extreme temperature has been commonly used to define the hot extreme perkins and alexander 2013 whan et al 2015 and was also employed in this study we also used different thresholds to define droughts spi 0 5 and hot extremes e g tx 70th and tx 80th and results were generally consistent not shown 3 2 dependence between droughts and hot extremes we first assess the dependence between droughts and hot extremes for the first period 1949 1979 which will then be compared with that for the period 1980 2010 to show the dependence change the kendall rank correlation coefficient τ which is a nonparametric measure of the dependence genest and favre 2007 zhang and singh 2007 wahl et al 2015 between the spi and percentiles of tx was computed for the period 1949 1979 as shown in fig 1 compared to limited regions with positive dependence in the western u s the negative correlation coefficient τ for the period 1949 1979 was shown for most regions in the united states with strong dependence in large regions of central and southeastern u s consistent with previous studies koster et al 2009 ford et al 2017 the negative correlation between droughts and hot extremes in large regions of the u s implies that the drought induced warming may in turn exacerbate the drought condition mueller and seneviratne 2012 resulting in compound droughts and hot extremes seneviratne et al 2012 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 in this study we are particularly interested in the drought induced warming and we focus on the region with negative dependence in fig 1 3 3 conditional likelihood of hot extremes under droughts to assess the likelihood of hot extremes associated with drought induced warming we focus on the conditional behavior of hot extremes under drought conditions the copula model was used to estimate the conditional probability of hot extremes given droughts section 2 at each grid point the three copulas frank clayton and gumbel were first fitted to drought and hot extreme indicators spi and tx for the period 1949 1979 and the best copula was selected based on minimum aic values the conditional probability of extreme temperature tx higher than the 90th percentile given the spi lower than or equal to 0 8 i e p t tx 90 spi 0 8 during summer for the period 1949 1979 is shown in fig 2 a given drought conditions the conditional probability of hot extremes is high in regions with significant negative dependence if droughts and hot extremes are independent the conditional probability of temperature higher than the 90th percentile would be 0 1 from fig 2 a the conditional probability of hot extremes given drought spi 0 8 was higher than that of the independence case in addition the likelihood of the compound dry and hot extreme is also higher in regions with significant negative dependence fig 2 b this result highlights the critical importance to study hot extremes from a multivariate perspective taking into account drought conditions or the compound dry and hot extreme especially in regions with significant correlation coefficients between the two extremes to assess potential uncertainties from the choice of different thresholds we also use the threshold spi 0 5 and t x 70th to show the joint and conditional probability in eqs 1 and 2 respectively supplementary materials fig s1 the pattern of the higher conditional probability and joint probability in regions with significant negative dependence between droughts and hot extremes fig s1 is consistent with results in fig 2 indicating the overall robustness of the results to evaluate the performance of the copula model we also compute the conditional probability and joint probability using the empirical method supplementary materials fig s2 which is conducted based on the r package compoundevents currently under development https r forge r project org projects compoundevents the empirical conditional probability can be estimated by counting the relative frequency of seasons with t x 70th for all seasons with spi 0 5 the conditional probability of hot extremes conditional on droughts from the copula model and from the empirical method are generally in agreement with each other for example the conditional probability in eastern texas is around 0 6 fig s1 similar to the value shown from the empirical estimation fig s2 these results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the copula model 3 4 changes in the dependence the difference of kendall rank correlation coefficient τ between droughts and hot extremes for the two periods 1949 1979 and 1980 2010 is shown in fig 3 for the regions with negative dependence during 1949 1979 the decrease of the correlation coefficient τ or increase of the negative dependence was mainly shown in the western southern and northeastern regions the increase of negative correlation coefficient or the decrease of negative dependence was shown in some areas of midwest and southeastern us to clearly show this pattern of dependence changes we selected two regions region a 101w 98 w 26 n 29 n region b 98 w 95 w 36 n 39 n with increased and decreased negative dependence respectively the boxplot of the correlation coefficient τ for all grids during the two periods in the two regions is shown in fig 4 a and b respectively for region a the median of the correlation coefficient τ was 0 23 during 1949 1979 and it decreased to 0 39 during 1979 2010 for region b the median of the correlation coefficient was 0 32 during 1949 1979 which increased to 0 21 during 1979 2010 the change of the dependence between droughts and hot extremes may be caused by potential variations of the soil moisture temperature interaction for the two periods under global warming seneviratne et al 2010 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 these results indicate the dependence between droughts and hot extremes for the period 1979 2010 has changed compared with that for 1949 1979 in these two regions 3 5 likelihood changes associated with dependence changes based on the analysis of the dependence between the two extremes section 3 2 and the associated likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions section 3 3 the change in the dependence shown in fig 3 section 3 4 is expected to result in changes in the likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions we then compared the conditional probability of hot extremes given droughts i e spi 0 8 during summer for the two periods 1949 1979 and 1980 2010 to assess changes in the likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions based on the copula model to avoid uncertainties from the copula differences during the two periods the same type of copula for the period 1949 1979 was used for the period 1980 2010 but with different copula parameters for negatively correlated droughts and hot extremes if the negative correlation coefficient τ decreases i e increased negative dependence the likelihood of the occurrence of hot extremes is expected to be higher given the same drought condition indicating a higher chance of occurrences of compound dry and hot events to clearly show the pattern of changes in the likelihood we took the average of precipitation and temperature of all grids in the two regions regions a and b from which the indicators of droughts and hot extremes were computed to assess regional changes in the likelihood associated with dependence changes the conditional probability p t tx spi 0 8 for the two periods in these two regions is shown in fig 4 c d due to the increased negative dependence between the spi and tx for region a the conditional probability p t tx 90 spi 0 8 increased from 0 22 to 0 28 due to the decreased negative dependence between the spi and tx for region b the conditional probability p t tx 90 spi 0 8 decreased from 0 27 to 0 22 these results demonstrate changes of likelihoods of hot extremes associated with changes in the dependence between droughts and hot extremes the ratio of the likelihood which is defined as the conditional probability p t tx 90 spi 0 8 for 1980 2010 divided by that for 1949 1979 is shown in fig 5 a the conditional probability p t tx 90 spi 0 8 for the period 1980 2010 showed an increase in the regions with increased negative dependence such as the southern u s fig 3 overall the ratio of likelihood increased significantly around 1 5 to 2 folds for the second period 1980 2010 in the western southern and northeastern u s this indicated that with the same drought condition i e spi 0 8 the occurrence of hot extremes increased by 150 to 200 in these regions during 1980 2010 the increased likelihood of hot extremes was also reflected in the increased joint probability of spi 0 8 and t tx 90 for 1980 2010 than that for 1949 1979 as shown in fig 5 b note that these results are consistent with the previous study on the frequency of compound drought and heat waves in the u s based on the empirical approach mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 which shows the increased frequency in roughly similar regions overall given the same drought condition the likelihood of hot extremes and compound droughts and hot extremes is shown to increase in the western southern and northeastern u s due to the increased negative dependence between droughts and hot extremes for the regions with decreased negative dependence a decreased conditional probability of hot extremes given spi 0 8 and likelihood of compound droughts and hot extremes was observed accordingly 4 conclusions and discussions this study investigated changes in the likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions for the two periods 1949 1979 and 1980 2010 in the united states results showed that dependence between droughts and hot extremes in the u s has changed with regional differences resulting in changes in the likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions and compound droughts and hot extremes specifically the negative dependence between droughts and hot extremes in large regions in western southern and northeastern u s has increased while that in certain midwest and southeastern regions has decreased the increased negative dependence from the first period 1949 1979 to the second period 1980 2010 was associated with increased likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions while the decreased negative dependence was associated with decreased likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions totally 31 data pairs of the spi and extreme temperature were used for the statistical inference of the dependence evaluation and multivariate modeling for the two periods 1949 1979 and 1980 2010 the data limitation in this regard may induce certain uncertainties in the evaluation of the dependence change and associated likelihood of hot extremes in addition the selection of copula models in the statistical analysis may also be affected by relatively short records which may lead to uncertainties in the probability estimation moreover the significance of changes in the dependence and associated likelihood were not assessed these are the caveats in interpreting results of this study we conducted statistical analysis of the likelihood of extremes based on the stationary concept results from this study have shown the changed correlation coefficient between droughts and hot extremes which indicates the nonstationary property of the dependence due to important role of dependence in the risk analysis of multivariate or compound extremes a nonstationary based risk assessment framework can also be employed to investigate the likelihood of hot extremes and compound droughts and hot extremes bender et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 kwon and lall 2016 sarhadi et al 2018 which will be conducted in our future studies based on the changed pattern of hot extremes conditioned on droughts it is expected that regions with increased negative dependence between droughts and hot extremes are expected to be particularly vulnerable to a warmer climate under the influence of natural and anthropogenic forcing this calls for improved mitigation efforts in coping with droughts and heat extremes in these regions considering disastrous impacts of compound droughts and hot extremes this study highlights the importance of assessing the likelihood of droughts and hot extremes

5897,the conditional dependence between droughts and hot extremes in many regions tends to lead to compound dry and hot extremes that may cause serious impacts on the ecosystem human society and infrastructure thus it is of particular importance to understand variations of the conditional dependence between droughts and hot extremes under global warming we investigated changes in the dependence between droughts characterized by the standardized precipitation index spi and hot extremes characterized by extreme temperature during summer for two periods 1949 1979 and 1980 2010 in the united states the copula method was employed to construct the conditional distribution of hot extremes under drought conditions to show changed likelihoods of hot extremes results demonstrated increased negative dependence between droughts and hot extremes in large regions in the western southern and northeastern u s leading to a higher likelihood of hot extremes conditional on droughts from the first period 1949 1979 to the recent period 1980 2010 meanwhile decreased negative dependence between droughts and hot extremes was shown in parts of midwest and southeastern u s leading to a decreased likelihood of hot extremes conditional on droughts due to disastrous impacts of both droughts and hot extremes our findings will aid mitigation efforts of extremes in the u s in a warmer climate keywords conditional dependence compound extreme drought hot extreme 1 introduction global warming has been shown to lead to increased frequency and intensity of weather and climate extremes e g drought heat wave in many regions mishra and singh 2010 dai 2013 horton et al 2016 huang et al 2017 in recent decades concerns have been raised on concurrent or consecutive occurrences of multiple extremes i e compound extremes that may pose stronger threats to the society and ecosystems than individual extremes such as the 2003 heat wave in europe and 2010 heat wave in russia that were accompanied by droughts seneviratne et al 2012 leonard et al 2014 wahl et al 2015 hao et al 2018 empirical work using observations and model simulations has shown an increase in the frequency and spatial extent of compound drought and hot extremes in a warming climate at regional and global scales hao et al 2013 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 it is thus important to understand the occurrence and variations of compound droughts and hot extremes the association between precipitation and temperature at different time scales has been evaluated trenberth and shea 2005 adler et al 2008 herath et al 2018 sharma and mujumdar 2019 studies have shown the existence of negative dependence between precipitation and temperature during summer season in regions including the u s and europe which tends to result in a tendency of dry and hot summer and high likelihood of compound droughts and hot extremes koster et al 2009 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 zhou and liu 2018 chen et al 2019 evidence from both observational and modeling products illustrates that one of the main drivers of the negative dependence is the soil moisture temperature feedback especially in the transitional regions of wet and dry climate hirschi et al 2011 mueller and seneviratne 2012 greve et al 2014 gallego elvira et al 2016 holmes et al 2017 specifically soil moisture deficit reduces evaporation and leads to increased sensible heat causing localized increase in temperature which is predominately strong in regimes that are neither moisture nor energy limited and can occur throughout the year hirschi et al 2011 miralles et al 2018 this conditional dependence of hot extremes under drought conditions has been shown to be an important feature of the occurrence of compound droughts and hot extremes seneviratne et al 2012 the soil moisture temperature feedback and potential increase of extremes under climate change play important roles in controlling current and future changes of regional temperature quesada et al 2012 berg et al 2016 lorenz et al 2016 vogel et al 2017 miralles et al 2018 recent studies have shown that climate change may lead to shifts in the hotspots of soil moisture temperature feedback dirmeyer et al 2013 whan et al 2015 for example using the correlation coefficient as a metric of land atmosphere coupling previous studies have shown many processes in the soil moisture temperature feedback may be significantly modified under climate change seneviratne et al 2010 berg and sheffield 2018 vogel et al 2018 berg and sheffield 2019 this is expected to affect the conditional dependence between droughts and hot extremes however assessing the likelihood of variations of hot extremes under drought conditions due to changes in the conditional dependences is rather rare in this study we investigate changes in the conditional likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions during the period 1949 2010 in the united states the copula based conditional distribution model is employed to estimate the likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions incorporating changes in the dependence for two periods 1949 1979 and 1980 2010 we first show the changes in the dependence between droughts and hot extremes during summer in the united states we then quantify changes in the likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions during the two periods using the copula method 2 methods the copula methodology nelsen 2006 which has been widely used in modeling dependence between hydroclimatic variables genest and favre 2007 fang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 was employed in this study to construct the joint conditional distribution of droughts and hot extremes zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 ribeiro et al 2019 for continuous random variables x droughts and y hot extremes with marginal probability distributions u and v the joint probability or the likelihood of compound droughts and hot extremes can be expressed with a copula c as nelsen 2006 1 p x x y y u c u v a variety of copula families such as the elliptical and archimedean have been employed for constructing the joint distribution shown in eq 1 three 2 parameter copulas including clayton gumbel and frank are among the most commonly used copulas for the bivariate case kao and govindaraju 2010 and were used in this study for modeling the joint distribution of droughts and hot extremes a suitable copula for each period was selected based on the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 an estimator of the relative quality of the model and the best model was the one with the minimum aic value zhang and singh 2007 the conditional probability of hot extremes higher than a certain threshold given drought conditions lower than or equal to a certain threshold can be expressed as following hao et al 2017 2 p y y x x p x x y y p x x u c u v u the conditional probability in eq 2 quantifies the impact of droughts on the likelihood of hot extremes note that the numerator i e u c u v is essentially the likelihood of compound dry and hot extremes 3 data and results 3 1 data monthly precipitation and daily maximum temperature tmax data in the u s at 1 8 degree resolution were used in this study maurer et al 2002 which is available for the period from 1949 to 2010 these data were separated into two equal periods 1949 1979 and 1980 2010 for comparisons of results 31 years for each period the joint distribution of droughts and hot extremes is constructed based on the relatively long record of each period to assess changes in the likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions the standardized precipitation index spi mckee 1993 based on accumulated precipitation of different time scales is used as the drought indicator in this study to avoid uncertainties that may arise in the fitting of parametric distributions we computed the spi by using the empirical gringorten plotting position formula gringorten 1963 to estimate the marginal distribution since droughts and hot extremes may lead to large impacts to the water supply and energy consumption in summer we focus on the summer season of june july and august jja for the drought condition we computed the 3 month spi based on accumulated precipitation of jja to represent drought conditions during summer the summertime spi was computed for the two 31 yr periods 1949 1979 and 1980 2010 separately the threshold 0 8 was used to characterize the drought condition which has been used to classify the moderate drought condition in u s drought monitor usdm svoboda et al 2002 for the hot extreme we identified the highest daily maximum temperature for each month during jja respectively and then averaged them to represent the extreme temperature tx during summer the 90th percentile of extreme temperature has been commonly used to define the hot extreme perkins and alexander 2013 whan et al 2015 and was also employed in this study we also used different thresholds to define droughts spi 0 5 and hot extremes e g tx 70th and tx 80th and results were generally consistent not shown 3 2 dependence between droughts and hot extremes we first assess the dependence between droughts and hot extremes for the first period 1949 1979 which will then be compared with that for the period 1980 2010 to show the dependence change the kendall rank correlation coefficient τ which is a nonparametric measure of the dependence genest and favre 2007 zhang and singh 2007 wahl et al 2015 between the spi and percentiles of tx was computed for the period 1949 1979 as shown in fig 1 compared to limited regions with positive dependence in the western u s the negative correlation coefficient τ for the period 1949 1979 was shown for most regions in the united states with strong dependence in large regions of central and southeastern u s consistent with previous studies koster et al 2009 ford et al 2017 the negative correlation between droughts and hot extremes in large regions of the u s implies that the drought induced warming may in turn exacerbate the drought condition mueller and seneviratne 2012 resulting in compound droughts and hot extremes seneviratne et al 2012 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 in this study we are particularly interested in the drought induced warming and we focus on the region with negative dependence in fig 1 3 3 conditional likelihood of hot extremes under droughts to assess the likelihood of hot extremes associated with drought induced warming we focus on the conditional behavior of hot extremes under drought conditions the copula model was used to estimate the conditional probability of hot extremes given droughts section 2 at each grid point the three copulas frank clayton and gumbel were first fitted to drought and hot extreme indicators spi and tx for the period 1949 1979 and the best copula was selected based on minimum aic values the conditional probability of extreme temperature tx higher than the 90th percentile given the spi lower than or equal to 0 8 i e p t tx 90 spi 0 8 during summer for the period 1949 1979 is shown in fig 2 a given drought conditions the conditional probability of hot extremes is high in regions with significant negative dependence if droughts and hot extremes are independent the conditional probability of temperature higher than the 90th percentile would be 0 1 from fig 2 a the conditional probability of hot extremes given drought spi 0 8 was higher than that of the independence case in addition the likelihood of the compound dry and hot extreme is also higher in regions with significant negative dependence fig 2 b this result highlights the critical importance to study hot extremes from a multivariate perspective taking into account drought conditions or the compound dry and hot extreme especially in regions with significant correlation coefficients between the two extremes to assess potential uncertainties from the choice of different thresholds we also use the threshold spi 0 5 and t x 70th to show the joint and conditional probability in eqs 1 and 2 respectively supplementary materials fig s1 the pattern of the higher conditional probability and joint probability in regions with significant negative dependence between droughts and hot extremes fig s1 is consistent with results in fig 2 indicating the overall robustness of the results to evaluate the performance of the copula model we also compute the conditional probability and joint probability using the empirical method supplementary materials fig s2 which is conducted based on the r package compoundevents currently under development https r forge r project org projects compoundevents the empirical conditional probability can be estimated by counting the relative frequency of seasons with t x 70th for all seasons with spi 0 5 the conditional probability of hot extremes conditional on droughts from the copula model and from the empirical method are generally in agreement with each other for example the conditional probability in eastern texas is around 0 6 fig s1 similar to the value shown from the empirical estimation fig s2 these results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the copula model 3 4 changes in the dependence the difference of kendall rank correlation coefficient τ between droughts and hot extremes for the two periods 1949 1979 and 1980 2010 is shown in fig 3 for the regions with negative dependence during 1949 1979 the decrease of the correlation coefficient τ or increase of the negative dependence was mainly shown in the western southern and northeastern regions the increase of negative correlation coefficient or the decrease of negative dependence was shown in some areas of midwest and southeastern us to clearly show this pattern of dependence changes we selected two regions region a 101w 98 w 26 n 29 n region b 98 w 95 w 36 n 39 n with increased and decreased negative dependence respectively the boxplot of the correlation coefficient τ for all grids during the two periods in the two regions is shown in fig 4 a and b respectively for region a the median of the correlation coefficient τ was 0 23 during 1949 1979 and it decreased to 0 39 during 1979 2010 for region b the median of the correlation coefficient was 0 32 during 1949 1979 which increased to 0 21 during 1979 2010 the change of the dependence between droughts and hot extremes may be caused by potential variations of the soil moisture temperature interaction for the two periods under global warming seneviratne et al 2010 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 these results indicate the dependence between droughts and hot extremes for the period 1979 2010 has changed compared with that for 1949 1979 in these two regions 3 5 likelihood changes associated with dependence changes based on the analysis of the dependence between the two extremes section 3 2 and the associated likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions section 3 3 the change in the dependence shown in fig 3 section 3 4 is expected to result in changes in the likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions we then compared the conditional probability of hot extremes given droughts i e spi 0 8 during summer for the two periods 1949 1979 and 1980 2010 to assess changes in the likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions based on the copula model to avoid uncertainties from the copula differences during the two periods the same type of copula for the period 1949 1979 was used for the period 1980 2010 but with different copula parameters for negatively correlated droughts and hot extremes if the negative correlation coefficient τ decreases i e increased negative dependence the likelihood of the occurrence of hot extremes is expected to be higher given the same drought condition indicating a higher chance of occurrences of compound dry and hot events to clearly show the pattern of changes in the likelihood we took the average of precipitation and temperature of all grids in the two regions regions a and b from which the indicators of droughts and hot extremes were computed to assess regional changes in the likelihood associated with dependence changes the conditional probability p t tx spi 0 8 for the two periods in these two regions is shown in fig 4 c d due to the increased negative dependence between the spi and tx for region a the conditional probability p t tx 90 spi 0 8 increased from 0 22 to 0 28 due to the decreased negative dependence between the spi and tx for region b the conditional probability p t tx 90 spi 0 8 decreased from 0 27 to 0 22 these results demonstrate changes of likelihoods of hot extremes associated with changes in the dependence between droughts and hot extremes the ratio of the likelihood which is defined as the conditional probability p t tx 90 spi 0 8 for 1980 2010 divided by that for 1949 1979 is shown in fig 5 a the conditional probability p t tx 90 spi 0 8 for the period 1980 2010 showed an increase in the regions with increased negative dependence such as the southern u s fig 3 overall the ratio of likelihood increased significantly around 1 5 to 2 folds for the second period 1980 2010 in the western southern and northeastern u s this indicated that with the same drought condition i e spi 0 8 the occurrence of hot extremes increased by 150 to 200 in these regions during 1980 2010 the increased likelihood of hot extremes was also reflected in the increased joint probability of spi 0 8 and t tx 90 for 1980 2010 than that for 1949 1979 as shown in fig 5 b note that these results are consistent with the previous study on the frequency of compound drought and heat waves in the u s based on the empirical approach mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 which shows the increased frequency in roughly similar regions overall given the same drought condition the likelihood of hot extremes and compound droughts and hot extremes is shown to increase in the western southern and northeastern u s due to the increased negative dependence between droughts and hot extremes for the regions with decreased negative dependence a decreased conditional probability of hot extremes given spi 0 8 and likelihood of compound droughts and hot extremes was observed accordingly 4 conclusions and discussions this study investigated changes in the likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions for the two periods 1949 1979 and 1980 2010 in the united states results showed that dependence between droughts and hot extremes in the u s has changed with regional differences resulting in changes in the likelihood of hot extremes under drought conditions and compound droughts and hot extremes specifically the

5898,lack of geospecificity or local relevance is a major limitation in contemporary large scale flood modeling frameworks there is a little practical value for configuring a large scale model if the model produces streamflow and or inundation maps only along the large rivers while numerous lower order streams remain overlooked this study fills the gap through a new flood prediction framework based on the loose coupling of a hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool swat and a 1d 2d hydrodynamic model lisflood fp hence swat lisfp the prototype swat lisfp framework was configured with 26 000 stream reaches across the 500 000 km2 ohio river basin united states after being calibrated against 50 gauge stations across the basin swat simulated streamflow outputs were fed as upstream boundary conditions in lisflood fp the resultant flood inundation extents consistently captured 70 80 of the remotely sensed inundation irrespective of the flood events or locations within the basin this was also confirmed via cross validation with an existing flood modeling framework autorapid follum et al 2017 additional modeling experiments were conducted to facilitate two critical discussions how simulated inundation extent is affected by the uncertainty in streamflow prediction and the density of streamflow boundary conditions taking into account the uncertainties in swat streamflow lisflood fp showed a remarkable improvement with more than 95 of remotely sensed inundation captured within the simulated extent while this approach produces a variable area flood map i e a range of areas likely to be inundated at a particular point of time inundation in the lower order streams can still remain undetected a solution to this problem was demonstrated by setting up streamflow boundary conditions across further lower order streams which subsequently justified the need for high resolution stream network and hence the essence of locally relevant flood inundation modeling the new contributions of his study particularly through introducing swat as a functional hydrologic alternative to supplement a hydrodynamic model such as lisflood fp and the series of experiments to draw insights on addressing lack of accuracy and local relevance will enhance the global flood modeling initiatives keywords flood mapping floodplain global flood hazards hydrologic modeling hydrodynamic modeling ohio river basin 1 introduction with frequently occurring high magnitude floods and associated socio economic damages in many regions across the world researchers and decision makers are actively seeking suitable approaches for flood inundation mapping traditionally flood inundation maps are created by driving a hydrodynamic model with available stage or streamflow data e g cook and merwade 2009 liu et al 2019 liu and merwade 2019 musser and dyar 2007 however this approach cannot represent the propagation retention and attenuation of flooding across the entire stream network this is because gauges that record flow and stage data are mostly installed along higher order streams thereby leaving many lower order streams unmonitored even the data available at higher order streams are of too short length or too poor quality to accurately capture floodplain hydrodynamics di baldassarre and montanari 2009 an effective way to address this information gap at both gauged and ungauged streams is through an integrated hydrologic hydrodynamic modeling framework in such a framework one or more hydrologic models can simulate streamflow which can provide upstream boundary conditions or forcing data to one or more hydrodynamic models for producing flood inundation maps the coupling of hydrologic and hydrodynamic models is a well recognized approach but common only to small watersheds e g huang and hattermann 2018 kim et al 2012 komi et al 2017 nguyen et al 2016 development of large scale hydrologic hydrodynamic modeling frameworks covering the world s major river basin s e g biancamaria et al 2009 hoch et al 2017 paiva et al 2013 paiva et al 2011 schumann et al 2013 are not yet full fledged we identified three persistent limitations in the current state of the art large scale flood modeling initiatives i lack of geospecificity or local relevance in predicted flood information ii applications restricted only to identify a zone of potential food hazards so called floodplain maps not the actual flooding and iii acute inaccuracy problem to justify the rationale of our study these limitations are elaborately discussed below large scale predictions of streamflow and inundation maps are immensely helpful for operational disaster information systems what seriously impedes such potential is the lack of local relevance spatial resolution of topography data and computational mesh configuration in a hydrologic and or hydrodynamic model are frequently used to define the local relevance of its outputs e g chen et al 2017 gallegos et al 2009 hartnett and nash 2017 wood et al 2011 we suggest that this definition is a misnomer for fluvial flood prediction and mitigation planning for instance there is little practical value for configuring a model with meter scale computational mesh if the so called high or hyper resolution model produces streamflow and or inundation maps only along the main river channels see e g biancamaria et al 2009 chen et al 2017 komi et al 2017 logah et al 2017 schumann et al 2013 wilson et al 2007 on the contrary it is physically more meaningful and thus practically informative to construct flood models so that the degree of local relevance is dictated by the resolution spatial density of stream network considering as many lower order streams as possible via a high resolution stream network would ensure the maximum local relevance of streamflow and inundation maps across large spatial scales a fundamental aspect of flood prediction previously ignored in research and operational management in line with efforts to build large scale locally relevant flood prediction frameworks global flood hazard models have received considerable attention in recent times e g alfieri et al 2014 dottori et al 2016 pappenberger et al 2012 sampson et al 2015 wing et al 2017 however these initiatives have only produced static maps with a specific probability of flood occurrence e g 100 year return period while these maps stimulate new generation of spatially explicit floodplain ecohydrologic and socio economic management kiedrzyńska et al 2015 smith et al 2019 they cannot be considered as actual flood maps near real time mapping of flood inundation extents with corresponding streamflow data is the main requirement for a decision support system that can inform real life flood management to facilitate near real time predictions national oceanic and atmospheric administration in the united states developed the national water model nwm framework maidment 2017 nwm predicts streamflow and potential flood inundation extents across 2 7 million streams in the continental us an unprecedented combination considering both spatial scale and resolution of stream network maidment et al 2016 follum et al 2017 introduced the autorapid framework demonstrating its capability for fast parsimonious flood map simulation across millions of streams in the midwest us and mississippi delta there is a concomitant trend of similar initiatives for other parts of the world as well e g glofrim by hoch et al 2017 while these emergent frameworks offer increased flood information capacity in public domain their accuracy during real life flood events and means to efficiently address their prediction uncertainties have not been thoroughly investigated see e g afshari et al 2018 salas et al 2018 zheng et al 2018a what is also being overlooked in the previous studies is the possibility that two such frameworks independently developed for a particular basin may produce largely inconsistent flood information accordingly there remains the urgency to continue developing robust hydrologic hydrodynamic model combinations and ensure reliable flood information via real life accuracy assessments and inter framework comparisons this study aims to fill these gaps with a newly developed large scale locally relevant flood prediction framework at its core the framework loosely couples hydrologic model swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2011 with 1d 2d hydrodynamic model lisflood fp bates and de roo 2000 horritt and bates 2001 bates et al 2013 neal et al 2012 with a prototype daily simulation setup involving 26 000 stream reaches across the ohio river basin a 500 000 km2 region within the mississippi river system fig 1 we addressed the following questions to infer a comprehensive understanding on the framework s predictability and representativeness 1 how accurate is the new framework during real life flood events does the existing framework s corroborate the new framework s predicted flood inundation extents 2 does knowing the level of hydrologic uncertainty help increase the predictability of inundation extents 3 how does local relevance i e spatial resolution of stream network influence models ability to capture inundation extents over large spatial scales 2 model selection many 1d 2d hydrodynamic models have been developed as stand alone software packages to support reach or watershed scale simulations nelson et al 2003 musser and dyar 2007 vanderkimpen et al 2009 ballesteros et al 2011 nguyen et al 2016 usace 2016 for a large scale flood modeling framework involving numerous streams choice of a hydrodynamic model depends primarily on its easy interoperability with a driver hydrologic model opportunities for cyber enabled high performance computation and flexibility for data assimilation kauffeldt et al 2016 merwade et al 2018 this is why low complexity parsimonious inundation mapping tools relying on topography roughness parameters and simple hydraulic equations such as those used in the nwm or autorapid frameworks follum et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 zheng et al 2018a b have gained great community attention however because these tools lack physical process descriptions on floodplain mechanisms their application involves a trade off between fast computation power and accuracy as such they may underperform compared to 1d 2d hydrodynamic models afshari et al 2018 to this end lisflood fp has emerged as a suitable hydrodynamic model although nearly all of the large scale frameworks using lisflood fp are designed for mapping a static areal extent with a specific probability of inundation e g the floodplain maps by alfieri et al 2014 dottori et al 2016 sampson et al 2015 wing et al 2017 it is possible to configure lisflood fp for near real time prediction of potential flood events wing et al 2019 hoch et al 2017 and schumann et al 2013 demonstrated this by coupling lisflood fp respectively with variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 2003 and pcraster global water balance pcr globwb van beek and bierkens 2009 models however using coarse resolution stream networks therefore how lisflood fp would perform in a much complex setup e g 26 000 stream reaches across the 500 000 km2 ohio river basin fig 1 is still an outstanding question for large scale simulation of streamflow across high resolution stream networks coupled atmospheric land surface river routing models are being increasingly used in recent times e g lin et al 2019 2018a b tavakoly et al 2017 for instance the noah mp model under the auspices of wrf hydro modeling system is adopted in the nwm flood prediction framework salas et al 2018 there have been several large scale applications of vic and pcr globwb as well but these applications often involve coarse resolution stream network e g hoch et al 2017 schumann et al 2013 as noted above or monthly time scale simulation e g oubeidillah et al 2014 safeeq et al 2014 van beek et al 2011 swat is another process based model frequently applied on the world s major river basins e g abbaspour et al 2015 daggupati et al 2015 du et al 2018 pervez and henebry 2015 rajib and merwade 2017 schuol et al 2008 in addition to the well documented evaluations that approve swat s effectiveness arnold et al 2012 there are web based platforms such as swatshare that can be used to publish and share swat models with a broader community and perform extensive calibration using high performance computational resource rajib et al 2016a the companion tools of swatshare such as hydroglobe can assimilate multi source earth observations e g rajib et al 2018a b and swatflow can perform dynamic visualization of hydrographs and flood inundation extents these are the emergent opportunities which led to swat s selection for our flood prediction framework to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to show the application of swat model as the hydrologic component of a large scale flood prediction framework our framework also involves the most complex assembly of lisflood fp till date specifically considering the combined overburden of large basin area high resolution stream network and topography and continuous daily simulation while this study demonstrates a prototype framework using recent flood events in the ohio river basin as test cases efforts are underway to extend the models over a much larger domain and perform near real time predictions 3 methodology 3 1 ohio river basin as the flood modeling testbed the 500 000 km2 ohio river basin orb fig 1 is the largest sub basin of the mississippi river system in terms of water volume thus carrying a great socio economic and ecological significance for the north american continent an intriguing factor to consider orb as a flood modeling testbed is the increasing frequency of flood events over the past decades holmes et al 2012 holmes and dinicola 2010 mallakpour and villarini 2015 a historical record by us national weather service nws 2018 suggests that the ohio river at cincinnati located in the most downstream portion of the basin came near or above the designated flood stage 108 times within a span of 160 years 1858 2018 i e nearly 1 potential extreme event in every 1 5 year period previous studies analyzing land management and or climate change effects also confirmed the increasing flood frequency in orb e g du et al 2018 kunkel et al 2013 tayyebi et al 2015 despite this rising threats of flood hazard flood modeling studies specifically focusing on orb do not exist in literature 3 2 hydrologic modeling 3 2 1 swat model setup setting up a swat model in the gis interface arcswat requires three geospatial datasets digital elevation model dem land use and soil texture these datasets were obtained from the following sources 30 m dem from the us geological survey usgs national elevation dataset ned usgs 2013a 30 m land use data from the 2011 national land cover database nlcd usgs 2013b and 1 250 000 scale state soil geographic data statsgo built in with swat geodatabase to reduce the computational burden all topographic analyses e g sub basin delineation were performed by resampling the dem to a 90 m spatial resolution following several other large scale swat applications e g schuol et al 2008 faramarzi et al 2017 du et al 2018 a sub basin was treated as the smallest spatial unit of hydrologic simulations elevation difference across the basin was represented via three slope classes 0 4 4 10 and 10 to enable comparison with similar flood modeling initiatives in the us previously noted e g follum et al 2017 maidment 2017 tavakoly et al 2017 the nhdplus stream network national hydrography dataset plus mckay et al 2012 was superimposed burned in on the 90 m dem along with a 100 km2 threshold area for headwater stream identification this 100 km2 threshold was selected via multiple iterations to spatially match the dem generated stream network with nhdplus dataset the model could also use nhdplus stream network directly however such an option would require a significant amount of gis pre processing and quality assessment tasks to ensure continuous connectivity of streams see e g david et al 2013 nonetheless our dem based network delineation resulted into 26 000 individual stream reaches and sub basins fig 1 for every stream reach hydraulic geometry i e bank full width wc and depth dc were defined by relating upstream drainage area da with semi empirical power law relationships w c 1 29da 0 6 and d c 0 13da 0 4 where da is in km2 and w is in m her et al 2017 this approach similar to other large scale hydrologic river routing models hoch et al 2017 li et al 2013 paiva et al 2013 allowed w values in lower order streams to be smaller than the dem s spatial resolution for instance the minimum wc in the orb model was 2 m whereas the underlying dem cell size was 90 m the above bank water was simply routed through a hypothetical floodplain with a constant 5wc width neitsch et al 2011 weather forcing data were obtained from the 12 km north american data assimilation system nldas phase ii nasa 2019 and national centers for environmental prediction s ncep 38 km climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 specifically total daily precipitation were obtained from nldas whereas other energy related inputs including minimum maximum daily temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were obtained from cfsr potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated using swat s built in penman monteith approach nearly 30 of orb has artificial subsurface drainage tile drainage du et al 2018 therefore tile drainage routine was activated for all the sub basins having poorly drained soils e g du et al 2018 green et al 2006 reservoir storage discharge could not be explicitly considered in the current orb setup because of limited access to dam operation data although this limitation was implicitly addressed via rigorous streamflow calibration across a large number of gauge stations processes related to infiltration surface runoff generation and channel routing were simulated using the curve number and variable storage methods respectively neitsch et al 2011 3 2 2 calibration and validation of swat the orb swat model was first initialized for 1 year 2009 and then calibrated for a 2 year period 2010 2011 using daily streamflow observations at 50 usgs gauge stations fig 2 a and supplementary information s1 the simultaneous multi site calibration involved 18 parameters related to surface subsurface snow accumulation and in stream hydrologic responses supplementary information s2 du et al 2018 previously calibrated a coarse resolution orb swat model using 80 years 1935 2014 of streamflow data at 9 gauge stations for calibrating the current orb swat model initial parameter ranges were defined based on the optimization results of du et al 2018 the parameter optimization was conducted with sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour 2015 using a weighted kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 rajib et al 2016b 2018b as the objective function kge was maximized to obtain the most optimal parameter set which produces the best possible agreement between simulated and observed streamflow hydrographs at target locations kge 1 means 100 agreement relying on a single streamflow output time series the so called best hydrograph may not be reasonable because of the uncertainties in extreme flow predictions a problem common to any large scale hydrologic model abbaspour et al 2015 faramarzi et al 2017 therefore a band hydrograph representing the 95 prediction uncertainty abbaspour 2015 was produced for every reach in addition to the best hydrograph representing the most optimal streamflow corresponding the most optimal parameter set to allow an independent posterior evaluation the model was validated over a separate 2 year period 2012 2013 and at 5 separate gauge stations across the basin targeting different upstream drainage areas topography land use and climatic conditions fig 2a 3 3 hydrodynamic modeling 3 3 1 coupling swat and lisflood fp simulated streamflow outputs from swat were fed as the upstream boundary conditions in lisflood fp this was a loose coupling prototype architecture where both swat and lisfloo fp were executed in stand alone mode and an intermediate relational data model e g hoch et al 2017 peckham et al 2013 allowed the one way transfer of information we performed three separate sets of simulations m1 m3 by varying the boundary conditions of lisflood fp table 1 irrespective of their differences the basic setup and parameterization procedure in lisflood fp were kept identical across all the configurations throughout the following discussion we name the framework swat lisfp 3 3 2 lisflood fp setup and calibration the geospatial datasets topography land use and stream network required to set up lisflood fp were the same as in the orb swat model in all the configurations m1 m3 a sub grid scale hydrodynamic scheme neal et al 2012 was applied to solve the momentum and continuity equations for channel flow and floodplain flow respectively eqs 1 3 1 q c t δ t q c t g a c f l o w t δ t s c t 1 g δ t n c 2 q c t r c f l o w t 4 3 a c f l o w t 2 q f i 1 2 t δ t q f i 1

x grid cell width defined by the spatial resolution of the input dem qf unit width flow rate in floodplain wc channel bank full width h f depth of floodplain flow g gravitational acceleration simulation of flood inundation in lisflood fp requires each stream reach to be described using four parameters bank full width wc bank elevation z bed elevation zb and manning s n bates et al 2013 given the loose nature of integration between swat and lisflood fp it is challenging to minimize the propagation of uncertainty resulting from the obvious differences in models respective floodplain representation and corresponding numerical schemes one way to address this issue is to maintain the best possible consistency in channel floodplain representation by parameterizing both models with identical values of wc z zb and n in the current setup of the framework reach average values for each of these input parameters were adopted as described below i bank full width wc reach average wc values were directly exported from the orb swat model these can also be derived from existing global databases andreadis et al 2013 or using at station hydraulic geometry leopold and maddock 1953 most of the previous applications of lisflood fp adopted either of these two approaches e g neal et al 2012 schumann et al 2013 however global databases are mostly derived from available coarse resolution dems so that they provide wc values only for higher order streams calculation of at station hydraulic geometry does not produce reasonable results in relatively ungauged areas not to mention the heavy computational overhead required to perform at a station analysis across thousands of stream reaches as such exporting swat wc a drainage area based estimate similar to other large scale models hoch et al 2017 li et al 2013 paiva et al 2013 noted in section 3 2 1 deemed as an efficient way for parameterizing lisflood fp ii bank elevation z for any grid cell that has w associated with it lisflood fp picked the elevation data from the input dem and assigned that as the corresponding z value bates et al 2013 iii bed elevation zb this was defined as z dc where dc is the bank full depth similar to wc dc was exported from swat as well alternatively lisflood fp can approximate dc as a wc b following leopold and maddock 1953 here a and b are user defined coefficients which can be optimized through calibration using swat estimated dc values was more practical than seeking so called calibrated values of a and b for 26 000 reaches while maintaining consistency between the two model components and reducing computational overhead this approach eliminated potential uncertainties induced from inappropriate values of a and b iv roughness coefficient for floodplain manning s coefficient nf a set of nf values were adopted from the supporting literature kalyanapu et al 2010 and assigned to each of the land use classes in lisflood fp in this manner nf was varied across the basin allowing the model to effectively represent floodplain surface heterogeneity v roughness coefficient for channel manning s coefficient nc a unique nc value 0 03 was assigned throughout the stream network this unique value was derived from a calibration experiment based on a coarse resolution lisflood fp setup merwade et al 2018 rajib et al 2016c in this preliminary experiment nc values were varied between 0 01 and 0 05 in 0 005 increments one at a time every iteration assigning a unique nc throughout the stream network after each iteration the relative change in spatial agreement of simulated inundation extents was measured against the us federal emergency management agency 100 year flood hazard maps fema https msc fema gov portal accordingly 0 03 was found to be a representative estimate of channel roughness for orb considering the maximum agreement between fema maps and lisflood fp simulations although fema maps are mostly model simulated outcomes xian et al 2015 and not the observed extents of actual flood events using these maps to compare the results of other hydrodynamic models is an approach frequently followed in flood modeling studies e g afshari et al 2018 although floodplain roughness nf in the orb model was varied spatially representing channel roughness with a unique nc value for the entire stream network might have posed some inaccuracies in simulated flood maps however it is not uncommon to use a unique nc value in flood modeling especially over large spatial scales see e g afshari et al 2018 hoch et al 2017 li et al 2013 rudorff et al 2014 in fact the nc value 0 03 used for orb is the same as the one used for the mississippi and amazon river basins by follum et al 2017 autorapid framework and hoch et al 2017 glofrim framework respectively 3 4 validation of simulated inundation extents 3 4 1 comparison with remotely sensed observations real life observed flood inundation maps derived from open access remotely sensed imagery were used as the primary reference data for model validation specifically landsat satellite images for may 4 2011 and april 22 2013 were obtained from usgs earth explorer http earthexplorer usgs gov fig 3 so that they represent different flood magnitudes across different areas within the basin with different topography and land use conditions yet model validation based on satellite imagery is not always ideal due to cloud cover contamination wang et al 2019 as well as the potential temporal mismatch between satellite e g repeat cycle exact time of image acquisition and model outputs e g daily average data we strategically designed our approach so that these issues impart minimal influence on validation results specifically despite the 16 day repeat cycle of landsat satellite availability of relatively cloud free image was one of our main criteria of selecting flood events dates for model validation further each of the dates selected for model validation was within a multi day span of flood inundation unlike flash floods that dissipate within a few hours stakeholder inputs not discussed here in such cases a landsat image could represent the average flood condition throughout the day irrespective of the satellite s exact image acquisition time this assumption despite imposing some limitations on validation results allows consistent comparison of satellite data with daily average outputs derived from daily time step of model simulations raw landsat images were processed through a supervised image classification technique in arcgis to distinguish flood inundation extents this classification was conducted by i creating training polygons for known land use classes such as waterbodies forest agricultural and urban areas and then ii applying a maximum likelihood method to separate flooded areas all the flooded areas in an image were then converted and aggregared into gis polygons and thus a reference map for evaluating simulated inundation extents this so called remotely sensed reference inundation map is subject to uncertainty due to satelittte s image acquisition processing and the subsequent image classification techniques moreover the landsat images available through usgs platform are in 30 m spatial resolution which may be too coarse to capture flooding along the lower order streams effects of these uncertainties on model evaluation results were not considered in this study 3 4 2 comparison with an existing flood modeling framework it is important to acknowledge how a newly developed flood prediction framework might compare with the frameworks that are already available for a particular region of interest while this cross validation step has been commonly ignored in the previous studies we sought evidence on swat lisfp s predictability and reliability using a secondary set of reference flood maps generated from autorapid in the basic setup of autorapid follum et al 2017 first the routing application for parallel computation of discharge rapid david et al 2011 model computes streamflow using gridded runoff data from land surface models lsms e g tavakoly et al 2017 a parsimonious hydraulic model autoroute follum et al 2013 uses this streamflow and manning s equation to calculate the normal flow depth across a large number of channel cross sections where the cross section geometry is derived directly from topography data finally autoroute simulates inundation extents using a volume filling numerical method at each cross section to facilitate a comparison with the current swat lisfp setup we executed autorapid across orb only for the two specific flood events mentioned above fig 3 using nhdplus stream network and 10 m ned dem here we limit this comparison only to flood inundation extents potential inconsistencies between these two frameworks related to different model inputs process conceptualizations and parameter calibrations are not addressed in this study 3 4 3 model performance metrics f fit and c correctness indices alfieri et al 2014 liu and merwade 2018 were used to measure prediction accuracy of simulated flood inundation extents eqs 4 5 4 f a rm a r a m a rm 5 c a rm a r here ar and am refer to the reference remote sensing autorapid and model simulated inundation extents respectively and arm refers to the common inundated area intersection between the two flood maps by definition both indices range from 0 to 1 f index indicates the degree to which reference and simulated extents match f 1 means 100 overlap as f decreases the simulated inundation extent starts to deviate from the reference either over estimation or under estimation until no overlap can be found f 0 on the contrary c index is a relatively less conservative metric of model accuracy signifying the percentage of the reference extent that is correctly predicted by simulation when c equals 1 reference flood extent falls entirely within the simulated extent even though the model might actually be over estimating the inundated area therefore c is always greater or equal to f for a given set of simulated and reference inundation maps 4 results and discussion 4 1 overall predictability and representativeness of the framework 4 1 1 streamflow streamflow simulation performance in terms of kge across 55 gauge stations indicated a robust model fig 4 a kge between usgs data and the most optimal swat simulations ranged between 0 20 and 0 90 with a value 0 4 0 5 or higher in 64 of the target locations 35 out of 55 gauge stations fig 4b the equally reasonable performance regardless of calibration or validation run especially considering non overlapping time periods and a separate set of gauge stations approved consistent predictability of the model while streamflow output based on the most optimal parameter set may underperform at some locations hence relatively low kge a well calibrated model should have a narrow uncertainty band r factor 1 with most of the reference data points captured therein p factor 1 abbaspour 2015 we exemplify this in fig 4c for one of the validation locations where the model produced relatively low kge but acceptable p factor and r factor estimates the robustness of streamflow simulation as noted above might have been resulted from our methodological design that involved substantially rigorous calibration compared to many other large scale flood modeling frameworks for instance our 50 site swat calibration largely contrasts 3 site pcr globwb calibration in a similar sized amazonian sub basin glofrim framework by hoch et al 2017 also compare with 8 site mgb iph calibration across the entire amazon river basin by paiva et al 2013 although the short run time 5 years of our prototype framework is similar to that used in glofrim 6 years hoch et al 2017 we selected parameter initial ranges based on a prior 80 year streamflow calibration du et al 2018 noted in section 3 2 2 these comparisons considered alongside the overall streamflow simulation performance fig 4 suggest that our current orb swat model is capable of reproducing and forecasting hydrologic variabilities with reasonable accuracy 4 1 2 flood inundation extents the simulated flood inundation maps matched considerably well with remotely sensed observations fig 5 and autorapid outputs fig 6 specifically when the upstream boundary conditions in lisflood fp were set with the most optimal swat streamflow m1 configuration table 1 simulated flood maps showed f 0 6 0 65 and c 0 75 0 8 with respect to remotely sensed observations these performance measures suggest a fairly good accuracy notwithstanding the deterministic streamflow forcing complete lack of in situ channel geometry data and challenges they imposed on models representation of 26 000 stream reaches across the 500 000 km2 basin the predictability and representativeness of our swat lisfp framework was further justified when we found resemblance between swat lisfp and autorapid flood maps f 0 7 0 75 and c 0 75 0 85 fig 6 clearly swat lisfp flood maps were consistently accurate across different flood events and regions within the basin and regardless of the reference dataset used in evaluating model performance which confirms the reliability of the framework for real life applications 4 2 effect of streamflow prediction uncertainty on simulated flood inundation inaccuracies of deterministic inundation maps and their implications on efficient flood management planning have been long standing discussions in flood modeling practices merwade et al 2008 most of the previous studies on probabilistic inundation were conducted at reach or watershed scales e g di baldassarre et al 2010 to comply with the physical meaning of a probabilistic flood map the most ideal way is to perform delicate numerical analyses and distinguish both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties in model simulations alfonso et al 2016 which may not be feasible for a very complex model setup such as the one presented in this study given the above one simple alternative would be to at least inform the hydrodynamic model about the uncertainties in hydrologic streamflow simulation our m2 configuration ran such a scenario by setting up the boundary conditions in lisflood fp with a band of streamflow table 1 fig 4c the outcome was a flood map showing the minimum and maximum extents of flood inundation fig 7 here the maximum and minimum inundation extents resulted respectively from the upper and lower bounds of the 95 prediction uncertainty in streamflow simulation it is evident that simulated flood inundation based on band hydrographs captured nearly 100 of the remotely sensed inundation whereas the same model setup using the most optimal streamflow data as boundary conditions captured less than 80 compare c index in fig 5a and fig 7 in areas where the maximum simulated extent overestimated the reference map the minimum extent produced a better match therefore the maximum simulated extent does not mean that it has a greater likelihood of occurrence than the minimum extent together they delineate an area that is likely to be inundated during a flood event these findings clearly suggest that instead of predicting a single deterministic flood inundation extent based on the most optimal streamflow output m1 predicting a potential areal range of inundation via integrating streamflow uncertainty into the channel floodplain hydrodynamic simulation m2 greatly minimizes bias this with different representations of channel geometry and roughness in lisflood fp would produce an end to end probabilistic flood map e g liu and merwade 2018 our study demonstrates that swat lisfp can efficiently account for these uncertainties implying meaningful practical implications of the framework for near real time disaster management 4 3 effect of densified streamflow boundary conditions on simulated flood inundation in the first two configurations m1 and m2 lisflood fp ingested swat simulated streamflow at a limited number of locations where the channel becomes wider than 90 m table 1 fig 2b in order to evaluate the role of upstream boundary conditions on large scale flood inundation the m3 configuration ingested streamflow at lower order streams where the channel becomes wider than 30 m fig 2c results obtained from m3 configuration revealed prominent improvement in simulated inundation compare fig 8 m3 f 0 70 and c 0 91 versus fig 5b m1 f 0 60 and c 0 80 this improvement in model predictability was more noticeable in lower order streams like any other hydrodynamic model it is theoretically impossible for lisflood fp to produce fluvial floodplain inundation if lower order streams hence the associated streamflow inputs do not exist in the model this was why the ability to set up abundant streamflow boundary conditions via a high resolution stream network enabled better prediction of flood inundation extents in m3 this in other words justified our definition of locally relevant flood modeling where spatial resolution is defined in terms of the number of streams being modeled not the grid size of the dem or the model simulation 5 potential opportunities for improved predictability logic suggests that the possible increase in streamflow accuracy should correspondingly lead to more accurate flood inundation maps but attempting high accuracy in streamflow simulation simply by parameter calibration is a challenging task irrespective of the model used in a flood prediction framework e g an early prototype version of nwm by lin et al 2018b for instance despite involving 50 gauge stations in the calibration process the relatively under performing streamflow simulation at some locations in the current orb swat model may be due to the lack of spatially explicit reservoir storage discharge functions this problem could be minimized by incorporating reservoir geometry data i e maximum water surface area and storage volume in hydrologic models neitsch et al 2011 while these information are accessible from global databases for some of the major reservoirs e g lehner döll 2004 salas et al 2018 and tavakoly et al 2017 showed how streamflow simulation accuracy in a large scale flood prediction framework can be improved by directly assimilating available gauge data at reservoir outlets or reservoir release flow without requiring explicit inputs on reservoir geometry this also underscores the potential for assimilating remotely sensed streamflow data at reservoir outlet locations e g surface water and ocean topography swot satellite mission yoon et al 2016 yet assimilating reservoir outflow data and or considering more gauge stations for parameter calibration may not improve overall fidelity kannan et al 2019 because hydrologic models often give right answers acceptable streamflow at the watershed outlet for wrong reasons biased water balance across the watershed therefore in addition to targeting improved streamflow predictability at discrete locations the overall physical state of the hydrologic model needs to be improved by assimilating remotely sensed soil moisture and or evapotranspiration data e g han et al 2012 rajib et al 2018a b so that the model remains well informed of the antecedent watershed conditions at the onset of extreme events to enhance hydrodynamic modeling accuracy improving the channel geometry representation is perhaps the most widely acknowledged measure cook and merwade 2009 we suggest that channel geometry is important for both hydrologic and hydrodynamic models this is because a realistic representation of channel width depth would enable improved simulation of floodplain storage and hence the timing and magnitude of peak flow in the hydrologic model her et al 2017 which would subsequently allow the hydrodynamic model to precisely capture inundation pattern cook and merwade 2009 global databases on channel width depth exist e g andreadis et al 2013 however these databases do not provide information for lower order streams calibrating the power law equations that conceptualize channel width depth e g sections 3 2 1 and 3 3 2 may be a pursuable approach only where relevant reference data stage height are available to fill this information gap an algorithm to reconstruct channel geometry from high resolution topography data e g dey et al 2019 appears to be an efficient solution such an algorithm may be tightly coupled with both hydrologic and hydrodynamic model architectures enabling seamless assimilation of channel geometry data in respective simulations besides this use of a unique channel roughness nc throughout the stream network is another persistent limitation in large scale hydrodynamic model setups e g follum et al 2017 hoch et al 2017 also noted in section 3 3 2 it would be ideal to select nc values based on a regional calibration of manning s equation across clusters of land use and slope while these are important considerations for improved predictability of large scale locally relevant flood models associated data model interoperability and computational challenges cannot be overstated 6 summary and future direction contrary to the long standing practice of reach or watershed scale flood modeling there is a need to build large scale flood prediction capabilities additionally it is necessary that a so called large scale model is locally relevant evolved from this critical yet often overlooked perspective our study provides the first assessment of a new large scale locally relevant flood prediction framework that loosely couples hydrologic model swat with hydrodynamic model lisflood fp hence swat lisfp in the prototype framework swat simulates streamflows for nearly 26 000 stream reaches across the 500 000 km2 ohio river basin which feed lisflood fp as the upstream boundary conditions to simulate flood inundation extents potentially at near real time based on three contrasting modeling configurations the following conclusions are drawn i streamflow outputs are reasonably accurate in terms of kge performance metric based on the calibration validation results across 55 gauge stations kge values range between 0 20 and 0 90 especially kge 0 5 in more than 60 of the target locations indicates a robust model using the so called most optimal or best fit swat streamflow as the upstream boundary conditions m1 configuration lisflood fp produces flood inundation extents that are consistently 70 80 accurate f and c indices with respect to the remotely sensed observations of real life flood events the simulated flood inundation extents also show strong resemblance with the outputs produced by an existing flood prediction framework autorapid follum et al 2017 this two step model validation using two independent reference datasets remote sensing and autorapid approves the reliability of swat lisfp framework ii while the above findings are based on a single deterministic flood map generated by a best fit streamflow forcing boundary condition swat lisfp can also delineate a range of inundated areas by considering the uncertainty in streamflow simulation specifically the simulated extents considering the 95 streamflow uncertainty band can potentially capture the entirety of actual remotely sensed flooding this is a key finding indicating the ability of our prototype framework to efficiently minimize prediction bias iii our results clearly show that setting up streamflow boundary conditions only in the large rivers e g locations beyond which a channel is wider than 90 m leaves a considerable portion of flood inundation undetected in comparison model predictability noticeably improves when the boundary conditions are set at the lower order streams a high resolution stream network implies availability of densified streamflow estimates from a hydrologic model densified streamflow would allow more rigorous constraining of the hydrodynamic model boosting its capacity to detect flooded areas across large spatial scales these findings rationalize the use of a high resolution stream network and hence the new theme of locally relevant flood modeling an important aspect disregarded in many of the existing large scale frameworks while these results are promising an added benefit of our framework is the parameter interoperability between swat and lisflood fp with the current inter model data transfer mechanism lisflood fp can export channel geometry bank full width and depth for each of the stream reaches n 26 000 directly from swat s algorithm while greatly minimizing dependency on in situ data acquisition and or hydrodynamic model calibrations this interoperability also eliminates propagation error that may stem from the driver hydrologic model and subsequently affect the simulated inundation extents accordingly it is possible that improvements in swat s floodplain river corridor representation through process modifications integrating spatially resolved global datasets and or remote sensing techniques would automatically increase the overall accuracy of lisflood fp our perspective is not limited to coupling models and evaluating their performances currently efforts are underway to equip swat with a reproducible workflow of multi source multi variate remotely sensed data assimilation e g rajib et al 2018a b to enable near real time predictions input management especially to handle sub daily weather forecasts and associated data transfer mechanism from swat to lisflood fp will be restructured as well eventually the framework will be prompted from a cyber infrastructure so that it can be findable accessible interoperable and reproducible fair swatshare a recently developed cyber infrastructure for sharing data assimilation high performance simulation and visualization of environmental models rajib et al 2016a is an example attesting our motive towards that direction with these emergent cohesive efforts it is possible to transform the current prototype framework into a sustainable globally applicable flood modeling and information system declaration of competing interest the authors declare

5898,lack of geospecificity or local relevance is a major limitation in contemporary large scale flood modeling frameworks there is a little practical value for configuring a large scale model if the model produces streamflow and or inundation maps only along the large rivers while numerous lower order streams remain overlooked this study fills the gap through a new flood prediction framework based on the loose coupling of a hydrologic model soil and water assessment tool swat and a 1d 2d hydrodynamic model lisflood fp hence swat lisfp the prototype swat lisfp framework was configured with 26 000 stream reaches across the 500 000 km2 ohio river basin united states after being calibrated against 50 gauge stations across the basin swat simulated streamflow outputs were fed as upstream boundary conditions in lisflood fp the resultant flood inundation extents consistently captured 70 80 of the remotely sensed inundation irrespective of the flood events or locations within the basin this was also confirmed via cross validation with an existing flood modeling framework autorapid follum et al 2017 additional modeling experiments were conducted to facilitate two critical discussions how simulated inundation extent is affected by the uncertainty in streamflow prediction and the density of streamflow boundary conditions taking into account the uncertainties in swat streamflow lisflood fp showed a remarkable improvement with more than 95 of remotely sensed inundation captured within the simulated extent while this approach produces a variable area flood map i e a range of areas likely to be inundated at a particular point of time inundation in the lower order streams can still remain undetected a solution to this problem was demonstrated by setting up streamflow boundary conditions across further lower order streams which subsequently justified the need for high resolution stream network and hence the essence of locally relevant flood inundation modeling the new contributions of his study particularly through introducing swat as a functional hydrologic alternative to supplement a hydrodynamic model such as lisflood fp and the series of experiments to draw insights on addressing lack of accuracy and local relevance will enhance the global flood modeling initiatives keywords flood mapping floodplain global flood hazards hydrologic modeling hydrodynamic modeling ohio river basin 1 introduction with frequently occurring high magnitude floods and associated socio economic damages in many regions across the world researchers and decision makers are actively seeking suitable approaches for flood inundation mapping traditionally flood inundation maps are created by driving a hydrodynamic model with available stage or streamflow data e g cook and merwade 2009 liu et al 2019 liu and merwade 2019 musser and dyar 2007 however this approach cannot represent the propagation retention and attenuation of flooding across the entire stream network this is because gauges that record flow and stage data are mostly installed along higher order streams thereby leaving many lower order streams unmonitored even the data available at higher order streams are of too short length or too poor quality to accurately capture floodplain hydrodynamics di baldassarre and montanari 2009 an effective way to address this information gap at both gauged and ungauged streams is through an integrated hydrologic hydrodynamic modeling framework in such a framework one or more hydrologic models can simulate streamflow which can provide upstream boundary conditions or forcing data to one or more hydrodynamic models for producing flood inundation maps the coupling of hydrologic and hydrodynamic models is a well recognized approach but common only to small watersheds e g huang and hattermann 2018 kim et al 2012 komi et al 2017 nguyen et al 2016 development of large scale hydrologic hydrodynamic modeling frameworks covering the world s major river basin s e g biancamaria et al 2009 hoch et al 2017 paiva et al 2013 paiva et al 2011 schumann et al 2013 are not yet full fledged we identified three persistent limitations in the current state of the art large scale flood modeling initiatives i lack of geospecificity or local relevance in predicted flood information ii applications restricted only to identify a zone of potential food hazards so called floodplain maps not the actual flooding and iii acute inaccuracy problem to justify the rationale of our study these limitations are elaborately discussed below large scale predictions of streamflow and inundation maps are immensely helpful for operational disaster information systems what seriously impedes such potential is the lack of local relevance spatial resolution of topography data and computational mesh configuration in a hydrologic and or hydrodynamic model are frequently used to define the local relevance of its outputs e g chen et al 2017 gallegos et al 2009 hartnett and nash 2017 wood et al 2011 we suggest that this definition is a misnomer for fluvial flood prediction and mitigation planning for instance there is little practical value for configuring a model with meter scale computational mesh if the so called high or hyper resolution model produces streamflow and or inundation maps only along the main river channels see e g biancamaria et al 2009 chen et al 2017 komi et al 2017 logah et al 2017 schumann et al 2013 wilson et al 2007 on the contrary it is physically more meaningful and thus practically informative to construct flood models so that the degree of local relevance is dictated by the resolution spatial density of stream network considering as many lower order streams as possible via a high resolution stream network would ensure the maximum local relevance of streamflow and inundation maps across large spatial scales a fundamental aspect of flood prediction previously ignored in research and operational management in line with efforts to build large scale locally relevant flood prediction frameworks global flood hazard models have received considerable attention in recent times e g alfieri et al 2014 dottori et al 2016 pappenberger et al 2012 sampson et al 2015 wing et al 2017 however these initiatives have only produced static maps with a specific probability of flood occurrence e g 100 year return period while these maps stimulate new generation of spatially explicit floodplain ecohydrologic and socio economic management kiedrzyńska et al 2015 smith et al 2019 they cannot be considered as actual flood maps near real time mapping of flood inundation extents with corresponding streamflow data is the main requirement for a decision support system that can inform real life flood management to facilitate near real time predictions national oceanic and atmospheric administration in the united states developed the national water model nwm framework maidment 2017 nwm predicts streamflow and potential flood inundation extents across 2 7 million streams in the continental us an unprecedented combination considering both spatial scale and resolution of stream network maidment et al 2016 follum et al 2017 introduced the autorapid framework demonstrating its capability for fast parsimonious flood map simulation across millions of streams in the midwest us and mississippi delta there is a concomitant trend of similar initiatives for other parts of the world as well e g glofrim by hoch et al 2017 while these emergent frameworks offer increased flood information capacity in public domain their accuracy during real life flood events and means to efficiently address their prediction uncertainties have not been thoroughly investigated see e g afshari et al 2018 salas et al 2018 zheng et al 2018a what is also being overlooked in the previous studies is the possibility that two such frameworks independently developed for a particular basin may produce largely inconsistent flood information accordingly there remains the urgency to continue developing robust hydrologic hydrodynamic model combinations and ensure reliable flood information via real life accuracy assessments and inter framework comparisons this study aims to fill these gaps with a newly developed large scale locally relevant flood prediction framework at its core the framework loosely couples hydrologic model swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2011 with 1d 2d hydrodynamic model lisflood fp bates and de roo 2000 horritt and bates 2001 bates et al 2013 neal et al 2012 with a prototype daily simulation setup involving 26 000 stream reaches across the ohio river basin a 500 000 km2 region within the mississippi river system fig 1 we addressed the following questions to infer a comprehensive understanding on the framework s predictability and representativeness 1 how accurate is the new framework during real life flood events does the existing framework s corroborate the new framework s predicted flood inundation extents 2 does knowing the level of hydrologic uncertainty help increase the predictability of inundation extents 3 how does local relevance i e spatial resolution of stream network influence models ability to capture inundation extents over large spatial scales 2 model selection many 1d 2d hydrodynamic models have been developed as stand alone software packages to support reach or watershed scale simulations nelson et al 2003 musser and dyar 2007 vanderkimpen et al 2009 ballesteros et al 2011 nguyen et al 2016 usace 2016 for a large scale flood modeling framework involving numerous streams choice of a hydrodynamic model depends primarily on its easy interoperability with a driver hydrologic model opportunities for cyber enabled high performance computation and flexibility for data assimilation kauffeldt et al 2016 merwade et al 2018 this is why low complexity parsimonious inundation mapping tools relying on topography roughness parameters and simple hydraulic equations such as those used in the nwm or autorapid frameworks follum et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 zheng et al 2018a b have gained great community attention however because these tools lack physical process descriptions on floodplain mechanisms their application involves a trade off between fast computation power and accuracy as such they may underperform compared to 1d 2d hydrodynamic models afshari et al 2018 to this end lisflood fp has emerged as a suitable hydrodynamic model although nearly all of the large scale frameworks using lisflood fp are designed for mapping a static areal extent with a specific probability of inundation e g the floodplain maps by alfieri et al 2014 dottori et al 2016 sampson et al 2015 wing et al 2017 it is possible to configure lisflood fp for near real time prediction of potential flood events wing et al 2019 hoch et al 2017 and schumann et al 2013 demonstrated this by coupling lisflood fp respectively with variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 2003 and pcraster global water balance pcr globwb van beek and bierkens 2009 models however using coarse resolution stream networks therefore how lisflood fp would perform in a much complex setup e g 26 000 stream reaches across the 500 000 km2 ohio river basin fig 1 is still an outstanding question for large scale simulation of streamflow across high resolution stream networks coupled atmospheric land surface river routing models are being increasingly used in recent times e g lin et al 2019 2018a b tavakoly et al 2017 for instance the noah mp model under the auspices of wrf hydro modeling system is adopted in the nwm flood prediction framework salas et al 2018 there have been several large scale applications of vic and pcr globwb as well but these applications often involve coarse resolution stream network e g hoch et al 2017 schumann et al 2013 as noted above or monthly time scale simulation e g oubeidillah et al 2014 safeeq et al 2014 van beek et al 2011 swat is another process based model frequently applied on the world s major river basins e g abbaspour et al 2015 daggupati et al 2015 du et al 2018 pervez and henebry 2015 rajib and merwade 2017 schuol et al 2008 in addition to the well documented evaluations that approve swat s effectiveness arnold et al 2012 there are web based platforms such as swatshare that can be used to publish and share swat models with a broader community and perform extensive calibration using high performance computational resource rajib et al 2016a the companion tools of swatshare such as hydroglobe can assimilate multi source earth observations e g rajib et al 2018a b and swatflow can perform dynamic visualization of hydrographs and flood inundation extents these are the emergent opportunities which led to swat s selection for our flood prediction framework to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to show the application of swat model as the hydrologic component of a large scale flood prediction framework our framework also involves the most complex assembly of lisflood fp till date specifically considering the combined overburden of large basin area high resolution stream network and topography and continuous daily simulation while this study demonstrates a prototype framework using recent flood events in the ohio river basin as test cases efforts are underway to extend the models over a much larger domain and perform near real time predictions 3 methodology 3 1 ohio river basin as the flood modeling testbed the 500 000 km2 ohio river basin orb fig 1 is the largest sub basin of the mississippi river system in terms of water volume thus carrying a great socio economic and ecological significance for the north american continent an intriguing factor to consider orb as a flood modeling testbed is the increasing frequency of flood events over the past decades holmes et al 2012 holmes and dinicola 2010 mallakpour and villarini 2015 a historical record by us national weather service nws 2018 suggests that the ohio river at cincinnati located in the most downstream portion of the basin came near or above the designated flood stage 108 times within a span of 160 years 1858 2018 i e nearly 1 potential extreme event in every 1 5 year period previous studies analyzing land management and or climate change effects also confirmed the increasing flood frequency in orb e g du et al 2018 kunkel et al 2013 tayyebi et al 2015 despite this rising threats of flood hazard flood modeling studies specifically focusing on orb do not exist in literature 3 2 hydrologic modeling 3 2 1 swat model setup setting up a swat model in the gis interface arcswat requires three geospatial datasets digital elevation model dem land use and soil texture these datasets were obtained from the following sources 30 m dem from the us geological survey usgs national elevation dataset ned usgs 2013a 30 m land use data from the 2011 national land cover database nlcd usgs 2013b and 1 250 000 scale state soil geographic data statsgo built in with swat geodatabase to reduce the computational burden all topographic analyses e g sub basin delineation were performed by resampling the dem to a 90 m spatial resolution following several other large scale swat applications e g schuol et al 2008 faramarzi et al 2017 du et al 2018 a sub basin was treated as the smallest spatial unit of hydrologic simulations elevation difference across the basin was represented via three slope classes 0 4 4 10 and 10 to enable comparison with similar flood modeling initiatives in the us previously noted e g follum et al 2017 maidment 2017 tavakoly et al 2017 the nhdplus stream network national hydrography dataset plus mckay et al 2012 was superimposed burned in on the 90 m dem along with a 100 km2 threshold area for headwater stream identification this 100 km2 threshold was selected via multiple iterations to spatially match the dem generated stream network with nhdplus dataset the model could also use nhdplus stream network directly however such an option would require a significant amount of gis pre processing and quality assessment tasks to ensure continuous connectivity of streams see e g david et al 2013 nonetheless our dem based network delineation resulted into 26 000 individual stream reaches and sub basins fig 1 for every stream reach hydraulic geometry i e bank full width wc and depth dc were defined by relating upstream drainage area da with semi empirical power law relationships w c 1 29da 0 6 and d c 0 13da 0 4 where da is in km2 and w is in m her et al 2017 this approach similar to other large scale hydrologic river routing models hoch et al 2017 li et al 2013 paiva et al 2013 allowed w values in lower order streams to be smaller than the dem s spatial resolution for instance the minimum wc in the orb model was 2 m whereas the underlying dem cell size was 90 m the above bank water was simply routed through a hypothetical floodplain with a constant 5wc width neitsch et al 2011 weather forcing data were obtained from the 12 km north american data assimilation system nldas phase ii nasa 2019 and national centers for environmental prediction s ncep 38 km climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 specifically total daily precipitation were obtained from nldas whereas other energy related inputs including minimum maximum daily temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were obtained from cfsr potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated using swat s built in penman monteith approach nearly 30 of orb has artificial subsurface drainage tile drainage du et al 2018 therefore tile drainage routine was activated for all the sub basins having poorly drained soils e g du et al 2018 green et al 2006 reservoir storage discharge could not be explicitly considered in the current orb setup because of limited access to dam operation data although this limitation was implicitly addressed via rigorous streamflow calibration across a large number of gauge stations processes related to infiltration surface runoff generation and channel routing were simulated using the curve number and variable storage methods respectively neitsch et al 2011 3 2 2 calibration and validation of swat the orb swat model was first initialized for 1 year 2009 and then calibrated for a 2 year period 2010 2011 using daily streamflow observations at 50 usgs gauge stations fig 2 a and supplementary information s1 the simultaneous multi site calibration involved 18 parameters related to surface subsurface snow accumulation and in stream hydrologic responses supplementary information s2 du et al 2018 previously calibrated a coarse resolution orb swat model using 80 years 1935 2014 of streamflow data at 9 gauge stations for calibrating the current orb swat model initial parameter ranges were defined based on the optimization results of du et al 2018 the parameter optimization was conducted with sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour 2015 using a weighted kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 rajib et al 2016b 2018b as the objective function kge was maximized to obtain the most optimal parameter set which produces the best possible agreement between simulated and observed streamflow hydrographs at target locations kge 1 means 100 agreement relying on a single streamflow output time series the so called best hydrograph may not be reasonable because of the uncertainties in extreme flow predictions a problem common to any large scale hydrologic model abbaspour et al 2015 faramarzi et al 2017 therefore a band hydrograph representing the 95 prediction uncertainty abbaspour 2015 was produced for every reach in addition to the best hydrograph representing the most optimal streamflow corresponding the most optimal parameter set to allow an independent posterior evaluation the model was validated over a separate 2 year period 2012 2013 and at 5 separate gauge stations across the basin targeting different upstream drainage areas topography land use and climatic conditions fig 2a 3 3 hydrodynamic modeling 3 3 1 coupling swat and lisflood fp simulated streamflow outputs from swat were fed as the upstream boundary conditions in lisflood fp this was a loose coupling prototype architecture where both swat and lisfloo fp were executed in stand alone mode and an intermediate relational data model e g hoch et al 2017 peckham et al 2013 allowed the one way transfer of information we performed three separate sets of simulations m1 m3 by varying the boundary conditions of lisflood fp table 1 irrespective of their differences the basic setup and parameterization procedure in lisflood fp were kept identical across all the configurations throughout the following discussion we name the framework swat lisfp 3 3 2 lisflood fp setup and calibration the geospatial datasets topography land use and stream network required to set up lisflood fp were the same as in the orb swat model in all the configurations m1 m3 a sub grid scale hydrodynamic scheme neal et al 2012 was applied to solve the momentum and continuity equations for channel flow and floodplain flow respectively eqs 1 3 1 q c t δ t q c t g a c f l o w t δ t s c t 1 g δ t n c 2 q c t r c f l o w t 4 3 a c f l o w t 2 q f i 1 2 t δ t q f i 1

x grid cell width defined by the spatial resolution of the input dem qf unit width flow rate in floodplain wc channel bank full width h f depth of floodplain flow g gravitational acceleration simulation of flood inundation in lisflood fp requires each stream reach to be described using four parameters bank full width wc bank elevation z bed elevation zb and manning s n bates et al 2013 given the loose nature of integration between swat and lisflood fp it is challenging to minimize the propagation of uncertainty resulting from the obvious differences in models respective floodplain representation and corresponding numerical schemes one way to address this issue is to maintain the best possible consistency in channel floodplain representation by parameterizing both models with identical values of wc z zb and n in the current setup of the framework reach average values for each of these input parameters were adopted as described below i bank full width wc reach average wc values were directly exported from the orb swat model these can also be derived from existing global databases andreadis et al 2013 or using at station hydraulic geometry leopold and maddock 1953 most of the previous applications of lisflood fp adopted either of these two approaches e g neal et al 2012 schumann et al 2013 however global databases are mostly derived from available coarse resolution dems so that they provide wc values only for higher order streams calculation of at station hydraulic geometry does not produce reasonable results in relatively ungauged areas not to mention the heavy computational overhead required to perform at a station analysis across thousands of stream reaches as such exporting swat wc a drainage area based estimate similar to other large scale models hoch et al 2017 li et al 2013 paiva et al 2013 noted in section 3 2 1 deemed as an efficient way for parameterizing lisflood fp ii bank elevation z for any grid cell that has w associated with it lisflood fp picked the elevation data from the input dem and assigned that as the corresponding z value bates et al 2013 iii bed elevation zb this was defined as z dc where dc is the bank full depth similar to wc dc was exported from swat as well alternatively lisflood fp can approximate dc as a wc b following leopold and maddock 1953 here a and b are user defined coefficients which can be optimized through calibration using swat estimated dc values was more practical than seeking so called calibrated values of a and b for 26 000 reaches while maintaining consistency between the two model components and reducing computational overhead this approach eliminated potential uncertainties induced from inappropriate values of a and b iv roughness coefficient for floodplain manning s coefficient nf a set of nf values were adopted from the supporting literature kalyanapu et al 2010 and assigned to each of the land use classes in lisflood fp in this manner nf was varied across the basin allowing the model to effectively represent floodplain surface heterogeneity v roughness coefficient for channel manning s coefficient nc a unique nc value 0 03 was assigned throughout the stream network this unique value was derived from a calibration experiment based on a coarse resolution lisflood fp setup merwade et al 2018 rajib et al 2016c in this preliminary experiment nc values were varied between 0 01 and 0 05 in 0 005 increments one at a time every iteration assigning a unique nc throughout the stream network after each iteration the relative change in spatial agreement of simulated inundation extents was measured against the us federal emergency management agency 100 year flood hazard maps fema https msc fema gov portal accordingly 0 03 was found to be a representative estimate of channel roughness for orb considering the maximum agreement between fema maps and lisflood fp simulations although fema maps are mostly model simulated outcomes xian et al 2015 and not the observed extents of actual flood events using these maps to compare the results of other hydrodynamic models is an approach frequently followed in flood modeling studies e g afshari et al 2018 although floodplain roughness nf in the orb model was varied spatially representing channel roughness with a unique nc value for the entire stream network might have posed some inaccuracies in simulated flood maps however it is not uncommon to use a unique nc value in flood modeling especially over large spatial scales see e g afshari et al 2018 hoch et al 2017 li et al 2013 rudorff et al 2014 in fact the nc value 0 03 used for orb is the same as the one used for the mississippi and amazon river basins by follum et al 2017 autorapid framework and hoch et al 2017 glofrim framework respectively 3 4 validation of simulated inundation extents 3 4 1 comparison with remotely sensed observations real life observed flood inundation maps derived from open access remotely sensed imagery were used as the primary reference data for model validation specifically landsat satellite images for may 4 2011 and april 22 2013 were obtained from usgs earth explorer http earthexplorer usgs gov fig 3 so that they represent different flood magnitudes across different areas within the basin with different topography and land use conditions yet model validation based on satellite imagery is not always ideal due to cloud cover contamination wang et al 2019 as well as the potential temporal mismatch between satellite e g repeat cycle exact time of image acquisition and model outputs e g daily average data we strategically designed our approach so that these issues impart minimal influence on validation results specifically despite the 16 day repeat cycle of landsat satellite availability of relatively cloud free image was one of our main criteria of selecting flood events dates for model validation further each of the dates selected for model validation was within a multi day span of flood inundation unlike flash floods that dissipate within a few hours stakeholder inputs not discussed here in such cases a landsat image could represent the average flood condition throughout the day irrespective of the satellite s exact image acquisition time this assumption despite imposing some limitations on validation results allows consistent comparison of satellite data with daily average outputs derived from daily time step of model simulations raw landsat images were processed through a supervised image classification technique in arcgis to distinguish flood inundation extents this classification was conducted by i creating training polygons for known land use classes such as waterbodies forest agricultural and urban areas and then ii applying a maximum likelihood method to separate flooded areas all the flooded areas in an image were then converted and aggregared into gis polygons and thus a reference map for evaluating simulated inundation extents this so called remotely sensed reference inundation map is subject to uncertainty due to satelittte s image acquisition processing and the subsequent image classification techniques moreover the landsat images available through usgs platform are in 30 m spatial resolution which may be too coarse to capture flooding along the lower order streams effects of these uncertainties on model evaluation results were not considered in this study 3 4 2 comparison with an existing flood modeling framework it is important to acknowledge how a newly developed flood prediction framework might compare with the frameworks that are already available for a particular region of interest while this cross validation step has been commonly ignored in the previous studies we sought evidence on swat lisfp s predictability and reliability using a secondary set of reference flood maps generated from autorapid in the basic setup of autorapid follum et al 2017 first the routing application for parallel computation of discharge rapid david et al 2011 model computes streamflow using gridded runoff data from land surface models lsms e g tavakoly et al 2017 a parsimonious hydraulic model autoroute follum et al 2013 uses this streamflow and manning s equation to calculate the normal flow depth across a large number of channel cross sections where the cross section geometry is derived directly from topography data finally autoroute simulates inundation extents using a volume filling numerical method at each cross section to facilitate a comparison with the current swat lisfp setup we executed autorapid across orb only for the two specific flood events mentioned above fig 3 using nhdplus stream network and 10 m ned dem here we limit this comparison only to flood inundation extents potential inconsistencies between these two frameworks related to different model inputs process conceptualizations and parameter calibrations are not addressed in this study 3 4 3 model performance metrics f fit and c correctness indices alfieri et al 2014 liu and merwade 2018 were used to measure prediction accuracy of simulated flood inundation extents eqs 4 5 4 f a rm a r a m a rm 5 c a rm a r here ar and am refer to the reference remote sensing autorapid and model simulated inundation extents respectively and arm refers to the common inundated area intersection between the two flood maps by definition both indices range from 0 to 1 f index indicates the degree to which reference and simulated extents match f 1 means 100 overlap as f decreases the simulated inundation extent starts to deviate from the reference either over estimation or under estimation until no overlap can be found f 0 on the contrary c index is a relatively less conservative metric of model accuracy signifying the percentage of the reference extent that is correctly predicted by simulation when c equals 1 reference flood extent falls entirely within the simulated extent even though the model might actually be over estimating the inundated area therefore c is always greater or equal to f for a given set of simulated and reference inundation maps 4 results and discussion 4 1 overall predictability and representativeness of the framework 4 1 1 streamflow streamflow simulation performance in terms of kge across 55 gauge stations indicated a robust model fig 4 a kge between usgs data and the most optimal swat simulations ranged between 0 20 and 0 90 with a value 0 4 0 5 or higher in 64 of the target locations 35 out of 55 gauge stations fig 4b the equally reasonable performance regardless of calibration or validation run especially considering non overlapping time periods and a separate set of gauge stations approved consistent predictability of the model while streamflow output based on the most optimal parameter set may underperform at some locations hence relatively low kge a well calibrated model should have a narrow uncertainty band r factor 1 with most of the reference data points captured therein p factor 1 abbaspour 2015 we exemplify this in fig 4c for one of the validation locations where the model produced relatively low kge but acceptable p factor and r factor estimates the robustness of streamflow simulation as noted above might have been resulted from our methodological design that involved substantially rigorous calibration compared to many other large scale flood modeling frameworks for instance our 50 site swat calibration largely contrasts 3 site pcr globwb calibration in a similar sized amazonian sub basin glofrim framework by hoch et al 2017 also compare with 8 site mgb iph calibration across the entire amazon river basin by paiva et al 2013 although the short run time 5 years of our prototype framework is similar to that used in glofrim 6 years hoch et al 2017 we selected parameter initial ranges based on a prior 80 year streamflow calibration du et al 2018 noted in section 3 2 2 these comparisons considered alongside the overall streamflow simulation performance fig 4 suggest that our current orb swat model is capable of reproducing and forecasting hydrologic variabilities with reasonable accuracy 4 1 2 flood inundation extents the simulated flood inundation maps matched considerably well with remotely sensed observations fig 5 and autorapid outputs fig 6 specifically when the upstream boundary conditions in lisflood fp were set with the most optimal swat streamflow m1 configuration table 1 simulated flood maps showed f 0 6 0 65 and c 0 75 0 8 with respect to remotely sensed observations these performance measures suggest a fairly good accuracy notwithstanding the deterministic streamflow forcing complete lack of in situ channel geometry data and challenges they imposed on models representation of 26 000 stream reaches across the 500 000 km2 basin the predictability and representativeness of our swat lisfp framework was further justified when we found resemblance between swat lisfp and autorapid flood maps f 0 7 0 75 and c 0 75 0 85 fig 6 clearly swat lisfp flood maps were consistently accurate across different flood events and regions within the basin and regardless of the reference dataset used in evaluating model performance which confirms the reliability of the framework for real life applications 4 2 effect of streamflow prediction uncertainty on simulated flood inundation inaccuracies of deterministic inundation maps and their implications on efficient flood management planning have been long standing discussions in flood modeling practices merwade et al 2008 most of the previous studies on probabilistic inundation were conducted at reach or watershed scales e g di baldassarre et al 2010 to comply with the physical meaning of a probabilistic flood map the most ideal way is to perform delicate numerical analyses and distinguish both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties in model simulations alfonso et al 2016 which may not be feasible for a very complex model setup such as the one presented in this study given the above one simple alternative would be to at least inform the hydrodynamic model about the uncertainties in hydrologic streamflow simulation our m2 configuration ran such a scenario by setting up the boundary conditions in lisflood fp with a band of streamflow table 1 fig 4c the outcome was a flood map showing the minimum and maximum extents of flood inundation fig 7 here the maximum and minimum inundation extents resulted respectively from the upper and lower bounds of the 95 prediction uncertainty in streamflow simulation it is evident that simulated flood inundation based on band hydrographs captured nearly 100 of the remotely sensed inundation whereas the same model setup using the most optimal streamflow data as boundary conditions captured less than 80 compare c index in fig 5a and fig 7 in areas where the maximum simulated extent overestimated the reference map the minimum extent produced a better match therefore the maximum simulated extent does not mean that it has a greater likelihood of occurrence than the minimum extent together they delineate an area that is likely to be inundated during a flood event these findings clearly suggest that instead of predicting a single deterministic flood inundation extent based on the most optimal streamflow output m1 predicting a potential areal range of inundation via integrating streamflow uncertainty into the channel floodplain hydrodynamic simulation m2 greatly minimizes bias this with different representations of channel geometry and roughness in lisflood fp would produce an end to end probabilistic flood map e g liu and merwade 2018 our study demonstrates that swat lisfp can efficiently account for these uncertainties implying meaningful practical implications of the framework for near real time disaster management 4 3 effect of densified streamflow boundary conditions on simulated flood inundation in the first two configurations m1 and m2 lisflood fp ingested swat simulated streamflow at a limited number of locations where the channel becomes wider than 90 m table 1 fig 2b in order to evaluate the role of upstream boundary conditions on large scale flood inundation the m3 configuration ingested streamflow at lower order streams where the channel becomes wider than 30 m fig 2c results obtained from m3 configuration revealed prominent improvement in simulated inundation compare fig 8 m3 f 0 70 and c 0 91 versus fig 5b m1 f 0 60 and c 0 80 this improvement in model predictability was more noticeable in lower order streams like any other hydrodynamic model it is theoretically impossible for lisflood fp to produce fluvial floodplain inundation if lower order streams hence the associated streamflow inputs do not exist in the model this was why the ability to set up abundant streamflow boundary conditions via a high resolution stream network enabled better prediction of flood inundation extents in m3 this in other words justified our definition of locally relevant flood modeling where spatial resolution is defined in terms of the number of streams being modeled not the grid size of the dem or the model simulation 5 potential opportunities for improved predictability logic suggests that the possible increase in streamflow accuracy should correspondingly lead to more accurate flood inundation maps but attempting high accuracy in streamflow simulation simply by parameter calibration is a challenging task irrespective of the model used in a flood prediction framework e g an early prototype version of nwm by lin et al 2018b for instance despite involving 50 gauge stations in the calibration process the relatively under performing streamflow simulation at some locations in the current orb swat model may be due to the lack of spatially explicit reservoir storage discharge functions this problem could be minimized by incorporating reservoir geometry data i e maximum water surface area and storage volume in hydrologic models neitsch et al 2011 while these information are accessible from global databases for some of the major reservoirs e g lehner döll 2004 salas et al 2018 and tavakoly et al 2017 showed how streamflow simulation accuracy in a large scale flood prediction framework can be improved by directly assimilating available gauge data at reservoir outlets or reservoir release flow without requiring explicit inputs on reservoir geometry this also underscores the potential for assimilating remotely sensed streamflow data at reservoir outlet locations e g surface water and ocean topography swot satellite mission yoon et al 2016 yet assimilating reservoir outflow data and or considering more gauge stations for parameter calibration may not improve overall fidelity kannan et al 2019 because hydrologic models often give right answers acceptable streamflow at the watershed outlet for wrong reasons biased water balance across the watershed therefore in addition to targeting improved streamflow predictability at discrete locations the overall physical state of the hydrologic model needs to be improved by assimilating remotely sensed soil moisture and or evapotranspiration data e g han et al 2012 rajib et al 2018a b so that the model remains well informed of the antecedent watershed conditions at the onset of extreme events to enhance hydrodynamic modeling accuracy improving the channel geometry representation is perhaps the most widely acknowledged measure cook and merwade 2009 we suggest that channel geometry is important for both hydrologic and hydrodynamic models this is because a realistic representation of channel width depth would enable improved simulation of floodplain storage and hence the timing and magnitude of peak flow in the hydrologic model her et al 2017 which would subsequently allow the hydrodynamic model to precisely capture inundation pattern cook and merwade 2009 global databases on channel width depth exist e g andreadis et al 2013 however these databases do not provide information for lower order streams calibrating the power law equations that conceptualize channel width depth e g sections 3 2 1 and 3 3 2 may be a pursuable approach only where relevant reference data stage height are available to fill this information gap an algorithm to reconstruct channel geometry from high resolution topography data e g dey et al 2019 appears to be an efficient solution such an algorithm may be tightly coupled with both hydrologic and hydrodynamic model architectures enabling seamless assimilation of channel geometry data in respective simulations besides this use of a unique channel roughness nc throughout the stream network is another persistent limitation in large scale hydrodynamic model setups e g follum et al 2017 hoch et al 2017 also noted in section 3 3 2 it would be ideal to select nc values based on a regional calibration of manning s equation across clusters of land use and slope while these are important considerations for improved predictability of large scale locally relevant flood models associated data model interoperability and computational challenges cannot be overstated 6 summary and future direction contrary to the long standing practice of reach or watershed scale flood modeling there is a need to build large scale flood prediction capabilities additionally it is necessary that a so called large scale model is locally relevant evolved from this critical yet often overlooked perspective our study provides the first assessment of a new large scale locally relevant flood prediction framework that loosely couples hydrologic model swat with hydrodynamic model lisflood fp hence swat lisfp in the prototype framework swat simulates streamflows for nearly 26 000 stream reaches across the 500 000 km2 ohio river basin which feed lisflood fp as the upstream boundary conditions to simulate flood inundation extents potentially at near real time based on three contrasting modeling configurations the following conclusions are drawn i streamflow outputs are reasonably accurate in terms of kge performance metric based on the calibration validation results across 55 gauge stations kge values range between 0 20 and 0 90 especially kge 0 5 in more than 60 of the target locations indicates a robust model using the so called most optimal or best fit swat streamflow as the upstream boundary conditions m1 configuration lisflood fp produces flood inundation extents that are consistently 70 80 accurate f and c indices with respect to the remotely sensed observations of real life flood events the simulated flood inundation extents also show strong resemblance with the outputs produced by an existing flood prediction framework autorapid follum et al 2017 this two step model validation using two independent reference datasets remote sensing and autorapid approves the reliability of swat lisfp framework ii while the above findings are based on a single deterministic flood map generated by a best fit streamflow forcing boundary condition swat lisfp can also delineate a range of inundated areas by considering the uncertainty in streamflow simulation specifically the simulated extents considering the 95 streamflow uncertainty band can potentially capture the entirety of actual remotely sensed flooding this is a key finding indicating the ability of our prototype framework to efficiently minimize prediction bias iii our results clearly show that setting up streamflow boundary conditions only in the large rivers e g locations beyond which a channel is wider than 90 m leaves a considerable portion of flood inundation undetected in comparison model predictability noticeably improves when the boundary conditions are set at the lower order streams a high resolution stream network implies availability of densified streamflow estimates from a hydrologic model densified streamflow would allow more rigorous constraining of the hydrodynamic model boosting its capacity to detect flooded areas across large spatial scales these findings rationalize the use of a high resolution stream network and hence the new theme of locally relevant flood modeling an important aspect disregarded in many of the existing large scale frameworks while these results are promising an added benefit of our framework is the parameter interoperability between swat and lisflood fp with the current inter model data transfer mechanism lisflood fp can export channel geometry bank full width and depth for each of the stream reaches n 26 000 directly from swat s algorithm while greatly minimizing dependency on in situ data acquisition and or hydrodynamic model calibrations this interoperability also eliminates propagation error that may stem from the driver hydrologic model and subsequently affect the simulated inundation extents accordingly it is possible that improvements in swat s floodplain river corridor representation through process modifications integrating spatially resolved global datasets and or remote sensing techniques would automatically increase the overall accuracy of lisflood fp our perspective is not limited to coupling models and evaluating their performances currently efforts are underway to equip swat with a reproducible workflow of multi source multi variate remotely sensed data assimilation e g rajib et al 2018a b to enable near real time predictions input management especially to handle sub daily weather forecasts and associated data transfer mechanism from swat to lisflood fp will be restructured as well eventually the framework will be prompted from a cyber infrastructure so that it can be findable accessible interoperable and reproducible fair swatshare a recently developed cyber infrastructure for sharing data assimilation high performance simulation and visualization of environmental models rajib et al 2016a is an example attesting our motive towards that direction with these emergent cohesive efforts it is possible to transform the current prototype framework into a sustainable globally applicable flood modeling and information system declaration of competing interest the authors declare

5899,a structure from motion sfm photogrammetry based methodology for precise mapping of large wood lw accumulations in fluvial systems is presented the technique may be useful for routine inventory and rapid volume estimation of complex lw structures that tend to divert or obstruct flow in rivers our methodology is validated by means of laboratory experiments ranging from elementary to complex arrangements of lw components and organic fine material ofm seven experimental setups were used as the basis for i manual approximations of 2 5d and 3d geometric reference volumes ii 2 5d volume models based on mesh geometry iii a closed watertight 3d mesh from an unorganized point cloud and iv estimates of porosity a commercially available sfm photogrammetry software package pix4dmapper was used for point cloud and simplified mesh generation in order to obtain more precise volumes 3d surface models are required accordingly we generated 3d watertight mesh models of the unorganized point cloud using the screened poisson surface reconstruction psr technique the pix4d volume tool 2 5d resulted in an overestimation 2 9 to 52 7 of the geometric volume 3d due to the convex hull approximation of the geometry normal to the surface plane psr 3d resulted in more precise volumes showing deviations from the geometric volume 3d in a range of 15 9 to 10 6 as the algorithm could capture concavities and involuted surfaces on the accumulation assuming that the difference between 3d and 2 5d volume models represents many of the voids visible within or on the surface of the deposit this volume can be used as an estimate of porosity our assessment suggests that image based sfm methodology is well suited for further investigations in lw research due to its time and cost efficiency in comparison with other conventional surveying techniques the methodology can be used to generate high quality point cloud and mesh models of log jam formations these may be used by river managers and researchers to quantify accumulation volume and thus gain a better understanding of lw composition and the influence of wood geometry on hydraulic flow conditions keywords large wood lw accumulation models sfm photogrammetry estimation of 2 5d and 3d volumes lw accumulation porosity 1 introduction 1 1 large wood lw accumulations and assessment the majority of river focused research defines large wood lw as wooden pieces with a minimum length of 1 m and a diameter larger than 0 1 m nakamura and swanson 1994 fetherston et al 1995 wyżga and zawiejska 2005 ravazzolo et al 2015 martin et al 2018 while smaller elements are considered as organic fine material ofm lw plays an important role in moderating sediment transport and storage megahan and nowlin 1976 hornbeck et al 1993 and stream channel morphology zimmerman et al 1967 keller and swanson 1979 bilby 1984 smith et al 1993 abbe and montgomery 1996 but it also provides habitat for fish and other riverine organisms fausch and northcote 1992 several research projects have focused on the influence of log structures on channel forms including stream banks and bars keller and swanson 1979 gippel et al 1996 as well as on flow hydraulics energy losses changes in roughness and flow dissipation heede et al 1972 gregory et al 1985 knauss 1995 anderson et al 2006 besides the positive effects of wood in stream channels lw accumulations at constricted cross sections may represent a hazard to river spanning infrastructure agriculture lands as well as human populations in adjacent areas mazzorana and fuchs 2010 schmocker and weitbrecht 2013 ruiz villanueva et al 2017 gasser et al 2019 a fundamental knowledge of geometrical arrangement volume and porous space of lw accumulations is essential in order to better understand the effects on channel hydraulics in presence of log structures furthermore quantification of the wood inventory within a river corridor provides important information on the likelihood of jam development as well as clues to key loading points within the contributing catchment the geometry of lw accumulations is a function of the flows that deposited the wood wyżga and zawiejska 2005 material deposited in the waning stages of a flood may be deposited individually or as bundles with similar orientation abbe and montgomery 2003 more often an abrupt transition in flow conditions above a constricted passage will lead to a chaotic accumulation that can be several meters high lassettre and kondolf 2012 rusyda 2014 and several kilometres in length collins et al 2002 wohl 2014 interstitial space at the inside of the log formation can be filled by transported ofm reducing accumulation porosity such lw accumulations can act as flow obstructions moos et al 2018 that affect channel morphology mosley 1981 wohl and scott 2017 there is considerable scope for better capture and structural analysis of these jams if the tools were available a current literature review reveals little progress in wood volume estimation techniques some studies have focused on assessing lw volumes along channels van wagner 1968 uchiogi et al 1996 benda and sias 2003 rigon et al 2008 and only a small number have endeavoured to evaluate the volume of existing log jams those that focused on lw accumulation volume applied a parallelepiped approach boivin et al 2015 or geometric measures of length and diameter as well as number of individual logs or wood pieces cordova et al 2006 brown et al 2014 dixon and sear 2014 ruiz villanueva et al 2016 tonon et al 2018 and calculated a volume based on cylindrical approximations these methods do not consider any irregularities in shape and in many cases volume estimates are based on a line intersection technique introduced by warren and olsen 1964 leading to a rough estimation of lw volume rather than a precise measurement brown et al 2014 also described the methodology of water displacement for lw volume estimation which may be effective for relatively small quantities of organic material although measuring of volume is difficult harmon et al 1986 many researches have underlined the importance of assessing lw volume within a quantitative assessment framework lienkaemper and swanson 1987 gurnell et al 2002 webb and erskine 2003 manners and doyle 2008 dixon and sear 2014 wohl et al 2017 martin et al 2018 characterising the porosity of wood accumulations in particular still represents a major challenge in lw research piegay 1993 boivin and buffin bélanger 2010 schalko et al 2018 scott et al 2019 as it is onerous to estimate void space inside the log jam formation gaps in accumulations have important implications for hydraulic flow behaviour such as the development of backwater effects which are strongly related to the blocked cross sectional area the amount of ofm and accumulation porosity knauss 1995 schalko et al 2016 gschnitzer et al 2017 thus improved assessment of void space within accumulations can help in evaluating structural integrity and capacity for retention of water and sediment finally any technique for rapidly acquiring consistent volume information will help to improve wood inventories and budgets of wood flux from catchments wood budgets are commonly used to study the impacts of forestry cave et al 2017 phillips et al 2018 or other disturbances that affect wood supply to rivers drone photogrammetry is particularly helpful for this application as the photographs can be taken from an aerial vantage at a scale tailored for individual cases and at a resolution that is well suited for reach studies colomina and molina 2014 cunliffe et al 2016 woodget et al 2017 lucia et al 2018 higher altitude e g airplane based photogrammetry smikrud and prakash 2006 does not provide sufficient detail for precise volumetric assessment recent studies applied aerial sanhueza et al 2019 and ground based spreitzer et al 2019 structure from motion sfm photogrammetry for volume estimation of larger wood quantities however both studies reported challenges with model resolution and a lack of standardised protocols the aim of this paper is to demonstrate a structure from motion sfm photogrammetry based workflow considering a suite of meshing algorithms that can produce precise volumetric estimates for wood accumulations using point cloud resolutions in the order of many 102 105 points per square meter such as achieved using tls surveying boivin and buffin bélanger 2010 tonon et al 2014 grigillo et al 2015 this is the typical realm of models acquired from field photography i e from ground level mosbrucker et al 2017 verma and bourke 2019 or low altitude drone acquisition woodget et al 2017 acuna and sosa 2019 which provides better time and cost efficiency westoby et al 2012 1 2 structure from motion sfm for lw research sfm photogrammetry has proven to be a powerful technique for fieldwork as one can produce highly detailed models with simply a camera and a few strategically placed orientation and scaling marks westoby et al 2012 provide a useful summary of the field procedures reconstruction algorithms and the sfm workflow there are a number of software packages available for point cloud generation both as open source evaluated by bianco et al 2018 as well as commercially licensed evaluated by alidoost and arefi 2017 the effectiveness of sfm has been demonstrated for terrestrial mapping in the field javernick et al 2014 kraaijenbrink et al 2016 smith et al 2016 jugie et al 2018 li et al 2018a tunnicliffe et al 2018 and there are a number of studies that have successfully demonstrated the applicability of sfm in the laboratory chandler et al 2000 curran and tan 2010 morgan et al 2016 wang et al 2016 balaguer puig et al 2017 seitz et al 2018 the survey accuracy has been shown to be similar to other topographic measurement techniques such as terrestrial or airborne lidar mancini et al 2013 kaiser et al 2014 ružić et al 2014 morgan et al 2016 filippelli et al 2019 although sfm photogrammetry is generally more efficient considering costs and time peterson et al 2015 the trinity river restoration program trrp 2018 provides some interesting comparisons of tls and sfm point cloud models where results reveal a higher point cloud density in the tls models whereas sfm provided a more detailed surface structure multiple camera viewing angles resulted in more detailed relief on the wooden elements peterson et al 2015 making this methodology more suitable for lw research surrounding water and non static vegetation may affect the quality of sfm photogrammetry models because of feature distortion or the loss of tie points during the initial point cloud processing stage some of the studies have used standard smartphone cameras for data acquisition and concluded that results reveal point cloud quality equal to that of tls wróżyński et al 2017 besides data acquisition smartphones may also be of use for point cloud generation processing and meshing using the available hardware resources nocerino et al 2017 the technique of obtaining volumetric information from multi view 2d images has been in practice for decades martin and aggarwal 1983 though the achievable resolution has soared with the advent of automated point matching and new bundle adjustment techniques once a point cloud model of an object is generated its volume can be computed either in 2 5d on the basis of a plane with a predefined region bounded by the convex hull and an elevation grid or in 3d where no such restrictions apply however the elevation function becomes complex for unorganized point cloud models remondino 2003 such as lw accumulation models currently a common challenge is the identification and or classification of landscape elements from detailed yet often noisy point cloud data lw research faces this problem as well in particular for branches rootwads and ofm while wood logs have a generally cylindrical form which presents a consistent geometric form for meshing and recognition algorithms raumonen et al 2013 and hackenberg et al 2015 exploited the geometric architecture of trees and developed an approach for clustered point cloud reconstruction of trees using such cylindrical units in this vein recent work in related fields have shown successful reconstruction of individual plants with stem branches and leaves both on a basis of the most relevant neighbour points in sfm photogrammetry golbach et al 2015 and tls data hétroy wheeler et al 2016 a significant advance in these studies was achieved by the clusterization of leaves and branches that allows for structural assessment and volume estimation schneider et al 2014 widlowski et al 2014 surface reconstruction for tubular shapes and tree sections is often based on the poisson scheme morel et al 2018 which has been shown to be robust and fairly stable in a number of studies kaiser et al 2014 carrivick et al 2016 gupta and shukla 2017 the accuracy of plant and tree reconstruction algorithms shows errors in a range of a few cm to less than one mm for an entire tree model hackenberg et al 2015 li et al 2018b lw research faces the additional challenge presented by complex compositional features e g ofm and sediments for which high point cloud density becomes essential in order to distinguish amongst some of these features colvard 1998 wright et al 2000 a recent study applying sfm photogrammetry to the problem of aboveground biomass estimation shows how compositional details can be captured based on a colour scheme alonzo et al 2018 the method of colour segmentation algorithms for point cloud filtering has further been applied in geosciences for obtaining volumes and porosity of soil and sediments orru et al 2016 when filtering a reconstructed surface model for colours surface texture may be used for the generation of roughness models bertin et al 2015 alratrout et al 2018 and used for porosity estimates seitz et al 2018 approaches such as introduced by raumonen et al 2013 and alonzo et al 2018 can help to estimate lw accumulation structure and volume even when significant portions of the logs are not captured in the dataset 1 3 objectives given the requirement for precise in situ volume estimation in lw research there is high demand for portable and easily deployed surveying tools such as sfm photogrammetry that can efficiently capture the geometry of wooden deposits to move from the unorganized point cloud produced by photogrammetric techniques to a volumetric model requires testing of the available meshing and volume integration algorithms under controlled conditions with our work we aim to develop a sfm photogrammetry based workflow pipeline to estimate the volume of model lw accumulations that can be objectively verified our objectives are i to generate high quality point cloud models of lw accumulations under controlled conditions in the laboratory ii to compute the geometric measures including volume and porosity of the generated 2 5d and 3d lw accumulation models iii to evaluate and assess the computed lw volumes generated via sfm photogrammetry in comparison with easily verifiable accumulation volumes iv to assess the challenges and opportunities arising from 2 5d volume estimation from elevation points that have been projected vertically onto a reference surface versus 3d volumes that may be obtained by detailed meshing of the point cloud sfm photogrammetry is a promising tool for lw research under controlled conditions in the laboratory considering its performance relative to other available mapping techniques developing a quantitative framework for analysing lw accumulations will enable more meaningful and compatible measures of accumulation composition and volumes as well as detailed assessment of surface structure detrital organic characteristics and other features 2 laboratory experiments for estimates of lw accumulation volumes based on sfm photogrammetry we used a set of wooden dowel structures which were assembled on a smooth surface in the laboratory the wooden dowels were of a uniform cylindrical shape varying in length and diameter altogether seven distinctive accumulation structures table 1 were considered starting with the most elementary a single wood dowel working up to complex lw accumulations we also considered ofm as part of our experimental setup for a small number of experiments for the laboratory ofm substrate we used wood chips with a length of up to 65 mm and bark pieces in a range of 4 32 mm b axis the ofm fills porous space in between the log skeleton structure reducing accumulation porosity the species of the wooden material was pinus radiata new zealand pine for the first experiment a single wooden dowel one dowel with a length of 300 mm and 46 mm in diameter was used table 1 this setup appears trivial however it represents an essential verification test for further volume assessment of lw accumulations the second structure comprised two wooden dowels two dowels both showing equal dimensions l 300 mm d 46 mm one of the dowels was placed on top of the other one in a perpendicular alignment the distance between the grounded point of the top dowel and the underlying centrally placed dowel was about three quarters of the top dowel s length six cylindrical wooden dowels six dowels dowel pile were used for a further elementary lw accumulation a triangular bundle was formed with three logs at the base two in the middle and one on top in order to maintain the shape and position of the dowel pile tape was used the dowels had a length of 400 mm each with a diameter of 32 mm a more complex lw accumulation was set up using eight wooden dowels eight dowels high photo count that were randomly assembled forming an accumulation skeleton the lw accumulation consisted of a mixture of the previously used dowels comprising two dowels with a length of 300 mm and 46 mm in diameter and another six dowels with lengths of 400 mm and 32 mm in diameter for this experiment a relatively high number of images 529 was obtained for the photogrammetric model similar to the previous setup eight dowels high photo count the same eight dowels were used and assembled into another lw accumulation eight dowels low photo count on the laboratory floor a relatively low number of images 23 was acquired for the model the purpose is to demonstrate the effects of having a low number of images in comparison to a high number of images for volume estimates an accumulation consisting of only ofm ofm accumulation was formed to resemble a heap approximately 70 mm in height with a roughly circular planform diameter of 190 mm for material preparation a measuring cylinder was filled with 1 00 10 3 m3 of wood chips 65 mm and bark pieces 4 to 32 mm the glass cylinder was filled in three layers with the material gently compacted at each interval using fingers the material in the measuring cylinder and in the accumulation heap showed a similar degree of consolidation the most complex lw accumulation considered for our experiments consisted of ten dowels varying in length and diameter and 1 l of ofm the lw dowels were mixed up with the ofm and formed into a complex accumulation structure ten dowels ofm dowel composition and dimensions can be obtained from table 1 the total 3d geometric volume based on the conical shape of the accumulation was 1 42 10 3 m3 3 methodology 3 1 procedure for volumetric estimates we classified our accumulations into three categories i elementary accumulations one dowel two dowels and six dowels ii complex accumulations eight dowels and iii ofm accumulations as a further advanced stage of complex accumulations ofm accumulation and ten dowels ofm the aim of the experiments is to compare 3d and 2 5d volumes estimated via sfm photogrammetry methodology to the actual 3d see 3d geometric volume in table 1 and 2 5d volumes see 2 5d geometric volume in fig 1 computed via standard mathematical approximations to resolve the geometric aspects of the constitutional elements e g cylinders cones wedges the point cloud model was generated using a commercial sfm photogrammetry software package pix4dmapper pix4d switzerland 2018 version 4 1 25 which provides an efficient workflow and offers a palette of useful tools for point cloud as well as mesh processing the volumes of the 2 5d and 3d photogrammetrically derived meshes were assessed using freely available open source software tools namely meshlab cignoni et al 2008 version 2016 12 and cloudcomparev2 2016 version 2 6 3 in cloudcompare the initial unorganised point cloud model was segmented for further object oriented processing stages including filtering and cleaning of outlier points as well as meshing the meshlab implementation of the screened poisson surface reconstruction psr kazhdan and hoppe 2013 was used for meshing the unorganized point cloud providing an initial mesh the final refinement of the mesh involved closing the grid surface such that it was continuous watertight for this operation we used the commercial package autodesk fusion 360 2018 version 2 0 5119 having established 2 5d and 3d volumes the porous space inside the lw accumulations could be estimated as the volumetric difference between the two models 3 2 image acquisition experiments were mostly conducted in a custom designed black room in the laboratory consisting of black walls with good light conditions 4 500 w halogen flood lights from the top and a table in the centre a platform 400 500 mm was mounted on the table supporting a rotating platter with a flat surface this platform enabled easy setup for obtaining oblique and nadir images without capturing any detail beyond the lw assembly e g floor the only experiment that was not conducted in the black room eight dowels low photo count was carried out on a sealed and flat laboratory floor for scaling purposes a number of chequerboards with a raster of 25 mm were placed around the accumulations image acquisition for our lw volume assessment was carried out using a standard smartphone device huawei nova 2i with 16mp image resolution images were captured under controlled light conditions using default settings for contrast exposure saturation and sharpness further camera specifications are listed in table 2 3 3 point cloud and mesh processing in pix4d pix4dmapper initially computes matching key points from overlapping images then applies a bundle block adjustment algorithm to generate a sparse 3d point cloud step 1 based on the residuals from model fitting the software iteratively estimates the internal and external camera parameters until the best optimization is achieved pix4dmapper 2018 after initial sparse cloud processing the model is scaled using ground control reference marks in our case chequerboards around the lw accumulations at this stage the orientation of the point cloud model may also be adjusted by setting orientation constraints for the x y and z directions in order to take the new scaling and orientation input into account the reprocessing step has to be started the next step in pix4dmapper involves computing the dense point cloud model and mesh step 2 the point cloud density settings are listed in table 3 and the processing times required can be found in table 4 a maximum number of 1 0 106 faces was selected for the generation of the pix4d mesh model which provides a good balance between acceptable model detail and tractable computation of volumes and other analyses the third processing step step 3 involves the generation of a digital surface model dsm and the orthomosaic both are essential for volume estimates using the volume tool implemented in pix4dmapper pix4d volume tool 2 5d the dsm is generated from nearest neighbour interpolation of the dense point cloud the orthomosaic provides detailed rgb information for the resultant dsm pix4dmapper 2018 3 4 geometric volume 2 5d using an approach analogous to the 2 5d method in the pix4d volume tool we calculate the projected volume for elementary lw accumulations independently using geometrical primitives based on the laboratory setup of the lw models for one two and six dowels we assessed the volume of the primitives as well as the interstitial space between the objects and the horizontal reference plane platter surface the actual volume of a dowel is provided in eq 1 the fill volumes for various interstitial elements 1 4 are approximated using eqs 2 5 for the first experimental setup using one dowel the projected volume was calculated as demonstrated in fig 1a using eq 6 the next accumulation model comprising two dowels fig 1b and c shows a projected length of 292 mm for the top dowel emerging to a height of 69 mm measured to the bottom edge of the top dowel the total 2 5d volume is calculated according to eq 7 another 2 5d calculation for the six dowel accumulation was assessed using eq 8 the dowel pile in fig 1d consists of several different void elements calculations must account for the various projected volumes including ledges and projections mathematical approximations in 2 5d resolution are only practical for elementary lw accumulations with known geometric measures the method becomes inadequate as model complexity increases 1 v d o w e l d 2 π l 4 m

tool 2 5d and psr meshing 3d in the following work we employ two techniques for 2 5d and 3d volume estimation 2 5d volume consists of a convex hull enclosing the horizontal extents of the point cloud projected vertically from above much as a sheet fully draped over an object encompasses the extent of the object and falls vertically to the floor thus an elevation field potentially including void space can be mapped to a 2d raster grid and volume can be estimated by integrating the gridded height elements this approach is commonly used in terrestrial and airborne surveys to generate volumetric information of for instance stockpiles or landforms above a given reference datum lane et al 2003 milan et al 2007 eltner et al 2016 the 2 5d approach however is not well suited to subjects with over arching structures hollows concavities or any surface whose face normals point below the plane of the horizontal reference surface spreitzer et al 2019 pix4dmapper was used to compute the 2 5d volume which requires the specification of a base surface fig 2 we selected multiple points on the flat surface around the lw accumulation and used the default settings for base surfaces points above cut volume and beneath fill volume the reference surface are kept in the computational domain however they have separate outputs in this article we are focusing on the cut volume the base surface raster is resolved at the same resolution as the model ground sampling distance gsd in contrast to the 2 5d approach the 3d model mesh encloses the object from all perspectives and volumes are assessed by integrating cubes or tetrahedral elements within this enclosed space wang et al 2018 this is the preferred technique in the present application since the aim is assessing the volume of wooden material within a complex body with many voids with photogrammetric techniques the field of view into the lw accumulations is invariably obscured by interwoven wooden elements ofm and sedimentary fill so our assessment of deposit porosity is imperfect even with 3d models but we think this is an important improvement over more conventional 2 5 techniques the generation of robust 3d meshes of lw accumulation bodies using psr was conducted in meshlab cloudcompare and autodesk fusion 360 the variety of software packages applied in our workflow fig 2 is a function of the many tasks involved in the reconstruction of lw accumulations each program features specialized tools for mesh creation editing filtering and cleanup and construction of a watertight hull as a first step after importing the point cloud model the computation of point normals is required mitra and nguyen 2003 this was done using orientation consensus among 12 neighbour points with view direction from the top as this arrangement generally resulted in the most satisfactory surface reconstruction with minimal artefacts for psr an octree depth of 12 was chosen and other parameters were kept as default once the psr meshing was finished the resultant grid was exported to cloudcompare in order to isolate the area of interest the accumulation structure from the surrounding platter topography cloudcompare was found to have the best tool for this operation back in meshlab several filter and reconstruction processes were applied i selection of edges longer than some optimum threshold 5 10 3 2 5 10 4 varies between the mesh models ii selection of faces by colour filtering for else than brown colours iii filter for isolated faces with a diameter larger than some optimum 5 20 of the world unit varies between the mesh models iv close holes closing of resulting smaller holes not resolving the problem of closing the bottom of the mesh v remove non manifold edges faces and zero area faces the cleaned psr mesh model is then exported in obj format for further processing in autodesk fusion 360 autodesk fusion 360 has tools for closing the bottom of the mesh with a smooth curved surface rather than a plane or bulging protrusion as often occurs in other methods for the final watertight accumulation model in some cases other parts of the psr mesh especially small sections on the bottom plane become isolated while closing the hole for this reason we filtered the mesh model once more in meshlab and computed geometric measures the output metrics provide information about bounding box dimensions surface area and volumetric measures of the modelled lw accumulation 3 6 porosity of lw accumulations in the present article void volume vv is defined as the difference between the projected 2 5d volume v2 5d and the more refined 3d volume v3d eq 9 consequently the porosity n can be determined as the ratio of porous space vv to 2 5d volume eq 10 for the ofm accumulations the corresponding reference volume 3d geometric volume in table 1 includes pore space 9 v v v 2 5 d v 3 d m 3 10 n 100 v v v 2 5 d 4 results 4 1 point cloud and mesh results all of our laboratory lw accumulations resulted in high resolution point cloud models with 2 2 106 12 7 106 generated 3d points the processing time in pix4dmapper for initial tie point processing was between 10 min for low image datasets and 2 6 h for datasets with a higher number of images further point cloud processing times including dsm and orthomosaic generation ranged from 30 min to 43 h our 2 5d volume models computed and meshed in pix4dmapper emerged with 1 0 106 faces as per description in the methodology section 3 3 the 3d psr algorithm generated between 2 6 106 and 15 2 106 faces depending on the dowel prototype complexity meshing the eight dowels low image point cloud required two applications of the meshing process in order to construct a watertight surface table 4 provides an overview of point cloud and meshing results using psr the volumes of elementary lw accumulations were computed fig 3 a to f the psr operation for the elementary lw accumulations 2 6 3 7 106 faces only takes a few minutes in meshlab processing times increase slightly with more complex laboratory models e g with ofm 10 8 and 15 2 106 faces however the maximum time required for psr was one hour for the eight dowels high photo count accumulation model showing a total of 4 7 106 faces the final meshes are shown in fig 3a ton with the psr model on the left side and the corresponding watertight model on the right side 4 2 volumetric results results for i 3d geometric volume ii 2 5d geometric volume iii pix4d volume tool volume 2 5d and iv psr volume 3d are outlined in table 5 and summarised as a chart in fig 5 a selection of the pix4d mesh models is shown in fig 4 with base surface in green and computed 2 5d volume in red the 3d geometric volumes ranged from 0 50 up to 2 93 10 3 m3 while computed 2 5d pix4d volumes ranged between 0 56 and 6 19 10 3 m3 in contrast the 3d psr volumes displayed in fig 3 at the left hand side ranged from 0 49 to 3 27 10 3 m3 some individual ofm pieces are resolved emphasising the high level of mesh detail the 3d psr models reveal pore space volumes that are almost identical to the 3d geometric estimates as shown in fig 3 surface texture is reconstructed using screened psr accumulation shape and size are kept intact when closing the bottom hole fig 3 right side models for the first experimental setup using one dowel the results displayed in fig 5 showed a discrepancy surplus of 10 9 between the volume computed via pix4d volume tool 2 5d and the 3d geometric volume on the other hand results from the pix4d volume tool showed a minor underestimation 1 2 relative to the 2 5d geometric volume approximation within the 3d framework the psr revealed a slight underestimation of volume in comparison to estimates based on 3d geometry the pore space under the longitudinal edges of the dowel fill volume 1 in fig 1 was calculated to be 12 8 according eqs 9 and 10 results for our second lw accumulation comprising two identical wooden dowels showed an overestimation by 31 9 in 2 5d volume computed via algorithms in the pix4d volume tool compared to the 3d geometric volume as before almost identical values were achieved for 3d volumes psr vs 3d geometric volume and 2 5d volumes pix4d vs 2 5d geometric volume for this experiment a porosity of almost one third of the entire lw accumulation was calculated the dowel pile consisting of six identical wooden dowels showed considerable deviations amongst the 2 5d pix4d volume tool 2 31 10 3 m3 3d psr 2 13 10 3 m3 and geometric volumes 2 31 10 3 m3 2 5d 1 93 10 3 m3 3d variations of 9 5 for psr volume and 16 4 for pix4d volume tool were determined in comparison to the 3d geometric volume again the 2 5d pix4d volume tool and 2 5d geometric volume approximation showed almost identical measures 0 2 the volume of porous space in the dowel pile was calculated to be 0 18 l 7 7 more complex lw accumulations consisting of eight dowels scanned with a high photo count 529 images revealed nearly identical results between 3d psr volume 2 95 10 3 m3 and 3d geometric volume 2 93 10 3 m3 the volume obtained using the 2 5d pix4d volume tool 6 19 10 3 m3 however showed a 52 7 deviation from those 3d volumes this lw accumulation was not amenable to geometric volume calculation owing to its complexity the large deviation between 2 5d and 3d volumetric measures was attributed to a porosity of 52 3 the second lw accumulation also comprised eight dowels however the point cloud and mesh were generated from a small image set 23 images this model showed larger deviations between 3d psr volume 3 27 10 3 m3 and 3d geometric volume 2 93 10 3 m3 yet the value estimated via the pix4d volume tool 5 66 10 3 m3 indicated a slightly lower deviation for the 2 5d volume consistent with the estimated porosity 48 2 the magnitude of these departures is compared in fig 5 experiments with the ofm accumulation yielded almost identical values between 2 5d pix4d volume estimates 1 03 10 3 m3 and those obtained from 3d geometric volume 1 00 10 3 m3 estimates 3d psr volume 0 86 10 3 m3 however revealed a negative departure of 15 9 from these volumes in combination with ten lw pieces the 3d psr volume 1 46 10 3 m3 overestimated the 3d geometric volume 1 42 10 3 m3 by 3 1 whereas the 2 5d volume computed with pix4d volume tool 2 16 10 3 m3 exceeded this by 34 4 the resulting porosity accounted for almost one third of the 2 5d volume 32 2 5 discussion 5 1 processing of elementary and complex lw accumulations in the laboratory despite the variable number of images exclusively obtained from a standard smartphone camera with default settings for each of the accumulation models all of the point cloud models showed a high level of detail this is most evident in the more complex models where sticks and bark are finely resolved the model point cloud complexity varies considerably so does the quantity of generated 3d points as results have shown the total number of model points relates directly to the number of photos used for the model generation cf fig 6 this was found to be consistent with existing literature applying ground based sfm photogrammetry in geosciences stumpf et al 2015 wróżyński et al 2017 furthermore it has been shown that with a larger degree of image overlap the number of generated points increases morgan et al 2016 more complex lw accumulation models thus require a proportionately higher number of images with generous image overlap 75 to resolve intersections of structural members overlapping and covered areas as well as void spaces inside the structure an increased number of images and higher point density can counteract problems such as outliers noise perspective deformations and poor reconstruction of sharp edges or similarly textured sections scaioni et al 2015 these issues may be particularly acute for model subjects with pronounced surface irregularities higher proportions of ofm and variable particle size li et al 2018a we found that in terms of surface reconstruction psr meshing models with ofm have up to four times more computed faces than lw accumulation skeletons even with a similar number of images this is evident when comparing results for six dowels and ofm accumulation despite a slightly lesser number of photos used to build the model the ofm accumulation has far more faces in the resulting mesh from this we infer that face count must be strongly related to textural complexity of the surface higher image complexity likely provides more point matching opportunities for the software resulting in a denser overall point cloud maiti and chakravarty 2016 in contrast less feature rich subjects e g one dowel will tend to have simpler resultant models as the psr algorithm smooths out noise associated effects kazhdan et al 2006 if a ceiling is set for the total face count 1 0 106 faces in our case pix4dmapper may not be able to satisfy conditions for a clean mesh within that limit the resulting relatively coarse mesh surface structure may therefore influence volumetric measures of lw accumulations showing complex surfaces with only loosely resolved elements giirsoy and patrikalakis 1992 shao et al 2018 such as protruding branches root wad and entire logs for one of our psr mesh models eight dowels low photo count a watertight surface could not be achieved initially due to this limit on vertices and a number of artefacts such as self intersecting faces were evident we resolved this issue by re meshing the existing psr mesh with the same initial parameters and settings as were applied in the first instance for psr in meshlab in order to achieve a watertight surface covering the entire lw accumulation the resulting accumulation model fig 3h shows less detail than the model that was generated on the basis of a very high photo count fig 3j results also reveal that processing times are proportional to the number of 3d points used for densified point cloud generation table 4 however we also found that the relatively long processing times which are required for densified point cloud generation using a high photo count resulted in better model reconstruction than those generated on a basis of a low photo count this means that there are compromises to be made between processing times model accuracy and field labour in the course of image acquisition the software algorithm requires relatively little operator intervention and can be scripted to generate a great number of high resolution densified point cloud models with available options of subsampling and subdividing the point cloud in order to better manage large data sets zhou and chen 2011 fan and atkinson 2019 the remaining editing and mesh processing times can be reduced significantly while maintaining surface details and mesh model quality tazir et al 2016 chen et al 2017 the exact effects of subsampling and meshing of reduced lw accumulations point cloud models however require further research to be better understood 5 2 point normals the orientation of point normals is particularly important for elementary accumulations given that there are fewer and larger faces available to represent the model topology reconstructing the contours of occluded and obscured elements is a troublesome problem in computational geometry hoppe et al 1992 mitra and nguyen 2003 demarsin et al 2007 as other results from the psr process highlight fuhrmann and goesele 2011 lobos and rojas moraleda 2013 wolff et al 2016 sheng et al 2018 as can be seen in fig 3h i and j a convex hull is generated at the bottom occluded side of individual lw pieces which is a common effect when working with psr due to the inconsistent off surface constraints mostegel and rumpler 2012 berger et al 2017 guerrero et al 2018 ideally all of the surface normals of each dowel would be neatly directed outward from the central axis fixing this problem is very time and memory consuming and prone to producing unreliable data and failed convergence of mesh generation routines the parameters contributing to the challenge are various vosselman et al 2004 such as orientation of the cylinder axis or the detection of a circle in a plane kimme et al 1975 describing the accumulation of randomly assorted cylindrical objects this is an indication of present challenges when it comes to point cloud and meshing algorithms nurunnabi et al 2017 the meshing software typically makes some bulk assumptions about normal direction e g averaging amongst neighbouring normals smooth iterations or flip normal with respect to upward pointing geometry or radial expansion starting from the centre cignoni et al 2008 cloudcomparev2 2016 which in the case of complex scenes still can result in complete failure of point normal estimation and the process of generating a watertight mesh in the case of a large number of point normals facing incorrectly the entire dowel may not be considered for surface reconstruction volume estimates rather it will get lost as a consequence of errors during the mesh closing procedure fig 7 it is desirable that the numerous details of lw accumulations in shape and structure be kept throughout each processing step in order to not affect volumetric assessment and calculation of accumulation porosity difficulties arising with unorganised point clouds and imperfections in point normal estimation and surface reconstruction need to be addressed future algorithms have to be robust to unoriented point normals and inaccuracies berger et al 2014 we overcame meshing challenges by experimenting with the number of neighbours up to 300 points for complex lw accumulations which resulted in a suitable however not perfect point normal computation for surface reconstruction and volume computation 5 3 volumetric computations we have demonstrated that 2 5d computations using the pix4d volume tool perform as expected the models are consistent with our geometric estimations of the 2 5d models all within a range of 1 2 volume deviation table 5 overall the 2 5d model from photogrammetry such as also applied in the field spreitzer et al 2019 is more convenient to develop than a watertight 3d mesh which requires several software packages as well as advanced skills in point cloud and mesh editing thus from the perspective of rapid assessment of lw volume it may be reasonable to accept errors inherent in this approximation and quantify 2 5d volume by using a standalone sfm photogrammetry software kit such as pix4dmapper yet there is a variety of sfm photogrammetry toolboxes available freely astre 2015 visualsfm 2018 or commercially such as agisoft llc russia 2018 and autodesk recap 2019 if more precision is needed particularly when dealing with significant deposit complexity showing overarching structures void spaces and protruding elements it may be worth the additional effort to develop a fully 3d resolved model such as suggested in this study in our experience the psr meshing algorithm followed by a mesh closing procedure provided the best surface reconstruction and volume estimates as has also been demonstrated in the course of previously conducted studies kaiser et al 2014 carrivick et al 2016 gupta and shukla 2017 considering the employment of the presented 3d sfm photogrammetry approach for field applications special attention must be paid at a stage of closing the bottom of the mesh which requires a basal surface that matches field conditions with a similar shape such as applied for the 2 5d pix4d approach relative to the 3d geometric models the 3d psr volumes are overestimated by a maximum of 10 6 for elementary and complex lw accumulations all showing accumulation skeletons in the case of large amounts of ofm filling some of the void spaces inside the accumulation skeletons as demonstrated with experiments using ofm accumulations in fig 3k to n negative discrepancies of up to 15 9 were found 3d psr mesh resulted in lower values this underestimation is likely related to the complex surface structure of the organic material the digital mesh surface conforms more closely to the fibrous mass than could be captured during measurement using a glass measurement cylinder when 1 l of ofm was prepared c f ofm accumulation and ten dowels ofm in section 2 while void spaces between glass cylinder wall and the ofm have been accounted for in the 3d geometric model the 3d psr mesh analysis did not capture such boundary void spaces resulting in the slight negative aberration from the reference volume another important factor is the number of images used for the photogrammetric model a higher photo count typically resulted in greater detail and accuracy dikovski et al 2014 micheletti et al 2015 the models that were based on a lower photo count led to blocky reconstruction and less refined joints between dowels furthermore with a lack of oblique imagery the meshing process fails at the reconstruction of occluded areas in the model mosbrucker et al 2017 in places where multiple dowels intersect and overlap psr usually very robust to noise wolff et al 2016 struggles with the identification of individual dowels there are problems with filtering residual noise from point cloud generation williams et al 2018 and the algorithm fails to accurately reconstruct dowel intersections these circumstances provide reason to expect significant distortions in 3d volume for models developed from a low photo count because of sparse or over inflated due to the generation of a randomly shaped artefacts reconstruction in the centre of the dowel accumulation in the case of eight dowels low photo count the 3d psr mesh volume exceeded the 3d geometric volume by 10 6 compare fig 5 whereas the psr volume considering the eight dowels high photo count accumulation model revealed 0 9 volumetric difference relative to the 3d geometric model this scenario addresses once more the importance of obtaining a high quality dataset consisting of an abundant number of images both oblique and nadir oriented but also providing sufficient image overlap both vertically and horizontally around the lw accumulation as previous studies have confirmed dikovski et al 2014 micheletti et al 2015 in order to provide optimum definition of compositional details and surface structure of the lw accumulation we strongly recommend acquisition of additional images of the accumulation with attention to voids and ledges to better resolve contact points of major structural items finally closure of the mesh bottom can result in distorted surface reconstruction if the edges of the lw accumulation mesh model are not properly cleaned as described in section 3 5 the closed bottom surfaces of some lw accumulation models are shown in fig 8 convex artefacts bubbles are generated when outlying mesh elements are encountered below the lw accumulation model ideally the resultant bottom surface is flat and shows sharp edges connecting to the existing lw accumulation model as demonstrated in fig 8 rather than bulged corners that distort the actual accumulation volume cleaning the mesh model is therefore essential and enables the computation of realistic lw volumes from the 3d models achieving a closed mesh is essential for 3d volume estimations and we have yet to find a satisfactory open source software solution for this operation alternatively we were able to accomplish this rapidly with few artefacts in autodesk fusion 360 5 4 lw accumulation porosity lw accumulation porosity n is defined as the ratio of void volume to bulk volume pagliara and carnacina 2010 for porosity estimates of our lw accumulation models in the laboratory we applied the 2 5d volume results from the pix4d volume tool as the bulk volume and the 3d psr volume as solid volume according to eqs 9 and 10 results for accumulation porosity vary in a range of 7 7 52 3 table 5 the accuracy of this technique is limited by the scale of investigation with larger accumulations it becomes increasingly difficult to capture interior interstices and evaluate an aspect ratio e g length diameter as well as the packing matrix of structural elements and ofm however it provides a good approximation and would be useful for first order assessment of porosity characteristics across a population of lw deposits both in the field as well as in the laboratory our porosity estimation approach has great potential for field applications and the improvement of recent sfm photogrammetry studies sanhueza et al 2019 spreitzer et al 2019 as there are no visual estimates or manual calculations involved such as a parallelepiped approach boivin et al 2015 livers et al 2015 scott et al 2019 and the introduced 3d approach is a major advance for the development of semi automated and automated methods which allow for accurate lw accumulation volume and porosity assessment the porosity results correspond to expected values ranging from 30 to 50 dixon 2016 additional information provided by sfm photogrammetry e g colour information orru et al 2016 can significantly contribute to resolving accumulation structure and jam porosity the canupo plugin in cloudcomparev2 2016 can be leveraged for automated identification and classification of point values which works similar to classifiers for land cover mapping waske and braun 2009 rodriguez galiano et al 2012 and objects within a scene yousefhussien et al 2018 furthermore previously developed reconstruction algorithms of tree and plant parts raumonen et al 2013 hackenberg et al 2015 may be particularly helpful for skeletonisation of lw accumulations based on progressive simplification of the geometry of structural members yrttimaa et al 2019 jacobson et al 2013 developed a robust method which uses surface texture to reconstruct a tree skeleton this will be of major importance for future applications dealing with aspect ratios packing matrix zhang et al 2006 roughness parameters e g sediment and flow retention bocchiola et al 2002 pagliara and carnacina 2010 obtained via sfm photogrammetry bretar et al 2013 verma and bourke 2019 this paths the way for using lw accumulations showing most realistic features in computer aided 2d ruiz villanueva et al 2014 costabile and macchione 2015 ventres pake et al 2019 and 3d smith et al 2011 allen and smith 2012 lai 2016 modelling 6 conclusions and outlook here we have demonstrated that both detailed 2 5d volume surfaces and 3d volumetric meshes can be generated in order to assess the volume of a scaled lw accumulation in a laboratory setting as drone or ground based photogrammetric techniques are becoming increasingly popular to quantify and model lw formations in river systems it is important to understand the potential and limitations of the technology while sfm photogrammetry on small and accessible wooden accumulations can be easily applied by means of exclusively ground based datasets a combination of low altitude aerial flights e g drone and ground based mapping where accessible is suggested to better resolve 3d models of larger and more complex lw accumulations in the field therefore a better understanding of merged datasets is required solutions to the essential problem of rendering volumetric models of constitutional elements within lw accumulations from unorganized point clouds remain elusive yet we have shown how critical advances can be exploited the comparison of simple models from the pix4d volume tool 2 5d and the psr 3d algorithm in meshlab relative to geometrically determined benchmarks revealed that the 3d approach using psr provided the most accurate results for lw accumulation assessment the 2 5d models consistently overestimated the volume by an average of 28 2 the 3d models deviated by 6 3 absolute on average with a mix of over and under estimation overestimation of accumulation volumes was expected from 2 5d models as they include interstitial space within the accumulation we found that for an accurate generation of a 3d mesh model a higher number of oblique and nadir images is required than for conventional 2 5d mesh models occluded geometry in the models introduced the problem of mesh closure software algorithms must estimate this closure in sparse regions of the point cloud often resulting in strong distortions of the resultant volume model using the difference between the 2 5d and 3d volumes as a measure of deposit void space the introduced methodology provides a consistent and objective measure for assessing void space in the field our results showed void proportions of 7 7 to 52 3 these measurements showed good consistency with the results based on consideration of geometric primitive models of void space we successfully computed high quality 3d models of miniature lw structures along with ofm in a controlled laboratory environment and extracted precise accumulation volumes for the first time our results demonstrated the capability of this sfm methodology which provides major advances for lw accumulation assessment in the field as well as in the laboratory this may be of further fundamental importance for prototype accumulation models 2d 2 5d and 3d in hydraulic engineering using numerical modelling for instance mesh generation techniques will be useful for the estimation of obstructed cross sectional area of lw accumulations and surface roughness which affect hydraulic flow behaviour and backwater effects respectively some challenges arise for future work including i properly resolving intersecting elements especially in the accumulation centre ii mesh closure processes without losing important surface details and iii assessing the effects of point sub sampling on model quality in order to deploy sfm photogrammetry as an effective surveying tool thus progress in point cloud processing editing and meshing algorithms is imperative in order to generate more reliable and robust models the workflow should be able to counter problems with rendering mesh e g noise reduction correct point normal estimation resolving surface texture e g mesh closing recognition of void spaces and mitigating environmental noise e g shades reflections water surfaces using standard camera devices such as smartphones or action cameras this workflow will contribute to a better understanding of lw accumulations in fluvial environments by providing parameters for accumulation volume and porosity which are known to affect channel hydraulics and bedload processes such indicators can facilitate hydraulic studies and help to better assess lw accumulations in rivers apart from volume and porosity estimates our method can provide significant information about constitutional materials of the accumulation surface structure roughness elements log alignment and geometries which are all crucial parameters for studying formation processes of lw accumulations this understanding will allow for the identification of critical key logs which are responsible for jam initiation computation of the resulting hydraulic discharge behaviour and estimation of the effects on channel morphology in the presence of lw accumulations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
5899,a structure from motion sfm photogrammetry based methodology for precise mapping of large wood lw accumulations in fluvial systems is presented the technique may be useful for routine inventory and rapid volume estimation of complex lw structures that tend to divert or obstruct flow in rivers our methodology is validated by means of laboratory experiments ranging from elementary to complex arrangements of lw components and organic fine material ofm seven experimental setups were used as the basis for i manual approximations of 2 5d and 3d geometric reference volumes ii 2 5d volume models based on mesh geometry iii a closed watertight 3d mesh from an unorganized point cloud and iv estimates of porosity a commercially available sfm photogrammetry software package pix4dmapper was used for point cloud and simplified mesh generation in order to obtain more precise volumes 3d surface models are required accordingly we generated 3d watertight mesh models of the unorganized point cloud using the screened poisson surface reconstruction psr technique the pix4d volume tool 2 5d resulted in an overestimation 2 9 to 52 7 of the geometric volume 3d due to the convex hull approximation of the geometry normal to the surface plane psr 3d resulted in more precise volumes showing deviations from the geometric volume 3d in a range of 15 9 to 10 6 as the algorithm could capture concavities and involuted surfaces on the accumulation assuming that the difference between 3d and 2 5d volume models represents many of the voids visible within or on the surface of the deposit this volume can be used as an estimate of porosity our assessment suggests that image based sfm methodology is well suited for further investigations in lw research due to its time and cost efficiency in comparison with other conventional surveying techniques the methodology can be used to generate high quality point cloud and mesh models of log jam formations these may be used by river managers and researchers to quantify accumulation volume and thus gain a better understanding of lw composition and the influence of wood geometry on hydraulic flow conditions keywords large wood lw accumulation models sfm photogrammetry estimation of 2 5d and 3d volumes lw accumulation porosity 1 introduction 1 1 large wood lw accumulations and assessment the majority of river focused research

fausch and northcote 1992 several research projects have focused on the influence of log structures on channel forms including stream banks and bars keller and swanson 1979 gippel et al 1996 as well as on flow hydraulics energy losses changes in roughness and flow dissipation heede et al 1972 gregory et al 1985 knauss 1995 anderson et al 2006 besides the positive effects of wood in stream channels lw accumulations at constricted cross sections may represent a hazard to river spanning infrastructure agriculture lands as well as human populations in adjacent areas mazzorana and fuchs 2010 schmocker and weitbrecht 2013 ruiz villanueva et al 2017 gasser et al 2019 a fundamental knowledge of geometrical arrangement volume and porous space of lw accumulations is essential in order to better understand the effects on channel hydraulics in presence of log structures furthermore quantification of the wood inventory within a river corridor provides important information on the likelihood of jam development as well as clues to key loading points within the contributing catchment the geometry of lw accumulations is a function of the flows that deposited the wood wyżga and

conditions above a constricted passage will lead to a chaotic accumulation that can be several meters high lassettre and kondolf 2012 rusyda 2014 and several kilometres in length collins et al 2002 wohl 2014 interstitial space at the inside of the log formation can be filled by transported ofm reducing accumulation porosity such lw accumulations can act as flow obstructions moos et al 2018 that affect channel morphology mosley 1981 wohl and scott 2017 there is considerable scope for better capture and structural analysis of these jams if the tools were available a current literature review reveals little progress in wood volume estimation techniques some studies have focused on assessing lw volumes along channels van wagner 1968 uchiogi et al 1996 benda and sias 2003 rigon et al 2008 and only a small number have endeavoured to evaluate the volume of existing log jams those that focused on lw accumulation volume applied a parallelepiped approach boivin et al 2015 or geometric measures of length and diameter as well as number of individual logs or wood pieces cordova et al 2006 brown et al 2014 dixon and sear 2014 ruiz villanueva et al 2016 tonon et al 2018 and calculated a volume based on cylindrical approximations these methods do not consider any irregularities in shape and in many cases volume estimates are based on a line intersection technique introduced by warren and olsen 1964 leading to a rough estimation of lw volume rather than a precise measurement brown et al 2014 also described the methodology of water displacement for lw volume estimation which may be effective for relatively small quantities of organic material although measuring of volume is difficult harmon et al 1986 many researches have underlined the importance of assessing lw volume within a quantitative assessment framework lienkaemper and swanson 1987 gurnell et al 2002 webb and erskine 2003 manners and doyle 2008 dixon and sear 2014 wohl et al 2017 martin et al 2018 characterising the porosity of wood accumulations in particular still represents a major challenge in lw research piegay 1993 boivin and buffin bélanger 2010 schalko et al 2018 scott et al 2019 as it is onerous to estimate void space inside the log jam formation gaps in accumulations have important implications for hydraulic flow behaviour such as the development of backwater effects which are strongly related to the blocked cross sectional area the amount of ofm and accumulation porosity knauss 1995 schalko et al 2016 gschnitzer et al 2017 thus improved assessment of void space within accumulations can help in evaluating structural integrity and capacity for retention of water and sediment finally any technique for rapidly acquiring consistent volume information will help to improve wood inventories and budgets of wood flux from catchments wood budgets are commonly used to study the impacts of forestry cave et al 2017 phillips et al 2018 or other disturbances that affect wood supply to rivers drone photogrammetry is particularly helpful for this application as the photographs can be taken from an aerial vantage at a scale tailored for individual cases and at a resolution that is well suited for reach studies colomina and molina 2014 cunliffe et al 2016 woodget et al 2017 lucia et al 2018 higher altitude e g airplane based photogrammetry smikrud and prakash 2006 does not provide sufficient detail for precise volumetric assessment recent studies applied aerial sanhueza et al 2019 and ground based spreitzer et al 2019 structure from motion sfm photogrammetry for volume estimation of larger wood quantities however both studies reported challenges with model resolution and a lack of standardised protocols the aim of this paper is to demonstrate a structure from motion sfm photogrammetry based workflow considering a suite of meshing algorithms that can produce precise volumetric estimates for wood accumulations using point cloud resolutions in the order of many 102 105 points per square meter such as achieved using tls surveying boivin and buffin bélanger 2010 tonon et al 2014 grigillo et al 2015 this is the typical realm of models acquired from field photography i e from ground level mosbrucker et al 2017 verma and bourke 2019 or low altitude drone acquisition woodget et al 2017 acuna and sosa 2019 which provides better time and cost efficiency westoby et al 2012 1 2 structure from motion sfm for lw research sfm photogrammetry has proven to be a powerful technique for fieldwork as one can produce highly detailed models with simply a camera and a few strategically placed orientation and scaling marks westoby et al 2012 provide a useful summary of the field procedures reconstruction algorithms and the sfm workflow there are a number of software packages available for point cloud generation both as open source evaluated by bianco et al 2018 as well as commercially licensed evaluated by alidoost and arefi 2017 the effectiveness of sfm has been demonstrated for terrestrial mapping in the field javernick et al 2014 kraaijenbrink et al 2016 smith et al 2016 jugie et al 2018 li et al 2018a tunnicliffe et al 2018 and there are a number of studies that have successfully demonstrated the applicability of sfm in the laboratory chandler et al 2000 curran and tan 2010 morgan et al 2016 wang et al 2016 balaguer puig et al 2017 seitz et al 2018 the survey accuracy has been shown to be similar to other topographic measurement techniques such as terrestrial or airborne lidar mancini et al 2013 kaiser et al 2014 ružić et al 2014 morgan et al 2016 filippelli et al 2019 although sfm photogrammetry is generally more efficient considering costs and time peterson et al 2015 the trinity river restoration program trrp 2018 provides some interesting comparisons of tls and sfm point cloud models where results reveal a higher point cloud density in the tls models whereas sfm provided a more detailed surface structure multiple camera viewing angles resulted in more detailed relief on the wooden elements peterson et al 2015 making this methodology more suitable for lw research surrounding water and non static vegetation may affect the quality of sfm photogrammetry models because of feature distortion or the loss of tie points during the initial point cloud processing stage some of the studies have used standard smartphone cameras for data acquisition and concluded that results reveal point cloud quality equal to that of tls wróżyński et al 2017 besides data acquisition smartphones may also be of use for point cloud generation processing and meshing using the available hardware resources nocerino et al 2017 the technique of obtaining volumetric information from multi view 2d images has been in practice for decades martin and aggarwal 1983 though the achievable resolution has soared with the advent of automated point matching and new bundle adjustment techniques once a point cloud model of an object is generated its volume can be computed either in 2 5d on the basis of a plane with a predefined region bounded by the convex hull and an elevation grid or in 3d where no such restrictions apply however the elevation function becomes complex for unorganized point cloud models remondino 2003 such as lw accumulation models currently a common challenge is the identification and or classification of landscape elements from detailed yet often noisy point cloud data lw research faces this problem as well in particular for branches rootwads and ofm while wood logs have a generally cylindrical form which presents a consistent geometric form for meshing and recognition algorithms raumonen et al 2013 and hackenberg et al 2015 exploited the geometric architecture of trees and developed an approach for clustered point cloud reconstruction of trees using such cylindrical units in this vein recent work in related fields have shown successful reconstruction of individual plants with stem branches and leaves both on a basis of the most relevant neighbour points in sfm photogrammetry golbach et al 2015 and tls data hétroy wheeler et al 2016 a significant advance in these studies was achieved by the clusterization of leaves and branches that allows for structural assessment and volume estimation schneider et al 2014 widlowski et al 2014 surface reconstruction for tubular shapes and tree sections is often based on the poisson scheme morel et al 2018 which has been shown to be robust and fairly stable in a number of studies kaiser et al 2014 carrivick et al 2016 gupta and shukla 2017 the accuracy of plant and tree reconstruction algorithms shows errors in a range of a few cm to less than one mm for an entire tree model hackenberg et al 2015 li et al 2018b lw research faces the additional challenge presented by complex compositional features e g ofm and sediments for which high point cloud density becomes essential in order to distinguish amongst some of these features colvard 1998 wright et al 2000 a recent study applying sfm photogrammetry to the problem of aboveground biomass estimation shows how compositional details can be captured based on a colour scheme alonzo et al 2018 the method of colour segmentation algorithms for point cloud filtering has further been applied in geosciences for obtaining volumes and porosity of soil and sediments orru et al 2016 when filtering a reconstructed surface model for colours surface texture may be used for the generation of roughness models bertin et al 2015 alratrout et al 2018 and used for porosity estimates seitz et al 2018 approaches such as introduced by raumonen et al 2013 and alonzo et al 2018 can help to estimate lw accumulation structure and volume even when significant portions of the logs are not captured in the dataset 1 3 objectives given the requirement for precise in situ volume estimation in lw research there is high demand for portable and easily deployed surveying tools such as sfm photogrammetry that can efficiently capture the geometry of wooden deposits to move from the unorganized point cloud produced by photogrammetric techniques to a volumetric model requires testing of the available meshing and volume integration algorithms under controlled conditions with our work we aim to develop a sfm photogrammetry based workflow pipeline to estimate the volume of model lw accumulations that can be objectively verified our objectives are i to generate high quality point cloud models of lw accumulations under controlled conditions in the laboratory ii to compute the geometric measures including volume and porosity of the generated 2 5d and 3d lw accumulation models iii to evaluate and assess the computed lw volumes generated via sfm photogrammetry in comparison with easily verifiable accumulation volumes iv to assess the challenges and opportunities arising from 2 5d volume estimation from elevation points that have been projected vertically onto a reference surface versus 3d volumes that may be obtained by detailed meshing of the point cloud sfm photogrammetry is a promising tool for lw research under controlled conditions in the laboratory considering its performance relative to other available mapping techniques developing a quantitative framework for analysing lw accumulations will enable more meaningful and compatible measures of accumulation composition and volumes as well as detailed assessment of surface structure detrital organic characteristics and other features 2 laboratory experiments for estimates of lw accumulation volumes based on sfm photogrammetry we used a set of wooden dowel structures which were assembled on a smooth surface in the laboratory the wooden dowels were of a uniform cylindrical shape varying in length and diameter altogether seven distinctive accumulation structures table 1 were considered starting with the most elementary a single wood dowel working up to complex lw accumulations we also considered ofm as part of our experimental setup for a small number of experiments for the laboratory ofm substrate we used wood chips with a length of up to 65 mm and bark pieces in a range of 4 32 mm b axis the ofm fills porous space in between the log skeleton structure reducing accumulation porosity the species of the wooden material was pinus radiata new zealand pine for the first experiment a single wooden dowel one dowel with a length of 300 mm and 46 mm in diameter was used table 1 this setup appears trivial however it represents an essential verification test for further volume assessment of lw accumulations the second structure comprised two wooden dowels two dowels both showing equal dimensions l 300 mm d 46 mm one of the dowels was placed on top of the other one in a perpendicular alignment the distance between the grounded point of the top dowel and the underlying centrally placed dowel was about three quarters of the top dowel s length six cylindrical wooden dowels six dowels dowel pile were used for a further elementary lw accumulation a triangular bundle was formed with three logs at the base two in the middle and one on top in order to maintain the shape and position of the dowel pile tape was used the dowels had a length of 400 mm each with a diameter of 32 mm a more complex lw accumulation was set up using eight wooden dowels eight dowels high photo count that were randomly assembled forming an accumulation skeleton the lw accumulation consisted of a mixture of the previously used dowels comprising two dowels with a length of 300 mm and 46 mm in diameter and another six dowels with lengths of 400 mm and 32 mm in diameter for this experiment a relatively high number of images 529 was obtained for the photogrammetric model similar to the previous setup eight dowels high photo count the same eight dowels were used and assembled into another lw accumulation eight dowels low photo count on the laboratory floor a relatively low number of images 23 was acquired for the model the purpose is to demonstrate the effects of having a low number of images in comparison to a high number of images for volume estimates an accumulation consisting of only ofm ofm accumulation was formed to resemble a heap approximately 70 mm in height with a roughly circular planform diameter of 190 mm for material preparation a measuring cylinder was filled with 1 00 10 3 m3 of wood chips 65 mm and bark pieces 4 to 32 mm the glass cylinder was filled in three layers with the material gently compacted at each interval using fingers the material in the measuring cylinder and in the accumulation heap showed a similar degree of consolidation the most complex lw accumulation considered for our experiments consisted of ten dowels varying in length and diameter and 1 l of ofm the lw dowels were mixed up with the ofm and formed into a complex accumulation structure ten dowels ofm dowel composition and dimensions can be obtained from table 1 the total 3d geometric volume based on the conical shape of the accumulation was 1 42 10 3 m3 3 methodology 3 1 procedure for volumetric estimates we classified our accumulations into three categories i elementary accumulations one dowel two dowels and six dowels ii complex accumulations eight dowels and iii ofm accumulations as a further advanced stage of complex accumulations ofm accumulation and ten dowels ofm the aim of the experiments is to compare 3d and 2 5d volumes estimated via sfm photogrammetry methodology to the actual 3d see 3d geometric volume in table 1 and 2 5d volumes see 2 5d geometric volume in fig 1 computed via standard mathematical approximations to resolve the geometric aspects of the constitutional elements e g cylinders cones wedges the point cloud model was generated using a commercial sfm photogrammetry software package pix4dmapper pix4d switzerland 2018 version 4 1 25 which provides an efficient workflow and offers a palette of useful tools for point cloud as well as mesh processing the volumes of the 2 5d and 3d photogrammetrically derived meshes were assessed using freely available open source software tools namely meshlab cignoni et al 2008 version 2016 12 and cloudcomparev2 2016 version 2 6 3 in cloudcompare the initial unorganised point cloud model was segmented for further object oriented processing stages including filtering and cleaning of outlier points as well as meshing the meshlab implementation of the screened poisson surface reconstruction psr kazhdan and hoppe 2013 was used for meshing the unorganized point cloud providing an initial mesh the final refinement of the mesh involved closing the grid surface such that it was continuous watertight for this operation we used the commercial package autodesk fusion 360 2018 version 2 0 5119 having established 2 5d and 3d volumes the porous space inside the lw accumulations could be estimated as the volumetric difference between the two models 3 2 image acquisition experiments were mostly conducted in a custom designed black room in the laboratory consisting of black walls with good light conditions 4 500 w halogen flood lights from the top and a table in the centre a platform 400 500 mm was mounted on the table supporting a rotating platter with a flat surface this platform enabled easy setup for obtaining oblique and nadir images without capturing any detail beyond the lw assembly e g floor the only experiment that was not conducted in the black room eight dowels low photo count was carried out on a sealed and flat laboratory floor for scaling purposes a number of chequerboards with a raster of 25 mm were placed around the accumulations image acquisition for our lw volume assessment was carried out using a standard smartphone device huawei nova 2i with 16mp image resolution images were captured under controlled light conditions using default settings for contrast exposure saturation and sharpness further camera specifications are listed in table 2 3 3 point cloud and mesh processing in pix4d pix4dmapper initially computes matching key points from overlapping images then applies a bundle block adjustment algorithm to generate a sparse 3d point cloud step 1 based on the residuals from model fitting the software iteratively estimates the internal and external camera parameters until the best optimization is achieved pix4dmapper 2018 after initial sparse cloud processing the model is scaled using ground control reference marks in our case chequerboards around the lw accumulations at this stage the orientation of the point cloud model may also be adjusted by setting orientation constraints for the x y and z directions in order to take the new scaling and orientation input into account the reprocessing step has to be started the next step in pix4dmapper involves computing the dense point cloud model and mesh step 2 the point cloud density settings are listed in table 3 and the processing times required can be found in table 4 a maximum number of 1 0 106 faces was selected for the generation of the pix4d mesh model which provides a good balance between acceptable model detail and tractable computation of volumes and other analyses the third processing step step 3 involves the generation of a digital surface model dsm and the orthomosaic both are essential for volume estimates using the volume tool implemented in pix4dmapper pix4d volume tool 2 5d the dsm is generated from nearest neighbour interpolation of the dense point cloud the orthomosaic provides detailed rgb information for the resultant dsm pix4dmapper 2018 3 4 geometric volume 2 5d using an approach analogous to the 2 5d method in the pix4d volume tool we calculate the projected volume for elementary lw accumulations independently using geometrical primitives based on the laboratory setup of the lw models for one two and six dowels we assessed the volume of the primitives as well as the interstitial space between the objects and the horizontal reference plane platter surface the actual volume of a dowel is provided in eq 1 the fill volumes for various interstitial elements 1 4 are approximated using eqs 2 5 for the first experimental setup using one dowel the projected volume was calculated as demonstrated in fig 1a using eq 6 the next accumulation model comprising two dowels fig 1b and c shows a projected length of 292 mm for the top dowel emerging to a height of 69 mm measured to the bottom edge of the top dowel the total 2 5d volume is calculated according to eq 7 another 2 5d calculation for the six dowel accumulation was assessed using eq 8 the dowel pile in fig 1d consists of several different void elements calculations must account for the various projected volumes including ledges and projections mathematical approximations in 2 5d resolution are only practical for elementary lw accumulations with known geometric measures the method becomes inadequate as model complexity increases 1 v d o w e l d 2 π l 4 m

tool 2 5d and psr meshing 3d in the following work we employ two techniques for 2 5d and 3d volume estimation 2 5d volume consists of a convex hull enclosing the horizontal extents of the point cloud projected vertically from above much as a sheet fully draped over an object encompasses the extent of the object and falls vertically to the floor thus an elevation field potentially including void space can be mapped to a 2d raster grid and volume can be estimated by integrating the gridded height elements this approach is commonly used in terrestrial and airborne surveys to generate volumetric information of for instance stockpiles or landforms above a given reference datum lane et al 2003 milan et al 2007 eltner et al 2016 the 2 5d approach however is not well suited to subjects with over arching structures hollows concavities or any surface whose face normals point below the plane of the horizontal reference surface spreitzer et al 2019 pix4dmapper was used to compute the 2 5d volume which requires the specification of a base surface fig 2 we selected multiple points on the flat surface around the lw accumulation and used the default settings for base surfaces points above cut volume and beneath fill volume the reference surface are kept in the computational domain however they have separate outputs in this article we are focusing on the cut volume the base surface raster is resolved at the same resolution as the model ground sampling distance gsd in contrast to the 2 5d approach the 3d model mesh encloses the object from all perspectives and volumes are assessed by integrating cubes or tetrahedral elements within this enclosed space wang et al 2018 this is the preferred technique in the present application since the aim is assessing the volume of wooden material within a complex body with many voids with photogrammetric techniques the field of view into the lw accumulations is invariably obscured by interwoven wooden elements ofm and sedimentary fill so our assessment of deposit porosity is imperfect even with 3d models but we think this is an important improvement over more conventional 2 5 techniques the generation of robust 3d meshes of lw accumulation bodies using psr was conducted in meshlab cloudcompare and autodesk fusion 360 the variety of software packages applied in our workflow fig 2 is a function of the many tasks involved in the reconstruction of lw accumulations each program features specialized tools for mesh creation editing filtering and cleanup and construction of a watertight hull as a first step after importing the point cloud model the computation of point normals is required mitra and nguyen 2003 this was done using orientation consensus among 12 neighbour points with view direction from the top as this arrangement generally resulted in the most satisfactory surface reconstruction with minimal artefacts for psr an octree depth of 12 was chosen and other parameters were kept as default once the psr meshing was finished the resultant grid was exported to cloudcompare in order to isolate the area of interest the accumulation structure from the surrounding platter topography cloudcompare was found to have the best tool for this operation back in meshlab several filter and reconstruction processes were applied i selection of edges longer than some optimum threshold 5 10 3 2 5 10 4 varies between the mesh models ii selection of faces by colour filtering for else than brown colours iii filter for isolated faces with a diameter larger than some optimum 5 20 of the world unit varies between the mesh models iv close holes closing of resulting smaller holes not resolving the problem of closing the bottom of the mesh v remove non manifold edges faces and zero area faces the cleaned psr mesh model is then exported in obj format for further processing in autodesk fusion 360 autodesk fusion 360 has tools for closing the bottom of the mesh with a smooth curved surface rather than a plane or bulging protrusion as often occurs in other methods for the final watertight accumulation model in some cases other parts of the psr mesh especially small sections on the bottom plane become isolated while closing the hole for this reason we filtered the mesh model once more in meshlab and computed geometric measures the output metrics provide information about bounding box dimensions surface area and volumetric measures of the modelled lw accumulation 3 6 porosity of lw accumulations in the present article void volume vv is defined as the difference between the projected 2 5d volume v2 5d and the more refined 3d volume v3d eq 9 consequently the porosity n can be determined as the ratio of porous space vv to 2 5d volume eq 10 for the ofm accumulations the corresponding reference volume 3d geometric volume in table 1 includes pore space 9 v v v 2 5 d v 3 d m 3 10 n 100 v v v 2 5 d 4 results 4 1 point cloud and mesh results all of our laboratory lw accumulations resulted in high resolution point cloud models with 2 2 106 12 7 106 generated 3d points the processing time in pix4dmapper for initial tie point processing was between 10 min for low image datasets and 2 6 h for datasets with a higher number of images further point cloud processing times including dsm and orthomosaic generation ranged from 30 min to 43 h our 2 5d volume models computed and meshed in pix4dmapper emerged with 1 0 106 faces as per description in the methodology section 3 3 the 3d psr algorithm generated between 2 6 106 and 15 2 106 faces depending on the dowel prototype complexity meshing the eight dowels low image point cloud required two applications of the meshing process in order to construct a watertight surface table 4 provides an overview of point cloud and meshing results using psr the volumes of elementary lw accumulations were computed fig 3 a to f the psr operation for the elementary lw accumulations 2 6 3 7 106 faces only takes a few minutes in meshlab processing times increase slightly with more complex laboratory models e g with ofm 10 8 and 15 2 106 faces however the maximum time required for psr was one hour for the eight dowels high photo count accumulation model showing a total of 4 7 106 faces the final meshes are shown in fig 3a ton with the psr model on the left side and the corresponding watertight model on the right side 4 2 volumetric results results for i 3d geometric volume ii 2 5d geometric volume iii pix4d volume tool volume 2 5d and iv psr volume 3d are outlined in table 5 and summarised as a chart in fig 5 a selection of the pix4d mesh models is shown in fig 4 with base surface in green and computed 2 5d volume in red the 3d geometric volumes ranged from 0 50 up to 2 93 10 3 m3 while computed 2 5d pix4d volumes ranged between 0 56 and 6 19 10 3 m3 in contrast the 3d psr volumes displayed in fig 3 at the left hand side ranged from 0 49 to 3 27 10 3 m3 some individual ofm pieces are resolved emphasising the high level of mesh detail the 3d psr models reveal pore space volumes that are almost identical to the 3d geometric estimates as shown in fig 3 surface texture is reconstructed using screened psr accumulation shape and size are kept intact when closing the bottom hole fig 3 right side models for the first experimental setup using one dowel the results displayed in fig 5 showed a discrepancy surplus of 10 9 between the volume computed via pix4d volume tool 2 5d and the 3d geometric volume on the other hand results from the pix4d volume tool showed a minor underestimation 1 2 relative to the 2 5d geometric volume approximation within the 3d framework the psr revealed a slight underestimation of volume in comparison to estimates based on 3d geometry the pore space under the longitudinal edges of the dowel fill volume 1 in fig 1 was calculated to be 12 8 according eqs 9 and 10 results for our second lw accumulation comprising two identical wooden dowels showed an overestimation by 31 9 in 2 5d volume computed via algorithms in the pix4d volume tool compared to the 3d geometric volume as before almost identical values were achieved for 3d volumes psr vs 3d geometric volume and 2 5d volumes pix4d vs 2 5d geometric volume for this experiment a porosity of almost one third of the entire lw accumulation was calculated the dowel pile consisting of six identical wooden dowels showed considerable deviations amongst the 2 5d pix4d volume tool 2 31 10 3 m3 3d psr 2 13 10 3 m3 and geometric volumes 2 31 10 3 m3 2 5d 1 93 10 3 m3 3d variations of 9 5 for psr volume and 16 4 for pix4d volume tool were determined in comparison to the 3d geometric volume again the 2 5d pix4d volume tool and 2 5d geometric volume approximation showed almost identical measures 0 2 the volume of porous space in the dowel pile was calculated to be 0 18 l 7 7 more complex lw accumulations consisting of eight dowels scanned with a high photo count 529 images revealed nearly identical results between 3d psr volume 2 95 10 3 m3 and 3d geometric volume 2 93 10 3 m3 the volume obtained using the 2 5d pix4d volume tool 6 19 10 3 m3 however showed a 52 7 deviation from those 3d volumes this lw accumulation was not amenable to geometric volume calculation owing to its complexity the large deviation between 2 5d and 3d volumetric measures was attributed to a porosity of 52 3 the second lw accumulation also comprised eight dowels however the point cloud and mesh were generated from a small image set 23 images this model showed larger deviations between 3d psr volume 3 27 10 3 m3 and 3d geometric volume 2 93 10 3 m3 yet the value estimated via the pix4d volume tool 5 66 10 3 m3 indicated a slightly lower deviation for the 2 5d volume consistent with the estimated porosity 48 2 the magnitude of these departures is compared in fig 5 experiments with the ofm accumulation yielded almost identical values between 2 5d pix4d volume estimates 1 03 10 3 m3 and those obtained from 3d geometric volume 1 00 10 3 m3 estimates 3d psr volume 0 86 10 3 m3 however revealed a negative departure of 15 9 from these volumes in combination with ten lw pieces the 3d psr volume 1 46 10 3 m3 overestimated the 3d geometric volume 1 42 10 3 m3 by 3 1 whereas the 2 5d volume computed with pix4d volume tool 2 16 10 3 m3 exceeded this by 34 4 the resulting porosity accounted for almost one third of the 2 5d volume 32 2 5 discussion 5 1 processing of elementary and complex lw accumulations in the laboratory despite the variable number of images exclusively obtained from a standard smartphone camera with default settings for each of the accumulation models all of the point cloud models showed a high level of detail this is most evident in the more complex models where sticks and bark are finely resolved the model point cloud complexity varies considerably so does the quantity of generated 3d points as results have shown the total number of model points relates directly to the number of photos used for the model generation cf fig 6 this was found to be consistent with existing literature applying ground based sfm photogrammetry in geosciences stumpf et al 2015 wróżyński et al 2017 furthermore it has been shown that with a larger degree of image overlap the number of generated points increases morgan et al 2016 more complex lw accumulation models thus require a proportionately higher number of images with generous image overlap 75 to resolve intersections of structural members overlapping and covered areas as well as void spaces inside the structure an increased number of images and higher point density can counteract problems such as outliers noise perspective deformations and poor reconstruction of sharp edges or similarly textured sections scaioni et al 2015 these issues may be particularly acute for model subjects with pronounced surface irregularities higher proportions of ofm and variable particle size li et al 2018a we found that in terms of surface reconstruction psr meshing models with ofm have up to four times more computed faces than lw accumulation skeletons even with a similar number of images this is evident when comparing results for six dowels and ofm accumulation despite a slightly lesser number of photos used to build the model the ofm accumulation has far more faces in the resulting mesh from this we infer that face count must be strongly related to textural complexity of the surface higher image complexity likely provides more point matching opportunities for the software resulting in a denser overall point cloud maiti and chakravarty 2016 in contrast less feature rich subjects e g one dowel will tend to have simpler resultant models as the psr algorithm smooths out noise associated effects kazhdan et al 2006 if a ceiling is set for the total face count 1 0 106 faces in our case pix4dmapper may not be able to satisfy conditions for a clean mesh within that limit the resulting relatively coarse mesh surface structure may therefore influence volumetric measures of lw accumulations showing complex surfaces with only loosely resolved elements giirsoy and patrikalakis 1992 shao et al 2018 such as protruding branches root wad and entire logs for one of our psr mesh models eight dowels low photo count a watertight surface could not be achieved initially due to this limit on vertices and a number of artefacts such as self intersecting faces were evident we resolved this issue by re meshing the existing psr mesh with the same initial parameters and settings as were applied in the first instance for psr in meshlab in order to achieve a watertight surface covering the entire lw accumulation the resulting accumulation model fig 3h shows less detail than the model that was generated on the basis of a very high photo count fig 3j results also reveal that processing times are proportional to the number of 3d points used for densified point cloud generation table 4 however we also found that the relatively long processing times which are required for densified point cloud generation using a high photo count resulted in better model reconstruction than those generated on a basis of a low photo count this means that there are compromises to be made between processing times model accuracy and field labour in the course of image acquisition the software algorithm requires relatively little operator intervention and can be scripted to generate a great number of high resolution densified point cloud models with available options of subsampling and subdividing the point cloud in order to better manage large data sets zhou and chen 2011 fan and atkinson 2019 the remaining editing and mesh processing times can be reduced significantly while maintaining surface details and mesh model quality tazir et al 2016 chen et al 2017 the exact effects of subsampling and meshing of reduced lw accumulations point cloud models however require further research to be better understood 5 2 point normals the orientation of point normals is particularly important for elementary accumulations given that there are fewer and larger faces available to represent the model topology reconstructing the contours of occluded and obscured elements is a troublesome problem in computational geometry hoppe et al 1992 mitra and nguyen 2003 demarsin et al 2007 as other results from the psr process highlight fuhrmann and goesele 2011 lobos and rojas moraleda 2013 wolff et al 2016 sheng et al 2018 as can be seen in fig 3h i and j a convex hull is generated at the bottom occluded side of individual lw pieces which is a common effect when working with psr due to the inconsistent off surface constraints mostegel and rumpler 2012 berger et al 2017 guerrero et al 2018 ideally all of the surface normals of each dowel would be neatly directed outward from the central axis fixing this problem is very time and memory consuming and prone to producing unreliable data and failed convergence of mesh generation routines the parameters contributing to the challenge are various vosselman et al 2004 such as orientation of the cylinder axis or the detection of a circle in a plane kimme et al 1975 describing the accumulation of randomly assorted cylindrical objects this is an indication of present challenges when it comes to point cloud and meshing algorithms nurunnabi et al 2017 the meshing software typically makes some bulk assumptions about normal direction e g averaging amongst neighbouring normals smooth iterations or flip normal with respect to upward pointing geometry or radial expansion starting from the centre cignoni et al 2008 cloudcomparev2 2016 which in the case of complex scenes still can result in complete failure of point normal estimation and the process of generating a watertight mesh in the case of a large number of point normals facing incorrectly the entire dowel may not be considered for surface reconstruction volume estimates rather it will get lost as a consequence of errors during the mesh closing procedure fig 7 it is desirable that the numerous details of lw accumulations in shape and structure be kept throughout each processing step in order to not affect volumetric assessment and calculation of accumulation porosity difficulties arising with unorganised point clouds and imperfections in point normal estimation and surface reconstruction need to be addressed future algorithms have to be robust to unoriented point normals and inaccuracies berger et al 2014 we overcame meshing challenges by experimenting with the number of neighbours up to 300 points for complex lw accumulations which resulted in a suitable however not perfect point normal computation for surface reconstruction and volume computation 5 3 volumetric computations we have demonstrated that 2 5d computations using the pix4d volume tool perform as expected the models are consistent with our geometric estimations of the 2 5d models all within a range of 1 2 volume deviation table 5 overall the 2 5d model from photogrammetry such as also applied in the field spreitzer et al 2019 is more convenient to develop than a watertight 3d mesh which requires several software packages as well as advanced skills in point cloud and mesh editing thus from the perspective of rapid assessment of lw volume it may be reasonable to accept errors inherent in this approximation and quantify 2 5d volume by using a standalone sfm photogrammetry software kit such as pix4dmapper yet there is a variety of sfm photogrammetry toolboxes available freely astre 2015 visualsfm 2018 or commercially such as agisoft llc russia 2018 and autodesk recap 2019 if more precision is needed particularly when dealing with significant deposit complexity showing overarching structures void spaces and protruding elements it may be worth the additional effort to develop a fully 3d resolved model such as suggested in this study in our experience the psr meshing algorithm followed by a mesh closing procedure provided the best surface reconstruction and volume estimates as has also been demonstrated in the course of previously conducted studies kaiser et al 2014 carrivick et al 2016 gupta and shukla 2017 considering the employment of the presented 3d sfm photogrammetry approach for field applications special attention must be paid at a stage of closing the bottom of the mesh which requires a basal surface that matches field conditions with a similar shape such as applied for the 2 5d pix4d approach relative to the 3d geometric models the 3d psr volumes are overestimated by a maximum of 10 6 for elementary and complex lw accumulations all showing accumulation skeletons in the case of large amounts of ofm filling some of the void spaces inside the accumulation skeletons as demonstrated with experiments using ofm accumulations in fig 3k to n negative discrepancies of up to 15 9 were found 3d psr mesh resulted in lower values this underestimation is likely related to the complex surface structure of the organic material the digital mesh surface conforms more closely to the fibrous mass than could be captured during measurement using a glass measurement cylinder when 1 l of ofm was prepared c f ofm accumulation and ten dowels ofm in section 2 while void spaces between glass cylinder wall and the ofm have been accounted for in the 3d geometric model the 3d psr mesh analysis did not capture such boundary void spaces resulting in the slight negative aberration from the reference volume another important factor is the number of images used for the photogrammetric model a higher photo count typically resulted in greater detail and accuracy dikovski et al 2014 micheletti et al 2015 the models that were based on a lower photo count led to blocky reconstruction and less refined joints between dowels furthermore with a lack of oblique imagery the meshing process fails at the reconstruction of occluded areas in the model mosbrucker et al 2017 in places where multiple dowels intersect and overlap psr usually very robust to noise wolff et al 2016 struggles with the identification of individual dowels there are problems with filtering residual noise from point cloud generation williams et al 2018 and the algorithm fails to accurately reconstruct dowel intersections these circumstances provide reason to expect significant distortions in 3d volume for models developed from a low photo count because of sparse or over inflated due to the generation of a randomly shaped artefacts reconstruction in the centre of the dowel accumulation in the case of eight dowels low photo count the 3d psr mesh volume exceeded the 3d geometric volume by 10 6 compare fig 5 whereas the psr volume considering the eight dowels high photo count accumulation model revealed 0 9 volumetric difference relative to the 3d geometric model this scenario addresses once more the importance of obtaining a high quality dataset consisting of an abundant number of images both oblique and nadir oriented but also providing sufficient image overlap both vertically and horizontally around the lw accumulation as previous studies have confirmed dikovski et al 2014 micheletti et al 2015 in order to provide optimum definition of compositional details and surface structure of the lw accumulation we strongly recommend acquisition of additional images of the accumulation with attention to voids and ledges to better resolve contact points of major structural items finally closure of the mesh bottom can result in distorted surface reconstruction if the edges of the lw accumulation mesh model are not properly cleaned as described in section 3 5 the closed bottom surfaces of some lw accumulation models are shown in fig 8 convex artefacts bubbles are generated when outlying mesh elements are encountered below the lw accumulation model ideally the resultant bottom surface is flat and shows sharp edges connecting to the existing lw accumulation model as demonstrated in fig 8 rather than bulged corners that distort the actual accumulation volume cleaning the mesh model is therefore essential and enables the computation of realistic lw volumes from the 3d models achieving a closed mesh is essential for 3d volume estimations and we have yet to find a satisfactory open source software solution for this operation alternatively we were able to accomplish this rapidly with few artefacts in autodesk fusion 360 5 4 lw accumulation porosity lw accumulation porosity n is defined as the ratio of void volume to bulk volume pagliara and carnacina 2010 for porosity estimates of our lw accumulation models in the laboratory we applied the 2 5d volume results from the pix4d volume tool as the bulk volume and the 3d psr volume as solid volume according to eqs 9 and 10 results for accumulation porosity vary in a range of 7 7 52 3 table 5 the accuracy of this technique is limited by the scale of investigation with larger accumulations it becomes increasingly difficult to capture interior interstices and evaluate an aspect ratio e g length diameter as well as the packing matrix of structural elements and ofm however it provides a good approximation and would be useful for first order assessment of porosity characteristics across a population of lw deposits both in the field as well as in the laboratory our porosity estimation approach has great potential for field applications and the improvement of recent sfm photogrammetry studies sanhueza et al 2019 spreitzer et al 2019 as there are no visual estimates or manual calculations involved such as a parallelepiped approach boivin et al 2015 livers et al 2015 scott et al 2019 and the introduced 3d approach is a major advance for the development of semi automated and automated methods which allow for accurate lw accumulation volume and porosity assessment the porosity results correspond to expected values ranging from 30 to 50 dixon 2016 additional information provided by sfm photogrammetry e g colour information orru et al 2016 can significantly contribute to resolving accumulation structure and jam porosity the canupo plugin in cloudcomparev2 2016 can be leveraged for automated identification and classification of point values which works similar to classifiers for land cover mapping waske and braun 2009 rodriguez galiano et al 2012 and objects within a scene yousefhussien et al 2018 furthermore previously developed reconstruction algorithms of tree and plant parts raumonen et al 2013 hackenberg et al 2015 may be particularly helpful for skeletonisation of lw accumulations based on progressive simplification of the geometry of structural members yrttimaa et al 2019 jacobson et al 2013 developed a robust method which uses surface texture to reconstruct a tree skeleton this will be of major importance for future applications dealing with aspect ratios packing matrix zhang et al 2006 roughness parameters e g sediment and flow retention bocchiola et al 2002 pagliara and carnacina 2010 obtained via sfm photogrammetry bretar et al 2013 verma and bourke 2019 this paths the way for using lw accumulations showing most realistic features in computer aided 2d ruiz villanueva et al 2014 costabile and macchione 2015 ventres pake et al 2019 and 3d smith et al 2011 allen and smith 2012 lai 2016 modelling 6 conclusions and outlook here we have demonstrated that both detailed 2 5d volume surfaces and 3d volumetric meshes can be generated in order to assess the volume of a scaled lw accumulation in a laboratory setting as drone or ground based photogrammetric techniques are becoming increasingly popular to quantify and model lw formations in river systems it is important to understand the potential and limitations of the technology while sfm photogrammetry on small and accessible wooden accumulations can be easily applied by means of exclusively ground based datasets a combination of low altitude aerial flights e g drone and ground based mapping where accessible is suggested to better resolve 3d models of larger and more complex lw accumulations in the field therefore a better understanding of merged datasets is required solutions to the essential problem of rendering volumetric models of constitutional elements within lw accumulations from unorganized point clouds remain elusive yet we have shown how critical advances can be exploited the comparison of simple models from the pix4d volume tool 2 5d and the psr 3d algorithm in meshlab relative to geometrically determined benchmarks revealed that the 3d approach using psr provided the most accurate results for lw accumulation assessment the 2 5d models consistently overestimated the volume by an average of 28 2 the 3d models deviated by 6 3 absolute on average with a mix of over and under estimation overestimation of accumulation volumes was expected from 2 5d models as they include interstitial space within the accumulation we found that for an accurate generation of a 3d mesh model a higher number of oblique and nadir images is required than for conventional 2 5d mesh models occluded geometry in the models introduced the problem of mesh closure software algorithms must estimate this closure in sparse regions of the point cloud often resulting in strong distortions of the resultant volume model using the difference between the 2 5d and 3d volumes as a measure of deposit void space the introduced methodology provides a consistent and objective measure for assessing void space in the field our results showed void proportions of 7 7 to 52 3 these measurements showed good consistency with the results based on consideration of geometric primitive models of void space we successfully computed high quality 3d models of miniature lw structures along with ofm in a controlled laboratory environment and extracted precise accumulation volumes for the first time our results demonstrated the capability of this sfm methodology which provides major advances for lw accumulation assessment in the field as well as in the laboratory this may be of further fundamental importance for prototype accumulation models 2d 2 5d and 3d in hydraulic engineering using numerical modelling for instance mesh generation techniques will be useful for the estimation of obstructed cross sectional area of lw accumulations and surface roughness which affect hydraulic flow behaviour and backwater effects respectively some challenges arise for future work including i properly resolving intersecting elements especially in the accumulation centre ii mesh closure processes without losing important surface details and iii assessing the effects of point sub sampling on model quality in order to deploy sfm photogrammetry as an effective surveying tool thus progress in point cloud processing editing and meshing algorithms is imperative in order to generate more reliable and robust models the workflow should be able to counter problems with rendering mesh e g noise reduction correct point normal estimation resolving surface texture e g mesh closing recognition of void spaces and mitigating environmental noise e g shades reflections water surfaces using standard camera devices such as smartphones or action cameras this workflow will contribute to a better understanding of lw accumulations in fluvial environments by providing parameters for accumulation volume and porosity which are known to affect channel hydraulics and bedload processes such indicators can facilitate hydraulic studies and help to better assess lw accumulations in rivers apart from volume and porosity estimates our method can provide significant information about constitutional materials of the accumulation surface structure roughness elements log alignment and geometries which are all crucial parameters for studying formation processes of lw accumulations this understanding will allow for the identification of critical key logs which are responsible for jam initiation computation of the resulting hydraulic discharge behaviour and estimation of the effects on channel morphology in the presence of lw accumulations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
