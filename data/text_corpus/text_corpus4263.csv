21315,in this paper local scour around a subsea structure supported by a skirted mudmat foundation is explored experimentally for simplicity the structure is represented as a submerged circular cylinder founded on a concentric circular mudmat the experiments are conducted in the clear water regime and various geometries are considered by varying the height of the submerged cylinder relative to its diameter h 1 d 1 and the diameter of the mudmat relative to the submerged cylinder d 2 d 1 the experimental results indicate that the scour process can be categorized into two modes depending on geometry mode 1 in which local scour develops immediately at the upstream side of the mudmat and mode 2 in which local scour initiates at the downstream side of the mudmat and propagates upstream for each mode the rate of scour reduces as the mudmat becomes relatively large i e as d 2 d 1 increases this reduction is most significant if the mudmat size is sufficient to swap the mode of scour from mode 1 to mode 2 the reduction in scour rate however does not coincide with a reduction in maximum scour depth instead the relative scour depth of the superstructure s d 1 increases as the mudmat becomes larger i e as d 2 d 1 increases this trend is quantitatively explained by considering the effective aspect ratio of the combined mudmat and superstructure collectively the results of the present study provide insight into the inherent scour protection provided by a skirted mudmat foundation keywords scour foundation mudmat cylinder 1 introduction in offshore oil and gas developments skirted mudmat foundations are commonly used to support subsea structures e g subsea wells pipeline manifolds and pipeline connection structures randolph and gourvenec 2011 the primary reason to use skirted mudmat foundations is to provide geotechnical support both in terms of avoiding bearing failure sliding and overturning as well as to control settlements however it is often assumed that a mudmat foundation also provides an additional advantage in that it helps to mitigate scour especially when the mudmat extends some distance out from the perimeter of the superstructure it is supporting this is because local scour at a vertical column truncated or surface piercing is known to occur primarily due to the development of a horseshoe vortex at the base of the structure in combination with streamline contraction around the structure whitehouse 1998 sumer and fredsøe 2002 the mudmat shields the sediment local to the structure potentially mitigating scour whilst some previous research has investigated scour patterns around non uniform structures melville and raudkivi 1996 umeda et al 2010 whitehouse et al 2011 harris et al 2016 tavouktsoglou et al 2017 baghbadorani et al 2018 yao et al 2018 a systematic investigation into the scour protection provided by the mudmat has not yet been undertaken to the authors knowledge this is despite the fact that extensive studies have focused on mitigation of local scour at pile foundations including bed armouring countermeasures such as rock riprap chiew and lim 2000 dey and rajkumar 2007 lauchlan and melville 2001 petersen 2014 and flow altering devices such as submerged vanes odgaard and wang 1987 fins gupta and gangadharaiah 1992 slots chiew 1992 kumar et al 1999 and collars ettema 1980 dey 1997 zarrati et al 2006 alabi 2006 the primary aim of this paper is therefore to report on a systematic set of experiments to assess the benefits of mudmat foundations from a scour perspective for simplicity the subsea structure is modelled in this paper as a truncated cylinder and the mudmat is modelled as a circular cylinder buried flush with the initial surface of the seabed so that the exposure height of the mudmat is small or zero compared with the height of the submerged cylinder it is supporting and the skirt is very deep as in fig 1 for this simplified scenario two dimensionless parameters define the geometry i the ratio of mudmat to superstructure diameter d 2 d 1 and ii the aspect ratio of the superstructure h 1 d 1 a relatively wide parameter space is explored in terms of these non dimensional parameters for each case the key features relating to the scour process are explored e g the equilibrium scour depth the time scale and the scour hole geometry previous research has been undertaken on structures similar to that in fig 1 but only for h 1 d 1 1 i e surface piercing piles for this scenario and large d 2 d 1 ratios specifically d 2 d 1 2 7 and 8 1 melville and raudkivi 1996 reported that a shallow scour hole was quickly established downstream of the structure after sufficient time this scour hole then propagated upstream around the edges of the structure and subsequently developed quickly into a conventionally shaped hole ahead of the footing similar observations were also reported by zarrati et al 2006 and umeda et al 2010 collectively these results imply that there is a transition in the scour regime depending on the diameter ratio of the foundation and the superstructure which is likely to be influenced also by the aspect ratio of the superstructure h 1 d 1 to date this transition is not well defined in literature better definition of this transition is a second motivation of the present investigation this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the test setup section 3 presents the test results and some discussion and conclusions are given in section 4 and section 5 respectively 2 test setup the tests were conducted in a flume facility at the university of western australia the length width and height of the flume measures 13 2 m 0 4 m and 0 6 m respectively in the present tests the water depth was set to 0 26 m which is sufficiently large that flow depth and boundary effects should not influence the scour test results sumer and fredsøe 2002 a sand pit 0 5 m in depth and 1 1 m in length was located in the middle of the flume approximately 6 m downstream from the flow inlet see fig 2 the time average velocity was measured at 50 mm above the sand bed using a nortek vectrino ii acoustic doppler velocimeter adv and this was used to determine the bed shear stress in the same way as that outlined in yao et al 2018 the sampling frequency was 25 hz and the duration of the measurement was 5 min longer durations provided the same mean value the experiments were undertaken in the clear water regime with a steady current flow intensity corresponding to θ θ c r 0 98 where the shields parameter is θ 0 04 and the critical shields parameter of the sediment described further below is θ c r 0 041 the velocity profile was logarithmic near to the bed and increased in magnitude with distance further from the bed the depth average velocity corresponding to the shields parameter used in the experiments was 0 27 m s the choice to adopt this flow intensity was based on the results in yao et al 2018 scour depths are relatively large at flow intensities close to unity in total 31 experiments are reported in this paper as detailed in table 1 these experiments consider structures with h 1 d 1 ranging from 0 to 10 and d 2 d 1 varying from 1 to 3 these ranges are comparable with actual subsea structures based on the measured velocity of 0 27 m s and taking the viscosity of the water in the lab to be 1 0 10 6 m2 s the range in reynolds number based on mudmat diameter can be calculated using table 1 to be between 6 75 103 and 2 16 104 a non cohesive uniform siliceous sand d 50 0 24 mm ρ s 2650 k g m 3 θ c r 0 041 was adopted as the model sand bed for the circular foundation piles modelled this choice of sediment size ensures that d 2 d 50 the pile size to sediment size ratio is in the range 104 333 for these values meville and chiew 1999 suggest that scour depth will not be limited by sediment coarseness hence the present experimental results are likely to give conservative estimates of scour depth the scour depth at the upstream side of the mudmat was recorded with a video camera located outside the flume and focused on the upstream side of the scour hole the camera was placed about 20 cm above the seabed 20 cm upstream of the scour hole and near to the edge of the flume using the camera a coloured vertical grid taped to the periphery of the model could be read to determine the scour depth with an accuracy of 2 mm the width of the grid lines the three dimensional scour hole profile was also measured with an xbox 360 kinect 3 d infra red scanner at the end of each test the maximum scanning area measuring 1 m width 2 m length with a vertical accuracy of 2 mm each experiment was run for at least 30 h and continued until there was at least 3 6 h in which no change in scour depth was detected later in section 3 2 a mathematical expression is fitted to the measured scour time history in each experiment see equation 1 in cases where the equilibrium scour depth was not reached in an experiment the fitted equilibrium scour depth is an approximation as opposed to a direct observation this approximation will be reliable provided that the experiments were run close to equilibrium and the scour time history is self similar and well approximated by the fitted mathematical expression each of these requirements appear to be true for the present experiments see results shown in section 3 fig 6 3 test result 3 1 scour regimes in the present experiments two main phenomena or scour modes were observed across the full range of experiments listed in table 1 these phenomena are illustrated respectively for two example experiments mdt21 and mdt28 in fig 3 for mdt21 left hand side of fig 3 scour was observed to occur initially on the upstream side of the mudmat at locations one eighth of a perimeter 45 around from the front of the mudmat the scour hole then propagated almost immediately to the front of the mudmat these observations of scour development are reasonably consistent with well known observations for scour around piles e g melville 1975 sumer and fredsøe 2002 roulund et al 2005 and indicate that the amplified bed shear stresses upstream of the pile were capable of mobilising sediment beyond the perimeter of the mudmat in contrast to mdt21 it can be seen that for mdt28 right hand side of fig 3 scour first initiated on the lee side of the mudmat and gradually propagated around to the upstream side following this a small localised horseshoe vortex could be observed during the experiments visualised by suspended sediment grains in front of the mudmat this vortex contributed to significant local scour on the front side of the mudmat as demonstrated in fig 3 i j the observations of scour propagating from the back to the front of the mudmat is consistent with that described by melville and raudkivi 1996 zarrati et al 2006 and umeda et al 2010 for surface piercing piles unlike for mdt21 in mdt28 it is apparent that the mudmat extends sufficiently far upstream of the structure to stop initiation of local scour upstream of the pile however without upstream sediment replenishment in the clear water scour regime continuous scour at the lee side of the mudmat stimulates progressively sediment transport at locations around the mudmat perimeter this eventually results in scour propagation to the upstream side of the mudmat for a similar arrangement involving a foundation flush with the initial bed level umeda et al 2010 reported that during the initial stages of scour significant sediment transport was observed at the lee side of the foundation this corresponded to sweeping trapping and ejection of sediment from the depressions created in the lee wake at the same time the sediment transport rate at the upstream side of the foundation is negligible with increasing time the flow accelerated by the contraction of the main flow around the pier starts to sweep the sediment along the rim of the foundation following this the depressions formed at the shoulders of the foundation 45 gradually enlarge leading to scour hole development at the upstream edge of the foundation fig 4 summarises the occurrence of the different phenomena or modes of scour across the experimental parameter space i e whether scour occurred initially at the front of the pile labelled front scour or mode 1 or scour occurred initially at the lee side of the pile before propagating to the upstream side labelled back front scour or mode 2 this figure also presents an approximate line separating the two modes several observations can be drawn from fig 4 firstly for superstructure aspect ratios h 1 d 1 3 it can be seen that scour does not initiate immediately at the upstream side of the mudmat if d 2 d 1 is sufficiently large greater than 2 this implies that when the mudmat diameter is sufficiently large relative to the superstructure amplified shear stresses capable of mobilising sediment do not extend upstream beyond the mudmat secondly it is evident that for small superstructure aspect ratio h 1 d 1 3 the relative mudmat diameter d 2 d 1 required to initially suppress upstream scour reduces this is likely to be because the region and magnitude of amplified shear stress upstream of the cylinder reduces with reductions in aspect ratio qualitatively the shape of the transition line separating the two scour modes in fig 4 agrees reasonably well with that observed in the upstream extent of the horseshoe vortex as a function of cylinder aspect ratio reported by e g baker 1978 and umeda et al 2005 in both these works the extent of the horseshoe vortex can be estimated in terms of the distance to the upstream location where the boundary layer flow separates from the bed x s and this provides an indication of the region of amplified bed shear stress resulting due to the horseshoe vortex which must be smaller than x s quantitatively based on the cross over in behaviour from mode 1 to mode 2 the data in fig 4 suggests that for aspect ratios h 1 d 1 3 the region of shear stress amplification extends between 0 85 d 1 and 1 1 d 1 from the centre of the superstructure this distance is very similar to that observed in the shear stress contour plots of umeda et al 2005 although it should be noted that the boundary layer thickness in the present experiments is larger than that simulated by umeda et al 2005 based on these qualitative and quantitative comparisons to the literature a conceptual drawing of the two different modes of scour is presented in fig 5 in the present experiments only two regimes were observed however for very large values of d 2 d 1 it is possible that the mudmat may suppress lee wake scour in this situation a third clear water regime may result for low flow intensity clear water conditions i e for velocities below that considered here this would be a no scour regime alternatively for a flow intensity close to unity it is possible that scour may occur in this regime due to a perturbation in the seabed level and or due to the change in surface roughness across the mudmat sand interface 3 2 scour time history the scour time history at the front side of the mudmat was found to be closely related to the scour development regimes as indicated in fig 6 within the front scour regime d 2 d 1 2 2 the scour develops immediately at the front edge whilst in the back front scour regime d 2 d 1 2 2 there is an initial delay denoted by t i herein differences also exist in the rate of scour and the final equilibrium or maximum scour depth accounting for the non scouring period t i the scour time histories in fig 6 may be reasonably fitted with the following hyperbolic equation 1 s t s 0 t t i t t i t 0 where s t is the scour depth at time t measured at the upstream side of the cylinder s 0 is the apparent equilibrium scour depth and t 0 is the time scale of scour an advantage of fitting equation 1 to the experimental time series is that the evaluation of the parameters s 0 t 0 and t i enables the features of the scour time history to be quantitatively compared across the experimental parameter space i e for different superstructure aspect ratios and relative mudmat diameters for example to determine if the non dimensional scour depth at the mudmat increases with increasing d 2 d 1 or if it takes a longer time to attain the equilibrium state i e larger t 0 with increasing d 2 d 1 these questions are explored in the following subsections 3 3 time delay and time scale as demonstrated in fig 6 the time history of the local scour development process at the upstream side of the mudmat is delayed by a time t i in the back front scour regime fig 7 summarises this time delay for the experiments in which back front scour was observed in these figures the time delay has been normalised according to 2 t i g s 1 d 50 3 0 5 d 1 2 t i where t i is the non dimensional time delay d 1 is the diameter of the superstructure s is the specific gravity of the sand and d 50 is the median grain size of the sand this normalisation follows from that proposed by sumer and fredsøe 2002 and accounts for the relative size of the structure and the rate of sediment transport it can be seen in fig 7 that for a given relative mudmat diameter d 2 d 1 the time delay decreases with increasing aspect ratio h 1 d 1 this is consistent with the expectation that with increasing aspect ratio the flow structure at the downstream side of the mudmat will be enhanced leading to larger sediment transportation capacity and a faster transition of the scour hole to the upstream side of the mudmat fig 7 also indicates that for a fixed aspect ratio h 1 d 1 the time delay increases with d 2 d 1 this is owing to the fact that for a given aspect ratio of the superstructure increases in relative mudmat diameter shield larger regions of high shear stress amplification thus reducing the sediment transport capacity at the downstream perimeter of the mudmat this leads to a slower transition from downstream to upstream and a longer delay time once scour initiates at the front of the mudmat either directly or via back front scour the time scale t 0 describes how fast the scour develops to explore this parameter fig 8 summarises the fitted time scale for each of the experiments in this figure the time scale has been made non dimensional according to sumer and fredsøe 2002 3 t d 1 g s 1 d 50 3 0 5 d 1 2 t 0 where t 0 is the time scale and t d 1 is the non dimensional time scale normalised by the diameter of the superstructure fig 8 indicates that for a given mudmat diameter the time scale decreases with increases in aspect ratio h 1 d 1 before levelling off when h 1 d 1 3 4 this levelling off is consistent with that observed for submerged piles without a mudmat observed by yao et al 2018 and the observations from baker 1978 that the horseshoe vortex strengthens with increasing aspect ratio until h 1 d 1 3 at which point limited further strengthening and presumably limited further increases in bed shear stress to drive scour are observed 3 4 equilibrium scour depth the effect of the superstructure aspect ratio h 1 d 1 on the equilibrium scour depth is examined in fig 9 for a range of mudmat diameters the test results indicate that for a given superstructure aspect ratio i e given h 1 d 1 the non dimensional equilibrium scour depth scaled on the superstructure diameter d 1 increases as the mudmat gets larger hence although the mudmat was found to delay or reduce the rate of scour in section 3 2 it actually augments the final maximum scour depth this occurs because for a large relative mudmat diameter once scour is initiated at the front directly or via back front sdscour the scour hole is governed by the diameter of the mudmat rather than the diameter of the superstructure fig 9 also indicates that at a fixed d 2 d 1 the non dimensional equilibrium scour depth increases with aspect ratio until h 1 d 1 4 at which point the relative scour depth levels off as noted in section 3 3 this levelling off is consistent with that observed for submerged piles without a mudmat reported by yao et al 2018 and the observations from baker 1978 that the horseshoe vortex strengthens with increasing aspect ratio until h 1 d 1 3 at which point limited further strengthening and presumably limited further increases in bed shear stress to drive the scour process are observed an interesting aspect of fig 9 is that in the limit h 1 d 1 0 the equilibrium scour depth remains finite this is because even when the influence of the superstructure vanishes i e the overall structure just resembles a mudmat flush with the seabed surface any small undulations in the bed eventually trigger scour i e in the clear water conditions tested scour was unstable to small imperfections in the seabed or disturbance induced by the surface roughness difference between the mudmat and sand surface once an imperfection caused some scour at the mudmat after any length of time scour may then progress to a repeatable depth of 0 5 d 2 several experiments were undertaken in the present experimental program to observe initiation of scour for these cases in the end it was decided to run the experiment with an initial undulation introduced in the seabed for case mdt13 specifically a 6 mm groove was manually created in front of the mudmat to decrease the test duration and ensure repeatable results in terms of the time scale and total test duration the results in fig 9 have been replotted in fig 10 as a function of the relative mudmat diameter here it can be seen clearly that the non dimensional scour depth s 0 d 1 increases as the mudmat diameter increases before limiting in theory towards the linear dashed line representative of s 0 0 5 d 2 i e s 0 d 1 0 5 d 2 d 1 when d 2 d 1 1 in contrast to s 0 d 1 the non dimensional equilibrium scour depth s 0 d 2 decreases as the relative mudmat diameter increases this is owing to the fact that the contribution of the superstructure to the scour hole development is diminishing as the mudmat gets larger thus for sufficiently large d 2 d 1 the contribution of the superstructure is negligible and the scour depth limits to s 0 0 5 d 2 which is linearly proportional to the diameter of the mudmat 3 5 scour hole profile the effect of aspect ratio on the scour hole profile is examined in fig 11 for a fixed relative mudmat diameter d 2 d 1 2 2 the non dimensional depth z d 1 of the scour hole at the front of the mudmat can be seen to increase with h 1 d 1 i e the non dimensional depth of the scour hole increases from 1 1 to 2 7 with h 1 d 1 increasing from 0 to 10 in addition the horizontal dimensions of the scour hole also increase with the increase of aspect ratio i e the lateral width of the scour hole increased from 8 d 1 to 14 d 1 as h 1 d 1 increases from 0 to 10 downstream of the structure there is also a substantial increase in scour with aspect ratio i e as the superstructure becomes relatively taller lee wake scouring is more evident collectively these findings indicate that a given mudmat diameter is likely to be much more effective at limiting local scour for a squat superstructure i e small h 1 d 1 the effect of d 2 d 1 on the scour hole profile is examined in fig 12 with the h 1 d 1 ratio fixed at 3 it can be seen in this set of figures that increasing the mudmat diameter actually results in a larger overall scour hole and depth for example the maximum non dimensional depth of the scour hole increases from 1 5 to 2 3 with d 2 d 1 increasing from 1 to 3 the lateral width of the scour hole increases from 8 d 1 to 13 d 1 over this range 4 discussion a series of experiments have been analysed in the present paper to quantify the effect of a skirted mudmat on the local scour around a submerged pile it has been shown that the mudmat influences the mode of scour as well as the scour depth and the rate of scour from a practical perspective it is important to be able to predict these effects to work towards this prediction fig 13 compares measurements of the maximum equilibrium scour depth to the scour depth which would be predicted for a uniform submerged cylinder having a diameter equal to d 2 and an effective height given by 4 h e m h 1 d 1 d 2 in this equation m 1 is adopted in the present study for simplicity which implies h e h 1 is equal to the diameter ratio d 1 d 2 equation 4 follows from the idea of an equivalent height foundation introduced by parola et al 1996 the symbols in fig 13 represent the measured scour depth for each of the experiments plotted against the effective aspect ratio h e d 2 whilst the dashed line represents the scour depth observed for uniform submerged piles as a function of aspect ratio given by 5 s 0 d 1 17 1 exp h d 0 5 for θ θ c r 0 98 and is a best fit to the uniform cylinder data from experiments mdt1 to mdt13 the good agreement between the measurements and the dashed line in fig 13 implies that the scour depth may be predicted reasonably well for the combined mudmat and superstructure by first computing the effective aspect ratio and then computing the scour depth from equation 5 with h d h e d 2 h 1 d 1 d 2 2 the root mean square error between the measurements and equation 5 in fig 13 is 0 16 to explore the time scale in a similar way fig 14 presents the computed non dimensional time scale t d 2 t d 1 d 1 2 d 2 2 for each of the experiments valid for θ θ c r 0 98 plotted against the effective aspect ratio h e d 2 together with the time scale observed for uniform submerged piles given by taken again from a best fit to uniform cylinder experiments mdt1 to mdt13 6 t 161 156 h d 0 025 h d 0 009 for θ θ c r 0 98 again the agreement between the experiments and the prediction are reasonably good this implies that time scale may be predicted reasonably well for the combined mudmat and superstructure by first computing the effective aspect ratio and then computing the time scale from equation 6 again with h d h e d 2 each of these observations concerning the prediction of scour depth and time scale imply that the combined mudmat and superstructure both influence the scour process because of how they influence the overall aspect ratio of the subsea structure this is consistent with the observations by yao et al 2018 for submerged compound cylinders and is fundamentally different to the assumption that the scour depth due to both structural components separately may be simply added to give an estimate of the total scour depth to demonstrate this fig 15 and fig 16 deconstruct the scour profile to extract the contribution from the superstructure alone for two example experiments in both cases this contribution is compared with the scour profile observed for the superstructure in isolation i e without a mudmat the clear differences in the scour profiles emphasise the non linearity of the scour process the experiments presented in this paper were simplified in various ways for practicality for example the experiments have only considered circular and concentric geometries it is likely that the scour depth will vary if the superstructure is not placed concentrically on top of the mudmat see for example yao et al 2018 and if the cylinders are not cylindrical however it is likely that the concept of an equivalent uniform pile will still be useful for non circular geometries although future verification is required the present paper also considered clear water conditions at a flow intensity just below the onset of live bed conditions this was selected to generate a relatively large scour hole depth following the finding of yao et al 2018 that there is a local maximum in scour depth at this flow intensity for submerged piles further work is required to determine if the effects of a mudmat are similar in live bed conditions it is anticipated that a large mudmat would be more effective in live bed conditions because as shown in yao et al 2018 for a sandy seabed the equilibrium scour depth tends to zero as the overall aspect ratio of a submerged pile tends to zero 5 conclusions a series of experiments have been reported which aim to quantify the contribution of a skirted mudmat to scour mitigation for convenience the experiments considered a simplified structure in the clear water regime the following conclusions have been formed based on the present study 1 two local scour development modes at the mudmat foundation were identified across the range of aspect ratios h 1 d 1 and relative mudmat diameters d 2 d 1 tested these include a front scour regime and a back front scour regime the occurrence of each mode has been mapped within the parameter space spanned by h 1 d 1 and d 2 d 1 this indicates that the back front sscour regime is more likely for small superstructure aspect ratio and relatively large mudmat diameter since the mudmat is able to initially suppress the initiation of scour at the upstream side of the structure 2 the scour time history at the upstream edge of the mudmat is closely related to the scour development regime this time development can be represented reasonably well by a hyperbolic function equation 1 incorporating a non zero time delay for the back front scour regime 3 the non dimensional time scale of the local scour process was evaluated with a combination of a time delay t i and a time scale t 0 it was found that the time delay and time scale both increase with increasing relative mudmat diameter i e the mudmat helps to slow the scour process the scour rate is slowest for a given mudmat diameter when the aspect ratio of the superstructure is small 4 the equilibrium scour depth is largest at the upstream side of the mudmat at this location it is shown that the relative scour depth of the superstructure s 0 d 1 increases as the mudmat becomes relatively larger i e as d 2 d 1 increases fig 10 this is because scour of the mudmat begins to dominate the overall scour depth in contrast the equilibrium scour depth s 0 d 2 reduces in magnitude as d 2 d 1 increases by an amount which depends on h 1 d 1 since the contribution of the superstructure to the scour process reduces see the results in table 1 for example for a fixed relative mudmat diameter the non dimensional equilibrium scour depth increases with aspect ratio h 1 d 1 but levels off when h 1 d 1 3 4 5 the quantitative trends in scour depth and the scour time scale can be well predicted for the superstructure and mudmat in combination by considering a uniform submerged pile having the same diameter as the mudmat and an equivalent height which preserves the combined frontal area credit authorship contribution statement weidong yao conceptualization conceptualizsation methodology formal analysis writing original draft preparation scott draper

21315,in this paper local scour around a subsea structure supported by a skirted mudmat foundation is explored experimentally for simplicity the structure is represented as a submerged circular cylinder founded on a concentric circular mudmat the experiments are conducted in the clear water regime and various geometries are considered by varying the height of the submerged cylinder relative to its diameter h 1 d 1 and the diameter of the mudmat relative to the submerged cylinder d 2 d 1 the experimental results indicate that the scour process can be categorized into two modes depending on geometry mode 1 in which local scour develops immediately at the upstream side of the mudmat and mode 2 in which local scour initiates at the downstream side of the mudmat and propagates upstream for each mode the rate of scour reduces as the mudmat becomes relatively large i e as d 2 d 1 increases this reduction is most significant if the mudmat size is sufficient to swap the mode of scour from mode 1 to mode 2 the reduction in scour rate however does not coincide with a reduction in maximum scour depth instead the relative scour depth of the superstructure s d 1 increases as the mudmat becomes larger i e as d 2 d 1 increases this trend is quantitatively explained by considering the effective aspect ratio of the combined mudmat and superstructure collectively the results of the present study provide insight into the inherent scour protection provided by a skirted mudmat foundation keywords scour foundation mudmat cylinder 1 introduction in offshore oil and gas developments skirted mudmat foundations are commonly used to support subsea structures e g subsea wells pipeline manifolds and pipeline connection structures randolph and gourvenec 2011 the primary reason to use skirted mudmat foundations is to provide geotechnical support both in terms of avoiding bearing failure sliding and overturning as well as to control settlements however it is often assumed that a mudmat foundation also provides an additional advantage in that it helps to mitigate scour especially when the mudmat extends some distance out from the perimeter of the superstructure it is supporting this is because local scour at a vertical column truncated or surface piercing is known to occur primarily due to the development of a horseshoe vortex at the base of the structure in combination with streamline contraction around the structure whitehouse 1998 sumer and fredsøe 2002 the mudmat shields the sediment local to the structure potentially mitigating scour whilst some previous research has investigated scour patterns around non uniform structures melville and raudkivi 1996 umeda et al 2010 whitehouse et al 2011 harris et al 2016 tavouktsoglou et al 2017 baghbadorani et al 2018 yao et al 2018 a systematic investigation into the scour protection provided by the mudmat has not yet been undertaken to the authors knowledge this is despite the fact that extensive studies have focused on mitigation of local scour at pile foundations including bed armouring countermeasures such as rock riprap chiew and lim 2000 dey and rajkumar 2007 lauchlan and melville 2001 petersen 2014 and flow altering devices such as submerged vanes odgaard and wang 1987 fins gupta and gangadharaiah 1992 slots chiew 1992 kumar et al 1999 and collars ettema 1980 dey 1997 zarrati et al 2006 alabi 2006 the primary aim of this paper is therefore to report on a systematic set of experiments to assess the benefits of mudmat foundations from a scour perspective for simplicity the subsea structure is modelled in this paper as a truncated cylinder and the mudmat is modelled as a circular cylinder buried flush with the initial surface of the seabed so that the exposure height of the mudmat is small or zero compared with the height of the submerged cylinder it is supporting and the skirt is very deep as in fig 1 for this simplified scenario two dimensionless parameters define the geometry i the ratio of mudmat to superstructure diameter d 2 d 1 and ii the aspect ratio of the superstructure h 1 d 1 a relatively wide parameter space is explored in terms of these non dimensional parameters for each case the key features relating to the scour process are explored e g the equilibrium scour depth the time scale and the scour hole geometry previous research has been undertaken on structures similar to that in fig 1 but only for h 1 d 1 1 i e surface piercing piles for this scenario and large d 2 d 1 ratios specifically d 2 d 1 2 7 and 8 1 melville and raudkivi 1996 reported that a shallow scour hole was quickly established downstream of the structure after sufficient time this scour hole then propagated upstream around the edges of the structure and subsequently developed quickly into a conventionally shaped hole ahead of the footing similar observations were also reported by zarrati et al 2006 and umeda et al 2010 collectively these results imply that there is a transition in the scour regime depending on the diameter ratio of the foundation and the superstructure which is likely to be influenced also by the aspect ratio of the superstructure h 1 d 1 to date this transition is not well defined in literature better definition of this transition is a second motivation of the present investigation this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the test setup section 3 presents the test results and some discussion and conclusions are given in section 4 and section 5 respectively 2 test setup the tests were conducted in a flume facility at the university of western australia the length width and height of the flume measures 13 2 m 0 4 m and 0 6 m respectively in the present tests the water depth was set to 0 26 m which is sufficiently large that flow depth and boundary effects should not influence the scour test results sumer and fredsøe 2002 a sand pit 0 5 m in depth and 1 1 m in length was located in the middle of the flume approximately 6 m downstream from the flow inlet see fig 2 the time average velocity was measured at 50 mm above the sand bed using a nortek vectrino ii acoustic doppler velocimeter adv and this was used to determine the bed shear stress in the same way as that outlined in yao et al 2018 the sampling frequency was 25 hz and the duration of the measurement was 5 min longer durations provided the same mean value the experiments were undertaken in the clear water regime with a steady current flow intensity corresponding to θ θ c r 0 98 where the shields parameter is θ 0 04 and the critical shields parameter of the sediment described further below is θ c r 0 041 the velocity profile was logarithmic near to the bed and increased in magnitude with distance further from the bed the depth average velocity corresponding to the shields parameter used in the experiments was 0 27 m s the choice to adopt this flow intensity was based on the results in yao et al 2018 scour depths are relatively large at flow intensities close to unity in total 31 experiments are reported in this paper as detailed in table 1 these experiments consider structures with h 1 d 1 ranging from 0 to 10 and d 2 d 1 varying from 1 to 3 these ranges are comparable with actual subsea structures based on the measured velocity of 0 27 m s and taking the viscosity of the water in the lab to be 1 0 10 6 m2 s the range in reynolds number based on mudmat diameter can be calculated using table 1 to be between 6 75 103 and 2 16 104 a non cohesive uniform siliceous sand d 50 0 24 mm ρ s 2650 k g m 3 θ c r 0 041 was adopted as the model sand bed for the circular foundation piles modelled this choice of sediment size ensures that d 2 d 50 the pile size to sediment size ratio is in the range 104 333 for these values meville and chiew 1999 suggest that scour depth will not be limited by sediment coarseness hence the present experimental results are likely to give conservative estimates of scour depth the scour depth at the upstream side of the mudmat was recorded with a video camera located outside the flume and focused on the upstream side of the scour hole the camera was placed about 20 cm above the seabed 20 cm upstream of the scour hole and near to the edge of the flume using the camera a coloured vertical grid taped to the periphery of the model could be read to determine the scour depth with an accuracy of 2 mm the width of the grid lines the three dimensional scour hole profile was also measured with an xbox 360 kinect 3 d infra red scanner at the end of each test the maximum scanning area measuring 1 m width 2 m length with a vertical accuracy of 2 mm each experiment was run for at least 30 h and continued until there was at least 3 6 h in which no change in scour depth was detected later in section 3 2 a mathematical expression is fitted to the measured scour time history in each experiment see equation 1 in cases where the equilibrium scour depth was not reached in an experiment the fitted equilibrium scour depth is an approximation as opposed to a direct observation this approximation will be reliable provided that the experiments were run close to equilibrium and the scour time history is self similar and well approximated by the fitted mathematical expression each of these requirements appear to be true for the present experiments see results shown in section 3 fig 6 3 test result 3 1 scour regimes in the present experiments two main phenomena or scour modes were observed across the full range of experiments listed in table 1 these phenomena are illustrated respectively for two example experiments mdt21 and mdt28 in fig 3 for mdt21 left hand side of fig 3 scour was observed to occur initially on the upstream side of the mudmat at locations one eighth of a perimeter 45 around from the front of the mudmat the scour hole then propagated almost immediately to the front of the mudmat these observations of scour development are reasonably consistent with well known observations for scour around piles e g melville 1975 sumer and fredsøe 2002 roulund et al 2005 and indicate that the amplified bed shear stresses upstream of the pile were capable of mobilising sediment beyond the perimeter of the mudmat in contrast to mdt21 it can be seen that for mdt28 right hand side of fig 3 scour first initiated on the lee side of the mudmat and gradually propagated around to the upstream side following this a small localised horseshoe vortex could be observed during the experiments visualised by suspended sediment grains in front of the mudmat this vortex contributed to significant local scour on the front side of the mudmat as demonstrated in fig 3 i j the observations of scour propagating from the back to the front of the mudmat is consistent with that described by melville and raudkivi 1996 zarrati et al 2006 and umeda et al 2010 for surface piercing piles unlike for mdt21 in mdt28 it is apparent that the mudmat extends sufficiently far upstream of the structure to stop initiation of local scour upstream of the pile however without upstream sediment replenishment in the clear water scour regime continuous scour at the lee side of the mudmat stimulates progressively sediment transport at locations around the mudmat perimeter this eventually results in scour propagation to the upstream side of the mudmat for a similar arrangement involving a foundation flush with the initial bed level umeda et al 2010 reported that during the initial stages of scour significant sediment transport was observed at the lee side of the foundation this corresponded to sweeping trapping and ejection of sediment from the depressions created in the lee wake at the same time the sediment transport rate at the upstream side of the foundation is negligible with increasing time the flow accelerated by the contraction of the main flow around the pier starts to sweep the sediment along the rim of the foundation following this the depressions formed at the shoulders of the foundation 45 gradually enlarge leading to scour hole development at the upstream edge of the foundation fig 4 summarises the occurrence of the different phenomena or modes of scour across the experimental parameter space i e whether scour occurred initially at the front of the pile labelled front scour or mode 1 or scour occurred initially at the lee side of the pile before propagating to the upstream side labelled back front scour or mode 2 this figure also presents an approximate line separating the two modes several observations can be drawn from fig 4 firstly for superstructure aspect ratios h 1 d 1 3 it can be seen that scour does not initiate immediately at the upstream side of the mudmat if d 2 d 1 is sufficiently large greater than 2 this implies that when the mudmat diameter is sufficiently large relative to the superstructure amplified shear stresses capable of mobilising sediment do not extend upstream beyond the mudmat secondly it is evident that for small superstructure aspect ratio h 1 d 1 3 the relative mudmat diameter d 2 d 1 required to initially suppress upstream scour reduces this is likely to be because the region and magnitude of amplified shear stress upstream of the cylinder reduces with reductions in aspect ratio qualitatively the shape of the transition line separating the two scour modes in fig 4 agrees reasonably well with that observed in the upstream extent of the horseshoe vortex as a function of cylinder aspect ratio reported by e g baker 1978 and umeda et al 2005 in both these works the extent of the horseshoe vortex can be estimated in terms of the distance to the upstream location where the boundary layer flow separates from the bed x s and this provides an indication of the region of amplified bed shear stress resulting due to the horseshoe vortex which must be smaller than x s quantitatively based on the cross over in behaviour from mode 1 to mode 2 the data in fig 4 suggests that for aspect ratios h 1 d 1 3 the region of shear stress amplification extends between 0 85 d 1 and 1 1 d 1 from the centre of the superstructure this distance is very similar to that observed in the shear stress contour plots of umeda et al 2005 although it should be noted that the boundary layer thickness in the present experiments is larger than that simulated by umeda et al 2005 based on these qualitative and quantitative comparisons to the literature a conceptual drawing of the two different modes of scour is presented in fig 5 in the present experiments only two regimes were observed however for very large values of d 2 d 1 it is possible that the mudmat may suppress lee wake scour in this situation a third clear water regime may result for low flow intensity clear water conditions i e for velocities below that considered here this would be a no scour regime alternatively for a flow intensity close to unity it is possible that scour may occur in this regime due to a perturbation in the seabed level and or due to the change in surface roughness across the mudmat sand interface 3 2 scour time history the scour time history at the front side of the mudmat was found to be closely related to the scour development regimes as indicated in fig 6 within the front scour regime d 2 d 1 2 2 the scour develops immediately at the front edge whilst in the back front scour regime d 2 d 1 2 2 there is an initial delay denoted by t i herein differences also exist in the rate of scour and the final equilibrium or maximum scour depth accounting for the non scouring period t i the scour time histories in fig 6 may be reasonably fitted with the following hyperbolic equation 1 s t s 0 t t i t t i t 0 where s t is the scour depth at time t measured at the upstream side of the cylinder s 0 is the apparent equilibrium scour depth and t 0 is the time scale of scour an advantage of fitting equation 1 to the experimental time series is that the evaluation of the parameters s 0 t 0 and t i enables the features of the scour time history to be quantitatively compared across the experimental parameter space i e for different superstructure aspect ratios and relative mudmat diameters for example to determine if the non dimensional scour depth at the mudmat increases with increasing d 2 d 1 or if it takes a longer time to attain the equilibrium state i e larger t 0 with increasing d 2 d 1 these questions are explored in the following subsections 3 3 time delay and time scale as demonstrated in fig 6 the time history of the local scour development process at the upstream side of the mudmat is delayed by a time t i in the back front scour regime fig 7 summarises this time delay for the experiments in which back front scour was observed in these figures the time delay has been normalised according to 2 t i g s 1 d 50 3 0 5 d 1 2 t i where t i is the non dimensional time delay d 1 is the diameter of the superstructure s is the specific gravity of the sand and d 50 is the median grain size of the sand this normalisation follows from that proposed by sumer and fredsøe 2002 and accounts for the relative size of the structure and the rate of sediment transport it can be seen in fig 7 that for a given relative mudmat diameter d 2 d 1 the time delay decreases with increasing aspect ratio h 1 d 1 this is consistent with the expectation that with increasing aspect ratio the flow structure at the downstream side of the mudmat will be enhanced leading to larger sediment transportation capacity and a faster transition of the scour hole to the upstream side of the mudmat fig 7 also indicates that for a fixed aspect ratio h 1 d 1 the time delay increases with d 2 d 1 this is owing to the fact that for a given aspect ratio of the superstructure increases in relative mudmat diameter shield larger regions of high shear stress amplification thus reducing the sediment transport capacity at the downstream perimeter of the mudmat this leads to a slower transition from downstream to upstream and a longer delay time once scour initiates at the front of the mudmat either directly or via back front scour the time scale t 0 describes how fast the scour develops to explore this parameter fig 8 summarises the fitted time scale for each of the experiments in this figure the time scale has been made non dimensional according to sumer and fredsøe 2002 3 t d 1 g s 1 d 50 3 0 5 d 1 2 t 0 where t 0 is the time scale and t d 1 is the non dimensional time scale normalised by the diameter of the superstructure fig 8 indicates that for a given mudmat diameter the time scale decreases with increases in aspect ratio h 1 d 1 before levelling off when h 1 d 1 3 4 this levelling off is consistent with that observed for submerged piles without a mudmat observed by yao et al 2018 and the observations from baker 1978 that the horseshoe vortex strengthens with increasing aspect ratio until h 1 d 1 3 at which point limited further strengthening and presumably limited further increases in bed shear stress to drive scour are observed 3 4 equilibrium scour depth the effect of the superstructure aspect ratio h 1 d 1 on the equilibrium scour depth is examined in fig 9 for a range of mudmat diameters the test results indicate that for a given superstructure aspect ratio i e given h 1 d 1 the non dimensional equilibrium scour depth scaled on the superstructure diameter d 1 increases as the mudmat gets larger hence although the mudmat was found to delay or reduce the rate of scour in section 3 2 it actually augments the final maximum scour depth this occurs because for a large relative mudmat diameter once scour is initiated at the front directly or via back front sdscour the scour hole is governed by the diameter of the mudmat rather than the diameter of the superstructure fig 9 also indicates that at a fixed d 2 d 1 the non dimensional equilibrium scour depth increases with aspect ratio until h 1 d 1 4 at which point the relative scour depth levels off as noted in section 3 3 this levelling off is consistent with that observed for submerged piles without a mudmat reported by yao et al 2018 and the observations from baker 1978 that the horseshoe vortex strengthens with increasing aspect ratio until h 1 d 1 3 at which point limited further strengthening and presumably limited further increases in bed shear stress to drive the scour process are observed an interesting aspect of fig 9 is that in the limit h 1 d 1 0 the equilibrium scour depth remains finite this is because even when the influence of the superstructure vanishes i e the overall structure just resembles a mudmat flush with the seabed surface any small undulations in the bed eventually trigger scour i e in the clear water conditions tested scour was unstable to small imperfections in the seabed or disturbance induced by the surface roughness difference between the mudmat and sand surface once an imperfection caused some scour at the mudmat after any length of time scour may then progress to a repeatable depth of 0 5 d 2 several experiments were undertaken in the present experimental program to observe initiation of scour for these cases in the end it was decided to run the experiment with an initial undulation introduced in the seabed for case mdt13 specifically a 6 mm groove was manually created in front of the mudmat to decrease the test duration and ensure repeatable results in terms of the time scale and total test duration the results in fig 9 have been replotted in fig 10 as a function of the relative mudmat diameter here it can be seen clearly that the non dimensional scour depth s 0 d 1 increases as the mudmat diameter increases before limiting in theory towards the linear dashed line representative of s 0 0 5 d 2 i e s 0 d 1 0 5 d 2 d 1 when d 2 d 1 1 in contrast to s 0 d 1 the non dimensional equilibrium scour depth s 0 d 2 decreases as the relative mudmat diameter increases this is owing to the fact that the contribution of the superstructure to the scour hole development is diminishing as the mudmat gets larger thus for sufficiently large d 2 d 1 the contribution of the superstructure is negligible and the scour depth limits to s 0 0 5 d 2 which is linearly proportional to the diameter of the mudmat 3 5 scour hole profile the effect of aspect ratio on the scour hole profile is examined in fig 11 for a fixed relative mudmat diameter d 2 d 1 2 2 the non dimensional depth z d 1 of the scour hole at the front of the mudmat can be seen to increase with h 1 d 1 i e the non dimensional depth of the scour hole increases from 1 1 to 2 7 with h 1 d 1 increasing from 0 to 10 in addition the horizontal dimensions of the scour hole also increase with the increase of aspect ratio i e the lateral width of the scour hole increased from 8 d 1 to 14 d 1 as h 1 d 1 increases from 0 to 10 downstream of the structure there is also a substantial increase in scour with aspect ratio i e as the superstructure becomes relatively taller lee wake scouring is more evident collectively these findings indicate that a given mudmat diameter is likely to be much more effective at limiting local scour for a squat superstructure i e small h 1 d 1 the effect of d 2 d 1 on the scour hole profile is examined in fig 12 with the h 1 d 1 ratio fixed at 3 it can be seen in this set of figures that increasing the mudmat diameter actually results in a larger overall scour hole and depth for example the maximum non dimensional depth of the scour hole increases from 1 5 to 2 3 with d 2 d 1 increasing from 1 to 3 the lateral width of the scour hole increases from 8 d 1 to 13 d 1 over this range 4 discussion a series of experiments have been analysed in the present paper to quantify the effect of a skirted mudmat on the local scour around a submerged pile it has been shown that the mudmat influences the mode of scour as well as the scour depth and the rate of scour from a practical perspective it is important to be able to predict these effects to work towards this prediction fig 13 compares measurements of the maximum equilibrium scour depth to the scour depth which would be predicted for a uniform submerged cylinder having a diameter equal to d 2 and an effective height given by 4 h e m h 1 d 1 d 2 in this equation m 1 is adopted in the present study for simplicity which implies h e h 1 is equal to the diameter ratio d 1 d 2 equation 4 follows from the idea of an equivalent height foundation introduced by parola et al 1996 the symbols in fig 13 represent the measured scour depth for each of the experiments plotted against the effective aspect ratio h e d 2 whilst the dashed line represents the scour depth observed for uniform submerged piles as a function of aspect ratio given by 5 s 0 d 1 17 1 exp h d 0 5 for θ θ c r 0 98 and is a best fit to the uniform cylinder data from experiments mdt1 to mdt13 the good agreement between the measurements and the dashed line in fig 13 implies that the scour depth may be predicted reasonably well for the combined mudmat and superstructure by first computing the effective aspect ratio and then computing the scour depth from equation 5 with h d h e d 2 h 1 d 1 d 2 2 the root mean square error between the measurements and equation 5 in fig 13 is 0 16 to explore the time scale in a similar way fig 14 presents the computed non dimensional time scale t d 2 t d 1 d 1 2 d 2 2 for each of the experiments valid for θ θ c r 0 98 plotted against the effective aspect ratio h e d 2 together with the time scale observed for uniform submerged piles given by taken again from a best fit to uniform cylinder experiments mdt1 to mdt13 6 t 161 156 h d 0 025 h d 0 009 for θ θ c r 0 98 again the agreement between the experiments and the prediction are reasonably good this implies that time scale may be predicted reasonably well for the combined mudmat and superstructure by first computing the effective aspect ratio and then computing the time scale from equation 6 again with h d h e d 2 each of these observations concerning the prediction of scour depth and time scale imply that the combined mudmat and superstructure both influence the scour process because of how they influence the overall aspect ratio of the subsea structure this is consistent with the observations by yao et al 2018 for submerged compound cylinders and is fundamentally different to the assumption that the scour depth due to both structural components separately may be simply added to give an estimate of the total scour depth to demonstrate this fig 15 and fig 16 deconstruct the scour profile to extract the contribution from the superstructure alone for two example experiments in both cases this contribution is compared with the scour profile observed for the superstructure in isolation i e without a mudmat the clear differences in the scour profiles emphasise the non linearity of the scour process the experiments presented in this paper were simplified in various ways for practicality for example the experiments have only considered circular and concentric geometries it is likely that the scour depth will vary if the superstructure is not placed concentrically on top of the mudmat see for example yao et al 2018 and if the cylinders are not cylindrical however it is likely that the concept of an equivalent uniform pile will still be useful for non circular geometries although future verification is required the present paper also considered clear water conditions at a flow intensity just below the onset of live bed conditions this was selected to generate a relatively large scour hole depth following the finding of yao et al 2018 that there is a local maximum in scour depth at this flow intensity for submerged piles further work is required to determine if the effects of a mudmat are similar in live bed conditions it is anticipated that a large mudmat would be more effective in live bed conditions because as shown in yao et al 2018 for a sandy seabed the equilibrium scour depth tends to zero as the overall aspect ratio of a submerged pile tends to zero 5 conclusions a series of experiments have been reported which aim to quantify the contribution of a skirted mudmat to scour mitigation for convenience the experiments considered a simplified structure in the clear water regime the following conclusions have been formed based on the present study 1 two local scour development modes at the mudmat foundation were identified across the range of aspect ratios h 1 d 1 and relative mudmat diameters d 2 d 1 tested these include a front scour regime and a back front scour regime the occurrence of each mode has been mapped within the parameter space spanned by h 1 d 1 and d 2 d 1 this indicates that the back front sscour regime is more likely for small superstructure aspect ratio and relatively large mudmat diameter since the mudmat is able to initially suppress the initiation of scour at the upstream side of the structure 2 the scour time history at the upstream edge of the mudmat is closely related to the scour development regime this time development can be represented reasonably well by a hyperbolic function equation 1 incorporating a non zero time delay for the back front scour regime 3 the non dimensional time scale of the local scour process was evaluated with a combination of a time delay t i and a time scale t 0 it was found that the time delay and time scale both increase with increasing relative mudmat diameter i e the mudmat helps to slow the scour process the scour rate is slowest for a given mudmat diameter when the aspect ratio of the superstructure is small 4 the equilibrium scour depth is largest at the upstream side of the mudmat at this location it is shown that the relative scour depth of the superstructure s 0 d 1 increases as the mudmat becomes relatively larger i e as d 2 d 1 increases fig 10 this is because scour of the mudmat begins to dominate the overall scour depth in contrast the equilibrium scour depth s 0 d 2 reduces in magnitude as d 2 d 1 increases by an amount which depends on h 1 d 1 since the contribution of the superstructure to the scour process reduces see the results in table 1 for example for a fixed relative mudmat diameter the non dimensional equilibrium scour depth increases with aspect ratio h 1 d 1 but levels off when h 1 d 1 3 4 5 the quantitative trends in scour depth and the scour time scale can be well predicted for the superstructure and mudmat in combination by considering a uniform submerged pile having the same diameter as the mudmat and an equivalent height which preserves the combined frontal area credit authorship contribution statement weidong yao conceptualization conceptualizsation methodology formal analysis writing original draft preparation scott draper

21316,vertical cylinders are widely used as supporting structures in ocean engineering applications shock waves due to underwater explosives undex can cause serious damage to offshore structures which has attracted the interest of many researchers the propagation characteristics of shock waves produced by undex across a cylinder are a complex physical phenomenon that involves fluid structure dynamic interactions for the shock wave produced by undex the total pressure on a cylinder consists of three parts including the incident shock wave pressure scattered wave pressure and radiation pressure due to the motion of the cylinder this paper develops an improved method for obtaining the transient response of a vertical circular cylinder subjected to undex first an empirical formula of the shock wave pressure for far field undex is adopted as the incident shock wave based on the continued fraction cf expansion of the frequency domain dynamic stiffness coefficient an accurate model in the time domain for solving the scattered wave pressures on a cylinder is further developed then the added mass model is used to replace the fluid structure interaction caused by radiation wave finally the vibration equation of a euler bernoulli beam is utilized to evaluate the transient response of the cylinder subjected to undex keywords continued fraction scattered wave substructure method vertical cylinder underwater explosive 1 introduction with the development of offshore areas and the exploration of the ocean an increasing number of offshore and coastal structures such as drilling platforms bridges high pile wharfs and other engineering structures are being constructed in water under the present international political situation these structures may become strike targets in terrorist activities or wars due to their political influence and potential effect on economic activity yi et al 2014a offshore structures may encounter underwater explosions caused by accidental explosions or terrorist explosions the shock wave produced by an underwater explosion may cause serious damage to engineering structures hung et al 2009 gauch et al 2018 yang et al 2019a vertical cylinders are usually used to support drilling platforms bridges wharfs and other offshore structures it should be noted that the analyses and designs of structures against low rate dynamic loadings such as earthquakes wind and ocean waves cannot be directly used in the designs of offshore structures subjected to blast loads hao et al 2016 to prevent bridges and wharfs from collapsing it is necessary to investigate the dynamic responses of vertical cylinders subjected to underwater explosions the present work is intended to present a substructure method for evaluating the dynamic response of a vertical cylinder subjected to a noncontact underwater explosion many researchers have already investigated the damage models of supporting cylinders for bridges under blast loading in air yuan et al 2017 liu et al 2018 m li et al 2019 based on an experimental test williams and williamson 2011 investigated the response and failure models of reinforced concrete rc cylinders under blast loading in air the results indicated that the primary response mode was base shear when the explosive was close to the ground a numerical model was established by yi et al 2014b to simulate blast loading on bridge components where both the diffraction and reflection of the blast loading were simulated based on the numerical model six main types of failure models of rc piers were identified liu et al 2018 compared with blast loads in air the dynamic responses and damage modes of cylinders caused by underwater explosions are more complex due to the multi physics nature of underwater explosions yang et al 2019b the interaction of fluid with structures during underwater explosions has been a concern for many years cole 1948 swisdak 1978 most of the research findings on underwater explosions are focused on ship engineering liang et al 2000 liang and tai 2006 zhang et al 2019 while few investigations concentrate on vertical cylinders zhuang et al 2020 designed scaled down experiment models to investigate the dynamic response and damage model of circular rc columns subjected to near field underwater explosions where three damage models including bending shear failure bending failure and punching failure were identified yan et al 2019 provided the safety distance for an rc pile subjected to underwater explosion shock loading by performing a numerical investigation numerical methods have been widely used to investigate various underwater explosion processes on assemblies such as steel plates zhang et al 2017 arch dams zhang et al 2018 multilayer structures meng et al 2019 and reinforced concrete slabs hai and ren 2020 numerical methods can effectively simulate the process of explosion shock waves and explosion bubbles in underwater explosions however these numerical methods usually require a large computational capacity the substructure method is a preferable method to analyse the interaction of a cylinder structure with water wang et al 2018b 2018c which considers the cylinder water system as composed of two substructures namely the cylinder and the water this technique avoids directly analysing the large water structure system this study aims to present an efficient substructure model in the time domain for simulating water cylinder dynamic interactions during undex according to the studies conducted by amirabadi and ghazangian 2018 the total wave pressures on a cylinder subjected to underwater explosions can be decomposed into an incident wave a scattered wave due to the incident wave and a radiation wave due to the motion of the cylinder the incident wave is generated by an underwater explosion the scattered wave is caused by the shock wave impact on the cylinder while the radiation wave is generated due to the cylinder vibrating in water the empirical formula of the incident wave pressures for far field undex was given by cole 1948 and zamyshlyaev 1973 according to the empirical formula an accurate and efficient model in the time domain for solving the scattered wave pressures on a vertical cylinder caused by far field undex is developed in addition the added mass model wang et al 2019b is used to replace the water cylinder interaction when the cylinder vibrates in water subjected to undex based on these solutions the dynamic response of a cylinder subjected to undex is investigated by using a euler bernoulli beam 2 mathematical formulation and solutions a vertical cylinder surrounded by water is shown in fig 1 which extends from the water bottom to above the surface along the z axis the axis line of the cylinder coincides with the z axis the height of the cylinder and the water depth are h the foundation is assumed to be rigid and the explosive charge is located at position a whose coordinate is x 0 y 0 z 0 in the cartesian coordinate system position a is assumed to be far from the water surface it can be seen that the position of the explosive charge can have substantial effects on the transient response of the cylinder especially for a slender cylinder the results also indicate that the destructive potency decreases when the explosive charge explodes near the water surface which is mainly due to the effective destructive radius of its charge being reduced the system is initially stationary a detailed description of the shock wave pressure of far field undex and the solutions of scattered waves and radiation waves based on linear wave theory wang et al 2019b are provided herein 2 1 incident wave pressure of far field undex the time history of the shock wave at a fixed position in the far field during undex starts with a sharp rise in pressure and is followed by a quick decay for far field undex the empirical formula of the shock wave pressure at a fixed location given by cole 1948 and zamyshlyaev 1973 can be expressed as 1 p i r t p m e t t 0 ϑ where p m is the peak pressure of the shock wave at the shock front pa r is the distance between the explosive centre and measuring point m t denotes the time s t 0 denotes the propagation time from the explosive to the measuring point s and ϑ denotes the time decay constant s it should be noted that the incident wave pressure at the measuring point is p i r t 0 when t t 0 empirical eq 1 has been widely used to predict the main characteristics of the shock wave generated by underwater explosions for trinitrotoluene tnt the peak pressure p m and time decay constant ϑ are 2 p m k 1 w 1 3 r α 1 3 ϑ k 2 w 1 3 w 1 3 r α 2 where w denotes the mass of the explosive kg and k 1 k 2 α 1 and α 2 are the shock parameters of the explosive for tnt the shock parameters are as follows k 1 52 16 mpa α 1 1 13 k 2 96 5 10 6 and α 2 0 22 in the cylindrical coordinate system the distance between the explosive centre and measuring point can be expressed as 4 r r r cos θ x 0 2 r sin θ y 0 2 z z 0 2 then the propagation time from the explosive to the measuring point can be expressed as 5 t 0 r cos θ x 0 2 r sin θ y 0 2 z z 0 2 c where c denotes the speed of sound waves in water m s 2 2 solution for a scattered shock wave the water is assumed to be compressible and inviscid amirabadi and ghazangian 2018 in a cylindrical coordinate system the scattered wave pressure in the frequency domain p s satisfies the following governing equation and boundary conditions 6 2 p s r 2 1 r p s r 1 r 2 2 p s θ 2 2 p

shock wave pressures on the surface of the cylinder p s can be obtained the fe equation shown in eq 52 is solved using the standard implicit time integration algorithm proposed by newmark 1959 which will be presented in section 3 2 4 solution for the radiation wave the shock wave can cause the vibration of the flexible cylinder it is well known that water cylinder interaction produces radiation wave pressure on the cylinder when it vibrates in water han and xu 1996 the radiation wave pressure can be modelled as the product of a hypothetical added mass and the acceleration of the structure liaw and chopra 1974 assuming a rigid cylinder a series of simplified formulas of the added mass for circular elliptical and rectangular cylinders are proposed wang et al 2018a 2019a however the studies conducted by han and xu 1996 and wang et al 2019b indicated that the added mass due to the flexible motion of the cylinder is smaller than that due to the rigid motion of the cylinder therefore the simplified formula of the added mass proposed by wang et al 2019b to simulate a flexible cylinder vibrating in water is adopted in the study which can be expressed as 58 m 1 ρ w π a 2 c m 0 6 e 0 93 l 0 403 e 0 156 l 59 c m 0 433 e 2 922 l 0 537 e 0 0391 l where l 2 a h and ρ w is the density of water 2 5 transient response of the elastic cylinder subjected to undex the euler bernoulli beam model is used for the elastic cylinder in the present study the mass per unit length of the cylinder is given by m ρ s π a 2 where ρ s denotes the density of the cylinder the explosive charge is assumed at position x 0 0 z 0 according to eqs 1 52 and 58 the differential equation of the cylinder subjected to shock waves can be expressed as follows 60 e i 4 u x z 4 c u x m u x m 1 u x f x z where e is the elastic modulus i is the area moment of inertia c is the damping of the cylinder and f x denotes the hydrodynamic force on the cylinder along the x axis caused by incident and scattered wave pressures which can be obtained as 61 f x 0 2 π p i a θ z t p s a θ z t a cos θ d θ the mode superposition method is adopted to solve eq 60 it is assumed that the cylinder can only be distorted in the first n mode shapes of vibration the elastic displacement of the cylinder can be written as 62 u x i 1 n φ i z q i t where φ i z are the mode shapes and q i t are the generalized coordinates the solution for φ i z is given in the following form wang et al 2019b 63 φ i z sin χ i z sinh χ i z sinh χ i h sin χ i h cosh χ i h cos χ i h cosh χ i z cos χ i z where χ i can be obtained by the following equation 64 1 cos χ i h cosh χ i h 0 furthermore the natural vibration frequencies of the cylinder ω i are expressed as 65 ω i χ i 4 e i m m 1 based on the assumption of rayleigh damping and using mode shape orthogonality liaw and chopra 1974 the equation of motion of the generalized coordinates q i t can be obtained by substituting eq 62 into eq 60 which is written as 66 m i q i c i q i k i q i f i 67 m i 0 h m m 1 φ i z 2 d z 68 k i ω i 2 m i 69 c i 2 ξ i ω i m i 70 f i 0 h f x φ i z d z where ξ i is the damping ratio applying the newmark 1959 method to eq 66

constant time step 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation the accuracy of the method for scattered wave is verified by an analytical solution given by liaw and chopra 1974 with p s r ρ w u 0 cos θ in eq 55 where u 0 is the dirac delta function described by zhao et al 2011 as shown in fig 2 and fig 3 shows the scattered wave pressures on the surface of cylinder at location a 0 0 it can be seen that the proposed solution has a good agreement with the analytical solution the transient response of the cylinder is verified by autodyn with a 5 m h 20 m x 0 10 z 0 10 and w 50 kg the material parameters including density and elastic modulus are ρ s 2500 kg m3 and e 30 gpa fig 4 shows the time history of displacement at z h figs 5 and 6 shows the maximum displacement and velocity versus z it can be seen that some error between the proposed method and the result obtained by autodyn the reasons for the differences are mainly because that the governing equations of the water and the boundary condition at water surface used in the present method and autodyn are different it should be noted that physical experiments should be conducted to further verify the present method in the future 3 2 transient responses a squatty cylinder with a 5 m and h 20 m and a slender cylinder with a 1 m and h 20 m are adopted in this section the material parameters including density elastic modulus and damping ratio are ρ s 2500 kg m3 e 30 gpa and ξ i 0 05 the effect of radiation wave produced by the motion of cylinder on the transient responses of the cylinder subjected to shock wave is firstly investigated where x 0 10 z 0 10 and w 100 kg for the squatty cylinder and x 0 6 z 0 10 and w 100 kg for the slender cylinder fig 7 shows the time history of displacement at z h with radiation wave included and neglected it can be seen that the radiation wave can decrease the transient response of the cylinder induced by the shock wave and the fundamental frequency of the cylinder the effect of the position of the explosive centre on the transient responses of the cylinder is furtherly investigated where w 100 kg fig 8 shows the time history of displacement at z h with different x 0 and z 0 it can be seen that the position of the explosive charge can have significant effects on the transient response of the cylinder especially for the slender cylinder fig 9 shows the displacement versus z at different t where x 0 10 and z 0 10 for the squatty cylinder and x 0 6 and z 0 10 for the slender cylinder it can be seen that the deformation mode of the cylinder gradually changes from shear deformation to bending deformation where the shear deformation occurs at shock wave stage and the bending deformation mainly occurs at free vibration stage it also can be seen that the shear deformation is more significant for the slender cylinder the effect of the mass of explosive charge is finally investigated where x 0 10 and z 0 5 for the squatty cylinder and x 0 6 and z 0 10 for the slender cylinder fig 10 shows the time history of displacement at z h with different w fig 11 shows the displacement versus z at different t it can be seen that the transient response of the cylinder increases as the mass of explosive increasing it also can be obtained that the shear deformation at shock wave stage significantly increases as the mass of explosive increasing 4 conclusions based on the empirical formula of the shock wave pressure for far field underwater explosive this paper presents a substructure method for transient response of vertical cylinder subjected to underwater explosion an empirical formula of the shock wave pressure for far field undex is used to simulate the incident shock wave then an accurate and efficient model in time domain is presented to solve the scattered wave pressures on a cylinder caused by far field undex and the added mass model is used to replace the fluid structure interaction caused by radiation waves the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the present numerical model for solving the scattered wave pressure on the cylinder cis accurate and efficient the proposed substructure method provides an efficient tool for evaluating the transient response and damage of vertical cylinders subjected to underwater explosives 2 the position of the explosive charge can have substantial effects on the transient response of the cylinder especially for the slender cylinder the transient response of the cylinder and the shear deformation at shock wave stage significantly increases as the mass of explosive increasing 3 the radiation wave can decrease the transient response of the cylinder induced by the shock wave and the fundamental frequency of the cylinder and it has greater effect on the slender cylinder it should be noted that the reflection of waves due to the foundation and the effect of water the surface are not considered in the present study usually the bubble load of underwater explosion has a great influence on the low frequency structure otherwise the results may be quite different from the actual results the proposed method will be improved to consider the interaction of shock waves with the foundation and water surface and study the effect of bubbles on the structure in the future credit authorship contribution statement piguang wang methodology writing original draft preparation

21316,vertical cylinders are widely used as supporting structures in ocean engineering applications shock waves due to underwater explosives undex can cause serious damage to offshore structures which has attracted the interest of many researchers the propagation characteristics of shock waves produced by undex across a cylinder are a complex physical phenomenon that involves fluid structure dynamic interactions for the shock wave produced by undex the total pressure on a cylinder consists of three parts including the incident shock wave pressure scattered wave pressure and radiation pressure due to the motion of the cylinder this paper develops an improved method for obtaining the transient response of a vertical circular cylinder subjected to undex first an empirical formula of the shock wave pressure for far field undex is adopted as the incident shock wave based on the continued fraction cf expansion of the frequency domain dynamic stiffness coefficient an accurate model in the time domain for solving the scattered wave pressures on a cylinder is further developed then the added mass model is used to replace the fluid structure interaction caused by radiation wave finally the vibration equation of a euler bernoulli beam is utilized to evaluate the transient response of the cylinder subjected to undex keywords continued fraction scattered wave substructure method vertical cylinder underwater explosive 1 introduction with the development of offshore areas and the exploration of the ocean an increasing number of offshore and coastal structures such as drilling platforms bridges high pile wharfs and other engineering structures are being constructed in water under the present international political situation these structures may become strike targets in terrorist activities or wars due to their political influence and potential effect on economic activity yi et al 2014a offshore structures may encounter underwater explosions caused by accidental explosions or terrorist explosions the shock wave produced by an underwater explosion may cause serious damage to engineering structures hung et al 2009 gauch et al 2018 yang et al 2019a vertical cylinders are usually used to support drilling platforms bridges wharfs and other offshore structures it should be noted that the analyses and designs of structures against low rate dynamic loadings such as earthquakes wind and ocean waves cannot be directly used in the designs of offshore structures subjected to blast loads hao et al 2016 to prevent bridges and wharfs from collapsing it is necessary to investigate the dynamic responses of vertical cylinders subjected to underwater explosions the present work is intended to present a substructure method for evaluating the dynamic response of a vertical cylinder subjected to a noncontact underwater explosion many researchers have already investigated the damage models of supporting cylinders for bridges under blast loading in air yuan et al 2017 liu et al 2018 m li et al 2019 based on an experimental test williams and williamson 2011 investigated the response and failure models of reinforced concrete rc cylinders under blast loading in air the results indicated that the primary response mode was base shear when the explosive was close to the ground a numerical model was established by yi et al 2014b to simulate blast loading on bridge components where both the diffraction and reflection of the blast loading were simulated based on the numerical model six main types of failure models of rc piers were identified liu et al 2018 compared with blast loads in air the dynamic responses and damage modes of cylinders caused by underwater explosions are more complex due to the multi physics nature of underwater explosions yang et al 2019b the interaction of fluid with structures during underwater explosions has been a concern for many years cole 1948 swisdak 1978 most of the research findings on underwater explosions are focused on ship engineering liang et al 2000 liang and tai 2006 zhang et al 2019 while few investigations concentrate on vertical cylinders zhuang et al 2020 designed scaled down experiment models to investigate the dynamic response and damage model of circular rc columns subjected to near field underwater explosions where three damage models including bending shear failure bending failure and punching failure were identified yan et al 2019 provided the safety distance for an rc pile subjected to underwater explosion shock loading by performing a numerical investigation numerical methods have been widely used to investigate various underwater explosion processes on assemblies such as steel plates zhang et al 2017 arch dams zhang et al 2018 multilayer structures meng et al 2019 and reinforced concrete slabs hai and ren 2020 numerical methods can effectively simulate the process of explosion shock waves and explosion bubbles in underwater explosions however these numerical methods usually require a large computational capacity the substructure method is a preferable method to analyse the interaction of a cylinder structure with water wang et al 2018b 2018c which considers the cylinder water system as composed of two substructures namely the cylinder and the water this technique avoids directly analysing the large water structure system this study aims to present an efficient substructure model in the time domain for simulating water cylinder dynamic interactions during undex according to the studies conducted by amirabadi and ghazangian 2018 the total wave pressures on a cylinder subjected to underwater explosions can be decomposed into an incident wave a scattered wave due to the incident wave and a radiation wave due to the motion of the cylinder the incident wave is generated by an underwater explosion the scattered wave is caused by the shock wave impact on the cylinder while the radiation wave is generated due to the cylinder vibrating in water the empirical formula of the incident wave pressures for far field undex was given by cole 1948 and zamyshlyaev 1973 according to the empirical formula an accurate and efficient model in the time domain for solving the scattered wave pressures on a vertical cylinder caused by far field undex is developed in addition the added mass model wang et al 2019b is used to replace the water cylinder interaction when the cylinder vibrates in water subjected to undex based on these solutions the dynamic response of a cylinder subjected to undex is investigated by using a euler bernoulli beam 2 mathematical formulation and solutions a vertical cylinder surrounded by water is shown in fig 1 which extends from the water bottom to above the surface along the z axis the axis line of the cylinder coincides with the z axis the height of the cylinder and the water depth are h the foundation is assumed to be rigid and the explosive charge is located at position a whose coordinate is x 0 y 0 z 0 in the cartesian coordinate system position a is assumed to be far from the water surface it can be seen that the position of the explosive charge can have substantial effects on the transient response of the cylinder especially for a slender cylinder the results also indicate that the destructive potency decreases when the explosive charge explodes near the water surface which is mainly due to the effective destructive radius of its charge being reduced the system is initially stationary a detailed description of the shock wave pressure of far field undex and the solutions of scattered waves and radiation waves based on linear wave theory wang et al 2019b are provided herein 2 1 incident wave pressure of far field undex the time history of the shock wave at a fixed position in the far field during undex starts with a sharp rise in pressure and is followed by a quick decay for far field undex the empirical formula of the shock wave pressure at a fixed location given by cole 1948 and zamyshlyaev 1973 can be expressed as 1 p i r t p m e t t 0 ϑ where p m is the peak pressure of the shock wave at the shock front pa r is the distance between the explosive centre and measuring point m t denotes the time s t 0 denotes the propagation time from the explosive to the measuring point s and ϑ denotes the time decay constant s it should be noted that the incident wave pressure at the measuring point is p i r t 0 when t t 0 empirical eq 1 has been widely used to predict the main characteristics of the shock wave generated by underwater explosions for trinitrotoluene tnt the peak pressure p m and time decay constant ϑ are 2 p m k 1 w 1 3 r α 1 3 ϑ k 2 w 1 3 w 1 3 r α 2 where w denotes the mass of the explosive kg and k 1 k 2 α 1 and α 2 are the shock parameters of the explosive for tnt the shock parameters are as follows k 1 52 16 mpa α 1 1 13 k 2 96 5 10 6 and α 2 0 22 in the cylindrical coordinate system the distance between the explosive

shock wave pressures on the surface of the cylinder p s can be obtained the fe equation shown in eq 52 is solved using the standard implicit time integration algorithm proposed by newmark 1959 which will be presented in section 3 2 4 solution for the radiation wave the shock wave can cause the vibration of the flexible cylinder it is well known that water cylinder interaction produces radiation wave pressure on the cylinder when it vibrates in water han and xu 1996 the radiation wave pressure can be modelled as the product of a hypothetical added mass and the acceleration of the structure liaw and chopra 1974 assuming a rigid cylinder a series of simplified formulas of the added mass for circular elliptical and rectangular cylinders are proposed wang et al 2018a 2019a however the studies conducted by han and xu 1996 and wang et al 2019b indicated that the added mass due to the flexible motion of the cylinder is smaller than that due to the rigid motion of the cylinder therefore the simplified formula of the added mass proposed by wang et al 2019b to simulate a flexible cylinder vibrating in water is adopted in the study which can be expressed as 58 m 1 ρ w π a 2 c m 0 6 e 0 93 l 0 403 e 0 156 l 59 c m 0 433 e 2 922 l 0 537 e 0 0391 l where l 2 a h and ρ w is the density of water 2 5 transient response of the elastic cylinder subjected to undex the euler bernoulli beam model is used for the elastic cylinder in the present study the mass per unit length of the cylinder is given by m ρ s π a 2 where ρ s denotes the density of the cylinder the explosive charge is assumed at position x 0 0 z 0 according to eqs 1 52 and 58 the differential equation of the cylinder subjected to shock waves can be expressed as follows 60 e i 4 u x z 4 c u x m u x m 1 u x f x z where e is the elastic modulus i is the area moment of inertia c is the damping of the cylinder and f x denotes the hydrodynamic force on the cylinder along the x axis caused by incident and scattered wave pressures which can be obtained as 61 f x 0 2 π p i a θ z t p s a θ z t a cos θ d θ the mode superposition method is adopted to solve eq 60 it is assumed that the cylinder can only be distorted in the first n mode shapes of vibration the elastic displacement of the cylinder can be written as 62 u x i 1 n φ i z q i t where φ i z are the mode shapes and q i t are the generalized

obtained by the following equation 64 1 cos χ i h cosh χ i h 0 furthermore the natural vibration frequencies of the cylinder ω i are expressed as 65 ω i χ i 4 e i m m 1 based on the assumption of rayleigh damping and using mode shape orthogonality liaw and chopra 1974 the equation of motion of the generalized coordinates q i t can be obtained by substituting eq 62 into eq 60 which is written as 66 m i q i c i q i k i q i f i 67 m i 0 h m m 1 φ i z 2 d z 68 k i ω i 2 m i 69 c i 2 ξ i ω i m i 70 f i 0 h f x φ i z d z where ξ i is the damping ratio applying the newmark 1959 method to eq 66

constant time step 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation the accuracy of the method for scattered wave is verified by an analytical solution given by liaw and chopra 1974 with p s r ρ w u 0 cos θ in eq 55 where u 0 is the dirac delta function described by zhao et al 2011 as shown in fig 2 and fig 3 shows the scattered wave pressures on the surface of cylinder at location a 0 0 it can be seen that the proposed solution has a good agreement with the analytical solution the transient response of the cylinder is verified by autodyn with a 5 m h 20 m x 0 10 z 0 10 and w 50 kg the material parameters including density and elastic modulus are ρ s 2500 kg m3 and e 30 gpa fig 4 shows the time history of displacement at z h figs 5 and 6 shows the maximum displacement and velocity versus z it can be seen that some error between the proposed method and the result obtained by autodyn the reasons for the differences are mainly because that the governing equations of the water and the boundary condition at water surface used in the present method and autodyn are different it should be noted that physical experiments should be conducted to further verify the present method in the future 3 2 transient responses a squatty cylinder with a 5 m and h 20 m and a slender cylinder with a 1 m and h 20 m are adopted in this section the material parameters including density elastic modulus and damping ratio are ρ s 2500 kg m3 e 30 gpa and ξ i 0 05 the effect of radiation wave produced by the motion of cylinder on the transient responses of the cylinder subjected to shock wave is firstly investigated where x 0 10 z 0 10 and w 100 kg for the squatty cylinder and x 0 6 z 0 10 and w 100 kg for the slender cylinder fig 7 shows the time history of displacement at z h with radiation wave included and neglected it can be seen that the radiation wave can decrease the transient response of the cylinder induced by the shock wave and the fundamental frequency of the cylinder the effect of the position of the explosive centre on the transient responses of the cylinder is furtherly investigated where w 100 kg fig 8 shows the time history of displacement at z h with different x 0 and z 0 it can be seen that the position of the explosive charge can have significant effects on the transient response of the cylinder especially for the slender cylinder fig 9 shows the displacement versus z at different t where x 0 10 and z 0 10 for the squatty cylinder and x 0 6 and z 0 10 for the slender cylinder it can be seen that the deformation mode of the cylinder gradually changes from shear deformation to bending deformation where the shear deformation occurs at shock wave stage and the bending deformation mainly occurs at free vibration stage it also can be seen that the shear deformation is more significant for the slender cylinder the effect of the mass of explosive charge is finally investigated where x 0 10 and z 0 5 for the squatty cylinder and x 0 6 and z 0 10 for the slender cylinder fig 10 shows the time history of displacement at z h with different w fig 11 shows the displacement versus z at different t it can be seen that the transient response of the cylinder increases as the mass of explosive increasing it also can be obtained that the shear deformation at shock wave stage significantly increases as the mass of explosive increasing 4 conclusions based on the empirical formula of the shock wave pressure for far field underwater explosive this paper presents a substructure method for transient response of vertical cylinder subjected to underwater explosion an empirical formula of the shock wave pressure for far field undex is used to simulate the incident shock wave then an accurate and efficient model in time domain is presented to solve the scattered wave pressures on a cylinder caused by far field undex and the added mass model is used to replace the fluid structure interaction caused by radiation waves the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the present numerical model for solving the scattered wave pressure on the cylinder cis accurate and efficient the proposed substructure method provides an efficient tool for evaluating the transient response and damage of vertical cylinders subjected to underwater explosives 2 the position of the explosive charge can have substantial effects on the transient response of the cylinder especially for the slender cylinder the transient response of the cylinder and the shear deformation at shock wave stage significantly increases as the mass of explosive increasing 3 the radiation wave can decrease the transient response of the cylinder induced by the shock wave and the fundamental frequency of the cylinder and it has greater effect on the slender cylinder it should be noted that the reflection of waves due to the foundation and the effect of water the surface are not considered in the present study usually the bubble load of underwater explosion has a great influence on the low frequency structure otherwise the results may be quite different from the actual results the proposed method will be improved to consider the interaction of shock waves with the foundation and water surface and study the effect of bubbles on the structure in the future credit authorship contribution statement piguang wang methodology writing original draft preparation

21317,a novel three dimensional model is proposed to study vortex induced vibration viv problems of top tensioned risers the model is based on the vector form intrinsic finite element vfife method and applicable to the fully coupled cross flow and in line riser viv scenarios the axial time varying dynamics and movement at the top end boundary of risers are also considered in the model by using the vfife method the structure is reduced to a set of particles whose motion satisfies newton s second law and its response is described by the position change of particles in space the fluctuating fluid force acting on the structure induced by vortex shedding is simulated using the classical van der pol wake oscillator equation in order to intuitively describe the time varying top tension of the real structure the real time changes in top tension caused by the array of tensioners simulated by spring is also considered the results of numerical simulation on top tension dominant mode numbers frequencies and amplitudes are compared with the experiment to prove that the vfife method is feasible and effective in predicting the three dimensional vortex induced vibration response keywords vortex induced vibration viv vector form intrinsic finite element vfife wake oscillator top tension 1 introduction a riser is widely used in the process of drilling well completion production and other functions connects the sea floating devices to the subsea wellheads and is one of the key components of marine oil and gas exploitation system with the exploitation of marine resources gradually moving into the deep water field cross flow cf and in line il vortex induced vibration viv becomes a crucial factor affecting the lifetime of risers for the deepwater risers in complex environment the displacement is usually large in this coupled vibration process and the geometric nonlinearity cannot be ignored with the development of computer technology numerical methods have been widely used in solving viv problems there are generally two numerical methods to predict viv of cylinders computational fluid dynamics cfd methods and semi empirical methods the wake oscillator model is one of the semi empirical methods unlike cfd which focuses on the details of the flow around the cylinder the wake oscillator model describes the complex interaction between the fluid and structure through simple mathematical equations so it is easier to understand and requires less computational resources the concept of this kind of phenomenological model was proposed by birkoff and zarantanello 1957 hartlen and curie 1970 was the first to adopt the van der pol oscillator equation to predict viv response in the cf direction then several improvements have been made following this idea in modeling two dimensional 2 d vortex shedding skop and griffin 1973 iwan and blevins 1974 skop and balasubramanian 1997 ogink and metrikine 2010 for the forced terms of the van der pol equation facchinetti et al 2004a evaluated three different types of linear coupling terms showing that a linear inertial coupling term can describe effectively some aspects of viv observed experimentally the analysis and prediction of viv of long slender structures has been paid much attention by researchers in order to describe this three dimensional 3 d viv phenomena a continuously distributed wake oscillator along the structure axis was applied facchinetti et al 2004b based on this model the viv of flexible slender systems were simulated and the results were compared with experiments to prove its feasibility mathelin and de langre 2005 violette 2007 the wake oscillator model has also been used to predict both the il and cf viv responses ge et al 2009 and this idea has gained widespread popularity gu et al 2013 considered the change of mean top tension of long flexible riser and deduced the corresponding analytical solution relatively less attention has been paid to the simulation of the axial dynamic tension of the riser zanganeh and srinil 2016 took the axially varying tension into account when establishing the structural oscillator equation and the response of axial dynamics was also analyzed recently the effect of internal fluid flow and the viscoelastic coefficients were well studied by wang et al 2018 and yang et al 2018 respectively however it should be noted that the movement on the top end of the riser and a change in top tension due to the motion were neglected in the aforementioned literature the global dynamic analysis in the design process requires more accurate modeling of the riser body connection due to the complexity of the riser system and the dynamic characteristics of viv so it is essential to incorporate the top movement of riser into the analysis model much work has been done for the investigation of viv response using wake oscillator model however the previous researches were mostly based on the continuous beam theory with the assumptions of small deformation and small displacement to establish the structure oscillator partial differential equation of motion which are usually solved by traditional finite element method fem and finite difference method fdm for marine risers suffering from strong ocean currents the vibration involves multiple modes and large bending deformation and when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the natural frequency of a riser the lock in phenomenon will occur further amplifying the amplitude the existing analytical frameworks can hardly handle large displacement and deformation of the risers and also ignore the geometric nonlinearity and could result in a large deviation between the calculated value and the actual response in the aspect of studying the riser tension the existing researches mostly used the average tension of the whole riser to describe the change of tension without considering the real time change of tension acting on the top of the riser the present research aims at overcoming such limitations by using a new structural behavior analysis method vector form intrinsic finite element vfife also termed as finite particle method fpm is a new method of structural behavior analysis based on vector mechanics theory and numerical calculations ting et al 2004 it concentrates the mass of the structure on a group of particles whose motion satisfies newton s second law and the behavior change of a structure is described by the position change of all particles the governing equations of the particles motion are a set of ordinary differential equations the whole motion process is divided into a series of path units and the deformations in a path unit are limited to small translations and small rotations the displacement of the element connecting the particles in a path unit includes the pure deformation and the rigid body motion the pure deformation of the element is obtained by the virtual inverse motion and then the internal forces are calculated according to the pure deformation the proposed concepts of point value description path unit and virtual inverse motion make it easier to solve large geometrical deformation large displacement and other nonlinear problems programmatically lien et al 2010 studied the nonlinear response of steel frames subjected to earthquake and fire load based on the new method of vfife wu 2013 used planar triangle elements to analyze shells with multiple nonlinear problems and the results have good reliability and accuracy in recent literature li et al 2018 presented a three dimensional analysis of marine risers with considering hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loadings caused by internal and external fluid and proved that vfife method is applicable in the dynamic analysis of risers in this work the three dimensional viv dynamic response of a top tensioned riser is predicted and analyzed by the vfife method and the riser system is simplified as a collection of particles in the solution of hydrodynamic forces the fluctuating nature of the vortex street in the water depth of each particle is represented by a nonlinear oscillator satisfying the van der pol equation and the linear distribution of fluid forces acting on the elements between adjacent particles is assumed the motion formula is solved by the central differential method of explicit time integration and each time integration step is defined as a path unit the calculation of internal force follows the formula of material mechanics the six internal forces and displacements can be derived directly in every calculation step 2 vfife model description and its solution 2 1 equation of particle motion assuming that the riser is in vertical equilibrium condition under the action of tension and gravity at the initial moment and the tension acting on the top of the riser is applied by a spring with a stiffness of k s the spring is used to replace the real tensioner in the experiment the bottom of the riser is connected to the subsea wellhead through a hinged support and the top is directly connected to the spring the whole structure is divided into a finite number of particles which are connected with each other by beam elements meanwhile the three dimensional coordinates are established with its origin at the bottom of the riser in which the x axis is consistent with the direction of the incoming flow u z axis coincides with the axis of the riser and y is perpendicular to both for the convenience of analysis and solution the elements are divided into the same length and particles and elements are numbered from the bottom to the top the sketch of the vfife model is shown in fig 1 a each particle has three translation degree of freedoms dofs and three rotation dofs corresponding to three concentrated forces and three concentrated moments respectively as shown in fig 1 b the motion equations of particle i at time t can be described as 1 m x i 0 0 0 m y i 0 0 0 m z i d 2 d t 2 x i y i z i p i x p i y p i z j 1 n p j x p j y p j z f j x f j y f j z i 2 i x x i x y i x z i y x i y y i y z i z x i z y i z z i d 2 d t 2 θ i x θ i y θ i z q i x q i y q i z j 1 n q j x q j y q j z m j x m j y m j z i where m i is the sum of mass m i added on the particle i and mass m α contributed from each beam element and assigned to particle i for the riser model in this paper the mass of particle i is only provided by the beam element so the value of m i is equal to zero m i is given by 3 m i m i α 1 n m α i where n is the number of elements connected to particle i in this model a particle is connected with two elements n 2 assuming that the mass of an element is evenly assigned to the particles at both ends m α can be computed from 4 m α l α 0 2 m s m f where m s ρ s a and m f c a ρ f d 2 π 4 normal direction or c a t ρ f d 2 π 4 tangential direction are the structure mass and the added fluid mass per unit length respectively it should be noted that at the initial moment the contribution of the added fluid mass to the mass of particle i is not considered in the calculation process of the tension of any element c a and c a t are the added fluid mass coefficients of the normal direction and tangential direction and their values are taken as 1 0 and 0 zhu 1991 the length of the connected elements at the initial moment are described by l α 0 i i is the mass inertia matrix in the global coordinate system which includes the moment of inertia i m of spatial particle itself and the equivalent moment of inertia i α provided by the connected beam elements and can be defined as 5 i i i m α 1 n i α i where i α ω α t i ˆ α ω α i m 0 ω α is the transformation matrix of principal coordinates and i ˆ α i ˆ 1 0 0 0 i ˆ 2 0 0 0 i ˆ 2 is the inertial matrix of the element node in the principal coordinates the mass of the element is distributed equally to the section of two nodes and the mass moment of inertia of the section around the principal axis are i ˆ 1 i ˆ 2 i ˆ 3 i ˆ 2 0 5 ρ s l α a r 2 2 and i ˆ 3 0 5 ρ s l α a r 3 2 respectively r 2 and r 3 are the rotating radius of the section around the principal axis x i x i y i z i and θ i θ i x θ i y θ i z are the position vectors of particle i described by the global coordinate system the forces acting directly on the particle are represented by matrices p i p i x p i y p i z and q i q i x q i y q i z p i p i x p i y p i z and q i q i x q i y q i z are the equivalent forces provided by the connected beam elements f i f i x f i y f i z and m i m i x m i y m i z are the internal forces acting on particle i the hydrodynamic forces are loaded in ramped loading way and the external forces acting on the riser at the initial time only include top pre tension gravity and buoyancy the tension t is applied directly by the spring to the top particle and its value at time t can be expressed as 6 t t 0 k s δ t o p here t 0 is the initial tension and δ t o p is the vertical displacement of top particle when the riser model is in static state δ t o p 0 t t 0 so the tension of any element e can be expressed as 7 t e t 0 g i e 1 n 1 m i l n ρ f a g n e l 2 n ρ f a g e 1 2 3 n where a π d 2 4 is the cross sectional area d is the riser outer diameter ρ f is the outer fluid density l and n are the initial length of the riser and the total number of elements respectively the buoyancy assignment of the element is the same as that of the mass the tension at other times and spatial locations can be described by the corresponding element axial force according to newton s third law and the internal force of the element the internal force acting on the particle at the initial moment can be calculated 2 2 wake model and hydrodynamic forces the fluctuating nature of the near wake at the location of particles i is described by the classical wake oscillator model q i and p i are non dimensional il and cf wake variables which satisfy the following van der pol equations 8 d 2 q i d t 2 2 ε x ω f i q i 2 1 d q i d t 4 ω f i 2 q i a x d 2 x i d t 2 9 d 2 p i d t 2 ε y ω f i p i 2 1 d p i d t ω f i 2 p i a y d 2 y i d t 2 herein ε x ε y a x and a y are parameters estimated by experiment and the value of them are set as ε x 0 02 ε y 0 04 a x 96 and a y 12 based on wang et al 2018 the vortex shedding angular frequency is given by 10 ω f i 2 π s t u i d in which u i is the current velocity at particle i and s t is the strouhal number for moving cylinders s t is set as 0 2 for all calculations païdoussis et al 2011 for the riser model subjected to uniform current the fluid forces acting on the riser particle i consists of two parts the mean drag force which will cause relatively stable displacement and deformation the other part is the fluctuating lift force and drag force the second part is produced by the vortex shedding which makes the structure vibrate repeatedly in the il and cf direction at a certain frequency all the fluid forces acting on the riser can be expressed by means of vectors parallel to the x or y axis the corresponding forces can be expressed as 11 f i x 1 2 c d m c d ρ d u i 2 12 f i y 1 2 c l ρ d u i 2 where c d m is the mean drag coefficient and c d is the fluctuating drag coefficient c d m is obtained by averaging the drag force coefficients over time and c d is the fluctuating part of it c l denote the vortex induced lift coefficient the vortex induced drag and lift coefficients are correspondingly modeled by 13 c d c d 0 q i 2 c l c l 0 p i 2 where c d 0 c l 0 are the amplitude of the fluctuating drag and lift force coefficient for a stationary cylinder subjected to vortex shedding in this work in order to consider the amplification of the drag coefficient caused by the cross flow motion of the riser simplistically we assume that the amplified drag coefficient c d m is a constant 2 and the amplitude of the fluctuating drag and lift force coefficient are taken as 0 1 and 0 3 respectively in the large range of re facchinetti et al 2004a when the element is small enough the distributed fluid force acting on element e can be approximately expressed as 14 f e x f e x f e 1 x 2 f e y f e y f e 1 y 2 e 1 2 3 n the fluid force acting on the element is equally distributed to the particles connected with two ends of the element so the fluid forces concentrated on particle i is given by 15 p i x l i 2 f i x l i 1 2 f i 1 x l i 2 f i x l i 1 2 f i 1 x p i y l i 2 f i y l i 1 2 f i 1 y l i 2 f i y l i 1 2 f i 1 y i 1 i 2 n i n 1 2 3 path unit and element internal force 2 3 1 path unit in the vfife method the displacement process of any particle i of the model is described by the path units if the start and finish time of analysis are t 0 and t f respectively the whole analysis duration t f t 0 is separated by a set of time points t 0 t 1 t 2 t a t b t f assuming that the time domain is discretized into a set of connected time slices as shown in fig 2 the time period t a t t b is a path unit the position vectors of the particle i at time t a t t b are expressed as x i a x i t x i b respectively the particle displacement follows the law of motion and hooke s law although the total deformation may be large the deformation of a single beam element in a path unit remains small the internal force increment in the period t t a can be computed by the theory of small displacement and small deformation and is only related to the pure deformation of element nodes moreover the reference of internal force and deformation calculation material frame at time t is the element form at time t a including the position of particles geometric parameters internal forces and material properties the form at time t b serves as the material frame of the next path unit 2 3 2 principal coordinates in a path unit t a t t b the element form at time t a is taken as the material frame and the internal force is calculated in the principal coordinates therefore it is necessary to find out the principle direction at each time point the shape of the axis of the flexible elements becomes a curve after loading and the principal direction of each point along the element is different in order to simplify the calculation the positions of the points between two particles are linearly interpolated in this way at any time each element has only one set of principal direction vectors and the internal force of the beam element can be calculated by the theory of flexure for an arbitrary element 1 2 nodes 1 and 2 are connected to particles a and b respectively the main axis direction is known at time t 0 during the whole analysis time t f t 0 the principal direction e 1 a e 2 a e 3 a and e 1 b e 2 b e 3 b between two adjacent time points t a and t b changes through vector rotation as in fig 3 the rotation vector γ b of the element principal axis can be divided into γ b 1 and γ b 2 γ b 1 represents the rotation of cross section around its normal and γ b 2 describes the rotation of the normal of cross section from 1 a 2 a to 1 b 2 b the rotation vectors of element node during t b t a are β 1 b θ a b θ a a β 2 b θ b b θ b a respectively taking node 1 as a reference point for rotation the rotation of the cross section around its normal is the component of the rotation vector of node 1 in the axial direction so γ b 1 can be expressed as γ b 1 β 1 b e 1 a e 1 a where e 1 a x b a x a a x b a x a a is the element direction vector at time t a the rotational angle of the normal of cross section and the direction vector of rotational axis are defined as γ b a sin 1 e 1 a e 1 b e b a e 1 a e 1 b e 1 a e 1 b where e 1 b x b b x a b x b b x a b is the element direction vector at time t b and the vector γ b 2 is calculated as γ b 2 γ b a e b a then the rotation vector of the principal axis is described as γ b γ b 1 γ b 2 η is the rotational displacement vector between e 2 a and e 2 b and according to the geometric relationships it can be expressed as 16 η 1 cos γ b γ b γ b γ b γ b e 2 a γ b γ b e 2 a sin γ b the calculation formula of η can also be written in matrix form 17 η 1 cos γ b a γ 2 a γ sin γ b e 2 a r e 2 a so the rotational vector relationship between principal directions e 2 a and e 2 b is described as 18 e 2 b e 2 a η e 2 a r e 2 a i r e 2 a i a γ sin γ b 1 cos γ b a γ 2 e 2 a r γ e 2 a where r γ is the rotation matrix between two vectors i is an 3 3 identity matrix and a γ is expressed as 19 a γ 0 n γ m γ n γ 0 l γ m γ l γ 0 e γ l γ m γ n γ γ b γ b with the value of e 1 b and e 2 b the third direction vector e 3 b can be given by e 3 b e 1 b e 2 b the above steps calculate the main axis direction at time t b by using the main direction the node position at time t a and the node rotation during the period of t b t a the initial principal direction of an element are e 1 0 e 2 0 e 3 0 and at the starting point of each path unit the rotation vector of one period is used to get the new principal direction of the next time point 2 3 3 virtual reverse motion and internal forces assuming that the node positions x a a x b a θ a a θ b a internal forces f 1 a f 2 a m 1 a m 2 a and material parameters of element 1 2 at time t a and the node positions x a t x b t θ a t θ b t at time t are both known during the period of t t a the node displacement vectors and rotation vectors in global coordinates are expressed as μ 1 t x a t x a a μ 2 t x b t x b a β 1 t θ a t θ a a β 2 t θ b t θ b a in order to calculate deformation and internal force a set of principal coordinates x ˆ y ˆ z ˆ parallel to e 1 a e 2 a e 3 a are defined and ω a e 1 a t e 2 a t e 3 a t t is the transformation matrix of principal coordinates then the node rotation vectors and internal forces at principal coordinates can be expressed as β ˆ j t ω a β j t f ˆ j a ω a f j a m ˆ j a ω a m j a j 1 2 take node 1 as the reference point of inverse motion the reverse rigid body translation vector is μ 1 t and the reverse rigid body rotation is described as γ t β ˆ 11 t e 1 a θ t a e t a where β ˆ 11 t β 1 t e 1 a e 1 t x b t x a t x b t x a t θ t a sin 1 e 1 a e 1 t and e t a e 1 a e 1 t e 1 a e 1 t through the transformation matrix ω a the inverse rigid body rotation at principal coordinates is expressed as 20 γ ˆ t ω a γ t β ˆ 11 t θ ˆ 2 t θ ˆ 3 t after the above mentioned reverse motion the pure deformation of element 1 2 during the interval of t t a can be figured out 21 δ ˆ e t l 12 t l 12 a x b t x a t x b a x a a 22 ϕ ˆ j t ϕ ˆ j 1 t ϕ ˆ j 2 t ϕ ˆ j 3 t β ˆ j t γ ˆ t β ˆ j 1 t β ˆ 11 t β ˆ j 2 t θ ˆ 2 t β ˆ j 3 t θ ˆ 3 t j 1 2 where δ ˆ e t ϕ ˆ j t are the pure deformation and angles respectively according to the theory of flexure the increment of internal forces described by the main coordinates are 23 δ f ˆ 1 δ f ˆ 11 δ f ˆ 12 δ f ˆ 13 e a a δ ˆ e t l 12 a 6 e a i ˆ 3 a ϕ ˆ 13 t ϕ ˆ 23 t l 12 a 2 6 e a i

2 ϕ ˆ 12 t 4 ϕ ˆ 22 t l 12 a e a i ˆ 3 a 2 ϕ ˆ 13 t 4 ϕ ˆ 23 t l 12 a therefore the internal forces of element nodes at time t can be expressed as 27 f ˆ j t f ˆ j a δ f ˆ j m ˆ j t m ˆ j a δ m ˆ j j 1 2 and then by the coordinate transformation and positive rigid body rotation the internal forces at global coordinates are given by 28 f j t r t ω a t f ˆ j t m j t r t ω a t m ˆ j t j 1 2 here the calculation method of rotation vector r t is the same as that of r γ 2 4 numerical solution of the equation of motion the equation of motion and wake oscillator equation are solved by the central differential method of explicit time integration and each time step h in the calculation process is defined as a path unit as initial conditions x i 0 θ i 0 q i 0 p i 0 are set as zero and a random noise with amplitude of order o 10 3 is introduced to q i 0 and p i 0 gu et al 2013 the calculation step includes three cycles fig 4 the first loop is to calculate the value of position variables of step n 1 x i n 1 θ i n 1 in step n the second loop is to calculate the value of wake variables of step n 1 in step n the third loop is that the position values and wake variables of step n 1 are brought into the structural element relationship formula and the fluid force calculation formula respectively and the values of external and internal force of step n 1 are calculated then through force integration the resultant force on a particle is obtained and the position variables of step n 2 are calculated considering the damping effect by fluid the difference equation for numerical calculation can be expressed as 29 x i n 1 2 c 1 x i n c 2 x i n 1 c 1 h 2 f i e x t f i int m i 30 θ i n 1 2 c 1 θ i n c 2 θ i n 1 c 1 h 2 m i e x t m i int i i n 31 q i n 1 a x h 2 f i 1 e x t f i 1

numerical simulation results and discussion in this paper a riser model tested by https www sciencedirect com science article pii s0029801817307552 huarte 2006 is used as a demonstration and validation the experiments were carried out at delft hydraulics in the delta flume which was used as a towing tank the flume used in the experiment was 230 m long and 5 m wide the lower 45 of the riser model was subjected to a uniform current at speeds up to 1 m s and the rest was surrounded by still water when testing the layout and main parameters of the experiment is shown in fig 5 and table 1 respectively other undetermined parameters in the calculation will be set as the typical values as in table 2 3 1 validation of the vfife model predictions with experimental results the experiment was conducted under five different initial tension states and three cases of them were simulated to illustrate the validity of the proposed model in predicting some aspects of viv response the flow speed in the simulation varied from 0 1 m s to 0 9 m s with an increment of 0 1 m s the vibration response as functions of reduced velocity are plotted in figs 6 8 figs 6a and 8a show the comparison between the vfife model and experimental results on the riser top tension the tension predicted by the vfife model is seen to fairly fit the experimental data when the reduced velocity is smaller than 23 however for the higher reduced velocity the experiment data increased faster than simulation both the experiment and the numerical simulation illustrate that the top tension increases significantly as reduced velocity increase and the rate of increase of the top tension also increase for different initial tension states the degree of top tension variation decreases with the increase of the initial tension when the initial tensions are 1922n 1538n and 1175n the maximum values of top tension variation obtained by simulation in the range of reduced velocity recorded are 131n 238n and 274n respectively accounting for 7 15 and 23 of the original tension therefore the influence of top tension variation cannot be ignored in the analysis of dynamic response figs 6b and 8b and figs 6e and 8e show the maximum displacement in cf and il directions varying with the reduced velocity it is noted that the maximum amplitudes without mean predicted by vfife model are smaller than the experimental values especially when the initial tension is 1175n this discrepancy may be due to the difference between the values of the empirical parameters used in the fluid force calculation and the actual value in addition the effect of damping error is also one of the possible reasons non dimensional il and cf dominant frequency are presented in figs 6d and 8d except for some data points the predicted results by vfife model are in good agreement with the experiment data the dominant frequency of the il vibration is approximately twice as large as the frequency of the cf vibration as can be seen in figs 6d and 8d moreover it can be found that the non dimensional dominant frequency fluctuates up and down along a straight line parallel to the coordinate axis which indicates that the vibration frequency of the riser increases linearly with the reduced velocity figs 6c and 8c show the changes of dominated mode numbers with reduced velocity in the present simulation and in the experimental test conducted by https www sciencedirect com science article pii s0029801817307552 huarte 2006 when the reduced velocity is within the range of 23 40 the il dominant mode numbers predicted by the vfife model are higher than the experiment results and have a maximum difference of two modes the prediction of the cf mode numbers is much better and the maximum discrepancy is only one mode number for both experiment and simulation the dominant mode numbers in the cf direction is about one half of that in the il direction thus the vfife model is able to effectively describe the dominant modes of vortex induced vibration with good accuracy 3 2 further analysis of numerical simulation results fig 9 shows the non dimensional response of riser vibration of different initial tension and velocity conditions simulated by vfife model inspecting fig 9 a the first column shows the displacement of the riser in the il direction without removing the average value it can be observed that at about one third of the riser height the displacement reaches the maximum value this can be explained by the fact that the experiment was conducted in a stepped current and the fluid force only acted on the lower part of the riser gu et al 2013 the vibration shapes without mean in the il and cf directions are given in the second and fourth columns respectively it can be found that the vibration shapes in both cf and il directions generally meet the characteristics of standing waves however from the rms values described in the third and fifth columns there is no pure wave node during vibration this indicates that the riser vibration response simulated by vfife model is actually a combination of standing waves and traveling waves such feature is also observed by ge et al 2009 the above findings are more intuitive in fig 10 which shows the time evolution of displacement of the riser at different positions the first line is the displacement change in the cf direction and the second line is the displacement change in the il direction it is seen that the traveling wave pattern becomes more and more obvious with the increase of flow velocities and the closer to the ends of the riser the more obvious the standing wave is in the middle of the riser the traveling wave has the greatest influence fig 11 shows the non dimensional displacement time histories and corresponding frequency spectrum of riser vibration at different depths z 1 025m 2 255m 4 715m 6 97m 9 02m 11 07m from the first and third columns it can be seen that the vibration of riser changes periodically with time although the amplitude of vibration is different at different locations the frequency remains the same and the vibration frequency along the il direction 6 92hz is about twice as much as the cf direction 3 57hz the above conclusion shows that the influence of il vibration on fatigue life cannot be ignored in the riser design and analysis and may be greater than that of cf direction fig 12 shows 2d trajectories at different depths at t 0 1922 n and u 0 5 m s it is clearly observed that the trajectories of the riser model in the xy plane at different depths are the traditional figure of eight which is also consistent with the experimental observations fig 13 gives the time evolution of the section internal force at every span position in fig 13 a it can be observed that as part of the tension exerted by the top spring counteracts the forces of gravity the tension of element decreases from top to bottom reducing about 200n which accounts for about thirteen percent of the initial tension this characteristic shows that it is necessary to consider the change of the tension along the structure axis in the numerical simulation otherwise the calculation results may have a large deviation from the experimental results the element tension changes periodically with time and the vibration amplitude at both ends of riser is larger than that in the middle of riser from the spectrum of axial force plotted in fig 14 it can be further observed that the variation frequency of element tension is generally composed of two parts one is twice of the cf vibration frequency 7 59hz the other is twice of the il vibration frequency 15 4hz moments around the principal axis y ˆ and z ˆ of the cross section are plotted in fig 13 b and c respectively from fig 13 b 13 c and fig 14 it is evident that the components of the moment around the main axis of the cross section follow a periodic trend and their frequency are consistent with the il and cf dominant response frequency 3 79hz 7 79hz fig 15 shows the evolution of stress with time and space the stress is mainly affected by the axial force of the element and its dominant response frequency is also composed of two parts one is twice of the cf vibration frequency the other is twice of the il vibration frequency 3 3 the top movement and the top tension of the riser as mentioned above a spring is used to simulate the effect of tensioner on the top of riser in the vfife model the influences of spring stiffness on the top movement and top tension are analyzed in further detail below figs 16 and 17 depict the time series and corresponding spectrum of top tension and top displacement of the vfife model with different towing speeds and spring stiffness it is evident that the tension and the displacement follow a periodic trend and the frequencies are close to the riser vibration frequencies in the il direction when the spring stiffness is constant both the mean top tension and the range of tension change increase with the towing speed which is the same as that of the top displacement the main reason is that the increase of flow velocity will lead to the increase of the amplitude of fluid force moreover from figs 16 and 17 it is noted that when the flow velocity remains constant the average value and amplitude of the top displacement both decrease with the spring stiffness and the dominant frequency of the top displacement is not affected by the spring stiffness this is mainly because when the current velocity is constant the fluid force acting on the riser is also constant therefore under the condition of constant current velocity the greater the spring stiffness the stronger the constraint on the top of the riser and the smaller the average value and amplitude of the top displacement the effect of this change on the vibration response of riser model in the il and cf direction can be ignored for the time domain variation of top tension the change rules of the vibration amplitude of top tension and the mean top tension with the spring stiffness are not obvious when the flow velocity remains constant the premise of the above conclusions is that large pretensions are used in the model calculation examples the pretension factor is up to 7 4 to 12 1 in the numerical simulation while it is generally 1 2 to 1 5 in the actual engineering therefore in the actual working condition the change of top displacement and top tension caused by different spring stiffness may have an additional impact on the vibration and deformation of the riser in the future work further analysis about how to choose the equivalent spring stiffness of the tensioner should be made 4 conclusions this paper combines the vector form intrinsic finite element method and wake oscillator model to predict the 3d vortex induced vibration response of vertical risers the feasibility of this method in analyzing vortex induced vibration of long flexible risers is illustrated by comparison with the experiment results different from the traditional method which usually reduces the structure to the euler bernoulli beam model the vfife uses particles to describe the vibration behavior of the structure which makes the analysis of the overall deformation of a riser no longer limited by the small deformation assumption in order to truly reflect the top constraints of a riser spring support is added as a boundary condition using the particle motion formulas to describe the deformation of structure can avoid solving complex nonlinear equations and simplify the process of solving internal forces and deformations in a word a computationally robust three dimensional model accounting for fully coupled cross flow in line and axial viv dynamics is presented and the vfife method provides a new way to deal with geometric nonlinear viv behaviors of risers future research will be focused on the validity of this model in the prediction of viv of

21317,a novel three dimensional model is proposed to study vortex induced vibration viv problems of top tensioned risers the model is based on the vector form intrinsic finite element vfife method and applicable to the fully coupled cross flow and in line riser viv scenarios the axial time varying dynamics and movement at the top end boundary of risers are also considered in the model by using the vfife method the structure is reduced to a set of particles whose motion satisfies newton s second law and its response is described by the position change of particles in space the fluctuating fluid force acting on the structure induced by vortex shedding is simulated using the classical van der pol wake oscillator equation in order to intuitively describe the time varying top tension of the real structure the real time changes in top tension caused by the array of tensioners simulated by spring is also considered the results of numerical simulation on top tension dominant mode numbers frequencies and amplitudes are compared with the experiment to prove that the vfife method is feasible and effective in predicting the three dimensional vortex induced vibration response keywords vortex induced vibration viv vector form intrinsic finite element vfife wake oscillator top tension 1 introduction a riser is widely used in the process of drilling well completion production and other functions connects the sea floating devices to the subsea wellheads and is one of the key components of marine oil and gas exploitation system with the exploitation of marine resources gradually moving into the deep water field cross flow cf and in line il vortex induced vibration viv becomes a crucial factor affecting the lifetime of risers for the deepwater risers in complex environment the displacement is usually large in this coupled vibration process and the geometric nonlinearity cannot be ignored with the development of computer technology numerical methods have been widely used in solving viv problems there are generally two numerical methods to predict viv of cylinders computational fluid dynamics cfd methods and semi empirical methods the wake oscillator model is one of the semi empirical methods unlike cfd which focuses on the details of the flow around the cylinder the wake oscillator model describes the complex interaction between the fluid and structure through simple mathematical equations so it is easier to understand and requires less computational resources the concept of this kind of phenomenological model was proposed by birkoff and zarantanello 1957 hartlen and curie 1970 was the first to adopt the van der pol oscillator equation to predict viv response in the cf direction then several improvements have been made following this idea in modeling two dimensional 2 d vortex shedding skop and griffin 1973 iwan and blevins 1974 skop and balasubramanian 1997 ogink and metrikine 2010 for the forced terms of the van der pol equation facchinetti et al 2004a evaluated three different types of linear coupling terms showing that a linear inertial coupling term can describe effectively some aspects of viv observed experimentally the analysis and prediction of viv of long slender structures has been paid much attention by researchers in order to describe this three dimensional 3 d viv phenomena a continuously distributed wake oscillator along the structure axis was applied facchinetti et al 2004b based on this model the viv of flexible slender systems were simulated and the results were compared with experiments to prove its feasibility mathelin and de langre 2005 violette 2007 the wake oscillator model has also been used to predict both the il and cf viv responses ge et al 2009 and this idea has gained widespread popularity gu et al 2013 considered the change of mean top tension of long flexible riser and deduced the corresponding analytical solution relatively less attention has been paid to the simulation of the axial dynamic tension of the riser zanganeh and srinil 2016 took the axially varying tension into account when establishing the structural oscillator equation and the response of axial dynamics was also analyzed recently the effect of internal fluid flow and the viscoelastic coefficients were well studied by wang et al 2018 and yang et al 2018 respectively however it should be noted that the movement on the top end of the riser and a change in top tension due to the motion were neglected in the aforementioned literature the global dynamic analysis in the design process requires more accurate modeling of the riser body connection due to the complexity of the riser system and the dynamic characteristics of viv so it is essential to incorporate the top movement of riser into the analysis model much work has been done for the investigation of viv response using wake oscillator model however the previous researches were mostly based on the continuous beam theory with the assumptions of small deformation and small displacement to establish the structure oscillator partial differential equation of motion which are usually solved by traditional finite element method fem and finite difference method fdm for marine risers suffering from strong ocean currents the vibration involves multiple modes and large bending deformation and when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the natural frequency of a riser the lock in phenomenon will occur further amplifying the amplitude the existing analytical frameworks can hardly handle large displacement and deformation of the risers and also ignore the geometric nonlinearity and could result in a large deviation between the calculated value and the actual response in the aspect of studying the riser tension the existing researches mostly used the average tension of the whole riser to describe the change of tension without considering the real time change of tension acting on the top of the riser the present research aims at overcoming such limitations by using a new structural behavior analysis method vector form intrinsic finite element vfife also termed as finite particle method fpm is a new method of structural behavior analysis based on vector mechanics theory and numerical calculations ting et al 2004 it concentrates the mass of the structure on a group of particles whose motion satisfies newton s second law and the behavior change of a structure is described by the position change of all particles the governing equations of the particles motion are a set of ordinary differential equations the whole motion process is divided into a series of path units and the deformations in a path unit are limited to small translations and small rotations the displacement of the element connecting the particles in a path unit includes the pure deformation and the rigid body motion the pure deformation of the element is obtained by the virtual inverse motion and then the internal forces are calculated according to the pure deformation the proposed concepts of point value description path unit and virtual inverse motion make it easier to solve large geometrical deformation large displacement and other nonlinear problems programmatically lien et al 2010 studied the nonlinear response of steel frames subjected to earthquake and fire load based on the new method of vfife wu 2013 used planar triangle elements to analyze shells with multiple nonlinear problems and the results have good reliability and accuracy in recent literature li et al 2018 presented a three dimensional analysis of marine risers with considering hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loadings caused by internal and external fluid and proved that vfife method is applicable in the dynamic analysis of risers in this work the three dimensional viv dynamic response of a top tensioned riser is predicted and analyzed by the vfife method and the riser system is simplified as a collection of particles in the solution of hydrodynamic forces the fluctuating nature of the vortex street in the water depth of each particle is represented by a nonlinear oscillator satisfying the van der pol equation and the linear distribution of fluid forces acting on the elements between adjacent particles is assumed the motion formula is solved by the central differential method of explicit time integration and each time integration step is defined as a path unit the calculation of internal force follows the formula of material mechanics the six internal forces and displacements can be derived directly in every calculation step 2 vfife model description and its solution 2 1 equation of particle motion assuming that the riser is in vertical equilibrium condition under the action of tension and gravity at the initial moment and the tension acting on the top of the riser is applied by a spring with a stiffness of k s the spring is used to replace the real tensioner in the experiment the bottom of the riser is connected to the subsea wellhead through a hinged support and the top is directly connected to the spring the whole structure is divided into a finite number of particles which are connected with each other by beam elements meanwhile the three dimensional coordinates are established with its origin at the bottom of the riser in which the x axis is consistent with the direction of the incoming flow u z axis coincides with the axis of the riser and y is perpendicular to both for the convenience of analysis and solution the elements are divided into the same length and particles and elements are numbered from the bottom to the top the sketch of the vfife model is shown in fig 1 a each particle has three translation degree of freedoms dofs and three rotation dofs corresponding to three concentrated forces and three concentrated moments respectively as shown in fig 1 b the motion equations of particle i at time t can be described as 1 m x i 0 0 0 m y i 0 0 0 m z i d 2 d t 2 x i y i z i p i x p i y p i z j 1 n p j x p j y p j z f j x f j y f j z i 2 i x x i x y i x z i y x i y y i y z i z x i z y i z z i d 2 d t 2 θ i x θ i y θ i z q i x q i y q i z j 1 n q j x q j y q j z m j x m j y m j z i where m i is the sum of mass m i added on the particle i and mass m α contributed from each beam element and assigned to particle i for the riser model in this paper the mass of particle i is only provided by the beam element so the value of m i is equal to zero m i is given by 3 m i m i α 1 n m α i where n is the number of elements connected to particle i in this model a particle is connected with two elements n 2 assuming that the mass of an element is evenly assigned to the particles at both ends m α can be computed from 4 m α l α 0 2 m s m f where m s ρ s a and m f c a ρ f d 2 π 4 normal direction or c a t ρ f d 2 π 4 tangential direction are the structure mass and the added fluid mass per unit length respectively it should be noted that at the initial moment the contribution of the added fluid mass to the mass of particle i is not considered in the calculation process of the tension of any element c a and c a t are the added fluid mass coefficients of the normal direction and tangential direction and their values are taken as 1 0 and 0 zhu 1991 the length of the connected elements at the initial moment are described by l α 0 i i is the mass inertia matrix in the global coordinate system which includes the moment of inertia i m of spatial particle itself and the equivalent moment of inertia i α provided by the connected beam elements and can be defined as 5 i i i m α 1 n i α i where i α ω α t i ˆ α ω α i m 0 ω α is the transformation matrix of principal coordinates and i ˆ α i ˆ 1 0 0 0 i ˆ 2 0 0 0 i ˆ 2 is the inertial matrix of the element node in the principal coordinates the mass of the element is distributed equally to the section of two nodes and the mass moment of inertia of the section around the principal axis are i ˆ 1 i ˆ 2 i ˆ 3 i ˆ 2 0 5 ρ s l α a r 2 2 and i ˆ 3 0 5 ρ s l α a r 3 2 respectively r 2 and r 3 are the rotating radius of the section around the principal axis x i x i y i z i and θ i θ i x θ i y θ i z are the position vectors of particle i described by the global coordinate system the forces acting directly on the particle are represented by matrices p i p i x p i y p i z and q i q i x q i y q i z p i p i x p i y p i z and q i q i x q i y q i z are the equivalent forces provided by the connected beam elements f i f i x f i y f i z and m i m i x m i y m i z are the internal forces acting on particle i the hydrodynamic forces are loaded in ramped loading way and the external forces acting on the riser at the initial time only include top pre tension gravity and buoyancy the tension t is applied directly by the spring to the top particle and its value at time t can be expressed as 6 t t 0 k s δ t o p here t 0 is the initial tension and δ t o p is the vertical displacement of top particle when the riser model is in static state δ t o p 0 t t 0 so the tension of any element e can be expressed as 7 t e t 0 g i e 1 n 1 m i l n ρ f a g n e l 2 n ρ f a g e 1 2 3 n where a π d 2 4 is the cross sectional area d is the riser outer diameter ρ f is the outer fluid density l and n are the initial length of the riser and the total number of elements respectively the buoyancy assignment of the element is the same as that of the mass the tension at other times and spatial locations can be described by the corresponding element axial force according to newton s third law and the internal force of the element the internal force acting on the particle at the initial moment can be calculated 2 2 wake model and hydrodynamic forces the fluctuating nature of the near wake at the location of particles i is described by the classical wake oscillator model q i and p i are non dimensional il and cf wake variables which satisfy the following van der pol equations 8 d 2 q i d t 2 2 ε x ω f i q i 2 1 d q i d t 4 ω f i 2 q i a x d 2 x i d t 2 9 d 2 p i d t 2 ε y ω f i p i 2 1 d p i d t ω f i 2 p i a y d 2 y i d t 2 herein ε x ε y a x and a y are parameters estimated by experiment and the value of them are set as ε x 0 02 ε y 0 04 a x 96 and a y 12 based on wang et al 2018 the vortex shedding angular frequency is given by 10 ω f i 2 π s t u i d in which u i is the current velocity at particle i and s t is the strouhal number for moving cylinders s t is set as 0 2 for all calculations païdoussis et al 2011 for the riser model subjected to uniform current the fluid forces acting on the riser particle i consists of two parts the mean drag force which will cause relatively stable displacement and deformation the other part is the fluctuating lift force and drag force the second part is produced by the vortex shedding which makes the structure vibrate repeatedly in the il and cf direction at a certain frequency all the fluid forces acting on the riser can be expressed by means of vectors parallel to the x or y axis the corresponding forces can be expressed as 11 f i x 1 2 c d m c d ρ d u i 2 12 f i y 1 2 c l ρ d u i 2 where c d m is the mean drag coefficient and c d is the fluctuating drag coefficient c d m is obtained by averaging the drag force coefficients over time and c d is the fluctuating part of it c l denote the vortex induced lift coefficient the vortex induced drag and lift coefficients are correspondingly modeled by 13 c d c d 0 q i 2 c l c l 0 p i 2 where c d 0 c l 0 are the amplitude of the fluctuating drag and lift force coefficient for a stationary cylinder subjected to vortex shedding in this work in order to consider the amplification of the drag coefficient caused by the cross flow motion of the riser simplistically we assume that the amplified drag coefficient c d m is a constant 2 and the amplitude of the fluctuating drag and lift force coefficient are taken as 0 1 and 0 3 respectively in the large range of re facchinetti et al 2004a when the element is small enough the distributed fluid force acting on element e can be approximately expressed as 14 f e x f e x f e 1 x 2 f e y f e y f e 1 y 2 e 1 2 3 n the fluid force acting on the element is equally distributed to the particles connected with two ends of the element so the fluid forces concentrated on particle i is given by 15 p i x l i 2 f i x l i 1 2 f i 1 x l i 2 f i x l i 1 2 f i 1 x p i y l i 2 f i y l i 1 2 f i 1 y l i 2 f i y l i 1 2 f i 1 y i 1 i 2 n i n 1 2 3 path unit and element internal force 2 3 1 path unit in the vfife method the displacement process of any particle i of the model is described by the path units if the start and finish time of analysis are t 0 and t f respectively the whole analysis duration t f t 0 is separated by a set of time points t 0 t 1 t 2 t a t b t f assuming that the time domain is discretized into a set of connected time slices as shown in fig 2 the time period t a t t b is a path unit the position vectors of the particle i at time t a t t b are expressed as x i a x i t x i b respectively the particle displacement follows the law of motion and hooke s law although the total deformation may be large the deformation of a single beam element in a path unit remains small the internal force increment in the period t t a can be computed by the theory of small displacement and small deformation and is only related to the pure deformation of element nodes moreover the reference of internal force and deformation calculation material frame at time t is the element form at time t a including the position of particles geometric parameters internal forces and material properties the form at time t b serves as the material frame of the next path unit 2 3 2 principal coordinates in a path unit t a t t b the element form at time t a is taken as the material frame and the internal force is calculated in the principal coordinates therefore it is necessary to find out the principle direction at each time point the shape of the axis of the flexible elements becomes a curve after loading and the principal direction of each point along the element is different in order to simplify the calculation the positions of the points between two particles are linearly interpolated in this way at any time each element has only one set of principal direction vectors and the internal force of the beam element can be calculated by the theory of flexure for an arbitrary element 1 2 nodes 1 and 2 are connected to particles a and b respectively the main axis direction is known at time t 0 during the whole analysis time t f t 0 the principal direction e 1 a e 2 a e 3 a and e 1 b e 2 b e 3 b between two adjacent time points t a and t b changes through vector rotation as in fig 3 the rotation vector γ b of the element principal axis can be divided into γ b 1 and γ b 2 γ b 1 represents the rotation of cross section around its normal and γ b 2 describes the rotation of the normal of cross section from 1 a 2 a to 1 b 2 b the rotation vectors of element node during t b t a are β 1 b θ a b θ a a β 2 b θ b b θ b a respectively taking node 1 as a reference point for rotation the rotation of the cross section around its normal is the component of the rotation vector of node 1 in the axial direction so γ b 1 can be expressed as γ b 1 β 1 b e 1 a e 1 a where e 1 a x b a x a a x b a x a a is the element direction vector at time t a the rotational angle of the normal of cross section and the direction vector of rotational axis are defined as γ b a sin 1 e 1 a e 1 b e b a e 1 a e 1 b e 1 a e 1 b where e 1 b x b b x a b x b b x a b is the element direction vector at time t b and the vector γ b 2 is calculated as γ b 2 γ b a e b a then the rotation vector of the principal axis is described as γ b γ b 1 γ b 2 η is the rotational displacement vector between e 2 a and e 2 b and according to the geometric relationships it can be expressed as 16 η 1 cos γ b γ b γ b γ b γ b e 2 a γ b γ b e 2 a sin γ b the calculation formula of η can also be written in matrix form 17 η 1 cos γ b a γ 2 a γ sin γ b e 2 a r e 2 a so the rotational vector relationship between principal directions e 2 a and e 2 b is described as 18 e 2 b e 2 a η e 2 a r e 2 a i r e 2 a i a γ sin γ b 1 cos γ b a γ 2 e 2 a r γ e 2 a where r γ is the rotation matrix between two vectors i is an 3 3 identity matrix and a γ is expressed as 19 a γ 0 n γ m γ n γ 0 l γ m γ l γ 0 e γ l γ m γ n γ γ b γ b with the value of e 1 b and e 2 b the third direction vector e 3 b can be given by e 3 b e 1 b e 2 b the above steps calculate the main axis direction at time t b by using the main direction the node position at time t a and the node rotation during the period of t b t a the initial principal direction of an element are e 1 0 e 2 0 e 3 0 and at the starting point of each path unit the rotation vector of one period is used to get the new principal direction of the next time point 2 3 3 virtual reverse motion and internal forces assuming that the node positions x a a x b a θ a a θ b a internal forces f 1 a f 2 a m 1 a m 2 a and material parameters of element 1 2 at time t a and the node positions x a t x b t θ a t θ b t at time t are both known during the period of t t a the node displacement vectors and rotation vectors in global coordinates are expressed as μ 1 t x a t x a a μ 2 t x b t x b a β 1 t θ a t θ a a β 2 t θ b t θ b a in order to calculate deformation and internal force a set of principal coordinates x ˆ y ˆ z ˆ parallel to e 1 a e 2 a e 3 a are defined and ω a e 1 a t e 2 a t e 3 a t t is the transformation matrix of principal coordinates then the node rotation vectors and internal forces at principal coordinates can be expressed as β ˆ j t ω a β j t f ˆ j a ω a f j a m ˆ j a ω a m j a j 1 2 take node 1 as the reference point of inverse motion the reverse rigid body translation vector is μ 1 t and the reverse rigid body rotation is described as γ t β ˆ 11 t e 1 a θ t a e t a where β ˆ 11 t β 1 t e 1 a e 1 t x b t x a t x b t x a t θ t a sin 1 e 1 a e 1 t and e t a e 1 a e 1 t e 1 a e 1 t through the transformation matrix ω a the inverse rigid body rotation at principal coordinates is expressed as 20 γ ˆ t ω a γ t β ˆ 11 t θ ˆ 2 t θ ˆ 3 t after the above mentioned reverse motion the pure deformation of element 1 2 during the interval of t t a can be figured out 21 δ ˆ e t l 12 t l 12 a x b t x a t x b a x a a 22 ϕ ˆ j t ϕ ˆ j 1 t ϕ ˆ j 2 t ϕ ˆ j 3 t β ˆ j t γ ˆ t β ˆ j 1 t β ˆ 11 t β ˆ j 2 t θ ˆ 2 t β ˆ j 3 t θ ˆ 3 t j 1 2 where δ ˆ e t ϕ ˆ j t are the pure deformation and angles respectively according to the theory of flexure the increment of internal forces described by the main coordinates are 23 δ f ˆ 1 δ f ˆ 11 δ f ˆ 12 δ f ˆ 13 e a a δ ˆ e t l 12 a 6 e a i ˆ 3 a ϕ ˆ 13 t ϕ ˆ 23 t l 12 a 2 6 e a i

2 ϕ ˆ 12 t 4 ϕ ˆ 22 t l 12 a e a i ˆ 3 a 2 ϕ ˆ 13 t 4 ϕ ˆ 23 t l 12 a therefore the internal forces of element nodes at time t can be expressed as 27 f ˆ j t f ˆ j a δ f ˆ j m ˆ j t m ˆ j a δ m ˆ j j 1 2 and then by the coordinate transformation and positive rigid body rotation the internal forces at global coordinates are given by 28 f j t r t ω a t f ˆ j t m j t r t ω a t m ˆ j t j 1 2 here the calculation method of rotation vector r t is the same as that of r γ 2 4 numerical solution of the equation of motion the equation of motion and wake oscillator equation are solved by the central differential method of explicit time integration and each time step h in the calculation process is defined as a path unit as initial conditions x i 0 θ i 0 q i 0 p i 0 are set as zero and a random noise with amplitude of order o 10 3 is introduced to q i 0 and p i 0 gu et al 2013 the calculation step includes three cycles fig 4 the first loop is to calculate the value of position variables of step n 1 x i n 1 θ i n 1 in step n the second loop is to calculate the value of wake variables of step n 1 in step n the third loop is that the position values and wake variables of step n 1 are brought into the structural element relationship formula and the fluid force calculation formula respectively and the values of external and internal force of step n 1 are calculated then through force integration the resultant force on a particle is obtained and the position variables of step n 2 are calculated considering the damping effect by fluid the difference equation for numerical calculation can be expressed as 29 x i n 1 2 c 1 x i n c 2 x i n 1 c 1 h 2 f i e x t f i int m i 30 θ i n 1 2 c 1 θ i n c 2 θ i n 1 c 1 h 2 m i e x t m i int i i n 31 q i n 1 a x h 2 f i 1 e x t f i 1

numerical simulation results and discussion in this paper a riser model tested by https www sciencedirect com science article pii s0029801817307552 huarte 2006 is used as a demonstration and validation the experiments were carried out at delft hydraulics in the delta flume which was used as a towing tank the flume used in the experiment was 230 m long and 5 m wide the lower 45 of the riser model was subjected to a uniform current at speeds up to 1 m s and the rest was surrounded by still water when testing the layout and main parameters of the experiment is shown in fig 5 and table 1 respectively other undetermined parameters in the calculation will be set as the typical values as in table 2 3 1 validation of the vfife model predictions with experimental results the experiment was conducted under five different initial tension states and three cases of them were simulated to illustrate the validity of the proposed model in predicting some aspects of viv response the flow speed in the simulation varied from 0 1 m s to 0 9 m s with an increment of 0 1 m s the vibration response as functions of reduced velocity are plotted in figs 6 8 figs 6a and 8a show the comparison between the vfife model and experimental results on the riser top tension the tension predicted by the vfife model is seen to fairly fit the experimental data when the reduced velocity is smaller than 23 however for the higher reduced velocity the experiment data increased faster than simulation both the experiment and the numerical simulation illustrate that the top tension increases significantly as reduced velocity increase and the rate of increase of the top tension also increase for different initial tension states the degree of top tension variation decreases with the increase of the initial tension when the initial tensions are 1922n 1538n and 1175n the maximum values of top tension variation obtained by simulation in the range of reduced velocity recorded are 131n 238n and 274n respectively accounting for 7 15 and 23 of the original tension therefore the influence of top tension variation cannot be ignored in the analysis of dynamic response figs 6b and 8b and figs 6e and 8e show the maximum displacement in cf and il directions varying with the reduced velocity it is noted that the maximum amplitudes without mean predicted by vfife model are smaller than the experimental values especially when the initial tension is 1175n this discrepancy may be due to the difference between the values of the empirical parameters used in the fluid force calculation and the actual value in addition the effect of damping error is also one of the possible reasons non dimensional il and cf dominant frequency are presented in figs 6d and 8d except for some data points the predicted results by vfife model are in good agreement with the experiment data the dominant frequency of the il vibration is approximately twice as large as the frequency of the cf vibration as can be seen in figs 6d and 8d moreover it can be found that the non dimensional dominant frequency fluctuates up and down along a straight line parallel to the coordinate axis which indicates that the vibration frequency of the riser increases linearly with the reduced velocity figs 6c and 8c show the changes of dominated mode numbers with reduced velocity in the present simulation and in the experimental test conducted by https www sciencedirect com science article pii s0029801817307552 huarte 2006 when the reduced velocity is within the range of 23 40 the il dominant mode numbers predicted by the vfife model are higher than the experiment results and have a maximum difference of two modes the prediction of the cf mode numbers is much better and the maximum discrepancy is only one mode number for both experiment and simulation the dominant mode numbers in the cf direction is about one half of that in the il direction thus the vfife model is able to effectively describe the dominant modes of vortex induced vibration with good accuracy 3 2 further analysis of numerical simulation results fig 9 shows the non dimensional response of riser vibration of different initial tension and velocity conditions simulated by vfife model inspecting fig 9 a the first column shows the displacement of the riser in the il direction without removing the average value it can be observed that at about one third of the riser height the displacement reaches the maximum value this can be explained by the fact that the experiment was conducted in a stepped current and the fluid force only acted on the lower part of the riser gu et al 2013 the vibration shapes without mean in the il and cf directions are given in the second and fourth columns respectively it can be found that the vibration shapes in both cf and il directions generally meet the characteristics of standing waves however from the rms values described in the third and fifth columns there is no pure wave node during vibration this indicates that the riser vibration response simulated by vfife model is actually a combination of standing waves and traveling waves such feature is also observed by ge et al 2009 the above findings are more intuitive in fig 10 which shows the time evolution of displacement of the riser at different positions the first line is the displacement change in the cf direction and the second line is the displacement change in the il direction it is seen that the traveling wave pattern becomes more and more obvious with the increase of flow velocities and the closer to the ends of the riser the more obvious the standing wave is in the middle of the riser the traveling wave has the greatest influence fig 11 shows the non dimensional displacement time histories and corresponding frequency spectrum of riser vibration at different depths z 1 025m 2 255m 4 715m 6 97m 9 02m 11 07m from the first and third columns it can be seen that the vibration of riser changes periodically with time although the amplitude of vibration is different at different locations the frequency remains the same and the vibration frequency along the il direction 6 92hz is about twice as much as the cf direction 3 57hz the above conclusion shows that the influence of il vibration on fatigue life cannot be ignored in the riser design and analysis and may be greater than that of cf direction fig 12 shows 2d trajectories at different depths at t 0 1922 n and u 0 5 m s it is clearly observed that the trajectories of the riser model in the xy plane at different depths are the traditional figure of eight which is also consistent with the experimental observations fig 13 gives the time evolution of the section internal force at every span position in fig 13 a it can be observed that as part of the tension exerted by the top spring counteracts the forces of gravity the tension of element decreases from top to bottom reducing about 200n which accounts for about thirteen percent of the initial tension this characteristic shows that it is necessary to consider the change of the tension along the structure axis in the numerical simulation otherwise the calculation results may have a large deviation from the experimental results the element tension changes periodically with time and the vibration amplitude at both ends of riser is larger than that in the middle of riser from the spectrum of axial force plotted in fig 14 it can be further observed that the variation frequency of element tension is generally composed of two parts one is twice of the cf vibration frequency 7 59hz the other is twice of the il vibration frequency 15 4hz moments around the principal axis y ˆ and z ˆ of the cross section are plotted in fig 13 b and c respectively from fig 13 b 13 c and fig 14 it is evident that the components of the moment around the main axis of the cross section follow a periodic trend and their frequency are consistent with the il and cf dominant response frequency 3 79hz 7 79hz fig 15 shows the evolution of stress with time and space the stress is mainly affected by the axial force of the element and its dominant response frequency is also composed of two parts one is twice of the cf vibration frequency the other is twice of the il vibration frequency 3 3 the top movement and the top tension of the riser as mentioned above a spring is used to simulate the effect of tensioner on the top of riser in the vfife model the influences of spring stiffness on the top movement and top tension are analyzed in further detail below figs 16 and 17 depict the time series and corresponding spectrum of top tension and top displacement of the vfife model with different towing speeds and spring stiffness it is evident that the tension and the displacement follow a periodic trend and the frequencies are close to the riser vibration frequencies in the il direction when the spring stiffness is constant both the mean top tension and the range of tension change increase with the towing speed which is the same as that of the top displacement the main reason is that the increase of flow velocity will lead to the increase of the amplitude of fluid force moreover from figs 16 and 17 it is noted that when the flow velocity remains constant the average value and amplitude of the top displacement both decrease with the spring stiffness and the dominant frequency of the top displacement is not affected by the spring stiffness this is mainly because when the current velocity is constant the fluid force acting on the riser is also constant therefore under the condition of constant current velocity the greater the spring stiffness the stronger the constraint on the top of the riser and the smaller the average value and amplitude of the top displacement the effect of this change on the vibration response of riser model in the il and cf direction can be ignored for the time domain variation of top tension the change rules of the vibration amplitude of top tension and the mean top tension with the spring stiffness are not obvious when the flow velocity remains constant the premise of the above conclusions is that large pretensions are used in the model calculation examples the pretension factor is up to 7 4 to 12 1 in the numerical simulation while it is generally 1 2 to 1 5 in the actual engineering therefore in the actual working condition the change of top displacement and top tension caused by different spring stiffness may have an additional impact on the vibration and deformation of the riser in the future work further analysis about how to choose the equivalent spring stiffness of the tensioner should be made 4 conclusions this paper combines the vector form intrinsic finite element method and wake oscillator model to predict the 3d vortex induced vibration response of vertical risers the feasibility of this method in analyzing vortex induced vibration of long flexible risers is illustrated by comparison with the experiment results different from the traditional method which usually reduces the structure to the euler bernoulli beam model the vfife uses particles to describe the vibration behavior of the structure which makes the analysis of the overall deformation of a riser no longer limited by the small deformation assumption in order to truly reflect the top constraints of a riser spring support is added as a boundary condition using the particle motion formulas to describe the deformation of structure can avoid solving complex nonlinear equations and simplify the process of solving internal forces and deformations in a word a computationally robust three dimensional model accounting for fully coupled cross flow in line and axial viv dynamics is presented and the vfife method provides a new way to deal with geometric nonlinear viv behaviors of risers future research will be focused on the validity of this model in the prediction of viv of

corresponding author fluid structure interactions fsi of multiple cylindrical structures frequently occur in crossflows due to the different wake interference regions of flexible cylinders with different diameters the interaction between multiple cylinders is complicated and sensitive to the centre to centre spacing ratio and diameter ratio limited information has been presented on the flow induced vibration fiv of two unequal diameter flexible cylinders in a tandem arrangement in this paper an experimental investigation was carried out in a towing tank to study the fiv of two tandem flexible cylinders with different diameters that can vibrate in both the cross flow cf and in line il directions there were two il spacing ratios t d 12 0 and 6 0 where t is the centre to centre distance between two cylinders and d is the diameter of the small cylinder and the diameter ratio d d where d is the diameter of the large cylinder was nearly 0 5 the aspect ratios mass ratios of the small cylinder and the large cylinder were 350 1 90 and 181 1 47 respectively the towing velocity varied from 0 05 to 1 00 m s with an interval of 0 05 m s the reynolds numbers for the small and large cylinder were 800 16000 and 1600 32000 respectively the cf vibration of the upstream large cylinder with t d 6 0 was suppressed at vrs 16 28 18 79 whereas the cf vibration of the large cylinder with t d 12 0 was not influenced the downstream cylinder exhibited more complicated behaviour due to the significant wake effect from the upstream cylinder which is consistent with the two equal diameter cylinders the fiv response of the downstream small cylinder was more sensitive to the il spacing ratio because of the wake shielding effect of the large cylinder the downstream small cylinder vibrated at low il dominant frequencies and the il to cf frequency ratio f il f cf was approximately 1 0 moreover wake induced flutter was observed on the downstream small cylinder keywords flow induced vibration fiv multiple cylinders unequal diameter wake induced flutter tandem configuration 1 introduction multiple cylindrical structures are often arranged in tandem in various engineering applications such as tubes in heat exchangers overhead transmission line bundles and offshore risers when the incoming flow passes through a group of multiple cylinders the flow induced vibration fiv phenomenon may occur among the previous studies on the fiv of multiple cylinders the configuration with two cylinders in tandem has received more attention papaioannou et al 2008 kim et al 2009 assi et al 2010 carmo et al 2011 huang and herfjord 2013 xu et al 2018b 2018c 2019 for the flow patterns of two identical stationary cylinders in a tandem arrangement there are three basic regimes the extended body regime the reattachment regime and the co shedding regime zdravkovich 1987 zhou and yiu 2006 sumner 2010 the wake is classified into three regimes depending on spacing ratio t d where t is the centre to centre spacing of the two cylinders and d is the diameter of two identical cylinders i the extended body regime takes place when 1 0 t d 2 0 and the free shear layers roll up to form a single vortex street ii in the reattachment regime 2 0 t d 5 0 the free shear layers separated from the upstream cylinder are more likely to reattach onto the surface of the downstream cylinder iii in the co shedding regime t d 5 0 a vortex is generated by the upstream cylinder and subsequently interacts with those separated from the downstream cylinder for two elastically supported rigid cylinders arranged in tandem vortex shedding is the main mechanism that causes the initial vibration of the cylinder borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 the cross flow cf and in line il fiv responses of multiple cylinders are more complicated than those of an isolated cylinder borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 numerically investigated the fiv of two elastically mounted cylinders in a tandem arrangement at re 200 the two vibrating cylinders approach each other at sufficiently high reduced velocities which significantly reduces the size of the gap region thereby eliminating gap flow in such cases the two cylinders vibrate as a single body with vibration amplitudes lower than those where the gap flow is active huang and herfjord 2013 experimentally studied two elastically mounted rigid cylinders in a tandem arrangement subjected to steady flow with t d 2 0 5 0 both cylinders were free to vibrate in both the cf and il directions the fiv response of the downstream cylinder was dependent upon the reduced velocity which was influenced by the wake of the upstream cylinder the upstream cylinder was nearly unaffected by the downstream cylinder when the initial t d was greater than 3 0 however the fiv response of the downstream cylinder was largely influenced by the upstream cylinder in the t d range tested the increasing demand for offshore risers and transmission lines has prompted studies into the fiv of multiple flexible cylinders research has shown that the wake flow of two tandem flexible cylinders undergoing fiv is completely three dimensional wang et al 2017 according to the reduced velocity griffith et al 2017 divided the flow pattern of two tandem cylinders with a small pitch ratio centre to centre spacing of the two cylinders to the cylinder diameter into three modes the combination of vortices with the same sign corresponds to the first mode in the second mode the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is relatively larger and moves completely out of the wake of the upstream cylinder the vortex pair propagates backward and the subsequent vortex pair catches up with the previously formed vortex pair they merge and form an irregular vortex street in the third mode the small amplitude of the upstream cylinder and the large amplitude of the downstream cylinder cause a vortex to appear in the gap in the reattachment regime the vortex shedding is synchronized to form a more regular periodic vortex in the co shedding regime the superposition of the wakes makes them more complex and non periodic papaioannou et al 2008 bao et al 2012 huera huarte and bearman 2011 and huera huarte and gharib 2011 experimentally studied the dynamic response of two flexible cylinders with near and far wake interference for spacing ratio t d ranging from 2 0 to 8 0 when the spacing ratio was sufficiently large the response of the upstream cylinder exhibited typical vortex induced vibration viv and was almost the same as that of an isolated flexible cylinder because the vortex in the gap the downstream cylinder had a large response amplitudes caused by wake induced vibration later huera huarte et al 2016 performed experimental investigation of the fiv of a flexible cylinder located behind a stationary cylinder at various spacing ratios t d 2 0 6 0 the fiv was found to be a multi mode response comprising large amplitude contributions from several adjacent modes wang et al 2017 investigated the effect of t d on the hydrodynamic interactions and the fiv responses of two tandem flexible cylinders the fiv response of the two flexible cylinders was found to be similar to the typical response at a small t d once t d was sufficiently large for the vortex to be detached from the upstream cylinder the downstream cylinder was vibrated by the wake of the upstream cylinder xu et al 2018b experimentally observed that the fiv response of the downstream cylinder was determined by lower frequencies and dominant modes due to the wake shielding effect when the cylinders were in a tandem arrangement the influence of the il spacing ratio on the il response was more remarkable than that on the cf response ma et al 2019 studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of two flexible cylinders connected in tandem both wake shielding effect and the vortex shedding effect influenced the hydrodynamic features of the downstream cylinder in addition when t d 6 0 due to the wake shielding effect the fatigue damage of the downstream cylinder is reduced the downstream cylinder suffered more serious il fatigue damage under t d 10 0 and 16 0 at some reduced velocities owing to the dominant modal lag xu et al 2020 cylindrical structures with equal diameters are special whereas unequal diameter cylinders are more common in offshore engineering for example considering the needs of technology and economy it is necessary to arrange smaller diameter auxiliary pipes as ties near the main pipe these piggyback pipes can effectively reduce the cost of installing the pipeline but the presence of small diameter cylinders has a certain hydrodynamic impact on the area near the main pipe moreover cylinders that serve different operational functions can form the same cluster such as drilling and production risers from the perspective of space saving and economic benefits the diameters of these risers are different and the diameter ratio generally varies between 1 0 and 4 0 when subjected to the ocean flow the falling vortex shedding generated by these cylindrical structures can affect the stability and safety of the slender cylinders although some fiv characteristics of two cylinders with different diameters can be studied by considering equal diameter cylinders other unequal diameter characteristics remain unrevealed there are fewer studies on the staggered arrangement dalton et al 2001 pearcey et al 2017 zhao et al 2007 xu et al 2020 gao et al 2010 and lee et al 2012 studied the flows around two cylinders with unequal diameters in a side by side arrangement whereas few studies have been performed on unequal diameter cylinders in a tandem arrangement qin et al 2017 studied the cf fiv on an elastically mounted large cylinder in the wake of a smaller stationary cylinder the diameter ratios d d and il spacing ratios t d varied from 0 2 to 1 0 and from 2 0 to 6 5 respectively the severe vibration of the cylinder depended on both d d and t d it was found that as t d increased vibrations of the large cylinder occurred at a smaller d d the wake from the small cylinder was narrow and the shear layer tended to switch its direction from one side to the other huang and sworn 2011 studied the hydrodynamic interaction of elastically supported rigid cylinders that oscillated freely in the cf and il directions in a water tank the diameter of the upstream cylinder was twice that of the downstream cylinder and the t d varied from 1 0 to 10 0 moreover the reynolds number was in the subcritical range the test results showed that the vibration response of the downstream cylinder was dependent on its actual reduced velocity the frequency components of the cf fiv of the downstream cylinder included the vortex shedding of the upstream cylinder and its vortex shedding the relative importance of the two sources of excitation was influenced by t d later huang and sworn 2013 conducted fiv experiments of two tandem and staggered cylinders with unequal diameters the t d varied from 1 0 to 15 0 for the upstream cylinder the viv was similar to the classical lock in response unless the t d was less than 2 0 as previously mentioned the studies of fiv response have mainly focused on equal diameter cylindrical structures in tandem side by side and staggered arrangements in our previous experimental studies on two identical cylinders undergoing fiv xu et al 2018a 2018b 2020 it was found that the multi mode and high amplitude features can better reflect the dynamic response of the long flexible cylinders few studies have investigated the fiv response of two unequal diameter flexible cylinders xu et al 2020 instead previous studies mainly focused on the flow patterns of multiple cylinders with different diameters this study performed experiments on unequal diameter cylinders to investigate their interesting fiv phenomena multiple long flexible cylindrical structures in a tandem arrangement are prone to experiencing fiv such vibrations are the main source of fatigue failures and these vibrations can result in structural damage when combined with wake interactions the outline of the rest of this paper is as follows section 2 presents a detailed description of the experimental setup and experimental details and introduces the methods for processing the measured strain signals and the reconstruction of the displacement responses section 3 presents and discusses the experimental results finally some conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 experimental descriptions and data analysis the il spacing plays an important role in the fiv and wake flow fields between two tandem flexible cylinders papaioannou et al 2008 wang et al 2017 zdravkovich 1987 studied most spacing in a wake interference region under the tandem configuration and the downstream cylinders were placed in the wake interference region where t d 6 0 the flow regions were divided depending on the diameter of the upstream cylinder therefore the interference area was larger when the diameter of the upstream cylinder was larger than that of the downstream cylinder in our previous experiment xu et al 2018b the separation distance between the two cylinders varied through five spacing ratios with t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 and obvious wake interference was observed from t d 6 0 to 16 0 huang and sworn 2011 studied the hydrodynamic interaction of unequal diameter rigid cylinders where the smaller cylinder was located downstream the influence of the downstream cylinder on the upstream cylinder is negligible at t d 5 0 t d 1 0 at the smaller spacing ratio the response of the downstream smaller cylinder is identical to that of the larger cylinder the yellow dashed lines in fig 1 delineate the four types of flow regions classified by zdravkovich 1987 around two cylinders undergoing flow interactions however that investigation was based on two elastically mounted rigid cylinders and the region classification was assumed to be slightly different from the result of our present study with two unequal diameter flexible cylinders for comparison we still divided the entire plane into four regions based on that study proximity interference wake interference proximity and wake interference and no interference as shown in fig 1 in the first region of proximity interference the two cylinders are close to each other and one is not submerged in the wake of the other when the downstream cylinder is in the second region of wake interference it is partially or fully submerged in the wake of the upstream cylinder the third type is a combination of the first two types the fourth region is the no interference region with negligibly weak interference between the two cylinders however since a flexible cylinder has a more complex response than a fixed cylinder the division of the flow area is only for reference as shown in fig 1 two unequal diameter cylinders in tandem arrangement were experimentally tested three experimental cases i ii and iii in this study were considered depending on the centre to centre spacing ratio t d and the relative position upstream or downstream in cases i and ii the small cylinder was located upstream of the large cylinder with t d 6 0 and 12 0 respectively in case iii the large cylinder was upstream of the small cylinder with t d 6 0 and the large cylinder was in the wake interference region the diameter ratio of the two unequal diameter cylinders was 0 5 in this experiment therefore when the centre to centre distance was 6d in case i the downstream small cylinder was located in the proximity and wake interference region the fiv of two unequal diameter cylinders arranged in a tandem configuration was experimentally investigated at the state key laboratory of hydraulic engineering simulation and safety at tianjin university the main apparatus was installed at the supporting frame in the experiment as shown in fig 2 including the supporting frame vertical supporting rods guide plate dials and the axial tension systems the apparatuses used in the experiment were slightly different from two equal diameter cylinders in different arrangements xu et al 2018a 2018b 2020 the supporting rods and supporting plates which were made of steel were the main vertical supporting devices the number of sturdy vertical supporting rods was increased from two to four the guide plates made of the hard plastic plate were installed on the supporting plate through several long bolts to avoid interference of the supporting devices under incoming flow and ensure that the incoming flow was two dimensional the supporting plate dial and the guide plate dial were added the position angle of the two unequal diameter cylindrical models could be changed by rotating the plate dial to achieve different arrangements tandem side by side and staggered for example from case i to case iii the plate dial only needed to be rotated 180 the tensioner was used to adjust the axial tension of the flexible cylinder and the springs were used to ensure that the axial tension did not change suddenly the load cell was used to collect the information on the end tension of the flexible cylinder model the initial axial pretension force was 450 n the cylindrical model was divided into an outer silicone tube and an internal copper tube as shown in fig 3 for each flexible cylinder model the il and cf bending strains were measured with two pairs of strain gauges installed at the inner tube the copper tube and the silicone tube were closely connected and were guaranteed not to be separated during the operation seven measurement locations g1 g7 were arranged uniformly along the cylinder with a length of l 5 6 m signal aliasing occurred during sampling and the sampling frequency was 100 hz after the experimental test started the sampling time for each test was 50 s fifteen minutes elapsed before the next test was started which ensured the water was clam the towing velocity in a 137 0 m 7 0 m 3 3 m length width depth tank was guaranteed to vary from 0 05 m s to 1 0 m s at increments of 0 05 m s the reynolds numbers of the small cylinder and the large cylinder were 800 16 000 and 1600 32 000 respectively the two cylinders were within the range of 300 re 3 105 which was the subcritical region the reynolds number of the small cylinder was chosen for all three cases from the perspective of space savings and economic benefits different functional risers were designed with different diameter ratios which typically varied from 0 25 to 1 0 to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of unequal diameter cylinders the diameter ratio d d where d is the smaller diameter and d is the larger diameter is a key parameter for example song et al 2015 selected d d from 0 1 to 1 6 when studying hydrodynamics and vortex shedding characteristics of two cylinders with different diameters in a steady flow alam and zhou 2008 studied the strouhal number fluid force and flow structure of two tandem cylinders with d d in the range of 0 24 1 0 the diameter of the cylinder in our previous experiments was 0 016 m xu et al 2018a b d therefore the small cylinder in this study had a diameter of d 0 016 m and the large cylinder had a diameter of d 0 031 m the diameter ratio selected in this experiment was nearly 0 5 which was also commonly selected in studies with a fixed diameter ratio lam and to 2003 studied the fiv responses of two cylinders with d 0 031 m and d 0 016 m zhao et al 2007 also studied two unequal diameter cylinders with a diameter ratio of 0 5 the aspect ratio length to diameter of the small cylinder was 350 and that of the large cylinder was 181 in the test the mass per unit length m s of the small cylinder was 0 3821 kg m and that of the larger cylinder was 1 1071 kg m moreover the corresponding mass ratios m were 1 90 and 1 47 the other specific parameters of the two cylindrical models are shown in table 1 the damping ratios of the two cylinders were determined from the free decay tests and calculated by 1 ζ ln a i a i j 2 j π where a i and a i j are the strain response amplitudes of the i th and the i j th cycles respectively in the present experimental tests the damping ratios of the small cylinder and the large cylinder were ζ s 0 034 and ζ l 0 031 respectively the root mean square rms displacement amplitudes response frequencies dominant modes and x y trajectories of the two flexible cylinders undergoing fiv in tandem are presented and discussed for three typical cases i ii and iii these fiv characteristics of the two flexible cylinders vary with the reduced velocity which is defined by the free flow velocity the cylinder diameter and the natural frequency however the diameters of the two cylinder models in this experiment are unequal moreover their natural frequencies are also different for an expedient comparison the reduced velocity was uniformly defined by the parameters of the small cylinder in this study 2 v r s u f s 1 d where f s 1 is the first order natural frequency of the small cylinder these natural frequencies of the cylinder in our free decay tests were not completely the same hence f s 1 was set to the theoretical value to avoid slight differences the theoretical value of f s n can be calculated as follows 3 f s n n t a m 1 π l 2 e i m 1 1 2 2 l similarly the natural frequency f l n of the large cylinder can be calculated as follows 4 f l n n t a m 2 π l 2 e i m 2 1 2 2 l where f s n and f l n are the nth order eigenfrequencies of the small and large cylinders respectively the experimentally measured and theoretical values of the natural frequencies of two unequal diameter cylinders are given in table 2 which shows that the reliability of the experimental results is high therefore a modal approach is required to obtain the displacement from the curvature measurements not only at the locations of the gauges but also at every point on the flexible cylinder the selected modal analysis technique has previously been successfully applied to analyse the measurement data associated with viv tests of long flexible risers lie and kaasen 2006 the modal analysis method was used to reconstruct the displacement information of the cylinder from the filtered strain signal taking the cf displacement reconstruction as an example the following formula was written 5 y z t n 1 w n t ϕ n z z 0 l the cylinder can be simplified to a bernoulli euler beam with both ends pinned the mode shape of displacement can be expressed as follows 6 ϕ n z sin π n z l z 0 l furthermore reconstruction of the displacement response was based on the relationship between curvature and strain the relationship between strain and displacement can be expressed as follows 7 ε z p t r n 1 7 π n l sin π n z l w n t p 1 7 n 1 7 the modal weight w n t was calculated according to eq 4 then w n t was brought into eq 2 to solve the displacement information the meanings of the symbols in eqs 2 7 are shown in table 1 lie and kaasen 2006 also used strain signals and conducted identifiable analyses however this method has difficulty accurately distinguishing the real signal from noise for low modes in addition the results with higher dominant modes are reliable because they are less influenced by the noise of the lower mode the measurement noises under low flow velocities may introduce errors in the displacement calculation therefore the present displacement response is analysed from a towing velocity of 0 15 m s to 1 0 m s the coordinates of a point on the cylinder are identified as y z t x z t as shown in eq 5 the rms value y rms z i x rms z i with respect to time can provide a general indication of the magnitude of the cf and il displacements at a span location z 8 y r m s z i 1 λ i 1 λ y z i t 2 x r m s z i 1 λ i 1 λ x z i t 2 where z i is the position along the axis of the cylinder and λ is the number of samples in the selected period the sampling duration of each test is 50 s and the selected time range is 20 40 s in offshore engineering applications the maximum displacement of a flexible cylindrical structure is the main factor that affects the design of the riser arrangement this will effectively avoid collision damage to the slender structure in the present study we chose the maximum dimensionless cf and il rms displacements max x rms max y rms to reflect the magnitude of the fiv response note that max y rms and max x rms can be determined from the following equations 9 m a x y r m s m a x 1 i n y r m s z i 10 m a x x r m s m a x 1 i n x r m s z i the meaning of some of the symbols in eqs 9 and 10 can be found in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 dominant modes and dominant frequencies fig 4 shows the dominant modes of two tandem cylinders with unequal diameters in the cf direction the dominant mode has the largest modal weight from eq 7 the cf dominant mode of two cylinders increases from lower modes to higher modes as vrs increases for example in two cases where the large cylinder is upstream of the small cylinder cases i and ii the dominant mode increases from the first order at vrs 3 76 to the third order at vrs 25 05 the variation in the cf dominant mode of the upstream large cylinder with vrs is almost the same as that of the isolated large cylinder the upstream small cylinder in case iii and the isolated small cylinder also have the same trend however the cf dominant modes of the upstream cylinder at t d 4 0 and 6 0 are lower than that of the isolated cylinder in the equal diameter experiment xu et al 2018b for tandem cylinders with small spacing ratios in the proximity and wake interference regions the near wake of the upstream cylinder is affected by the downstream cylinder zhou and alam 2016 nevertheless the upstream larger cylinder in case i is less affected at the same spacing ratio due to the smaller diameter of the downstream cylinder it can be verified that the existence and vibration of the downstream small cylinder have little effect on the cf dominant mode for the downstream cylinder the mode transitions between two adjacent vibration modes are delayed by increases in vrs due to the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder the synchronization region of the vibration mode is extended fig 5 shows the dominant modes of two tandem cylinders with unequal diameters in the il direction aside from the difference in the switching region of the vibration mode the small cylinder in case iii and the isolated cylinder exhibit similar behaviour the maximum il dominant modes of the upstream cylinder and the isolated cylinder are both sixth order the dominant modes in both the cf and il directions are different from those in the equal diameter experiment xu et al 2018b the comparison of the upstream cylinder in cases i and ii shows that the dominant modes of the upstream large cylinder with t d 6 0 are more similar to that of the isolated large cylinder due to the larger diameter of the upstream cylinder and the smaller spacing ratio the downstream cylinder may sit inside the vortex formation region of the upstream cylinder and the two cylinders behave as a single bluff body in the equal diameter experiment xu et al 2018b the fluid behaviour in the reattachment regime can be observed at the same spacing ratio in addition the il dominant modes of the downstream cylinder change drastically with vrs as evidenced by the large cylinder in case iii therefore when the large cylinder is located upstream of the small cylinder the lower mode vibrations of the small cylinder are caused by the strong shielding effects of the upstream cylinder figs 6 and 7 show the variations in the dimensionless cf and il dominant frequencies f cf f s 1 and f cf f l 1 f il f s 1 and f il f l 1 with respect to vrs for the unequal diameter cylinders respectively the fast fourier transform is employed to calculate the dominant frequencies from the time varying displacement the cf and il dominant frequencies are normalized with f s 1 and f l 1 which are calculated from eqs 3 and 4 respectively the diagonal grey dashed lines represent the strouhal number corresponding to the cf and il vortex shedding frequency of a stationary cylinder in the different selected cases the cf and il dominant frequencies of the upstream cylinder the large cylinder in cases i and ii and the small cylinder in case iii are similar to those of the isolated cylinder the effect of the downstream cylinder on the frequency response of the upstream cylinder is almost negligible in addition the upstream large cylinder behaves similarly with two different spacing ratios however the dimensionless dominant frequencies of the downstream cylinder in two directions are affected by the upstream cylinder and the spacing ratio this characteristic was also observed in the experiment of two equal diameter cylinders in a tandem arrangement xu et al 2018b it is clear in figs 6 and 7 that the downstream small cylinder oscillates with a lower dominant frequency than the isolated small cylinder there is synchronization between the dominant frequencies of the downstream small cylinder and the natural frequencies of different vibration modes as vrs increases there is a strong wake effect at t d 6 0 and 12 0 as the spacing ratio increases the dimensionless cf and il dominant frequencies slightly decrease because the diameter ratio d d is nearly 0 5 the free shear layers separated from the upstream large cylinder are more likely to reattach onto the surface of the downstream cylinder even at t d 12 0 when the small cylinder is located in the rear upper side of the large cylinder the shedding behind the cylinder is influenced by the shear layers behind the gap zhao et al 2005 2007 therefore if the small cylinder is located in wake interference it will be more affected by wake shielding this causes the true in flow velocities to differ from the free flow velocities for two equal diameter flexible cylinders in tandem it was also found that the strouhal frequency of the downstream cylinder was lower xu et al 2018b huang and herfjord 2013 also noted that the fiv of the downstream cylinder was strongly affected by the true in flow velocities when the large cylinder is located downstream its cf and il dominant frequencies are slightly affected by the upstream smaller cylinder and the values are close to those of the isolated cylinder this reveals that the effect of the downstream cylinder on the frequency response of the upstream cylinder is nearly negligible although the downstream large cylinder is in the wake interference region of the upstream small cylinder the upstream cylinder cannot completely cover the downstream cylinder due to the given diameter ratio d d 0 5 it is possible that the downstream large cylinder is located outside the vortex formation region of the upstream small cylinder and is periodically hit by the impingement of the kaman vortex shed from the upstream cylinder karman vortex shedding can now occur from both the upstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder therefore for the downstream large cylinder although the vortex shedding area is still affected by the true in flow velocity the true in flow velocity and free stream velocity in other areas are not much different fig 8 shows the relationship between the il to cf dominant frequency ratios f il f cf and vrs according to fig 8 for the small cylinder in cases i and ii f il f cf 2 0 at individual vrs 3 76 12 52 13 78 17 54 20 04 21 29 which indicates that a dual resonance occurs however the value of f il f cf is approximately 1 0 at most reduced velocities by analysing the f il f cf and dominant modes when the small cylinder is located behind the large cylinder it vibrates in low order modes the first order and second order modes as shown in figs 4 and 5 it can be considered that the same cf and il dominant frequencies of the small cylinder in cases i and ii are related to the low order mode vibrations caused by the strong shielding effect of the large cylinder in these cases this corresponds to the previous analysis of the dominant mode 3 2 displacement responses fig 9 shows the maximum rms dimensionless displacement of the small cylinder and the large cylinder as a function of vrs in the cf direction it should be noted that the cf and il displacements of the two unequal diameter cylinders are nondimensionalized by using their own diameters the fiv results of their respective isolated flexible cylinders are also included for comparison the vibration of the flexible cylinder exhibits high order vibration modes and multi mode competition regarding two tandem flexible cylinders with wake interference no matter how the spacing ratio changes the cylinders show classic viv response characteristics within the reduced velocity range corresponding to the typical lock in region the max y rms d and max y rms d reach local peaks when mode resonance occurs and then decrease before the vibration enters the next mode at vrs 13 78 as the vrs increases the dynamic behaviour of two cylinders differs greatly according to the spacing ratio of the cylinders and the vortex between the two cylinders as shown in fig 9 a the maximum rms cf displacement of the large cylinder in case ii varies similarly to that of the isolated large cylinder the specific performance is that both peaks of max y rms occur at vrs 18 79 and then decrease at vrs 20 04 these values are close the variations in the cf dominant modes and frequencies of the large cylinder in case ii are also similar to those of the isolated large cylinder this indicates that the fiv of the upstream large cylinder is not sensitive to the presence of downstream small cylinders the cf displacement response curve of the large cylinder in case i generally follows those of the large cylinder in case ii and the isolated large one for example a significant decrease occurs at vrs 21 29 in these curves however a significant difference was observed between the two curves in a vrs range of 15 03 20 04 for example the maximum value of max y rms in case ii is approximately 3 21 at vrs 18 79 whereas it is 1 83 at vrs 17 53 in case i this indicates that in the tandem unequal diameter experiment the spacing t d 6 0 and 12 0 between the two cylinders significantly influences the displacement amplitude of the upstream large cylinder at several reduced velocities wu and wang 2018 numerically studied the fiv of a cylinder with a downstream rigidly connected control rod for t d 4 and 8 the vortex of the main cylinder can form and develop in the gap the effect of the control rod on the fiv characteristics of the master cylinder was negligible because the cylinder system was excited by the main cylinder however the difference between the isolated large cylinder and the downstream large cylinder in case iii is significant combined with the dominant mode shown in fig 9 a the cf response amplitude of the large cylinder gradually increases and vrs increases in vibration mode the wake generated by the upstream small cylinder affects the cf response of the downstream large cylinder the small cylinder can suppress the vibration of the large cylinder when it is near the large cylinder t d 6 0 whether it is upstream or downstream it is obvious that when t d 6 0 in the tandem arrangement it has an inhibitory effect on the large cylinder the variations in the rms cf displacement with respect to vrs for the small cylinder in case iii and the isolated small cylinder are similar in fig 9 b which reveals that it is less affected by the downstream larger cylinder compared with the upstream cylinder in an equal diameter test xu et al 2018b the il vibration of the small cylinder in case iii increases slightly at vrs 10 02 15 03 and is similar at other reduced velocities this indicates that the diameter of the downstream cylinder has a slight effect on the vibration of the upstream cylinder the difference between the isolated small cylinder and the downstream small cylinder in cases i and ii is significant the wake generated from the upstream large cylinder suppresses the cf response vibration amplitude the distinct feature in fig 9 b is that the max y rms of the small cylinder with t d 6 0 is generally smaller than that of the isolated small cylinder at many reduced velocities the max y rms of the isolated small cylinder is higher up to 2 3 times greater than that of the small cylinder in cases i and ii we believe that both the shielding effect of the upstream cylinder and the diameter ratio of the two cylinders help reduce the effect of the incoming fluid force on the downstream cylinder and subsequently reduce the vibration amplitudes fig 10 shows the maximum il rms dimensionless displacement of the two cylinders versus the reduced velocity the calculation of the maximum il rms displacement max x rms is the same as that of max y rms the max x rms values of the upstream cylinder and the isolated cylinder exhibit similar variations with respect to vrs as shown in fig 10 this indicates that the spacing ratio t d does not affect the il displacement amplitude upstream in the tandem unequal diameter test however xu et al 2018b found obvious differences between the isolated cylinder and the upstream cylinder in the tandem equal diameter test which reveals that the t d affects the max y rms when the cylinders oscillate the two tandem flexible cylinders present a staggered arrangement for the fiv of two staggered rigid cylinders the il displacement of the upstream cylinder is larger than that of the isolated cylinder prasanth and mittal 2009 however the cf displacements of two unequal diameter cylinders appear to be suppressed as shown in fig 9 the cf spacing is not sufficiently large to make the gap flow increase the il displacement of the cylinders moreover no matter whether the large cylinder is located upstream or downstream when t d 6 0 the il vibration amplitude data do not fluctuate significantly the il vibrations of the large cylinder in case iii are close to those of the isolated large cylinder as previously mentioned max x rms is not sensitive to the il spacing ratio or relative position in the unequal diameter experiment as shown in fig 10 b max x rms of the small cylinder in cases i and ii differ from that of the isolated small cylinder the il rms displacement of the small cylinder increases with respect to vrs reaching a peak in the frequency locked region and subsequently decreasing when it turns to the next mode for example for the small cylinder in case i vrs in the second order mode is from 8 77 to 16 28 and the il displacement amplitude increases to twice that of the isolated small cylinder this means that the wake generated by the upstream large cylinder has a significant impact on the il response amplitudes of the downstream small cylinder in addition max x rms of the small cylinder in case ii is different from that of the small cylinder in case i combined with fig 9 b it is obvious that the effect of the spacing ratio on the il response is as significant as that on the cf response moreover max y rms of the downstream small cylinder is lower than that of the isolated small cylinder whereas max x rms is higher xu et al 2018b found that the il displacement of the downstream cylinder continually increased after the il displacement of the isolated cylinder reached the local peak which can also be attributed to wake induced flutter to investigate the fiv characteristics of two tandem flexible cylinders subjected to uniform flow the cf and il responses of the large cylinder and small cylinder at vrs 17 54 are analysed in figs 11 and 12 the three subplots in each column represent case i case ii and case iii the first column illustrates the spanwise distribution of the dimensionless rms cf displacement the second column is a space time varying non dimensional displacement contour of the rms cf displacements at time intervals ranging from 20 s to 21 s the third and fourth columns are two corresponding graphs in the il direction fig 11 shows that for the large cylinder in cases ii and iii the cf and il vibrations are controlled by the second order mode and the fourth order mode respectively in case i the il vibration of the large cylinder is controlled by the third order mode compared to the isolated large cylinder the il displacement of the large cylinder in case i is slightly larger which agrees with the vibration in fig 10 in the three cases the il direction of the small cylinder shows a combination of standing and travelling waves and the cf direction is mainly a standing wave response as shown in fig 12 due to the combination of the travelling wave and the standing wave an asymmetry develops in the displacement distribution for the small cylinder in cases i and ii due to the wake of the upstream large cylinder compared with the isolated small cylinder the il vibration displacement increases and the cf displacement decreases for example the cf peak amplitude of the isolated cylinder basically reaches approximately 1 2 whereas the maximum value of the small cylinder is approximately 0 5 the cf direction vibration of the small cylinder is suppressed and the amplitude is approximately half that of the isolated small cylinder however the maximum il amplitude of the small cylinder is nearly twice that of the isolated cylinder in case i and nearly 1 5 times that in case ii when the small cylinder is located downstream it is more obviously affected by the upstream larger cylinder when t d is smaller t d 6 0 the space time varying non dimensional displacement contours of the small cylinder in the cf and il directions indicate a combination of standing and travelling waves which are more obvious in the il direction 3 3 response trajectories fig 7 shows that the il dominant frequencies of the small cylinder in cases i and ii are lower than those of the isolated small cylinder for an isolated cylinder the il strouhal frequency is 0 326 and the cf strouhal frequency is 0 163 the il to cf strouhal frequency ratio is 2 0 for the cylinder in many studies f il f cf 2 0 indicated the occurrence of dual resonance song et al 2011 zhu et al 2016 xu et al 2018a b naudascher 2017 noticed that wake induced flutter was a coupled mode flutter with a lower frequency and a higher frequency wake induced flutter generally causes the dominant frequencies of the downstream cylinder to be the same in the cf and il directions which can be reflected by the small cylinder in cases i and ii as shown in fig 8 when the small cylinder is the downstream cylinder cases i and ii and the il to cf dimensionless dominant frequency ratio is 1 0 wake induced flutter can lead to ellipse shaped motion trajectories and increasing il displacement as shown in figs 13 and 14 the row of each subpicture represents one measurement location g1 g7 from top to bottom the first column contains the cf and il frequency spectrum curves the second column shows the cf and il displacement time histories the third column contains x y trajectories the il and cf frequency spectrum curves show that the fiv response of the small cylinder consists of the highest strong frequency and multiple weaker frequencies because the t d is smaller the upstream large cylinder has a greater impact and the small cylinder in case i has a more complex response than the small cylinder in case ii according to the frequency spectrum curves the il frequencies of the small cylinder in case ii are 2 57 hz at some measurement locations which are equal to the cf dominant frequencies the wake induced flutter occurs at vrs 12 52 this conclusion is supported by the ellipse shaped x y trajectories at the g7 measurement location of the small cylinder in case ii f il 2f cf but a frequency component f cf also exists compared to the small cylinder in case ii the x y trajectory in case i is more complicated and the ellipse shape is unstable this results in the x y trajectory of measurement point g7 being an unclear figure eight moreover as shown in figs 15 and 16 we also observed the trajectory of the upstream larger cylinder in cases i and ii the frequency spectrum of the large cylinder is so simple that the fiv response is dominated by one strong frequency in fig 15 the il dominant frequencies of the large cylinder in case ii are 5 30 hz and the cf dominant frequencies are 2 77 hz at different measurement locations fig 16 shows that for the large cylinder in case i the il dominant frequencies are 5 90 hz and the cf dominant frequencies are 2 93 hz as with the upstream cylinder the f il f cf of the large cylinder is approximately 2 0 the corresponding trajectories are the clear figure eights at the measurement locations which verifies these findings fig 17 shows the il displacement time histories of the large cylinder and small cylinder at seven measurement locations the time varying il displacements of the large cylinder show little amplitude fluctuations wake induced flutter acts on the small cylinder under the wake of the large cylinder additionally two unequal diameter cylinders present a staggered arrangement during vibration the vortex released from the upstream large cylinder affects the vortex formation at the bottom surface of the downstream cylinder mittal and kumar 2001 2004 the il time varying displacement values at the measurement locations from g2 to g6 fluctuate irregularly due to the unstable fluid force on the small cylinder the specific performance is that the positive and negative maximum values have no obvious periodic change and are not equal 4 conclusion the fiv response characteristics of two tandem unequal diameter cylinders are experimentally studied we created three distinct cases cases i ii and iii for the arrangement of the two cylinders and defined two il centre to centre spacing ratios t d 6 0 and 12 0 the similarities and differences with the isolated single cylinder and two identical flexible cylinders at the same spacing ratio were determined the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 when the large cylinder is located upstream cases i and ii the small cylinder has a slight effect on the cf and il fiv response which is mainly manifested in the dominant modes the dominant frequencies and the maximum rms displacement the cf displacement value of the large cylinder in case i is approximately half that of the isolated large cylinder at vrs 17 53 whereas the cf vibration of the large cylinder in case ii is almost unaffected this finding illustrates the influence of the presence and vibration of the small cylinder on the upstream large cylinder which depends on the given d d and t d in the tandem unequal diameter experiment 2 the downstream cylinder exhibits more complicated behaviour due to the significant wake effect from the upstream cylinder which has also been mentioned in the equal diameter experiment xu et al 2018b the wake shielding of the small cylinder with t d 6 0 has little effect on the downstream large cylinder due to d d 0 5 3 the strong shielding effect of the large cylinder in cases i and ii causes the downstream small cylinder to vibrate at low il dominant frequencies and modes where the il to cf frequency ratio f il f cf is approximately 1 0 weakened small cylinder vibration in the cf direction and increased vibration in the il direction are also observed which are related to wake induced flutter for two given spacing ratios the combination of proximity interference and wake interference acts on the downstream cylinder when the downstream cylinder is the small diameter cylinder the fiv response is more sensitive to il spacing ratios this conclusion is verified in the frequency spectra and x y trajectories of the small cylinder 4 moreover compared with equal diameter experiments xu et al 2018b 2020 when the upstream cylinder is the larger diameter cylinder wake induced flutter is more likely to occur increasing the diameter of the upstream cylinder significantly complicates the fiv response of the downstream cylinder in general through this experimental study we can better understand the fiv of two unequal diameter flexible cylinders in a tandem arrangement the results are significant for the design of engineering structures involving long flexible cylindrical groups however the working cases selected in this experiment are limited and only roughly analyse the relationship between the il spacing ratio diameter ratio and the fiv response of two flexible cylinders

corresponding author fluid structure interactions fsi of multiple cylindrical structures frequently occur in crossflows due to the different wake interference regions of flexible cylinders with different diameters the interaction between multiple cylinders is complicated and sensitive to the centre to centre spacing ratio and diameter ratio limited information has been presented on the flow induced vibration fiv of two unequal diameter flexible cylinders in a tandem arrangement in this paper an experimental investigation was carried out in a towing tank to study the fiv of two tandem flexible cylinders with different diameters that can vibrate in both the cross flow cf and in line il directions there were two il spacing ratios t d 12 0 and 6 0 where t is the centre to centre distance between two cylinders and d is the diameter of the small cylinder and the diameter ratio d d where d is the diameter of the large cylinder was nearly 0 5 the aspect ratios mass ratios of the small cylinder and the large cylinder were 350 1 90 and 181 1 47 respectively the towing velocity varied from 0 05 to 1 00 m s with an interval of 0 05 m s the reynolds numbers for the small and large cylinder were 800 16000 and 1600 32000 respectively the cf vibration of the upstream large cylinder with t d 6 0 was suppressed at vrs 16 28 18 79 whereas the cf vibration of the large cylinder with t d 12 0 was not influenced the downstream cylinder exhibited more complicated behaviour due to the significant wake effect from the upstream cylinder which is consistent with the two equal diameter cylinders the fiv response of the downstream small cylinder was more sensitive to the il spacing ratio because of the wake shielding effect of the large cylinder the downstream small cylinder vibrated at low il dominant frequencies and the il to cf frequency ratio f il f cf was approximately 1 0 moreover wake induced flutter was observed on the downstream small cylinder keywords flow induced vibration fiv multiple cylinders unequal diameter wake induced flutter tandem configuration 1 introduction multiple cylindrical structures are often arranged in tandem in various engineering applications such as tubes in heat exchangers overhead transmission line bundles and offshore risers when the incoming flow passes through a group of multiple cylinders the flow induced vibration fiv phenomenon may occur among the previous studies on the fiv of multiple cylinders the configuration with two cylinders in tandem has received more attention papaioannou et al 2008 kim et al 2009 assi et al 2010 carmo et al 2011 huang and herfjord 2013 xu et al 2018b 2018c 2019 for the flow patterns of two identical stationary cylinders in a tandem arrangement there are three basic regimes the extended body regime the reattachment regime and the co shedding regime zdravkovich 1987 zhou and yiu 2006 sumner 2010 the wake is classified into three regimes depending on spacing ratio t d where t is the centre to centre spacing of the two cylinders and d is the diameter of two identical cylinders i the extended body regime takes place when 1 0 t d 2 0 and the free shear layers roll up to form a single vortex street ii in the reattachment regime 2 0 t d 5 0 the free shear layers separated from the upstream cylinder are more likely to reattach onto the surface of the downstream cylinder iii in the co shedding regime t d 5 0 a vortex is generated by the upstream cylinder and subsequently interacts with those separated from the downstream cylinder for two elastically supported rigid cylinders arranged in tandem vortex shedding is the main mechanism that causes the initial vibration of the cylinder borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 the cross flow cf and in line il fiv responses of multiple cylinders are more complicated than those of an isolated cylinder borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 numerically investigated the fiv of two elastically mounted cylinders in a tandem arrangement at re 200 the two vibrating cylinders approach each other at sufficiently high reduced velocities which significantly reduces the size of the gap region thereby eliminating gap flow in such cases the two cylinders vibrate as a single body with vibration amplitudes lower than those where the gap flow is active huang and herfjord 2013 experimentally studied two elastically mounted rigid cylinders in a tandem arrangement subjected to steady flow with t d 2 0 5 0 both cylinders were free to vibrate in both the cf and il directions the fiv response of the downstream cylinder was dependent upon the reduced velocity which was influenced by the wake of the upstream cylinder the upstream cylinder was nearly unaffected by the downstream cylinder when the initial t d was greater than 3 0 however the fiv response of the downstream cylinder was largely influenced by the upstream cylinder in the t d range tested the increasing demand for offshore risers and transmission lines has prompted studies into the fiv of multiple flexible cylinders research has shown that the wake flow of two tandem flexible cylinders undergoing fiv is completely three dimensional wang et al 2017 according to the reduced velocity griffith et al 2017 divided the flow pattern of two tandem cylinders with a small pitch ratio centre to centre spacing of the two cylinders to the cylinder diameter into three modes the combination of vortices with the same sign corresponds to the first mode in the second mode the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is relatively larger and moves completely out of the wake of the upstream cylinder the vortex pair propagates backward and the subsequent vortex pair catches up with the previously formed vortex pair they merge and form an irregular vortex street in the third mode the small amplitude of the upstream cylinder and the large amplitude of the downstream cylinder cause a vortex to appear in the gap in the reattachment regime the vortex shedding is synchronized to form a more regular periodic vortex in the co shedding regime the superposition of the wakes makes them more complex and non periodic papaioannou et al 2008 bao et al 2012 huera huarte and bearman 2011 and huera huarte and gharib 2011 experimentally studied the dynamic response of two flexible cylinders with near and far wake interference for spacing ratio t d ranging from 2 0 to 8 0 when the spacing ratio was sufficiently large the response of the upstream cylinder exhibited typical vortex induced vibration viv and was almost the same as that of an isolated flexible cylinder because the vortex in the gap the downstream cylinder had a large response amplitudes caused by wake induced vibration later huera huarte et al 2016 performed experimental investigation of the fiv of a flexible cylinder located behind a stationary cylinder at various spacing ratios t d 2 0 6 0 the fiv was found to be a multi mode response comprising large amplitude contributions from several adjacent modes wang et al 2017 investigated the effect of t d on the hydrodynamic interactions and the fiv responses of two tandem flexible cylinders the fiv response of the two flexible cylinders was found to be similar to the typical response at a small t d once t d was sufficiently large for the vortex to be detached from the upstream cylinder the downstream cylinder was vibrated by the wake of the upstream cylinder xu et al 2018b experimentally observed that the fiv response of the downstream cylinder was determined by lower frequencies and dominant modes due to the wake shielding effect when the cylinders were in a tandem arrangement the influence of the il spacing ratio on the il response was more remarkable than that on the cf response ma et al 2019 studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of two flexible cylinders connected in tandem both wake shielding effect and the vortex shedding effect influenced the hydrodynamic features of the downstream cylinder in addition when t d 6 0 due to the wake shielding effect the fatigue damage of the downstream cylinder is reduced the downstream cylinder suffered more serious il fatigue damage under t d 10 0 and 16 0 at some reduced velocities owing to the dominant modal lag xu et al 2020 cylindrical structures with equal diameters are special whereas unequal diameter cylinders are more common in offshore engineering for example considering the needs of technology and economy it is necessary to arrange smaller diameter auxiliary pipes as ties near the main pipe these piggyback pipes can effectively reduce the cost of installing the pipeline but the presence of small diameter cylinders has a certain hydrodynamic impact on the area near the main pipe moreover cylinders that serve different operational functions can form the same cluster such as drilling and production risers from the perspective of space saving and economic benefits the diameters of these risers are different and the diameter ratio generally varies between 1 0 and 4 0 when subjected to the ocean flow the falling vortex shedding generated by these cylindrical structures can affect the stability and safety of the slender cylinders although some fiv characteristics of two cylinders with different diameters can be studied by considering equal diameter cylinders other unequal diameter characteristics remain unrevealed there are fewer studies on the staggered arrangement dalton et al 2001 pearcey et al 2017 zhao et al 2007 xu et al 2020 gao et al 2010 and lee et al 2012 studied the flows around two cylinders with unequal diameters in a side by side arrangement whereas few studies have been performed on unequal diameter cylinders in a tandem arrangement qin et al 2017 studied the cf fiv on an elastically mounted large cylinder in the wake of a smaller stationary cylinder the diameter ratios d d and il spacing ratios t d varied from 0 2 to 1 0 and from 2 0 to 6 5 respectively the severe vibration of the cylinder depended on both d d and t d it was found that as t d increased vibrations of the large cylinder occurred at a smaller d d the wake from the small cylinder was narrow and the shear layer tended to switch its direction from one side to the other huang and sworn 2011 studied the hydrodynamic interaction of elastically supported rigid cylinders that oscillated freely in the cf and il directions in a water tank the diameter of the upstream cylinder was twice that of the downstream cylinder and the t d varied from 1 0 to 10 0 moreover the reynolds number was in the subcritical range the test results showed that the vibration response of the downstream cylinder was dependent on its actual reduced velocity the frequency components of the cf fiv of the downstream cylinder included the vortex shedding of the upstream cylinder and its vortex shedding the relative importance of the two sources of excitation was influenced by t d later huang and sworn 2013 conducted fiv experiments of two tandem and staggered cylinders with unequal diameters the t d varied from 1 0 to 15 0 for the upstream cylinder the viv was similar to the classical lock in response unless the t d was less than 2 0 as previously mentioned the studies of fiv response have mainly focused on equal diameter cylindrical structures in tandem side by side and staggered arrangements in our previous experimental studies on two identical cylinders undergoing fiv xu et al 2018a 2018b 2020 it was found that the multi mode and high amplitude features can better reflect the dynamic response of the long flexible cylinders few studies have investigated the fiv response of two unequal diameter flexible cylinders xu et al 2020 instead previous studies mainly focused on the flow patterns of multiple cylinders with different diameters this study performed experiments on unequal diameter cylinders to investigate their interesting fiv phenomena multiple long flexible cylindrical structures in a tandem arrangement are prone to experiencing fiv such vibrations are the main source of fatigue failures and these vibrations can result in structural damage when combined with wake interactions the outline of the rest of this paper is as follows section 2 presents a detailed description of the experimental setup and experimental details and introduces the methods for processing the measured strain signals and the reconstruction of the displacement responses section 3 presents and discusses the experimental results finally some conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 experimental descriptions and data analysis the il spacing plays an important role in the fiv and wake flow fields between two tandem flexible cylinders papaioannou et al 2008 wang et al 2017 zdravkovich 1987 studied most spacing in a wake interference region under the tandem configuration and the downstream cylinders were placed in the wake interference region where t d 6 0 the flow regions were divided depending on the diameter of the upstream cylinder therefore the interference area was larger when the diameter of the upstream cylinder was larger than that of the downstream cylinder in our previous experiment xu et al 2018b the separation distance between the two cylinders varied through five spacing ratios with t d 4 0 6 0 8 0 10 0 and 16 0 and obvious wake interference was observed from t d 6 0 to 16 0 huang and sworn 2011 studied the hydrodynamic interaction of unequal diameter rigid cylinders where the smaller cylinder was located downstream the influence of the downstream cylinder on the upstream cylinder is negligible at t d 5 0 t d 1 0 at the smaller spacing ratio the response of the downstream smaller cylinder is identical to that of the larger cylinder the yellow dashed lines in fig 1 delineate the four types of flow regions classified by zdravkovich 1987 around two cylinders undergoing flow interactions however that investigation was based on two elastically mounted rigid cylinders and the region classification was assumed to be slightly different from the result of our present study with two unequal diameter flexible cylinders for comparison we still divided the entire plane into four regions based on that study proximity interference wake interference proximity and wake interference and no interference as shown in fig 1 in the first region of proximity interference the two cylinders are close to each other and one is not submerged in the wake of the other when the downstream cylinder is in the second region of wake interference it is partially or fully submerged in the wake of the upstream cylinder the third type is a combination of the first two types the fourth region is the no interference region with negligibly weak interference between the two cylinders however since a flexible cylinder has a more complex response than a fixed cylinder the division of the flow area is only for reference as shown in fig 1 two unequal diameter cylinders in tandem arrangement were experimentally tested three experimental cases i ii and iii in this study were considered depending on the centre to centre spacing ratio t d and the relative position upstream or downstream in cases i and ii the small cylinder was located upstream of the large cylinder with t d 6 0 and 12 0 respectively in case iii the large cylinder was upstream of the small cylinder with t d 6 0 and the large cylinder was in the wake interference region the diameter ratio of the two unequal diameter cylinders was 0 5 in this experiment therefore when the centre to centre distance was 6d in case i the downstream small cylinder was located in the proximity and wake interference region the fiv of two unequal diameter cylinders arranged in a tandem configuration was experimentally investigated at the state key laboratory of hydraulic engineering simulation and safety at tianjin university the main apparatus was installed at the supporting frame in the experiment as shown in fig 2 including the supporting frame vertical supporting rods guide plate dials and the axial tension systems the apparatuses used in the experiment were slightly different from two equal diameter cylinders in different arrangements xu et al 2018a 2018b 2020 the supporting rods and supporting plates which were made of steel were the main vertical supporting devices the number of sturdy vertical supporting rods was increased from two to four the guide plates made of the hard plastic plate were installed on the supporting plate through several long bolts to avoid interference of the supporting devices under incoming flow and ensure that the incoming flow was two dimensional the supporting plate dial and the guide plate dial were added the position angle of the two unequal diameter cylindrical models could be changed by rotating the plate dial to achieve different arrangements tandem side by side and staggered for example from case i to case iii the plate dial only needed to be rotated 180 the tensioner was used to adjust the axial tension of the flexible cylinder and the springs were used to ensure that the axial tension did not change suddenly the load cell was used to collect the information on the end tension of the flexible cylinder model the initial axial pretension force was 450 n the cylindrical model was divided into an outer silicone tube and an internal copper tube as shown in fig 3 for each flexible cylinder model the il and cf bending strains were measured with two pairs of strain gauges installed at the inner tube the copper tube and the silicone tube were closely connected and were guaranteed not to be separated during the operation seven measurement locations g1 g7 were arranged uniformly along the cylinder with a length of l 5 6 m signal aliasing occurred during sampling and the sampling frequency was 100 hz after the experimental test started the sampling time for each test was 50 s fifteen minutes elapsed before the next test was started which ensured the water was clam the towing velocity in a 137 0 m 7 0 m 3 3 m length width depth tank was guaranteed to vary from 0 05 m s to 1 0 m s at increments of 0 05 m s the reynolds numbers of the small cylinder and the large cylinder were 800 16 000 and 1600 32 000 respectively the two cylinders were within the range of 300 re 3 105 which was the subcritical region the reynolds number of the small cylinder was chosen for all three cases from the perspective of space savings and economic benefits different functional risers were designed with different diameter ratios which typically varied from 0 25 to 1 0 to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of unequal diameter cylinders the diameter ratio d d where d is the smaller diameter and d is the larger diameter is a key parameter for example song et al 2015 selected d d from 0 1 to 1 6 when studying hydrodynamics and vortex shedding characteristics of two cylinders with different diameters in a steady flow alam and zhou 2008 studied the strouhal number fluid force and flow structure of two tandem cylinders with d d in the range of 0 24 1 0 the diameter of the cylinder in our previous experiments was 0 016 m xu et al 2018a b d therefore the small cylinder in this study had a diameter of d 0 016 m and the large cylinder had a diameter of d 0 031 m the diameter ratio selected in this experiment was nearly 0 5 which was also commonly selected in studies with a fixed diameter ratio lam and to 2003 studied the fiv responses of two cylinders with d 0 031 m and d 0 016 m zhao et al 2007 also studied two unequal diameter cylinders with a diameter ratio of 0 5 the aspect ratio length to diameter of the small cylinder was 350 and that of the large cylinder was 181 in the test the mass per unit length m s of the small cylinder was 0 3821 kg m and that of the larger cylinder was 1 1071 kg m moreover the corresponding mass ratios m were 1 90 and 1 47 the other specific parameters of the two cylindrical models are shown in table 1 the damping ratios of the two cylinders were determined from the free decay tests and calculated by 1 ζ ln a i a i j 2 j π where a i and a i j are the strain response amplitudes of the i th and the i j th cycles respectively in the present experimental tests the damping ratios of the small cylinder and the large cylinder were ζ s 0 034 and ζ l 0 031 respectively the root mean square rms displacement amplitudes response frequencies dominant modes and x y trajectories of the two flexible cylinders undergoing fiv in tandem are presented and discussed for three typical cases i ii and iii these fiv characteristics of the two flexible cylinders vary with the reduced velocity which is defined by the free flow velocity the cylinder diameter and the natural frequency however the diameters of the two cylinder models in this experiment are unequal moreover their natural frequencies are also different for an expedient comparison the reduced velocity was uniformly defined by the parameters of the small cylinder in this study 2 v r s u f s 1 d where f s 1 is the first order natural frequency of the small cylinder these natural frequencies of the cylinder in our free decay tests were not completely the same hence f s 1 was set to the theoretical value to avoid slight differences the theoretical value of f s n can be calculated as follows 3 f s n n t a m 1 π l 2 e i m 1 1 2 2 l similarly the natural frequency f l n of the large cylinder can be calculated as follows 4 f l n n t a m 2 π l 2 e i m 2 1 2 2 l where f s n and f l n are the nth order eigenfrequencies of the small and large cylinders respectively the experimentally measured and theoretical values of the natural frequencies of two unequal diameter cylinders are given in table 2 which shows that the reliability of the experimental results is high therefore a modal approach is required to obtain the displacement from the curvature measurements not only at the locations of the gauges but also at every point on the flexible cylinder the selected modal analysis technique has previously been successfully applied to analyse the measurement data associated with viv tests of long flexible risers lie and kaasen 2006 the modal analysis method was used to reconstruct the displacement information of the cylinder from the filtered strain signal taking the cf displacement reconstruction as an example the following formula was written 5 y z t n 1 w n t ϕ n z z 0 l the cylinder can be simplified to a bernoulli euler beam with both ends pinned the mode shape of displacement can be expressed as follows 6 ϕ n z sin π n z l z 0 l furthermore reconstruction of the displacement response was based on the relationship between curvature and strain the relationship between strain and displacement can be expressed as follows 7 ε z p t r n 1 7 π n l sin π n z l w n t p 1 7 n 1 7 the modal weight w n t was calculated according to eq 4 then w n t was brought into eq 2 to solve the displacement information the meanings of the symbols in eqs 2 7 are shown in table 1 lie and kaasen 2006 also used strain signals and conducted identifiable analyses however this method has difficulty accurately distinguishing the real signal from noise for low modes in addition the results with higher dominant modes are reliable because they are less influenced by the noise of the lower mode the measurement noises under low flow velocities may introduce errors in the displacement calculation therefore the present displacement response is analysed from a towing velocity of 0 15 m s to 1 0 m s the coordinates of a point on the cylinder are identified as y z t x z t as shown in eq 5 the rms value y rms z i x rms z i with respect to time can provide a general indication of the magnitude of the cf and il displacements at a span location z 8 y r m s z i 1 λ i 1 λ y z i t 2 x r m s z i 1 λ i 1 λ x z i t 2 where z i is the position along the axis of the cylinder and λ is the number of samples in the selected period the sampling duration of each test is 50 s and the selected time range is 20 40 s in offshore engineering applications the maximum displacement of a flexible cylindrical structure is the main factor that affects the design of the riser arrangement this will effectively avoid collision damage to the slender structure in the present study we chose the maximum dimensionless cf and il rms displacements max x rms max y rms to reflect the magnitude of the fiv response note that max y rms and max x rms can be determined from the following equations 9 m a x y r m s m a x 1 i n y r m s z i 10 m a x x r m s m a x 1 i n x r m s z i the meaning of some of the symbols in eqs 9 and 10 can be found in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 dominant modes and dominant frequencies fig 4 shows the dominant modes of two tandem cylinders with unequal diameters in the cf direction the dominant mode has the largest modal weight from eq 7 the cf dominant mode of two cylinders increases from lower modes to higher modes as vrs increases for example in two cases where the large cylinder is upstream of the small cylinder cases i and ii the dominant mode increases from the first order at vrs 3 76 to the third order at vrs 25 05 the variation in the cf dominant mode of the upstream large cylinder with vrs is almost the same as that of the isolated large cylinder the upstream small cylinder in case iii and the isolated small cylinder also have the same trend however the cf dominant modes of the upstream cylinder at t d 4 0 and 6 0 are lower than that of the isolated cylinder in the equal diameter experiment xu et al 2018b for tandem cylinders with small spacing ratios in the proximity and wake interference regions the near wake of the upstream cylinder is affected by the downstream cylinder zhou and alam 2016 nevertheless the upstream larger cylinder in case i is less affected at the same spacing ratio due to the smaller diameter of the downstream cylinder it can be verified that the existence and vibration of the downstream small cylinder have little effect on the cf dominant mode for the downstream cylinder the mode transitions between two adjacent vibration modes are delayed by increases in vrs due to the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder the synchronization region of the vibration mode is extended fig 5 shows the dominant modes of two tandem cylinders with unequal diameters in the il direction aside from the difference in the switching region of the vibration mode the small cylinder in case iii and the isolated cylinder exhibit similar behaviour the maximum il dominant modes of the upstream cylinder and the isolated cylinder are both sixth order the dominant modes in both the cf and il directions are different from those in the equal diameter experiment xu et al 2018b the comparison of the upstream cylinder in cases i and ii shows that the dominant modes of the upstream large cylinder with t d 6 0 are more similar to that of the isolated large cylinder due to the larger diameter of the upstream cylinder and the smaller spacing ratio the downstream cylinder may sit inside the vortex formation region of the upstream cylinder and the two cylinders behave as a single bluff body in the equal diameter experiment xu et al 2018b the fluid behaviour in the reattachment regime can be observed at the same spacing ratio in addition the il dominant modes of the downstream cylinder change drastically with vrs as evidenced by the large cylinder in case iii therefore when the large cylinder is located upstream of the small cylinder the lower mode vibrations of the small cylinder are caused by the strong shielding effects of the upstream cylinder figs 6 and 7 show the variations in the dimensionless cf and il dominant frequencies f cf f s 1 and f cf f l 1 f il f s 1 and f il f l 1 with respect to vrs for the unequal diameter cylinders respectively the fast fourier transform is employed to calculate the dominant frequencies from the time varying displacement the cf and il dominant frequencies are normalized with f s 1 and f l 1 which are calculated from eqs 3 and 4 respectively the diagonal grey dashed lines represent the strouhal number corresponding to the cf and il vortex shedding frequency of a stationary cylinder in the different selected cases the cf and il dominant frequencies of the upstream cylinder the large cylinder in cases i and ii and the small cylinder in case iii are similar to those of the isolated cylinder the effect of the downstream cylinder on the frequency response of the upstream cylinder is almost negligible in addition the upstream large cylinder behaves similarly with two different spacing ratios however the dimensionless dominant frequencies of the downstream cylinder in two directions are affected by the upstream cylinder and the spacing ratio this characteristic was also observed in the experiment of two equal diameter cylinders in a tandem arrangement xu et al 2018b it is clear in figs 6 and 7 that the downstream small cylinder oscillates with a lower dominant frequency than the isolated small cylinder there is synchronization between the dominant frequencies of the downstream small cylinder and the natural frequencies of different vibration modes as vrs increases there is a strong wake effect at t d 6 0 and 12 0 as the spacing ratio increases the dimensionless cf and il dominant frequencies slightly decrease because the diameter ratio d d is nearly 0 5 the free shear layers separated from the upstream large cylinder are more likely to reattach onto the surface of the downstream cylinder even at t d 12 0 when the small cylinder is located in the rear upper side of the large cylinder the shedding behind the cylinder is influenced by the shear layers behind the gap zhao et al 2005 2007 therefore if the small cylinder is located in wake interference it will be more affected by wake shielding this causes the true in flow velocities to differ from the free flow velocities for two equal diameter flexible cylinders in tandem it was also found that the strouhal frequency of the downstream cylinder was lower xu et al 2018b huang and herfjord 2013 also noted that the fiv of the downstream cylinder was strongly affected by the true in flow velocities when the large cylinder is located downstream its cf and il dominant frequencies are slightly affected by the upstream smaller cylinder and the values are close to those of the isolated cylinder this reveals that the effect of the downstream cylinder on the frequency response of the upstream cylinder is nearly negligible although the downstream large cylinder is in the wake interference region of the upstream small cylinder the upstream cylinder cannot completely cover the downstream cylinder due to the given diameter ratio d d 0 5 it is possible that the downstream large cylinder is located outside the vortex formation region of the upstream small cylinder and is periodically hit by the impingement of the kaman vortex shed from the upstream cylinder karman vortex shedding can now occur from both the upstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder therefore for the downstream large cylinder although the vortex shedding area is still affected by the true in flow velocity the true in flow velocity and free stream velocity in other areas are not much different fig 8 shows the relationship between the il to cf dominant frequency ratios f il f cf and vrs according to fig 8 for the small cylinder in cases i and ii f il f cf 2 0 at individual vrs 3 76 12 52 13 78 17 54 20 04 21 29 which indicates that a dual resonance occurs however the value of f il f cf is approximately 1 0 at most reduced velocities by analysing the f il f cf and dominant modes when the small cylinder is located behind the large cylinder it vibrates in low order modes the first order and second order modes as shown in figs 4 and 5 it can be considered that the same cf and il dominant frequencies of the small cylinder in cases i and ii are related to the low order mode vibrations caused by the strong shielding effect of the large cylinder in these cases this corresponds to the previous analysis of the dominant mode 3 2 displacement responses fig 9 shows the maximum rms dimensionless displacement of the small cylinder and the large cylinder as a function of vrs in the cf direction it should be noted that the cf and il displacements of the two unequal diameter cylinders are nondimensionalized by using their own diameters the fiv results of their respective isolated flexible cylinders are also included for comparison the vibration of the flexible cylinder exhibits high order vibration modes and multi mode competition regarding two tandem flexible cylinders with wake interference no matter how the spacing ratio changes the cylinders show classic viv response characteristics within the reduced velocity range corresponding to the typical lock in region the max y rms d and max y rms d reach local peaks when mode resonance occurs and then decrease before the vibration enters the next mode at vrs 13 78 as the vrs increases the dynamic behaviour of two cylinders differs greatly according to the spacing ratio of the cylinders and the vortex between the two cylinders as shown in fig 9 a the maximum rms cf displacement of the large cylinder in case ii varies similarly to that of the isolated large cylinder the specific performance is that both peaks of max y rms occur at vrs 18 79 and then decrease at vrs 20 04 these values are close the variations in the cf dominant modes and frequencies of the large cylinder in case ii are also similar to those of the isolated large cylinder this indicates that the fiv of the upstream large cylinder is not sensitive to the presence of downstream small cylinders the cf displacement response curve of the large cylinder in case i generally follows those of the large cylinder in case ii and the isolated large one for example a significant decrease occurs at vrs 21 29 in these curves however a significant difference was observed between the two curves in a vrs range of 15 03 20 04 for example the maximum value of max y rms in case ii is approximately 3 21 at vrs 18 79 whereas it is 1 83 at vrs 17 53 in case i this indicates that in the tandem unequal diameter experiment the spacing t d 6 0 and 12 0 between the two cylinders significantly influences the displacement amplitude of the upstream large cylinder at several reduced velocities wu and wang 2018 numerically studied the fiv of a cylinder with a downstream rigidly connected control rod for t d 4 and 8 the vortex of the main cylinder can form and develop in the gap the effect of the control rod on the fiv characteristics of the master cylinder was negligible because the cylinder system was excited by the main cylinder however the difference between the isolated large cylinder and the downstream large cylinder in case iii is significant combined with the dominant mode shown in fig 9 a the cf response amplitude of the large cylinder gradually increases and vrs increases in vibration mode the wake generated by the upstream small cylinder affects the cf response of the downstream large cylinder the small cylinder can suppress the vibration of the large cylinder when it is near the large cylinder t d 6 0 whether it is upstream or downstream it is obvious that when t d 6 0 in the tandem arrangement it has an inhibitory effect on the large cylinder the variations in the rms cf displacement with respect to vrs for the small cylinder in case iii and the isolated small cylinder are similar in fig 9 b which reveals that it is less affected by the downstream larger cylinder compared with the upstream cylinder in an equal diameter test xu et al 2018b the il vibration of the small cylinder in case iii increases slightly at vrs 10 02 15 03 and is similar at other reduced velocities this indicates that the diameter of the downstream cylinder has a slight effect on the vibration of the upstream cylinder the difference between the isolated small cylinder and the downstream small cylinder in cases i and ii is significant the wake generated from the upstream large cylinder suppresses the cf response vibration amplitude the distinct feature in fig 9 b is that the max y rms of the small cylinder with t d 6 0 is generally smaller than that of the isolated small cylinder at many reduced velocities the max y rms of the isolated small cylinder is higher up to 2 3 times greater than that of the small cylinder in cases i and ii we believe that both the shielding effect of the upstream cylinder and the diameter ratio of the two cylinders help reduce the effect of the incoming fluid force on the downstream cylinder and subsequently reduce the vibration amplitudes fig 10 shows the maximum il rms dimensionless displacement of the two cylinders versus the reduced velocity the calculation of the maximum il rms displacement max x rms is the same as that of max y rms the max x rms values of the upstream cylinder and the isolated cylinder exhibit similar variations with respect to vrs as shown in fig 10 this indicates that the spacing ratio t d does not affect the il displacement amplitude upstream in the tandem unequal diameter test however xu et al 2018b found obvious differences between the isolated cylinder and the upstream cylinder in the tandem equal diameter test which reveals that the t d affects the max y rms when the cylinders oscillate the two tandem flexible cylinders present a staggered arrangement for the fiv of two staggered rigid cylinders the il displacement of the upstream cylinder is larger than that of the isolated cylinder prasanth and mittal 2009 however the cf displacements of two unequal diameter cylinders appear to be suppressed as shown in fig 9 the cf spacing is not sufficiently large to make the gap flow increase the il displacement of the cylinders moreover no matter whether the large cylinder is located upstream or downstream when t d 6 0 the il vibration amplitude data do not fluctuate significantly the il vibrations of the large cylinder in case iii are close to those of the isolated large cylinder as previously mentioned max x rms is not sensitive to the il spacing ratio or relative position in the unequal diameter experiment as shown in fig 10 b max x rms of the small cylinder in cases i and ii differ from that of the isolated small cylinder the il rms displacement of the small cylinder increases with respect to vrs reaching a peak in the frequency locked region and subsequently decreasing when it turns to the next mode for example for the small cylinder in case i vrs in the second order mode is from 8 77 to 16 28 and the il displacement amplitude increases to twice that of the isolated small cylinder this means that the wake generated by the upstream large cylinder has a significant impact on the il response amplitudes of the downstream small cylinder in addition max x rms of the small cylinder in case ii is different from that of the small cylinder in case i combined with fig 9 b it is obvious that the effect of the spacing ratio on the il response is as significant as that on the cf response moreover max y rms of the downstream small cylinder is lower than that of the isolated small cylinder whereas max x rms is higher xu et al 2018b found that the il displacement of the downstream cylinder continually increased after the il displacement of the isolated cylinder reached the local peak which can also be attributed to wake induced flutter to investigate the fiv characteristics of two tandem flexible cylinders subjected to uniform flow the cf and il responses of the large cylinder and small cylinder at vrs 17 54 are analysed in figs 11 and 12 the three subplots in each column represent case i case ii and case iii the first column illustrates the spanwise distribution of the dimensionless rms cf displacement the second column is a space time varying non dimensional displacement contour of the rms cf displacements at time intervals ranging from 20 s to 21 s the third and fourth columns are two corresponding graphs in the il direction fig 11 shows that for the large cylinder in cases ii and iii the cf and il vibrations are controlled by the second order mode and the fourth order mode respectively in case i the il vibration of the large cylinder is controlled by the third order mode compared to the isolated large cylinder the il displacement of the large cylinder in case i is slightly larger which agrees with the vibration in fig 10 in the three cases the il direction of the small cylinder shows a combination of standing and travelling waves and the cf direction is mainly a standing wave response as shown in fig 12 due to the combination of the travelling wave and the standing wave an asymmetry develops in the displacement distribution for the small cylinder in cases i and ii due to the wake of the upstream large cylinder compared with the isolated small cylinder the il vibration displacement increases and the cf displacement decreases for example the cf peak amplitude of the isolated cylinder basically reaches approximately 1 2 whereas the maximum value of the small cylinder is approximately 0 5 the cf direction vibration of the small cylinder is suppressed and the amplitude is approximately half that of the isolated small cylinder however the maximum il amplitude of the small cylinder is nearly twice that of the isolated cylinder in case i and nearly 1 5 times that in case ii when the small cylinder is located downstream it is more obviously affected by the upstream larger cylinder when t d is smaller t d 6 0 the space time varying non dimensional displacement contours of the small cylinder in the cf and il directions indicate a combination of standing and travelling waves which are more obvious in the il direction 3 3 response trajectories fig 7 shows that the il dominant frequencies of the small cylinder in cases i and ii are lower than those of the isolated small cylinder for an isolated cylinder the il strouhal frequency is 0 326 and the cf strouhal frequency is 0 163 the il to cf strouhal frequency ratio is 2 0 for the cylinder in many studies f il f cf 2 0 indicated the occurrence of dual resonance song et al 2011 zhu et al 2016 xu et al 2018a b naudascher 2017 noticed that wake induced flutter was a coupled mode flutter with a lower frequency and a higher frequency wake induced flutter generally causes the dominant frequencies of the downstream cylinder to be the same in the cf and il directions which can be reflected by the small cylinder in cases i and ii as shown in fig 8 when the small cylinder is the downstream cylinder cases i and ii and the il to cf dimensionless dominant frequency ratio is 1 0 wake induced flutter can lead to ellipse shaped motion trajectories and increasing il displacement as shown in figs 13 and 14 the row of each subpicture represents one measurement location g1 g7 from top to bottom the first column contains the cf and il frequency spectrum curves the second column shows the cf and il displacement time histories the third column contains x y trajectories the il and cf frequency spectrum curves show that the fiv response of the small cylinder consists of the highest strong frequency and multiple weaker frequencies because the t d is smaller the upstream large cylinder has a greater impact and the small cylinder in case i has a more complex response than the small cylinder in case ii according to the frequency spectrum curves the il frequencies of the small cylinder in case ii are 2 57 hz at some measurement locations which are equal to the cf dominant frequencies the wake induced flutter occurs at vrs 12 52 this conclusion is supported by the ellipse shaped x y trajectories at the g7 measurement location of the small cylinder in case ii f il 2f cf but a frequency component f cf also exists compared to the small cylinder in case ii the x y trajectory in case i is more complicated and the ellipse shape is unstable this results in the x y trajectory of measurement point g7 being an unclear figure eight moreover as shown in figs 15 and 16 we also observed the trajectory of the upstream larger cylinder in cases i and ii the frequency spectrum of the large cylinder is so simple that the fiv response is dominated by one strong frequency in fig 15 the il dominant frequencies of the large cylinder in case ii are 5 30 hz and the cf dominant frequencies are 2 77 hz at different measurement locations fig 16 shows that for the large cylinder in case i the il dominant frequencies are 5 90 hz and the cf dominant frequencies are 2 93 hz as with the upstream cylinder the f il f cf of the large cylinder is approximately 2 0 the corresponding trajectories are the clear figure eights at the measurement locations which verifies these findings fig 17 shows the il displacement time histories of the large cylinder and small cylinder at seven measurement locations the time varying il displacements of the large cylinder show little amplitude fluctuations wake induced flutter acts on the small cylinder under the wake of the large cylinder additionally two unequal diameter cylinders present a staggered arrangement during vibration the vortex released from the upstream large cylinder affects the vortex formation at the bottom surface of the downstream cylinder mittal and kumar 2001 2004 the il time varying displacement values at the measurement locations from g2 to g6 fluctuate irregularly due to the unstable fluid force on the small cylinder the specific performance is that the positive and negative maximum values have no obvious periodic change and are not equal 4 conclusion the fiv response characteristics of two tandem unequal diameter cylinders are experimentally studied we created three distinct cases cases i ii and iii for the arrangement of the two cylinders and defined two il centre to centre spacing ratios t d 6 0 and 12 0 the similarities and differences with the isolated single cylinder and two identical flexible cylinders at the same spacing ratio were determined the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 when the large cylinder is located upstream cases i and ii the small cylinder has a slight effect on the cf and il fiv response which is mainly manifested in the dominant modes the dominant frequencies and the maximum rms displacement the cf displacement value of the large cylinder in case i is approximately half that of the isolated large cylinder at vrs 17 53 whereas the cf vibration of the large cylinder in case ii is almost unaffected this finding illustrates the influence of the presence and vibration of the small cylinder on the upstream large cylinder which depends on the given d d and t d in the tandem unequal diameter experiment 2 the downstream cylinder exhibits more complicated behaviour due to the significant wake effect from the upstream cylinder which has also been mentioned in the equal diameter experiment xu et al 2018b the wake shielding of the small cylinder with t d 6 0 has little effect on the downstream large cylinder due to d d 0 5 3 the strong shielding effect of the large cylinder in cases i and ii causes the downstream small cylinder to vibrate at low il dominant frequencies and modes where the il to cf frequency ratio f il f cf is approximately 1 0 weakened small cylinder vibration in the cf direction and increased vibration in the il direction are also observed which are related to wake induced flutter for two given spacing ratios the combination of proximity interference and wake interference acts on the downstream cylinder when the downstream cylinder is the small diameter cylinder the fiv response is more sensitive to il spacing ratios this conclusion is verified in the frequency spectra and x y trajectories of the small cylinder 4 moreover compared with equal diameter experiments xu et al 2018b 2020 when the upstream cylinder is the larger diameter cylinder wake induced flutter is more likely to occur increasing the diameter of the upstream cylinder significantly complicates the fiv response of the downstream cylinder in general through this experimental study we can better understand the fiv of two unequal diameter flexible cylinders in a tandem arrangement the results are significant for the design of engineering structures involving long flexible cylindrical groups however the working cases selected in this experiment are limited and only roughly analyse the relationship between the il spacing ratio diameter ratio and the fiv response of two flexible cylinders

21319,resistance reduction has always been a concerning problem in pipeline transportation projects moreover adding fine particles has shown resistance reduction therefore we studied the effect of adding finer particles on the transport characteristics of coarse particle slurries in pipelines the flow conditions and slurry characteristics such as the flow velocity and particle volume concentration and the addition of finer particles can reduce the resistance of coarse particle slurries under certain working conditions in this study the changes in the transport characteristics of slurries with 0 44 mm diameter glass balls after adding an equal volume of 0 125 mm diameter glass balls under different flow velocities and volume concentrations were analysed the effects of adding fine particles on the transport characteristics of coarse particles under different flow conditions were determined including the distributions of the particle volume concentration velocity particle pressure and wall shear stress we observed that adding fine particles could change the flow regime of coarse particles near the critical flow velocity from sliding bed to heterogeneous flow thereby considerably reducing the pipeline resistance by approximately 20 at a high flow velocity heterogeneous or homogeneous flow the addition of fine particles will increase the resistance the study results explain the mechanism and characteristics of resistance reduction on adding fine particles from the perspective of changing the flow regime these findings can serve as a reference for further studying the resistance reduction mechanism on adding fine particles and for finding the optimal particle size distribution for slurry transport in pipelines keywords resistance reduction mechanism finer particles slurry flow regime euler euler two fluid model 1 introduction pipeline transportation is extensively used in dredging food coal oil and other industries as it requires a less initial investment while being environmentally friendly and providing easy optimisation of control parameters in pipeline transportation drag resistance is the main part of the operating cost therefore drag resistance reduction has always been the focus of research on pipeline transportation fei et al 1991 analysed complex slurries slurries with a range of particle sizes such slurries have overlapping flow regimes including homogeneous pseudo homogeneous heterogeneous and fully stratified regimes as defined by wilson et al 2006 these researchers found that complex slurries could significantly reduce the starting speed of large particles and friction resistance of coarse particles when studying debris flows therefore in long distance pipeline transportation systems complex slurry transportation is extremely beneficial for operating the system economically however the mechanism of the resistance reduction in complex slurries has not been thoroughly studied various methods have been proposed for complex slurry resistance but the general idea coincides with the two phase flow model defined by wasp 1977 he proposed separating the slurry particles into two motion forms one is the homogeneous flow consisting of the liquid and small particles uniformly diffused acting as the means of transport the drag resistance produced in this part can be regarded as the friction resistance of the pure liquid with the same density as that of the slurry given as follows 1 i m i w s m where i w represents the loss of water friction and s m represents the specific gravity of the slurry another motion form is the heterogeneous flow which transports particles that are distributed unevenly under the effect of gravity the resistance of this flow is calculated according to the durand 1952 formula as given below 2 i m i w 1 121 c v f v 2 g d s 1 g d s 1 w 1 5 where c vf represents the efflux solid volume concentration d represents the size of the particles d represents the diameter of the pipe s represents the specific gravity of the solid v represents the slurry velocity and w denotes the velocity of the particle settlement these two different forms are divided according to the following rule wasp 1963 3 log c v y 0 92 c v y 0 5 1 8 w β k v where c v y a is the specific local solid volume concentration y a is the dimensionless position along the vertical axis of the pipe which is defined as y y d where y is the distance from the pipe bottom and d is the pipe diameter k denotes the von karman constant k 0 35 0 4 β denotes a coefficient β 1 1 5 and v denotes the friction velocity 1 1 criteria for identifying homogeneous and heterogeneous flow regimes in complex slurries wasp 1977 used c v y 0 92 c v y 0 5 when 0 1 c v y 0 92 c v y 0 5 0 8 the flow is considered heterogeneous whereas it is considered homogeneous when c v y 0 92 c v y 0 5 0 8 furthermore miedema 2017 used the stokes number s tk and when s tk 0 03 the flow is considered homogeneous for convenience during calculation wilson et al 2006 directly used the particle size d and when d 0 04 mm the flow is considered homogeneous although these criteria for determining the flow regimes are different the corresponding particle sizes are all at the micron level 1 2 resistance of the heterogeneous part wilson et al 2006 considered that except for the particles having sizes less than 0 04 mm and are involved in a homogeneous flow there are three different flow regimes the first regime is pseudo homogeneous flow which is composed of particles that are greater than 0 04 mm and less than 0 15 mm the second regime is heterogeneous flow including particles with diameters that are 0 15 to 0 018 times the diameter of the pipe finally the third regime is fully stratified flow consisting of particles whose diameters are more than 0 018 times the diameter of the pipe the total resistance is the algebraic sum of the resistances of these three regimes and that of the homogeneous part similarly miedema 2017 proposed that except for the carrier phase and heterogeneous flow with s tk less than 0 03 there is a part with particle sizes larger than 0 018 times the diameter of the pipe exhibiting sliding flow the total resistance is the algebraic sum of the resistances of each part however when calculating the resistance of the heterogeneous and sliding parts it is necessary to modify the viscosity of the carrier phase having coarse particles with the volume concentration of the homogeneous part using the thomas 1965 model given as follows 4 μ x μ f 1 2 5 c v x 10 05 c v x 2 0 00273 e 16 6 c v x where c v x represents the concentration of the pseudo homogeneous fluid li et al 2018a also believe that under certain working conditions the fixed bed sliding heterogeneous pseudo homogeneous and homogeneous flow regimes may exist simultaneously they point out that the finer particles in the different flow regimes together constitute the carrier phase of the different regime coarser part of the flow therefore in their model the effective viscosity resulting from the volume concentrations of the homogeneous and pseudo homogeneous parts is used to modify the carrier phase of the heterogeneous part moreover all the fine particle concentrations are needed to correct the parameters of the carrier phase in this part in their view except for the drag reduction effect of finer particles on the viscosity of the slurry the effect of particle size distribution on the additional resistance becomes increasingly significant when the particle concentration is higher than a certain degree therefore when calculating the total drag resistance the sum of the resistances of various flow regimes needs to be multiplied by the drag reduction coefficient given as follows li et al 2018a 5 α 0 69 0 99 lg μ r 0 075 lg c u 1 27 lg μ r lg c u 0 165 lg μ r 2 0 082 lg c u 2 where c u represents the coefficient of uniformity and μ r represents the relative dynamic viscosity 1 3 finer particle addition for drag reduction kaushal et al 2005 conducted their resistance tests in pipes with inner diameters of 54 9 mm they used glass spheres with diameters of 0 125 and 0 44 mm three types of tests were conducted using fine particles and coarse particles with diameters measuring 0 125 and 0 44 mm respectively and their equal weight mixture under an average flow velocity of 2 m s the transport pressure drop for the slurry was 1567 pa m having a volume concentration of 20 with only 0 44 mm diameter particle however the transport pressure drop for the slurry was 1260 pa m having a volume concentration of 40 comprising both 0 125 and 0 44 mm diameter particles mixed equally by weight roughly similar to adding an equal volume of 0 125 mm particles into the slurry having a volume concentration of 20 and particle size of 0 44 mm this is nearly 20 lower than the resistance of the single sized particle d 0 44 mm slurry therefore we can infer that the resistance of the mixed slurry is not just the algebraic sum of 0 125 and 0 44 mm diameter particles the addition of fine particles produces a pure drag reduction effect li et al 2018b 2018c established a numerical model for slurry transportation in horizontal pipelines with single and multiple particle sizes under the same volume concentration simulations and comparative analyses were conducted for slurries having single particle diameter sizes of 0 125 and 0 44 mm and their equal weight mixture the interaction between the particles of different sizes in a multi sized particle slurry was further studied including distributions of the particle concentration velocity and pressure the results showed that the fine particles in the graded slurry play a significant role in reducing the friction between the coarse particles and the pipe wall however in most of the above studies the mechanism of resistance reduction in complex slurries is not adequately analysed therefore based on the experimental data of kaushal et al 2005 this study analyses the effect of adding finer particles on the flow characteristics of a coarse particle slurry specifically the study focuses on the relationship between the addition of finer particles and the change in the resistance of the coarse particle slurry and the change law of the effect concerning the addition of different number of finer particles under different condition further the study verifies and explains the resistance reduction effect of small sized particles in the graded slurry proposed by li et al 2008a and it expands and supplements the effect of the interaction of particles with different size on the particle kinetics given by li et al 2008b the remainder of this paper is organised as follows section 2 provides the mathematical model of the computational fluid dynamics cfd section 3 describes the simulation solution of this study including the physical model calculation domain boundary conditions computational mesh solution procedure convergence criterion and simulation programme section 4 describes the results and analysis of the effect on the particle concentration distribution velocity distribution pressure distribution and wall shear force distribution finally the conclusions of the study are summarised in section 5 2 mathematical model studies have proved that the euler multiphase flow model is suitable for the calculation and analysis of slurries with high concentrations and multiple particle sizes in pipeline transportation chen et al 2019 kaushal et al 2012 2013 2017 therefore in this study we used the eulerian multiphase flow model the model assumes that each phase in the slurry is a continuum the pressure values of each phase at the same point in the calculation domain are equal every particle is a smooth rigid sphere and the particles simultaneously collide to each other and the pipe walls the model accounts for the energy dissipation and interphase energy exchange caused by the particle motion drag force caused by the difference in interphase velocity lift force of the near wall particles caused by the primary phase velocity gradient and virtual mass force produced by the particle acceleration the model establishes the continuum momentum and energy equations for each phase moreover each phase is solved using mass momentum and energy conservation equations 2 1 conservation of mass the calculation model assumes that the slurry comprises a liquid phase and solid phases with different particle sizes all the solid phases are continuous similar to the liquid phase and the sum of the volume fractions of all the phases in the calculation domain is always one 6 α f i 1 n α p i 1 the liquid phase in this model is considered incompressible and the

based on the kinetic theory of granular flow which accounts for the elastic collision of particles based on the gas liquid two phase flow in the momentum equation the particle pressure is defined as a

sized particles having sizes of 0 125 and 0 44 mm and their equal weight mixture table 3 lists the physical properties of the materials used in the experiment 3 2 calculation domain and boundary conditions the horizontal pipe model with an internal diameter of 54 9 mm and length of 3300 mm was established the calculation domain comprised the inlet outlet and pipe wall the model boundary conditions were as follows the inlet was the velocity inlet the flow velocity and the concentration of each phase were set to specific values the outlet was the pressure outlet the average pressure was set equal to the atmospheric pressure on the wall the flow velocity of the primary phase fluid phase was set to zero no slip condition was applied the johnson jackson model was selected for setting the particle conditions table 4 lists the boundary conditions of the calculation model 3 3 computational mesh in this study the mesh model validated by li et al 2018b was used this mesh model has 30 boundary layers the outermost element height is 0 08 mm the growth ratio is 1 2 and the total number of the elements is 14 85 million as shown in fig 1 3 4 solution procedure and convergence the commercial cfd software package fluent 17 was employed to solve the continuous momentum and particle temperature equations using the finite volume method the residual type was the root mean square

factor for the pressure term was set to 0 2 the momentum term was set to 0 3 and the volume fraction was set to 0 4 default values were set for the other parameters table 5 summarises the numerical simulation parameters 3 5 simulation programme two types of slurries were considered to analyse the effect of adding different number of finer particles on the transport characteristics of the single sized coarse particles at different flow velocities and solid volume concentrations the first slurry contained single sized particles having diameters of 0 44 mm coarse particles and the second one had 0 44 and equal masses of 0 125 mm diameter particles finer particles with twice the solid concentration of the first slurry it can be roughly considered that the slurry is added with a similar amount of finer sand as the coarse particles in the corresponding slurry table 6 presents the simulation conditions used for these slurries 4 results and analysis the experimental data obtained using a 54 9 mm diameter pipe by kaushal et al 2005 is used to design a three dimensional cfd model to simulate the characteristics of the slurries with single sized glass balls with diameters of 0 44 mm coarse particles and having an equal mass of 0 125 mm diameter glass balls fine particles 4 1 effect on the particle concentration distribution fig 2 shows the comparison of the coarse particle d 0 44 mm volume concentration distributions along the central vertical lines of the pipe before and after adding an equal volume of solid fine d 0 125 mm particles determined through simulations and experiments the left figures show the coarse particle concentration distribution in the single particle slurry determined through simulations image 1 s p2 and experiments image 2 s experiment denoted as part i after adding fine particles to coarse particles the coarse particle phase image 3 m p3 fine particle phase image 4 m p2 and mixture image 5 mix concentration distributions determined through simulations and experiments are presented in the centre figures denoted as part ii the concentration distributions of the coarse particle phase image 6 m p3 after adding fine particles and the single sized coarse particle phase image 7 s p2 are compared in the figures on the right denoted as part iii the total concentration distributions determined through simulations show good agreement with those determined through experimental measurements obtained by kaushal et al 2005 fig 2a b and 2c show the particle volume concentration distributions under a low flow velocity and low concentration low flow velocity and high concentration and high flow velocity and high concentration respectively we can observe that adding an equal volume of fine particles barely affect the concentration distribution of coarse particles whether at a low velocity and low concentration shown in fig 2a or high velocity and high concentration shown in fig 2c the addition of fine particles affected the coarse particle slurry transport only near the critical flow velocity shown in fig 2b moreover adding a certain number of fine particles will enhance the suspension of the coarse particles making the coarse particles diffuse toward the top of the pipe from fig 2a and b we can infer that the concentration distribution of coarse particles does not change obviously before and after adding 10 fine particles at a flow velocity of 2 m s however when 20 fine particles are added the coarse particles change from the sliding regime to the heterogeneous regime therefore only a sufficient number of fine particles can change the flow regime of the coarse slurry this is consistent with the dynamic viscosity model proposed by thomas 1965 the higher the amount of fine particles the greater is the effective viscosity of the carrier fluid for transporting coarse particles the greater the buoyancy the better is the performance when maintaining the suspension furthermore adding fine particles at a low velocity can substantially reduce the resistance of the coarse particles by effectively increasing the suspension performance and reducing their collision and friction resistance with the pipe wall which was proved experimentally after adding 10 fine particles fig 2a the pressure drop reduced from 1061 pa m to 1048 pa m representing a decrease of 1 2 after adding 20 fine particles fig 2b the pressure drop reduced from 1567 pa m to 1260 pa m representing a decrease of nearly 20 kaushal et al 2005 fig 2b and c indicate that the effect adding fine particles on the concentration distribution of coarse particles decreases as the flow velocity increases which is because when the flow velocity increases the turbulent dissipation and collision forces of coarse particles increase rapidly and these particles continue to remain suspended after adding the fine particles the impact of the collision between particles was much larger than that of the buoyancy provided by the carrier phase of the fine particles namely the buoyancy effect of the carrier phase on the fine particles gradually became insignificant and its impact gradually decreased as well moreover adding fine particles at a high velocity will increase the pressure drop owing to the increased probability of particle collisions fig 2cii indicates that the pressure drop increases from 2705 pa m to 2971 pa m by nearly 10 after adding 20 of fine particles at a velocity of 4 m s kaushal et al 2005 from another perspective the most apparent reduction in resistance after adding the fine particles occurred when the motion regime of the coarse particles changed as shown in fig 2b adding fine particles makes the coarse particles change from the sliding regime to the heterogeneous regime and the resistance decrease by nearly 20 as shown in fig 2a adding a small number of fine particles did not improve the suspension of the sliding coarse particles however the near wall lubrication layer formed in the pipeline still played a role in reducing the collision and friction between the coarse particles and the wall and the resistance decreased by nearly 1 2 as shown in fig 2c under a high flow velocity adding fine particles has a negligible effect on the concentration distribution of coarse particles already suspended because of the increased flow velocity nevertheless it increases the collision between particles and increases the resistance by nearly 10 moreover the greater the number of fine particles added the greater the effective viscosity of the carrier phase in the coarse particle slurry and the greater the buoyancy of the coarse particles the better the suspension performance the resistance reduction effect is the best at a low flow velocity when the coarse particles are in the sliding regime on the other hand adding fine particles will increase the probability and intensity of collisions between particles and between the particles and the pipe wall thus increasing the collision energy consumption and resistance therefore at a high flow velocity adding fine particles when the coarse particles are in the heterogeneous regime will only increase the energy consumed for transportation 4 2 effect on velocity distribution fig 3 shows the coarse particle velocity distributions along the central vertical lines of the pipes before and after adding an equal volume of fine particles the velocity distributions of the coarse particle phase image 8 s p2 and water image 9 s p1 in single sized slurries determined through simulations are shown on the left side the velocity distribution curves of the coarse particles image 10 m p3 fine particles image 11 m p2 and water image 12 m p1 in the mixed slurry after adding fine particles are shown in the middle the graphs on the right side show a comparison of the velocity distributions of the coarse particle phase image 13 m p3 and the single sized coarse particle image 14 s p2 slurry determined through simulations the working conditions used for obtaining the results shown in fig 3a b and 3c correspond to those giving the particle concentration distributions shown in fig 2a b and 2c respectively according to fig 3a adding fine particles to the slurry containing coarse particles at a low concentration and low flow velocity hardly affects the velocity of the coarse particles conversely the velocity distribution of fine particles approaches that of the coarse particles owing to the extrusion and suppression of coarse particles in the area near the wall fig 3b indicates that adding a large number of fine particles 20 volume near the critical flow velocity significantly pushes the maximum velocity point of the coarse particles to the centre of the pipeline this results from a more uniform concentration distribution and better suspension of coarse particles as observed in fig 3c adding a large amount of fine particles 20 volume at a high concentration and high velocity makes the velocity distribution of coarse particles symmetrical to the centre of the pipeline this results from the increased collision between the particles and the uniform distribution of the coarse particle concentration 4 3 effect on particle pressure distribution fig 4 presents the coarse particle pressure distributions obtained through simulations on the cross section of the pipes before and after adding an equal volume of fine particles on the left is represented the pressure distribution contour of coarse particles before adding fine particles while on the right is represented the pressure distribution contour of coarse particles after adding fine particles the working conditions used for obtaining the results presented in fig 4a b and 4c correspond to those providing the particle concentration distributions in fig 2a b and 2c and velocity distributions in fig 3a b and 3c respectively fig 4a indicates that adding fine particles to the coarse particle slurry at a low concentration and low velocity reduces the maximum particle pressure of the coarse particle phase by 30 this is because the fine particles act as a buffer between the coarse particles and the pipe wall the addition of fine particles reduces the collisions among coarse particles and between the coarse particles and the pipe wall as observed in fig 4b adding more fine particles 20 volume near the critical flow velocity reduces the maximum particle pressure in the coarse particle phase by 47 this is because the addition of fine particles changes the motion regime of the coarse particles from sliding flow to heterogeneous flow and the density of coarse particles at the bottom of the pipeline is considerably reduced further fig 4c shows that adding more fine particles 20 volume at a high concentration and high velocity results in a maximum increase of 4 in the particle pressure of the coarse particle phase this is because the addition of fine particles significantly increases the collision probability between the particles furthermore adding fine particles leads to an increase in the particle pressure at the top of the pipe especially at high concentrations shown in fig 4b and c this is because the addition of fine particles makes the coarse particles to diffuse further toward the top of the pipe 4 4 effect on wall shear force distribution we compared the slurry containing only 0 44 mm diameter glass balls and that containing an equal volume of 0 125 mm diameter glass balls fig 5 shows the simulation results obtained for the wall shear force distribution the figure on the left shows the wall shear force distribution contour of coarse particles before adding fine particles and the figure on the right shows the contour for coarse particles after adding fine particles for obtaining the results shown in fig 5a b and 5c the following working conditions were used in the simulations velocity 2 m s with a coarse particle volume concentration 10 velocity 2 m s with a coarse particle volume concentration 20 velocity 4 m s with a coarse particle volume concentration 20 the particle concentration distributions shown in fig 2a b and 2c correspond to the velocity distributions in fig 3a b and 3c and the particle pressure distributions in fig 4a b and 4c respectively according to fig 5a adding fine particles to the slurry containing coarse particles at a low concentration and velocity reduces the maximum wall shear force of the coarse particle phase by 15 this is owing to the addition of fine particles that act as a buffer between the coarse particles and the pipe wall they reduce the collision and friction between the coarse particles and the pipe wall further fig 5b shows that the maximum wall shear force of the coarse particle phase can be reduced by 23 through the addition of more fine particles 20 volume near the critical flow velocity this is because the addition of fine particles changes the motion regime of the coarse particles from sliding flow to heterogeneous flow moreover the coarse particles near the pipe wall form suspensions as observed in fig 5c adding a large number of fine particles 20 volume at a high concentration and velocity causes a 15 reduction in the maximum wall shear force of the coarse particle phase this is because the fine particles develop a lubrication layer near the pipe wall as shown in fig 2cii which significantly reduces the friction between coarse particles on the bottom of the pipe the comparison of figs 4c and 5c shows that although the wall shear force at the bottom of the pipe decreases the wall shear force at the top of the pipe increases owing to the increase in the particle pressure therefore the total resistance of the slurry increases by 10 further we can infer from fig 5 that adding fine particles will reduce the maximum wall shear force of the coarse particle phase in contrast the addition of fine particles will increase the wall shear force of the coarse particle phase at the top of the pipe especially at a high velocity shown in fig 5c therefore the total shear force of the coarse particles in the entire pipe wall increases 5 conclusion we analysed the transport characteristics of slurries containing coarse particles of size 0 44 mm before and after adding an equal volume of fine particles of size 0 125 mm under typical conditions the effects of adding fine particles on the transport characteristics were studied including the transport parameters such as the concentration distribution velocity distribution particle pressure and wall shear force the following conclusions were drawn from the simulation results 1 adding a sufficient number of fine particles to a coarse particle slurry in the sliding regime will improve the suspension ability of the coarse particles moreover adding fine particles changes the motion regime of the coarse particles to heterogeneous flow it also reduces the energy consumed for particle collision considerably and decreases the friction between the coarse particles and the bottom of the pipe and reduces the resistance effectively by approximately 20 2 in heterogeneous coarse particle slurries the addition of fine particles will also form a near wall lubrication layer at the bottom of the pipe which can effectively reduce the energy consumed for particle collision and friction between the coarse particles and the pipe wall however owing to the increase in the energy consumed in a collision between particles and the collision and friction between the particles and the top of the pipe the total resistance of the will increase 3 at a low velocity before changing the motion regime of the coarse particle slurry by adding fine particles the resistance decreases with the increase in the number of fine particles added this continues until the slurry exhibits heterogeneous flow in which the resistance reduction effect is the best for the coarse particle slurry 4 the resistance increases with the addition of fine particles in the heterogeneous or pseudo homogeneous flow regime of the coarse particle slurry 5 the addition of homogeneous or pseudo homogeneous particles with a particle size d 0 04 mm or s tk 0 03 reduces the resistance further the addition of heterogeneous particles to the slurry in the sliding regime can also cause resistance reduction these findings can serve as a reference for further studying the resistance reduction mechanism on adding fine particles and for finding the optimal particle size distribution for slurry transport in pipelines admittedly the conclusion of this study was only verified in experiments where an equal number of finer particles with the diameter of 0 125 mm is added to a 0 44 mm diameter coarse particle slurry in a 0 549 m inner diameter pipe under different working conditions in the next step we will complete the simulation calculation of the transport characteristics after adding different numbers of finer particles with different particle sizes under a wider range of working conditions moreover we will provide the optimal fine particle size and number ratio corresponding to the maximum resistance reduction under different working conditions and conduct experimental verification in typical cases funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant number 51779143 and the cultivation of

21319,resistance reduction has always been a concerning problem in pipeline transportation projects moreover adding fine particles has shown resistance reduction therefore we studied the effect of adding finer particles on the transport characteristics of coarse particle slurries in pipelines the flow conditions and slurry characteristics such as the flow velocity and particle volume concentration and the addition of finer particles can reduce the resistance of coarse particle slurries under certain working conditions in this study the changes in the transport characteristics of slurries with 0 44 mm diameter glass balls after adding an equal volume of 0 125 mm diameter glass balls under different flow velocities and volume concentrations were analysed the effects of adding fine particles on the transport characteristics of coarse particles under different flow conditions were determined including the distributions of the particle volume concentration velocity particle pressure and wall shear stress we observed that adding fine particles could change the flow regime of coarse particles near the critical flow velocity from sliding bed to heterogeneous flow thereby considerably reducing the pipeline resistance by approximately 20 at a high flow velocity heterogeneous or homogeneous flow the addition of fine particles will increase the resistance the study results explain the mechanism and characteristics of resistance reduction on adding fine particles from the perspective of changing the flow regime these findings can serve as a reference for further studying the resistance reduction mechanism on adding fine particles and for finding the optimal particle size distribution for slurry transport in pipelines keywords resistance reduction mechanism finer particles slurry flow regime euler euler two fluid model 1 introduction pipeline transportation is extensively used in dredging food coal oil and other industries as it requires a less initial investment while being environmentally friendly and providing easy optimisation of control parameters in pipeline transportation drag resistance is the main part of the operating cost therefore drag resistance reduction has always been the focus of research on pipeline transportation fei et al 1991 analysed complex slurries slurries with a range of particle sizes such slurries have overlapping flow regimes including homogeneous pseudo homogeneous heterogeneous and fully stratified regimes as defined by wilson et al 2006 these researchers found that complex slurries could significantly reduce the starting speed of large particles and friction resistance of coarse particles when studying debris flows therefore in long distance pipeline transportation systems complex slurry transportation is extremely beneficial for operating the system economically however the mechanism of the resistance reduction in complex slurries has not been thoroughly studied various methods have been proposed for complex slurry resistance but the general idea coincides with the two phase flow model defined by wasp 1977 he proposed separating the slurry particles into two motion forms one is the homogeneous flow consisting of the liquid and small particles uniformly diffused acting as the means of transport the drag resistance produced in this part can be regarded as the friction resistance of the pure liquid with the same density as that of the slurry given as follows 1 i m i w s m where i w represents the loss of water friction and s m represents the specific gravity of the slurry another motion form is the heterogeneous flow which transports particles that are distributed unevenly under the effect of gravity the resistance of this flow is calculated according to the durand 1952 formula as given below 2 i m i w 1 121 c v f v 2 g d s 1 g d s 1 w 1 5 where c vf represents the efflux solid volume concentration d represents the size of the particles d represents the diameter of the pipe s represents the specific gravity of the solid v represents the slurry velocity and w denotes the velocity of the particle settlement these two different forms are divided according to the following rule wasp 1963 3 log c v y 0 92 c v y 0 5 1 8 w β k v where c v y a is the specific local solid volume concentration y a is the dimensionless position along the vertical axis of the pipe which is defined as y y d where y is the distance from the pipe bottom and d is the pipe diameter k denotes the von karman constant k 0 35 0 4 β denotes a coefficient β 1 1 5 and v denotes the friction velocity 1 1 criteria for identifying homogeneous and heterogeneous flow regimes in complex slurries wasp 1977 used c v y 0 92 c v y 0 5 when 0 1 c v y 0 92 c v y 0 5 0 8 the flow is considered heterogeneous whereas it is considered homogeneous when c v y 0 92 c v y 0 5 0 8 furthermore miedema 2017 used the stokes number s tk and when s tk 0 03 the flow is considered homogeneous for convenience during calculation wilson et al 2006 directly used the particle size d and when d 0 04 mm the flow is considered homogeneous although these criteria for determining the flow regimes are different the corresponding particle sizes are all at the micron level 1 2 resistance of the heterogeneous part wilson et al 2006 considered that except for the particles having sizes less than 0 04 mm and are involved in a homogeneous flow there are three different flow regimes the first regime is pseudo homogeneous flow which is composed of particles that are greater than 0 04 mm and less than 0 15 mm the second regime is heterogeneous flow including particles with diameters that are 0 15 to 0 018 times the diameter of the pipe finally the third regime is fully stratified flow consisting of particles whose diameters are more than 0 018 times the diameter of the pipe the total resistance is the algebraic sum of the resistances of these three regimes and that of the homogeneous part similarly miedema 2017 proposed that except for the carrier phase and heterogeneous flow with s tk less than 0 03 there is a part with particle sizes larger than 0 018 times the diameter of the pipe exhibiting sliding flow the total resistance is the algebraic sum of the resistances of each part however when calculating the resistance of the heterogeneous and sliding parts it is necessary to modify the viscosity of the carrier phase having coarse particles with the volume concentration of the homogeneous part using the thomas 1965 model given as follows 4 μ x μ f 1 2 5 c v x 10 05 c v x 2 0 00273 e 16 6 c v x where c v x represents the concentration of the pseudo homogeneous fluid li et al 2018a also believe that under certain working conditions the fixed bed sliding heterogeneous pseudo homogeneous and homogeneous flow regimes may exist simultaneously they point out that the finer particles in the different flow regimes together constitute the carrier phase of the different regime coarser part of the flow therefore in their model the effective viscosity resulting from the volume concentrations of the homogeneous and pseudo homogeneous parts is used to modify the carrier phase of the heterogeneous part moreover all the fine particle concentrations are needed to correct the parameters of the carrier phase in this part in their view except for the drag reduction effect of finer particles on the viscosity of the slurry the effect of particle size distribution on the additional resistance becomes increasingly significant when the particle concentration is higher than a certain degree therefore when calculating the total drag resistance the sum of the resistances of various flow regimes needs to be multiplied by the drag reduction coefficient given as follows li et al 2018a 5 α 0 69 0 99 lg μ r 0 075 lg c u 1 27 lg μ r lg c u 0 165 lg μ r 2 0 082 lg c u 2 where c u represents the coefficient of uniformity and μ r represents the relative dynamic viscosity 1 3 finer particle addition for drag reduction kaushal et al 2005 conducted their resistance tests in pipes with inner diameters of 54 9 mm they used glass spheres with diameters of 0 125 and 0 44 mm three types of tests were conducted using fine particles and coarse particles with diameters measuring 0 125 and 0 44 mm respectively and their equal weight mixture under an average flow velocity of 2 m s the transport pressure drop for the slurry was 1567 pa m having a volume concentration of 20 with only 0 44 mm diameter particle however the transport pressure drop for the slurry was 1260 pa m having a volume concentration of 40 comprising both 0 125 and 0 44 mm diameter particles mixed equally by weight roughly similar to adding an equal volume of 0 125 mm particles into the slurry having a volume concentration of 20 and particle size of 0 44 mm this is nearly 20 lower than the resistance of the single sized particle d 0 44 mm slurry therefore we can infer that the resistance of the mixed slurry is not just the algebraic sum of 0 125 and 0 44 mm diameter particles the addition of fine particles produces a pure drag reduction effect li et al 2018b 2018c established a numerical model for slurry transportation in horizontal pipelines with single and multiple particle sizes under the same volume concentration simulations and comparative analyses were conducted for slurries having single particle diameter sizes of 0 125 and 0 44 mm and their equal weight mixture the interaction between the particles of different sizes in a multi sized particle slurry was further studied including distributions of the particle concentration velocity and pressure the results showed that the fine particles in the graded slurry play a significant role in reducing the friction between the coarse particles and the pipe wall however in most of the above studies the mechanism of resistance reduction in complex slurries is not adequately analysed therefore based on the experimental data of kaushal et al 2005 this study analyses the effect of adding finer particles on the flow characteristics of a coarse particle slurry specifically the study focuses on the relationship between the addition of finer particles and the change in the resistance of the coarse particle slurry and the change law of the effect concerning the addition of different number of finer particles under different condition further the study verifies and explains the resistance reduction effect of small sized particles in the graded slurry proposed by li et al 2008a and it expands and supplements the effect of the interaction of particles with different size on the particle kinetics given by li et al 2008b the remainder of this paper is organised as follows section 2 provides the mathematical model of the computational fluid dynamics cfd section 3 describes the simulation solution of this study including the physical model calculation domain boundary conditions computational mesh solution procedure convergence criterion and simulation programme section 4 describes the results and analysis of the effect on the particle concentration distribution velocity distribution pressure distribution and wall shear force distribution finally the conclusions of the study are summarised in section 5 2 mathematical model studies have proved that the euler multiphase flow model is suitable for the calculation and analysis of slurries with high concentrations and multiple particle sizes in pipeline transportation chen et al 2019 kaushal et al 2012 2013 2017 therefore in this study we used the eulerian multiphase flow model the model assumes that each phase in the slurry is a continuum the pressure values of each phase at the same point in the calculation domain are equal every particle is a smooth rigid sphere and the particles simultaneously collide to each other and the pipe walls the model accounts for the energy dissipation and interphase energy exchange caused by the particle motion drag force caused by the difference in interphase velocity lift force of the near wall particles caused by the primary phase velocity gradient and virtual mass force produced by the particle acceleration the model establishes the continuum momentum and energy equations for each phase moreover each phase is solved using mass momentum and energy conservation equations 2 1 conservation of mass the calculation model assumes that the slurry comprises a liquid phase and solid phases with different particle sizes all the solid phases are continuous similar to the liquid phase and the sum of the volume fractions of all the phases in the calculation domain is always one 6 α f i 1 n α p i 1 the liquid phase in this model is considered incompressible and the solid phase is treated as a compressible fluid because its volume fraction is less than its maximum allowed value using the following euler continuity equations for the liquid phase 7 t α f ρ f α f ρ f v f 0 for the solid phase 8 t α p i ρ p i α p i ρ p i v p i 0 this model does not consider the crushing of coarse particles under collision therefore it does not consider mutual material transformations among the solid phases 2 2 conservation of momentum in the eulerian model the momentum conservation is observed for each phase and is given in the following equations for the liquid phase 9 t α f ρ f v f α f ρ f v f v f α f p τ f α f ρ f g i 1 n r f p i f f for the solid phase 10 t α p i ρ p i v p i α p i ρ p i v p i v p i α p i p p p i τ p i α p i ρ p i g r p i f f p i here r p i f represents the drag force of the liquid phase f to the particle phase i f f and f p i represent the external force from the outside of the particle phase including the virtual mass force f v m p i lift force f l i f t p i and turbulent dissipation force f t d p i the detailed calculation formula is given in table 1 2 3 particle temperature strictly speaking the eulerian multiphase flow model is based on the kinetic theory of granular flow which accounts for the elastic collision of particles based on the gas liquid two phase flow in the momentum equation the particle pressure is defined as a function of the particle temperature the particle temperature is affected by the particle collisions and is therefore proportional to the kinetic energy of the particles random motion the formal expression is θ p i u s p i 2 3 where u s p i is the fluctuating solid velocity of the ith solid phase in our model the particle temperature was determined using the transport equation as follows 11 3

sized particles having sizes of 0 125 and 0 44 mm and their equal weight mixture table 3 lists the physical properties of the materials used in the experiment 3 2 calculation domain and boundary conditions the horizontal pipe model with an internal diameter of 54 9 mm and length of 3300 mm was established the calculation domain comprised the inlet outlet and pipe wall the model boundary

simulation parameters 3 5 simulation programme two types of slurries were considered to analyse the effect of adding different number of finer particles on the transport characteristics of the single sized coarse particles at different flow velocities and solid volume concentrations the first slurry contained single sized particles having diameters of 0 44 mm coarse particles and the second one had 0 44 and equal masses of 0 125 mm diameter particles finer particles with twice the solid concentration of the first slurry it can be roughly considered that the slurry is added with a similar amount of finer sand as the coarse particles in the corresponding slurry table 6 presents the simulation conditions used for these slurries 4 results and analysis the experimental data obtained using a 54 9 mm diameter pipe by kaushal et al 2005 is used to design a three dimensional cfd model to simulate the characteristics of the slurries with single sized glass balls with diameters of 0 44 mm coarse particles and having an equal mass of 0 125 mm diameter glass balls fine particles 4 1 effect on the particle concentration distribution fig 2 shows the comparison of the coarse particle d 0 44 mm volume concentration distributions along the central vertical lines of the pipe before and after adding an equal volume of solid fine d 0 125 mm particles determined through simulations and experiments the left figures show the coarse particle concentration distribution in the single particle slurry determined through simulations image 1 s p2 and experiments image 2 s experiment denoted as part i after adding fine particles to coarse particles the coarse particle phase image 3 m p3 fine particle phase image 4 m p2 and mixture image 5 mix concentration distributions determined through simulations and experiments are presented in the centre figures denoted as part ii the concentration distributions of the coarse particle phase image 6 m p3 after adding fine particles and the single sized coarse particle phase image 7 s p2 are compared in the figures on the right denoted as part iii the total concentration distributions determined through simulations show good agreement with those determined through experimental measurements obtained by kaushal et al 2005 fig 2a b and 2c show the particle volume concentration distributions under a low flow velocity and low concentration low flow velocity and high concentration and high flow velocity and high concentration respectively we can observe that adding an equal volume of fine particles barely affect the concentration distribution of coarse particles whether at a low velocity and low concentration shown in fig 2a or high velocity and high concentration shown in fig 2c the addition of fine particles affected the coarse particle slurry transport only near the critical flow velocity shown in fig 2b moreover adding a certain number of fine particles will enhance the suspension of the coarse particles making the coarse particles diffuse toward the top of the pipe from fig 2a and b we can infer that the concentration distribution of coarse particles does not change obviously before and after adding 10 fine particles at a flow velocity of 2 m s however when 20 fine particles are added the coarse particles change from the sliding regime to the heterogeneous regime therefore only a sufficient number of fine particles can change the flow regime of the coarse slurry this is consistent with the dynamic viscosity model proposed by thomas 1965 the higher the amount of fine particles the greater is the effective viscosity of the carrier fluid for transporting coarse particles the greater the buoyancy the better is the performance when maintaining the suspension furthermore adding fine particles at a low velocity can substantially reduce the resistance of the coarse particles by effectively increasing the suspension performance and reducing their collision and friction resistance with the pipe wall which was proved experimentally after adding 10 fine particles fig 2a the pressure drop reduced from 1061 pa m to 1048 pa m representing a decrease of 1 2 after adding 20 fine particles fig 2b the pressure drop reduced from 1567 pa m to 1260 pa m representing a decrease of nearly 20 kaushal et al 2005 fig 2b and c indicate that the effect adding fine particles on the concentration distribution of coarse particles decreases as the flow velocity increases which is because when the flow velocity increases the turbulent dissipation and collision forces of coarse particles increase rapidly and these particles continue to remain suspended after adding the fine particles the impact of the collision between particles was much larger than that of the buoyancy provided by the carrier phase of the fine particles namely the buoyancy effect of the carrier phase on the fine particles gradually became insignificant and its impact gradually decreased as well moreover adding fine particles at a high velocity will increase the pressure drop owing to the increased probability of particle collisions fig 2cii indicates that the pressure drop increases from 2705 pa m to 2971 pa m by nearly 10 after adding 20 of fine particles at a velocity of 4 m s kaushal et al 2005 from another perspective the most apparent reduction in resistance after adding the fine particles occurred when the motion regime of the coarse particles changed as shown in fig 2b adding fine particles makes the coarse particles change from the sliding regime to the heterogeneous regime and the resistance decrease by nearly 20 as shown in fig 2a adding a small number of fine particles did not improve the suspension of the sliding coarse particles however the near wall lubrication layer formed in the pipeline still played a role in reducing the collision and friction between the coarse particles and the wall and the resistance decreased by nearly 1 2 as shown in fig 2c under a high flow velocity adding fine particles has a negligible effect on the concentration distribution of coarse particles already suspended because of the increased flow velocity nevertheless it increases the collision between particles and increases the resistance by nearly 10 moreover the greater the number of fine particles added the greater the effective viscosity of the carrier phase in the coarse particle slurry and the greater the buoyancy of the coarse particles the better the suspension performance the resistance reduction effect is the best at a low flow velocity when the coarse particles are in the sliding regime on the other hand adding fine particles will increase the probability and intensity of collisions between particles and between the particles and the pipe wall thus increasing the collision energy consumption and resistance therefore at a high flow velocity adding fine particles when the coarse particles are in the heterogeneous regime will only increase the energy consumed for transportation 4 2 effect on velocity distribution fig 3 shows the coarse particle velocity distributions along the central vertical lines of the pipes before and after adding an equal volume of fine particles the velocity distributions of the coarse particle phase image 8 s p2 and water image 9 s p1 in single sized slurries determined through simulations are shown on the left side the velocity distribution curves of the coarse particles image 10 m p3 fine particles image 11 m p2 and water image 12 m p1 in the mixed slurry after adding fine particles are shown in the middle the graphs on the right side show a comparison of the velocity distributions of the coarse particle phase image 13 m p3 and the single sized coarse particle image 14 s p2 slurry determined through simulations the working conditions used for obtaining the results shown in fig 3a b and 3c correspond to those giving the particle concentration distributions shown in fig 2a b and 2c respectively according to fig 3a adding fine particles to the slurry containing coarse particles at a low concentration and low flow velocity hardly affects the velocity of the coarse particles conversely the velocity distribution of fine particles approaches that of the coarse particles owing to the extrusion and suppression of coarse particles in the area near the wall fig 3b indicates that adding a large number of fine particles 20 volume near the critical flow velocity significantly pushes the maximum velocity point of the coarse particles to the centre of the pipeline this results from a more uniform concentration distribution and better suspension of coarse particles as observed in fig 3c adding a large amount of fine particles 20 volume at a high concentration and high velocity makes the velocity distribution of coarse particles symmetrical to the centre of the pipeline this results from the increased collision between the particles and the uniform distribution of the coarse particle concentration 4 3 effect on particle pressure distribution fig 4 presents the coarse particle pressure distributions obtained through simulations on the cross section of the pipes before and after adding an equal volume of fine particles on the left is represented the pressure distribution contour of coarse particles before adding fine particles while on the right is represented the pressure distribution contour of coarse particles after adding fine particles the working conditions used for obtaining the results presented in fig 4a b and 4c correspond to those providing the particle concentration distributions in fig 2a b and 2c and velocity distributions in fig 3a b and 3c respectively fig 4a indicates that adding fine particles to the coarse particle slurry at a low concentration and low velocity reduces the maximum particle pressure of the coarse particle phase by 30 this is because the fine particles act as a buffer between the coarse particles and the pipe wall the addition of fine particles reduces the collisions among coarse particles and between the coarse particles and the pipe wall as observed in fig 4b adding more fine particles 20 volume near the critical flow velocity reduces the maximum particle pressure in the coarse particle phase by 47 this is because the addition of fine particles changes the motion regime of the coarse particles from sliding flow to heterogeneous flow and the density of coarse particles at the bottom of the pipeline is considerably reduced further fig 4c shows that adding more fine particles 20 volume at a high concentration and high velocity results in a maximum increase of 4 in the particle pressure of the coarse particle phase this is because the addition of fine particles significantly increases the collision probability between the particles furthermore adding fine particles leads to an increase in the particle pressure at the top of the pipe especially at high concentrations shown in fig 4b and c this is because the addition of fine particles makes the coarse particles to diffuse further toward the top of the pipe 4 4 effect on wall shear force distribution we compared the slurry containing only 0 44 mm diameter glass balls and that containing an equal volume of 0 125 mm diameter glass balls fig 5 shows the simulation results obtained for the wall shear force distribution the figure on the left shows the wall shear force distribution contour of coarse particles before adding fine particles and the figure on the right shows the contour for coarse particles after adding fine particles for obtaining the results shown in fig 5a b and 5c the following working conditions were used in the simulations velocity 2 m s with a coarse particle volume concentration 10 velocity 2 m s with a coarse particle volume concentration 20 velocity 4 m s with a coarse particle volume concentration 20 the particle concentration distributions shown in fig 2a b and 2c correspond to the velocity distributions in fig 3a b and 3c and the particle pressure distributions in fig 4a b and 4c respectively according to fig 5a adding fine particles to the slurry containing coarse particles at a low concentration and velocity reduces the maximum wall shear force of the coarse particle phase by 15 this is owing to the addition of fine particles that act as a buffer between the coarse particles and the pipe wall they reduce the collision and friction between the coarse particles and the pipe wall further fig 5b shows that the maximum wall shear force of the coarse particle phase can be reduced by 23 through the addition of more fine particles 20 volume near the critical flow velocity this is because the addition of fine particles changes the motion regime of the coarse particles from sliding flow to heterogeneous flow moreover the coarse particles near the pipe wall form suspensions as observed in fig 5c adding a large number of fine particles 20 volume at a high concentration and velocity causes a 15 reduction in the maximum wall shear force of the coarse particle phase this is because the fine particles develop a lubrication layer near the pipe wall as shown in fig 2cii which significantly reduces the friction between coarse particles on the bottom of the pipe the comparison of figs 4c and 5c shows that although the wall shear force at the bottom of the pipe decreases the wall shear force at the top of the pipe increases owing to the increase in the particle pressure therefore the total resistance of the slurry increases by 10 further we can infer from fig 5 that adding fine particles will reduce the maximum wall shear force of the coarse particle phase in contrast the addition of fine particles will increase the wall shear force of the coarse particle phase at the top of the pipe especially at a high velocity shown in fig 5c therefore the total shear force of the coarse particles in the entire pipe wall increases 5 conclusion we analysed the transport characteristics of slurries containing coarse particles of size 0 44 mm before and after adding an equal volume of fine particles of size 0 125 mm under typical conditions the effects of adding fine particles on the transport characteristics were studied including the transport parameters such as the concentration distribution velocity distribution particle pressure and wall shear force the following conclusions were drawn from the simulation results 1 adding a sufficient number of fine particles to a coarse particle slurry in the sliding regime will improve the suspension ability of the coarse particles moreover adding fine particles changes the motion regime of the coarse particles to heterogeneous flow it also reduces the energy consumed for particle collision considerably and decreases the friction between the coarse particles and the bottom of the pipe and reduces the resistance effectively by approximately 20 2 in heterogeneous coarse particle slurries the addition of fine particles will also form a near wall lubrication layer at the bottom of the pipe which can effectively reduce the energy consumed for particle collision and friction between the coarse particles and the pipe wall however owing to the increase in the energy consumed in a collision between particles and the collision and friction between the particles and the top of the pipe the total resistance of the will increase 3 at a low velocity before changing the motion regime of the coarse particle slurry by adding fine particles the resistance decreases with the increase in the number of fine particles added this continues until the slurry exhibits heterogeneous flow in which the resistance reduction effect is the best for the coarse particle slurry 4 the resistance increases with the addition of fine particles in the heterogeneous or pseudo homogeneous flow regime of the coarse particle slurry 5 the addition of homogeneous or pseudo homogeneous particles with a particle size d 0 04 mm or s tk 0 03 reduces the resistance further the addition of heterogeneous particles to the slurry in the sliding regime can also cause resistance reduction these findings can serve as a reference for further studying the resistance reduction mechanism on adding fine particles and for finding the optimal particle size distribution for slurry transport in pipelines admittedly the conclusion of this study was only verified in experiments where an equal number of finer particles with the diameter of 0 125 mm is added to a 0 44 mm diameter coarse particle slurry in a 0 549 m inner diameter pipe under different working conditions in the next step we will complete the simulation calculation of the transport characteristics after adding different numbers of finer particles with different particle sizes under a wider range of working conditions moreover we will provide the optimal fine particle size and number ratio corresponding to the maximum resistance reduction under different working conditions and conduct experimental verification in typical cases funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant number 51779143 and the cultivation of
