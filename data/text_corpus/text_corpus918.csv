4590,a semi analytical model for the transient flow problem of a partially penetrating well in three dimensional anisotropic two layer confined aquifer is developed by taking the cross flow between two layers into consideration using the green function and boundary element method in laplace space a matrix is established and solved by gauss s elimination method the drawdown solution is inverted to the time domain by using numerical inversion algorithm of stehfest 1970 importantly the time of cross flow occurrence can be indicated precisely moreover the flow rate on penetrating segments and interfaces between layers at different flow stages are quantitatively investigated the comparison between the semi analytical solution and numerical solution shows an excellent agreement in addition one case for aquifer with two separate layers and another case for one single layer with an overlying gas cap or an underlying aquifer are also presented to show the differences between that with or without cross flow effect finally influencing factors including cross flow coefficient anisotropic factor penetrating location and penetrating ratio on both flow rate and drawdown are analyzed in

engineering problems many aquifers are not completely drilled or fully penetrated besides some aquifer systems consisting of multiple layers with different properties and cross flow between layers could not be ignored multi layer systems model has been studied by many researchers for decades in both ground water and petroleum literatures wikramaratna 1984 used laplace transform to get the analytical solution of drawdown in each aquifer but the outer boundaries of this model were infinite and cross flow between the aquifers was not taken into consideration a generalized form of fourier transform was applied to get the analytical solution of steady flow maas 1987a and non steady flow maas 1987b in a layered aquifer system however the derived formula cannot be used to analyze aquifer anisotropy osman 1993 used laplace transformation and duhamel s principle to get the drawdown of the finite conductivity vertical fracture located in a multilayered infinite aquifer importantly they mainly dealt with the fluid flow during early time rather than the flow during the whole time hemker 1999 solved the transient flow problem in layered aquifer with infinite radial extent in this study the finite difference technique was used for the vertical flow component but the cross flow between layers was not taken into consideration the transient flow problem of a well fully penetrating the layered aquifer was solved raghavan et al 1985 basquet et al 1999 using integral transformation method medeiros et al 2010 dealt with a heterogeneous reservoir by dividing it into blocks then drawdown solutions for adjacent blocks were coupled at the boundaries the method can be extended to compute drawdown for different forms of aquifer heterogeneity using laplace transform double fourier transform and green s functions method with numerical approximations the solutions of dual porosity dual permeability model for a two layer confined aquifer with cross flow were obtained by lu et al 2015 many scholars used the several methods of integral transformation laplace transformation separate variables to study unsteady flow problems of partially penetrating wells to solve problems in three dimension buhidma and raghavan 1980 investigated the drawdown and buildup behavior of partially penetrating wells in a rectangular aquifer with bottom water drive using the method of green s function the model was only for one layer javandel and witherspoon 1982 presented an analytical solution for the problem of partially penetrating in an isotropic two layer confined aquifer shah and thambynayagam 1992 solved the problem of partial completion in a two layer confined aquifer with the wellbore drawdown varying like a heaviside step function using finite hankel transforms and extended it to the case of a semipermeable membrane at the interlayer boundary cheng and morohunfola 1993 combined theories of neuman witherspoon and herrera with technique of laplace transform to analytically solve the transient flow problem in a multilayered leaky aquifer system which was composed of alternating layer of aquifers and aquitards however their research was limited to one dimensional problem kuchuk and habashy 1996 utilized the electromagnetics concepts of reflection and transmission to figure out fluid flow problems of horizontal well in a three dimensional layered aquifer whose homogeneity only existed in one direction taking horizontal flow in the aquitard and vertical flow in the confined aquifer into account barrash 2008 presented a semi analytical model for the problem of a partially penetrating well in three layer system with double laplace hankel transform method mishra et al 2012 also used the laplace transform to get the drawdown of a partially penetrating well with storage in an anisotropic confined aquifer considering the leakage of aquitard storage as an interface phenomenon feng and zhan 2019 developed a model for the problem of a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer based on this model feng et al 2019 extended their models to the problem of variable discharge of groundwater from a partially penetrating well in two layered aquifer system wang et al 2020 developed an analytical model for partially penetrating well with wellbore storage in double permeability aquifer laplace transformation and finite fourier cosine transformation were used to get the solutions feng et al 2020 solved the flow problem of a partially penetrating well in three layer aquifer system at different top boundary conditions by laplace hankel transform in a word transient flow problems of partially penetrating wells in multi layer aquifer and reservoir systems have caught much attention in the fields of hydrogeology and petroleum engineering however the flow rate on the interfaces between layers could not be quantitatively investigated due to the limitation of models in this study a semi analytical approach is proposed to compute drawdown transients for partially penetrating well in an anisotropic two layer confined aquifer the aquifer is divided into blocks which could be characterized by uniform average properties these blocks are coupled by the conditions of continuity of pressure and flow rate on the adjacent blocks the object of this work is mainly to study the transient flow of partially penetrating well in two layer confined aquifer with cross flow and quantitatively investigate the flow rate on the penetrating segments and interfaces at different flow stages through the change of flow rate on the interfaces the time and extent of cross flow occurrence can be clearly known besides the penetrating location and penetrating number in layers could be arbitrary the model can not only be used to simulate the fluid flow problem of partially penetrating in a two layer confined aquifer but also partially or fully completed in single layer with an overlying gas cap or an underlying aquifer it can also be extended to deal with the multi layer aquifer flow problems 2 methodology here three cases are mainly considered case one is about a two layer confined aquifer with permeable interfaces case two is about an aquifer with two separate layers case three is about one single layer with an overlying gas cap or an underlying aquifer 2 1 two layer confined aquifer with permeable interfaces case one 2 1 1 model assumption let us consider an aquifer consisting of two layers as shown in fig 1 the outer boundaries are impermeable each layer is considered to be homogenous in both horizontal and vertical direction however the properties are anisotropic besides properties of the two layers are different from each other importantly interface between the two layers is permeable therefore cross flow between layers will occur the aquifer is partially penetrated by a well of infinitesimal radius in both two layers in addition other necessary assumptions are illustrated as follows 1 the well is pumped at a constant rate q 2 the effects of gravity and capillary force on fluid flow in all layers are without consideration during the whole production process 3 the thickness of each layer is hn n 1 2 and the penetrating length is hwn n 1 2 4 the fluid flow is single phase and isothermal 2 1 2 solution first the green s function of the drawdown solution of arbitrary point in a homogeneous aquifer is reduced secondly the two layer confined aquifer is divided into two blocks finally the blocks of the aquifer are coupled by conditions to obtain the drawdown solution for the two layer confined aquifer 2 1 2 1 drawdown solution for a homogeneous aquifer the green s function of the drawdown solution in aquifer can be expressed as carslaw and jaeger

the flow rate of interfaces between adjacent blocks are equal 24 p edm 1 p edm 2 q edm 1 q edm 2 for m 1 2 k compared to the formation the drawdown loss along the wellbore is little which can be ignored so the drawdown of two penetrating segment is assumed to be equal 25 p w d 1 1 p w d 2 2 p wd moreover the sum of flow rate of two penetrating segment equals the whole well production rate 26 q w d 1 1 q w d 2 2 1 the linear matrix formed from eqs 22 26 owns 2 k 1 equations with 2 k 1 variables and it can be expressed as 27 ax b where a is the coefficient matrix x is the solution vector

to be figured out by matrix elimination method the solutions of flow rate of penetrating segments interfaces and the wellbore drawdown in the laplace domain could be inverted to the real time domain by stehfest 1970 inversion algorithm in addition the model has the ability to do data assimilation xue et al 2014 xue and zhang 2014 but it is not the focus of this paper the whole flowchart is presented in fig 3 2 1 3 model validation a two layer confined aquifer case is conducted for verification by using the numerical simulator in commercial well test software saphir to investigate drawdown responses in saphir an aquifer can be divided into many grid cells and the fluid flow can be simulated based on finite difference method basic parameters used in this simulation are provided in table 1 there are two layers with different properties both two layers are partially penetrated which is shown in the fig 4 the partially penetrating vertical well is located in the center of aquifer the numerical simulator runs for 2582 days with constant extraction rate 10 m3 d the comparison result is presented in fig 5 the comparison result shows that the agreement between the semi analytical solution and numerical solution is excellent therefore this method and result prove to be correct 2 2 aquifer with two separate layers case two 2 2 1 model assumption let us consider an aquifer consisting of two separate layers which is shown in fig 6 the outer boundaries are impermeable the properties of the two layers are different from each other two layers are separated by impermeable barriers therefore cross flow between layers will not happen the aquifer is partially penetrated by a well of infinitesimal radius in both two layers other necessary assumptions are the same as the case one 2 2 2 solution due to the impermeable barriers between two layers the flow rate of the interfaces equals zero 31 q edm 1 q edm 2 0 m 1 2 k where k is the interface segment number eq 22 can be rewritten as 32 p wdn n q wdn n s wdnwdn n p wd n 1 2 the matrix coefficient a solution vector x and right hand side vector b of the eq 27 can also be rewritten as follow 33 a s w d 1 w d

aquifer with two separate layers can be obtained 2 3 one single layer with an overlying gas cap or an underlying aquifer case three 2 3 1 model assumption an oil reservoir with an overlying gas cap or an underlying aquifer is illustrated in fig 7 the outer boundaries are impermeable both the oil layer and gas cap aquifer are considered to be homogeneous in vertical and horizontal direction however the properties are anisotropic the interfaces between oil layer and gas cap layer aquifer are permeable therefore cross flow between layers will occur the reservoir is partially penetrated by a well of infinitesimal radius in the oil layer other necessary assumptions are the same as the case one 2 3 2 solution for the reason of that only oil layer is penetrated the drawdown function of the penetrating segment in the oil layer which is equal to the drawdown of the wellbore can be written as 36 p w d 1 1 p wd q w d 1 1 s w d 1 w d 1 1 j 1 k q edj 1 s w d 1 e d j 1 where 1 represents oil layer and k is the interface segment number the drawdown function of the mth interface segment in the oil layer can be expressed as 37 p edm 1 q w d 1 1 s e d m w d 1 1 j 1 k q edm 1 s edmedj 1 m 1 2 k because the gas cap layer aquifer is not penetrated q w d 2 2 equals zero then the drawdown function of the mth interface segments in the gas cap aquifer can be rewritten as follow 38 p edm 2 j 1 k q edm 2 s edmedj 1 where 2 represents gas cap layer aquifer coupling the two layers with drawdown and flux continuity conditions at the interface yields the following expression 39 p edm 1 p edm 2 q

solving the linear matrix equations both the drawdown of partially penetrating well and the flow rate of the interface can be obtained 3 results and analysis 3 1 typical flow stages a partially penetrating well in a two layer confined aquifer with cross flow is considered to investigate the flow characteristics the interface is divided into 3 segments the specific matrixes of a x and b have been presented in eqs 28 30 the values of basic calculation parameters are shown in table 2 type curves of dimensionless drawdown and drawdown derivative are plotted in fig 8 the whole flow characteristics can be divided into four stages 1 early transition flow the fluid flows very near the wellbore each partially penetrating segment produces independently and does not interfere with each other this flow stage is consistent with that of fully penetrating well 2 spherical flow in this stage fluid flows from both vertical and horizontal directions into the penetrating segments the cross flow between two layers occurs fluid flows from the layer with lower permeability to the layer with higher permeability with the production time pass the flow rate difference between two layers become greater the pressure drawdown has not spread to the top and bottom boundaries yet the slope of dimensionless drawdown derivative curves is 1 2 3 radial flow when pressure drawdown spreads to the top and bottom boundaries middle radial flow occurs compared with vertical flow the horizontal flow is dominant the duration time of this stage depends on the distance from boundaries to the wellbore the further the boundaries in the horizontal direction is the longer the time of radial flow lasts the cross flow between layers still lasts however due to the supplies in the horizontal direction the flow rate differences between two layers gradually become smaller the dimensionless drawdown derivative curves is a horizontal line 4 pseudo steady flow in this region the pressure drawdown has spread to all the outer boundaries the exchange of fluid between two layers is in a state of dynamic equilibrium on a logarithmic graph curves of dimensionless drawdown and drawdown derivative in this flow stage are straight lines with unit slop 3 2 interface segment number table 3 shows the comparisons of the calculation results for cases of different interface segment number the interface segment number k is set from 3 to 7 other basic calculation parameters are the same with that in table 2 we can see from table 3 that interface segment number has little effect on the drawdown responses even in large time period in general dividing the interface into 3 segments can meet the accuracy requirements of calculation 3 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate how sensitive drawdown flow rate of penetrating segment and interface with respect to cross flow coefficient anisotropic factor penetrating ratio penetrating location the values of basic calculation parameters are the same as table 2 when discussing the influence of a parameter we change the variable s value and keep other parameters value constant the values of the analyzed parameter are also indicated in the figures 3 3 1 effect of cross flow coefficient λ n fig 9 shows the influences of cross flow coefficient on type curves it can be seen from the fig 9a that the cross flow coefficient which reflects the fluid flow capability in two layers affects all the flow stages with the increase of λ n the dimensionless drawdown and drawdown derivative decrease entirely the fluid flow capability in the second layer becomes higher and all the flow stages occur earlier fig 9b and c present the effects of cross flow coefficient on flow rate of interface and each penetrating segment comparing fig 9a and b we can see that cross flow begins in the spherical flow stage and lasts in the radial flow stage the flow rate of interface also becomes higher in the spherical flow stage but lower in the radial flow stage this is because the fluids flow mainly in the vertical direction during the spherical flow stage while in the horizontal direction during the radial flow stage with the respect of flow rate q ed positive value means that fluids flow out of layer while negative value means that fluids flow into layer therefore higher flow capability in the second layer results that the fluids flow into it from the first layer in addition as the fluid flow capability in the second layer becomes higher the fluid supply from the first layer turns greater it can be also seen from fig 9c that the flow rate difference between two penetrating segments gets bigger gradually till radial flow ends and remains constant in the pseudo flow stage 3 3 2 effect of anisotropic factor β the anisotropic factor means the ratio of horizontal permeability to vertical permeability in fig 10 a we can clearly see that anisotropic factor β affects the occurrence time of spherical flow stage and duration time of radial flow stage with the increase of anisotropic factor β the dimensionless drawdown and drawdown derivative get greater in addition due to the low permeability in vertical direction the occurrence time of spherical flow stage becomes later meanwhile the occurrence time of radial flow stage will also be delayed and duration time is shortened fig 10b and c show the effects of anisotropic β on the flow rate of interface and each penetrating segment when anisotropic β increases both the extent of cross flow and the fluid supply from the first layer get lesser from fig 10c we can see that during early transition flow the flow rate of two layers depends on the properties as time increases cross flow occurs which means that fluids flow from the layer with lower flow capability into the layer with higher flow capability the difference of flow rate between two penetrating segments will become greater until radial flow stage ends 3 3 3 effect of penetrating ratio h wd fig 11 shows the influence of penetrating ratio h wd on type curves h wd1 is 0 1 and h wd2 is set to be 0 3 0 4 0 5 penetrating ratio mainly affects early transition flow stage spherical flow stage and radial flow stage with the increase of h wd2 dimensionless drawdown and drawdown derivative decrease the penetrating ratio can affects the extent rather than the time of cross flow besides it is easy to find that the smaller the h wd2 the more obvious the spherical flow because h wd1 and h wd2 are not equal the dimensionless drawdown derivative in the radial flow stage is not horizontal line on the logarithmic graph with the increase of h wd2 the fluid supply from the first layer into the second layer becomes larger fig 11b in the early transition stage the flow rate of the penetrating segment in the second layer is larger than the one in the first layer then the spherical flow occurs with the supply of fluids flowing from the vertical direction the flow rate difference of penetrating segments between two layers gradually increases 3 3 4 effect of penetrating location z wd fig 12 shows the influence of penetrating location z wd on type curves we can see from the fig 12a that z wd mainly affects the spherical flow stage and radial flow stage while the penetrating segments of two layers are close to each other the dimensionless drawdown and drawdown derivative increase as the value of z wd1 changes from 60 to 40 the effect of cross flow coefficient is still larger than penetrating location fig 12b however with the penetrating location in the first layer getting closer to the interface fluids flow from the first layer into the second layer at the beginning and then change the flow direction for the reason of large drawdown near the penetrating segment when the penetrating location in the first layer is close enough to the interface fluids may directly flow from the second layer into the first layer with fluid supply from the first layer into the second layer turns less the flow rate difference between two layers gets smaller in the spherical flow stage radial flow stage and pseudo flow stage fig 12c 3 3 5 effect of interface permeability in case two now we discuss the effect of interface permeability on type curves in case one the two layers are connected and the interface is also permeable however the interface is impermeable in case two the effects of interface permeability are mainly in spherical flow stage radial flow stage and pseudo steady flow stage the dimensionless drawdown of case two is higher than that of case one in all flow stages except early transition flow stage this is because in case one fluids which are near the interface could flow from the layer with low permeability into the layer with high permeability in the spherical flow stage and this will cause lower drawdown however in case two fluids can only flow in the layer with low permeability and this will cause a higher drawdown it is shown in fig 13 b that the flow rate of two penetrating segments in case one is gradually different from that in case two staring from the spherical flow stage due to the fluid supply in case one the flow rate of penetrating segment in the layer with high permeability is always larger than that in the layer with low permeability however in case two the flow rate of two penetrating segments depends on the cross flow coefficient anisotropic factor penetrating ratio and so on in the early flow stages and only depends on the aquifer size in the late pseudo steady flow stage 3 3 6 effect of cross flow coefficient in case three in this case we assume that the well is only penetrated in oil layer with an underlying aquifer all the calculation parameters in case three are the same as that in case one except that h wd2 equals zero fig 14 a shows the dimensionless drawdown and drawdown derivate curves in case three compared with case one the cross flow coefficient λ 2 could not affect the early transition flow stage this is because that the fluids only flow in oil layer in the early transition flow stage we can also see from fig 14b that the fluids flow from the aquifer into oil layer as the permeability in aquifer turns high the water yield becomes large at the same time 4 conclusions in this study a semi analytical approach is proposed to simulate the cross flow effect on the flow behavior of a partially penetrating well in different aquifer types by green functions and boundary element method three cases are investigated including an anisotropic two layer confined aquifer aquifer with two separate layers and a single layer with an overlying gas cap or underlying aquifer the aquifer is divided into blocks which could be characterized by uniform average properties based on the conditions of continuity of pressure and flow rate on the interface the layers are coupled together finally the drawdown solution the flow rate of both penetrating segment and interface are obtained the main contributions in this work can be summarized as follows 1 the flow behavior of a partially penetrating well in an anisotropic two layer confined aquifer with cross flow can be divided into four typical flow periods a early transition flow b spherical flow c radial flow d pseudo steady flow 2 based on the flow rate of interfaces it can be seen that the degree of cross flow increases at the spherical flow stage and decreases gradually at the radial flow stage until it disappears at pseudo steady flow stage the greater the difference of properties between layers the higher the degree of cross flow 3 the flow rate of interfaces can be dramatically affected by the anisotropic factor and penetrating ratio during the spherical flow stage and radial flow stage although the directions of fluid flow should be from the layer with low permeability to the layer with high permeability it can be changed by the penetrating location 4 the flow rate of two penetrating segments in late pseudo steady flow stage only depends on the aquifer size when the two layers are separated from each other 5 in order to avoid premature water or gas invasion in oil reservoir perforations should be located as far away as possible from the gas cap or aquifer 5 data availability the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding

4590,a semi analytical model for the transient flow problem of a partially penetrating well in three dimensional anisotropic two layer confined aquifer is developed by taking the cross flow between two layers into consideration using the green function and boundary element method in laplace space a matrix is established and solved by gauss s elimination method the drawdown solution is inverted to the time domain by using numerical inversion algorithm of stehfest 1970 importantly the time of cross flow occurrence can be indicated precisely moreover the flow rate on penetrating segments and interfaces between layers at different flow stages are quantitatively investigated the comparison between the semi analytical solution and numerical solution shows an excellent agreement in addition one case for aquifer with two separate layers and another case for one single layer with an overlying gas cap or an underlying aquifer are also presented to show the differences between that with or without cross flow effect finally influencing factors including cross flow coefficient anisotropic factor penetrating location and penetrating ratio on both flow rate and drawdown are analyzed in

engineering problems many aquifers are not completely drilled or fully penetrated besides some aquifer systems consisting of multiple layers with different properties and cross flow between layers could not be ignored multi layer systems model has been studied by many researchers for decades in both ground water and petroleum literatures wikramaratna 1984 used laplace transform to get the analytical solution of drawdown in each aquifer but the outer boundaries of this model were infinite and cross flow between the aquifers was not taken into consideration a generalized form of fourier transform was applied to get the analytical solution of steady flow maas 1987a and non steady flow maas 1987b in a layered aquifer system however the derived formula cannot be used to analyze aquifer anisotropy osman 1993 used laplace transformation and duhamel s principle to get the drawdown of the finite conductivity vertical fracture located in a multilayered infinite aquifer importantly they mainly dealt with the fluid flow during early time rather than the flow during the whole time hemker 1999 solved the transient flow problem in layered aquifer with infinite radial extent in this study the finite difference technique was used for the vertical flow component but the cross flow between layers was not taken into consideration the transient flow problem of a well fully penetrating the layered aquifer was solved raghavan et al 1985 basquet et al 1999 using integral transformation method medeiros et al 2010 dealt with a heterogeneous reservoir by dividing it into blocks then drawdown solutions for adjacent blocks were coupled at the boundaries the method can be extended to compute drawdown for different forms of aquifer heterogeneity using laplace transform double fourier transform and green s functions method with numerical approximations the solutions of dual porosity dual permeability model for a two layer confined aquifer with cross flow were obtained by lu et al 2015 many scholars used the several methods of integral transformation laplace transformation separate variables to study unsteady flow problems of partially penetrating wells to solve problems in three dimension buhidma and raghavan 1980 investigated the drawdown and buildup behavior of partially penetrating wells in a rectangular aquifer with bottom water drive using the method of green s function the model was only for one layer javandel and witherspoon 1982 presented an analytical solution for the problem of partially penetrating in an isotropic two layer confined aquifer shah and thambynayagam 1992 solved the problem of partial completion in a two layer confined aquifer with the wellbore drawdown varying like a heaviside step function using finite hankel transforms and extended it to the case of a semipermeable membrane at the interlayer boundary cheng and morohunfola 1993 combined theories of neuman witherspoon and herrera with technique of laplace transform to analytically solve the transient flow problem in a multilayered leaky aquifer system which was composed of alternating layer of aquifers and aquitards however their research was limited to one dimensional problem kuchuk and habashy 1996 utilized the electromagnetics concepts of reflection and transmission to figure out fluid flow problems of horizontal well in a three dimensional layered aquifer whose homogeneity only existed in one direction taking horizontal flow in the aquitard and vertical flow in the confined aquifer into account barrash 2008 presented a semi analytical model for the problem of a partially penetrating well in three layer system with double laplace hankel transform method mishra et al 2012 also used the laplace transform to get the drawdown of a partially penetrating well with storage in an anisotropic confined aquifer considering the leakage of aquitard storage as an interface phenomenon feng and zhan 2019 developed a model for the problem of a partially penetrating well in a leaky confined aquifer based on this model feng et al 2019 extended their models to the problem of variable discharge of groundwater from a partially penetrating well in two layered aquifer system wang et al 2020 developed an analytical model for partially penetrating well with wellbore storage in double permeability aquifer laplace transformation and finite fourier cosine transformation were used to get the solutions feng et al 2020 solved the flow problem of a partially penetrating well in three layer aquifer system at different top boundary conditions by laplace hankel transform in a word transient flow problems of partially penetrating wells in multi layer aquifer and reservoir systems have caught much attention in the fields of hydrogeology and petroleum engineering however the flow rate on the interfaces between layers could not be quantitatively investigated due to the limitation of models in this study a semi analytical approach is proposed to compute drawdown transients for partially penetrating well in an anisotropic two layer confined aquifer the aquifer is divided into blocks which could be characterized by uniform average properties these blocks are coupled by the conditions of continuity of pressure and flow rate on the adjacent blocks the object of this work is mainly to study the transient flow of partially penetrating well in two layer confined aquifer with cross flow and quantitatively investigate the flow rate on the penetrating segments and interfaces at different flow stages through the change of flow rate on the interfaces the time and extent of cross flow occurrence can be clearly known besides the penetrating location and penetrating number in layers could be arbitrary the model can not only be used to simulate the fluid flow problem of partially penetrating in a two layer confined aquifer but also partially or fully completed in single layer with an overlying gas cap or an underlying aquifer it can also be extended to deal with the multi layer aquifer flow problems 2 methodology here three cases are mainly considered case one is about a two layer confined aquifer with permeable interfaces case two is about an aquifer with two separate layers case three is about one single layer with an overlying gas cap or an underlying aquifer 2 1 two layer confined aquifer with permeable interfaces case one 2 1 1 model assumption let us consider an aquifer consisting of two layers as shown in fig 1 the outer boundaries are impermeable each layer is considered to be homogenous in both horizontal and vertical direction however the properties are anisotropic besides properties of the two layers are different from each other importantly interface between the two layers is permeable therefore cross flow between layers will occur the aquifer is partially penetrated by a well of infinitesimal radius in both two layers in addition other necessary assumptions are illustrated as follows 1 the well is pumped at a constant rate q 2 the effects of gravity and capillary force on fluid flow in all layers are without consideration during the whole production process 3 the thickness of each layer is hn n 1 2 and the penetrating length is hwn n 1 2 4 the fluid flow is single phase and isothermal 2 1 2 solution first the green s function of the drawdown solution of arbitrary point in a homogeneous aquifer is reduced secondly the two layer confined aquifer is divided into two blocks finally the blocks of the aquifer are coupled by conditions to obtain the drawdown solution for the two layer confined aquifer 2 1 2 1 drawdown solution for a homogeneous aquifer the green s function of the drawdown solution in aquifer can be expressed as carslaw and jaeger

the flow rate of interfaces between adjacent blocks are equal 24 p edm 1 p edm 2 q edm 1 q edm 2 for m 1 2 k compared to the formation the drawdown loss along the wellbore is little which can be

to be figured out by matrix elimination method the solutions of flow rate of penetrating segments interfaces and the wellbore drawdown in the laplace domain could be inverted to the real time domain by stehfest 1970 inversion algorithm in addition the model has the ability to do data assimilation xue et al 2014 xue and zhang 2014 but it is not the focus of this paper the whole flowchart is presented in fig 3 2 1 3 model validation a two layer confined aquifer case is conducted for verification by using the numerical simulator in commercial well test software saphir to investigate drawdown responses in saphir an aquifer can be divided into many grid cells and the fluid flow can be simulated based on finite difference method basic parameters used in this simulation are provided in table 1 there are two layers with different properties both two layers are partially penetrated which is shown in the fig 4 the partially penetrating vertical well is located in the center of aquifer the numerical simulator runs for 2582 days with constant extraction rate 10 m3 d the comparison result is presented in fig 5 the comparison result shows that the agreement between the semi analytical solution and numerical solution is excellent therefore this method and result prove to be correct 2 2 aquifer with two separate layers case two 2 2 1 model assumption let us consider an aquifer consisting of two separate layers which is shown in fig 6 the outer boundaries are impermeable the properties of the two layers are different from each other two layers are separated by impermeable barriers therefore cross flow between layers will not happen the aquifer is partially penetrated by a well of infinitesimal radius in both two layers other necessary assumptions are the same as the case one 2 2 2 solution due to the impermeable barriers between two layers the flow rate of the interfaces equals zero 31 q edm 1 q edm 2 0 m 1 2 k where k is the interface segment number eq 22 can be rewritten as 32 p wdn n q wdn n s wdnwdn n p wd n 1 2 the matrix coefficient a solution vector x and right hand side vector b of the eq 27 can also be rewritten as follow 33 a s w d 1 w d

aquifer with two separate layers can be obtained 2 3 one single layer with an overlying gas cap or an underlying aquifer case three 2 3 1 model assumption an oil reservoir with an overlying gas cap or an underlying aquifer is illustrated in fig 7 the outer boundaries are impermeable both the oil layer and gas cap aquifer are considered to be homogeneous in vertical and horizontal direction however the properties are anisotropic the interfaces between oil layer and gas cap layer aquifer are permeable therefore cross flow between layers will occur the reservoir is partially penetrated by a well of infinitesimal radius in the oil layer other necessary assumptions are the same as the case one 2 3 2 solution for the reason of that only oil layer is penetrated the drawdown function of the penetrating segment in the oil layer which is equal to the drawdown of the wellbore can be written as 36 p w d 1 1 p wd q w d 1 1 s w d 1 w d 1 1 j 1 k q edj 1 s w d 1 e d j 1 where 1 represents oil layer and k is the interface segment number the drawdown function of the mth interface segment in the oil layer can be expressed as 37 p edm 1 q w d 1 1 s e d m w d 1 1 j 1 k q edm 1 s edmedj 1 m 1 2 k because the gas cap layer aquifer is not penetrated q w d 2 2 equals zero then the drawdown function of the mth interface segments in the gas cap aquifer can be rewritten as follow 38 p edm 2 j 1 k q edm 2 s edmedj 1 where 2 represents gas cap layer aquifer coupling the two layers with drawdown and flux continuity conditions at the interface yields the following expression 39 p edm 1 p edm 2 q

solving the linear matrix equations both the drawdown of partially penetrating well and the flow rate of the interface can be obtained 3 results and analysis 3 1 typical flow stages a partially penetrating well in a two layer confined aquifer with cross flow is considered to investigate the flow characteristics the interface is divided into 3 segments the specific matrixes of a x and b have been presented in eqs 28 30 the values of basic calculation parameters are shown in table 2 type curves of dimensionless drawdown and drawdown derivative are plotted in fig 8 the whole flow characteristics can be divided into four stages 1 early transition flow the fluid flows very near the wellbore each partially penetrating segment produces independently and does not interfere with each other this flow stage is consistent with that of fully penetrating well 2 spherical flow in this stage fluid flows from both vertical and horizontal directions into the penetrating segments the cross flow between two layers occurs fluid flows from the layer with lower permeability to the layer with higher permeability with the production time pass the flow rate difference between two layers become greater the pressure drawdown has not spread to the top and bottom boundaries yet the slope of dimensionless drawdown derivative curves is 1 2 3 radial flow when pressure drawdown spreads to the top and bottom boundaries middle radial flow occurs compared with vertical flow the horizontal flow is dominant the duration time of this stage depends on the distance from boundaries to the wellbore the further the boundaries in the horizontal direction is the longer the time of radial flow lasts the cross flow between layers still lasts however due to the supplies in the horizontal direction the flow rate differences between two layers gradually become smaller the dimensionless drawdown derivative curves is a horizontal line 4 pseudo steady flow in this region the pressure drawdown has spread to all the outer boundaries the exchange of fluid between two layers is in a state of dynamic equilibrium on a logarithmic graph curves of dimensionless drawdown and drawdown derivative in this flow stage are straight lines with unit slop 3 2 interface segment number table 3 shows the comparisons of the calculation results for cases of different interface segment number the interface segment number k is set from 3 to 7 other basic calculation parameters are the same with that in table 2 we can see from table 3 that interface segment number has little effect on the drawdown responses even in large time period in general dividing the interface into 3 segments can meet the accuracy requirements of calculation 3 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate how sensitive drawdown flow rate of penetrating segment and interface with respect to cross flow coefficient anisotropic factor penetrating ratio penetrating location the values of basic calculation parameters are the same as table 2 when discussing the influence of a parameter we change the variable s value and keep other parameters value constant the values of the analyzed parameter are also indicated in the figures 3 3 1 effect of cross flow coefficient λ n fig 9 shows the influences of cross flow coefficient on type curves it can be seen from the fig 9a that the cross flow coefficient which reflects the fluid flow capability in two layers affects all the flow stages with the increase of λ n the dimensionless drawdown and drawdown derivative decrease entirely the fluid flow capability in the second layer becomes higher and all the flow stages occur earlier fig 9b and c present the effects of cross flow coefficient on flow rate of interface and each penetrating segment comparing fig 9a and b we can see that cross flow begins in the spherical flow stage and lasts in the radial flow stage the flow rate of interface also becomes higher in the spherical flow stage but lower in the radial flow stage this is because the fluids flow mainly in the vertical direction during the spherical flow stage while in the horizontal direction during the radial flow stage with the respect of flow rate q ed positive value means that fluids flow out of layer while negative value means that fluids flow into layer therefore higher flow capability in the second layer results that the fluids flow into it from the first layer in addition as the fluid flow capability in the second layer becomes higher the fluid supply from the first layer turns greater it can be also seen from fig 9c that the flow rate difference between two penetrating segments gets bigger gradually till radial flow ends and remains constant in the pseudo flow stage 3 3 2 effect of anisotropic factor β the anisotropic factor means the ratio of horizontal permeability to vertical permeability in fig 10 a we can clearly see that anisotropic factor β affects the occurrence time of spherical flow stage and duration time of radial flow stage with the increase of anisotropic factor β the dimensionless drawdown and drawdown derivative get greater in addition due to the low permeability in vertical direction the occurrence time of spherical flow stage becomes later meanwhile the occurrence time of radial flow stage will also be delayed and duration time is shortened fig 10b and c show the effects of anisotropic β on the flow rate of interface and each penetrating segment when anisotropic β increases both the extent of cross flow and the fluid supply from the first layer get lesser from fig 10c we can see that during early transition flow the flow rate of two layers depends on the properties as time increases cross flow occurs which means that fluids flow from the layer with lower flow capability into the layer with higher flow capability the difference of flow rate between two penetrating segments will become greater until radial flow stage ends 3 3 3 effect of penetrating ratio h wd fig 11 shows the influence of penetrating ratio h wd on type curves h wd1 is 0 1 and h wd2 is set to be 0 3 0 4 0 5 penetrating ratio mainly affects early transition flow stage spherical flow stage and radial flow stage with the increase of h wd2 dimensionless drawdown and drawdown derivative decrease the penetrating ratio can affects the extent rather than the time of cross flow besides it is easy to find that the smaller the h wd2 the more obvious the spherical flow because h wd1 and h wd2 are not equal the dimensionless drawdown derivative in the radial flow stage is not horizontal line on the logarithmic graph with the increase of h wd2 the fluid supply from the first layer into the second layer becomes larger fig 11b in the early transition stage the flow rate of the penetrating segment in the second layer is larger than the one in the first layer then the spherical flow occurs with the supply of fluids flowing from the vertical direction the flow rate difference of penetrating segments between two layers gradually increases 3 3 4 effect of penetrating location z wd fig 12 shows the influence of penetrating location z wd on type curves we can see from the fig 12a that z wd mainly affects the spherical flow stage and radial flow stage while the penetrating segments of two layers are close to each other the dimensionless drawdown and drawdown derivative increase as the value of z wd1 changes from 60 to 40 the effect of cross flow coefficient is still larger than penetrating location fig 12b however with the penetrating location in the first layer getting closer to the interface fluids flow from the first layer into the second layer at the beginning and then change the flow direction for the reason of large drawdown near the penetrating segment when the penetrating location in the first layer is close enough to the interface fluids may directly flow from the second layer into the first layer with fluid supply from the first layer into the second layer turns less the flow rate difference between two layers gets smaller in the spherical flow stage radial flow stage and pseudo flow stage fig 12c 3 3 5 effect of interface permeability in case two now we discuss the effect of interface permeability on type curves in case one the two layers are connected and the interface is also permeable however the interface is impermeable in case two the effects of interface permeability are mainly in spherical flow stage radial flow stage and pseudo steady flow stage the dimensionless drawdown of case two is higher than that of case one in all flow stages except early transition flow stage this is because in case one fluids which are near the interface could flow from the layer with low permeability into the layer with high permeability in the spherical flow stage and this will cause lower drawdown however in case two fluids can only flow in the layer with low permeability and this will cause a higher drawdown it is shown in fig 13 b that the flow rate of two penetrating segments in case one is gradually different from that in case two staring from the spherical flow stage due to the fluid supply in case one the flow rate of penetrating segment in the layer with high permeability is always larger than that in the layer with low permeability however in case two the flow rate of two penetrating segments depends on the cross flow coefficient anisotropic factor penetrating ratio and so on in the early flow stages and only depends on the aquifer size in the late pseudo steady flow stage 3 3 6 effect of cross flow coefficient in case three in this case we assume that the well is only penetrated in oil layer with an underlying aquifer all the calculation parameters in case three are the same as that in case one except that h wd2 equals zero fig 14 a shows the dimensionless drawdown and drawdown derivate curves in case three compared with case one the cross flow coefficient λ 2 could not affect the early transition flow stage this is because that the fluids only flow in oil layer in the early transition flow stage we can also see from fig 14b that the fluids flow from the aquifer into oil layer as the permeability in aquifer turns high the water yield becomes large at the same time 4 conclusions in this study a semi analytical approach is proposed to simulate the cross flow effect on the flow behavior of a partially penetrating well in different aquifer types by green functions and boundary element method three cases are investigated including an anisotropic two layer confined aquifer aquifer with two separate layers and a single layer with an overlying gas cap or underlying aquifer the aquifer is divided into blocks which could be characterized by uniform average properties based on the conditions of continuity of pressure and flow rate on the interface the layers are coupled together finally the drawdown solution the flow rate of both penetrating segment and interface are obtained the main contributions in this work can be summarized as follows 1 the flow behavior of a partially penetrating well in an anisotropic two layer confined aquifer with cross flow can be divided into four typical flow periods a early transition flow b spherical flow c radial flow d pseudo steady flow 2 based on the flow rate of interfaces it can be seen that the degree of cross flow increases at the spherical flow stage and decreases gradually at the radial flow stage until it disappears at pseudo steady flow stage the greater the difference of properties between layers the higher the degree of cross flow 3 the flow rate of interfaces can be dramatically affected by the anisotropic factor and penetrating ratio during the spherical flow stage and radial flow stage although the directions of fluid flow should be from the layer with low permeability to the layer with high permeability it can be changed by the penetrating location 4 the flow rate of two penetrating segments in late pseudo steady flow stage only depends on the aquifer size when the two layers are separated from each other 5 in order to avoid premature water or gas invasion in oil reservoir perforations should be located as far away as possible from the gas cap or aquifer 5 data availability the data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding

4591,concrete and geomembranes are common materials used in canal linings to decrease canal seepage current numerical studies focus on concrete linings only by equivalent continuous models and seldom are about geomembrane and are suitable to quantify the seepage loss from canals with damaged linings in this study a new model is developed for the coupled numerical simulation of seepage through concrete with cracks and a geomembrane with holes in canal lining damage based on the finite element method in this model the porous media is discretized into solid elements whereas discrete cracks and geomembranes are modelled by zero thickness elements with the richards equation and cubic law applied to describe the water seepage process the porous media and crack zones are implicitly coupled in time and space through the exchange flow between the concrete and the crack zones in that the heads are integrated in a single matrix equation the domain area is divided into two subdomain areas by the geomembrane for the two subdomain areas the surfaces of both sides in the geomembrane are treated as two flux boundaries the proposed model is calibrated and validated by the results of ponding tests conducted on a canal with four lining treatments and additional experiments which showed that the model fit the experiments very well the model is applied to sensitivity analyses by varying the model parameters the model is shown to be capable of simulating the seepage of canals lined by concrete and geomembrane lining with different cracks and holes the sensitivity analysis shows that canal seepage mainly depends on the lining characteristics such as the crack width hole density saturated hydraulic conductivity k s of the geomembrane k s of the concrete and k s of the soil layers adjacent to the canal bottom keywords canal seepage canal lining numerical simulation damaged lining combined lining fully coupled model 1 introduction water loss from canals is the main source of water loss during water conveyance in irrigation areas and accounts for more than 15 50 of the total irrigation water in some regions van der leeden et al 1990 wang et al 2002 canal seepage not only wastes water but also maintains groundwater and soil water at high levels around the canal upadhyaya and chauhan 2001 and can lead to soil salinization and waterlogging singh 2017 because of the increasing irrigation demands and climate change it is a widespread and urgent challenge to maintain the sustainable use of water resources especially in arid and semiarid regions fasakhodi et al 2010 mariolakos 2007 thus the use of canal linings is an important approach for decreasing seepage loss concrete and geomembranes are two popular materials used in canal linings due to their simple construction and good seepage control performance soomro et al 2018 as an increasing number of canals are lined the accurate estimation of the seepage from lined canals is the basis for assessing agricultural water use efficiency cost and benefit performance of linings and for ensuring proper irrigation management hameed et al 1996 tabari et al 2014 xu et al 2010 canal seepage is greatly reduced by newly built canal linings jadhav et al 2014 snell 2001 zhang et al 2017 however significant seepage loss starts to occur from lined canals after the deterioration of the linings especially with poor maintenance of the lining barkhordari et al 2020 ghazaw 2011 kilic and tuylu 2011 many studies have shown that the permeability coefficient increases dramatically after the emergence of concrete cracks aldea et al 1999 wang et al 1997 yi et al 2011 and the liner loses functionality to some extent as the cracks expand merkley 2007 swamee and chahar 2015 the factors affecting canal seepage include the soil hydraulic properties canal bottom depth to the groundwater table lining material type damage conditions and lining service time for concrete and geomembrane combined linings seepage loss normally occurs in the cracks of the concrete or through holes in the geomembrane and only a negligible amount of water is lost through the concrete and geomembrane giroud et al 1992 reginato and myers 1966 therefore the focus of estimating the seepage losses from concrete and geomembrane lined canals is the identification of the seepage through cracks and holes this is the basis for explaining the mechanism of seepage loss through canal linings and studying the influence of different types of lining damage on canal seepage the seepage from a canal is obtained by direct measurements empirical equations theoretical analysis and numerical simulation the direct methods include the inflow outflow method ponding test method and seepage meter method akkuzu 2012 alam and bhutta 2004 brockway and worstell 1968 the effect of the lining and its damage on canal seepage can be obtained directly with these methods the inflow outflow test and ponding test are two common methods to measure canals directly the inflow outflow test is easy to conduct but is limited by the measurements as a result this test is widely used but more precise instruments are needed to obtain more accurate results kinzli et al 2010 the ponding test is difficult to conduct compared with the inflow outflow method but is more accurate and dependable alam and bhutta 2004 kraatz 1977 empirical formulas are often used to estimate canal seepage losses which include the davis wilson model moritz model ingham model molesworth model kostiakov model etc guo 1997 kraatz 1977 among these formulas the lining efficacy is reflected only in the davis wilson model and kostiakov model by a lining coefficient multiplying the earthen canal seepage rate empirical formulas are a simple and convenient way to estimate canal seepage but do not consider the lining effect variation with time or different types of lining damage because the coefficient is treated as a constant value with a wide range for the same type of canal lining material consequently the seepage loss from a lined canal cannot be estimated accurately by empirical formulas for example akkuzu 2012 compared the seepage loss calculated by the moritz and davis wilson equations with inflow outflow methods in a concrete lined canal which showed that the empirical equations are not sufficiently accurate for estimating seepage losses from lined canals theoretical analyses based on the steady state flow or unsteady state flow equation in groundwater and an underlying medium assume that only one or two homogeneous isotropic porous media are involved and based on these equations the quantity of seepage from canals has been given by some researchers bouwer 1969 1965 choudhary and chahar 2007 herrmann and bucksch 2014 swamee et al 2000 theoretical analyses explain an explicit mechanism and obtain a relatively accurate result but they are seldom used in the estimation of canal seepage from lined canals with different canal sections and groundwater levels because of the spatial variability in the soil characteristics and idealized conditions simplified for analytical tractability rastogi and prasad 1992 yao et al 2012 numerical simulation can accurately show the spatial and temporal seepage development under various boundary conditions mirnateghi and bruch 1983 showed that the finite difference method fdm was easy and efficient to modify for various conditions compared with the analytical method from a partly lined canal reported by subramanya et al 1975 rastogi and prasad 1992 assumed that the k s value of the lining layer was 1 10 of the soil at the bottom of the canal bed and used the finite element method fem to study the canal seepage loss in a canal phreatic aquifer system yao et al 2012 showed that hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 2008 reliably simulated the canal seepage and soil response under layered soil structures and four different linings by considering the lining material as a whole porous medium numerical simulation which takes multilayer soils and canal lining characteristics into consideration is the most accurate among the above methods however few numerical simulations concern canal seepage through geomembrane linings the method used in most studies to simulate seepage through concrete linings is the equivalent continuum model khoei et al 2015 the k s value used in the equivalent continuum model is an equivalent value for the lining and its damage this simplification provides a relatively accurate simulation result especially for canals with high integrity linings or those close to failure however because the relationship between the equivalent k s value of the lining and the lining damage is not explicit the equivalent continuum model is not suitable for quantifying the effects of the cracks and holes in a combined lining of a concrete lining with cracks and a geomembrane lining with holes on the canal seepage the discrete crack method is more suitable for detecting the seepage flow in cracked concrete lining because cracks are explicitly simulated and the representative element volume rev of the equivalent continuum model may not exist or is larger than the scale of the flow region of interest jiang et al 2014 some studies have shown that discrete crack method can feasibly simulate saturated and unsaturated flows in concrete lining cracks li et al 2016a 2018 long et al 1982 miao et al 2015 yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 for example long et al 1982 studied equivalent homogeneous anisotropic porous media by numerical simulation of the flow in discrete crack networks and the results showed that the fracture system behaved more like porous media in four cases in a study conducted by yan et al 2018 the flows in rock and cracks are modelled by darcy s law and the cubic law respectively and the results of the numerical solutions agree well with the analytical solutions which correctly calculated unsteady state seepage li et al 2018 proposed a model to simulate the capillary water absorption of concrete with a discrete crack network in which the concrete and cracks are modelled by solid elements and zero thickness crack elements respectively these studies show that the discrete crack method is an accurate and dependable approach to simulate canal seepage when the concrete lining is cracked due to the small thickness and small value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of geomembrane material k sg there are large numbers of calculations to implement and the many singular elements pose a difficulty for the mesh pretreatment which directly affects the calculation accuracy lu et al 1994 nayroles et al 1992 neuman 1973 zhang et al 2001 foose et al 2001 used modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 to simulate seepage through a composite lining with soil and a geomembrane with a hole in which the geomembrane and the lateral flow through the soil and geomembrane are modelled by a no flow boundary and a thin layer with a thickness up to 0 03 mm respectively based on the discontinuous fem zhan et al 2009 presented a membrane element method to simulate the fluid flow through a membrane that can be easily coupled with the normal galerkin fem el zein et al 2012 developed a three dimensional 3d model with the fem and simulated the flow and containment through a geomembrane composite lining with defects however there are few studies about the flow passing through geomembranes with many holes and the lack of coupling of the flow in cracks and porous media and geomembranes the main goal of this paper is to establish a 3d model coupling continuous porous media discrete cracks and thin geomembranes that can be used to simulate the seepage process through concrete with cracks and geomembranes with holes and cracks zero thickness elements are used to model the crack structure and geomembrane because they reduce the number of degrees of freedom without generating new solid elements and consequently reduce the computational burden based on the results of ponding tests and additional experiments the 3d numerical model was calibrated and validated and then applied to sensitivity analysis of canal seepage under different canal lining damage scenarios these efforts aimed to quantify the cracks and holes influencing canal seepage and to identify the main factors influencing canal seepage 2 material and methods 2 1 study area field experiments were carried out at the yonglian experimental station n41 4 6 18 e108 0 15 50 and altitude 1027 17 m above sea level in the hetao irrigation district hid which is located in inner mongolia china the site is in a typical arid continental climate zone with a mean annual temperature of 6 c xu et al 2012 the mean annual precipitation is 130 mm to 215 mm and the average annual evaporation from the water surface is 2100 mm to 2300 mm zhu et al 2013 the groundwater table is 1 0 4 0 m below the ground surface during a year zhang et al 2018 there is an approximately five month freezing thawing period from middle november to late april of the next year which results in extensive frost heaving damage to the concrete lining zhou et al 2014 2 2 experimental design and measurements 2 2 1 ponding test a canal 30 m long in the yonglian experiment station was selected for the ponding test following the chinese standard technical mwrc 2010 the canal was lined with a concrete and geomembrane combined lining in september 2015 the precast concrete slabs were 0 6 m in length 0 4 m in width and 0 06 m in thickness the joints between the precast concrete slabs were filled with cement mortar where cracks occurred there was an approximately 0 03 m thick sand layer between the concrete and geomembrane the whole test was divided into four treatments according to the canal lining status treatment 1 t1 was applied to the initial conditions of the canal denoted ocg treatment 2 denoted og was based on treatment 1 and involved the removal of the concrete slabs meaning the canal was lined only with a geomembrane with a 3 year service time then the geomembrane was also removed in treatment 3 denoted s after the ponding test of the t3 treatment the canal was repaired and lined with a combination of new precast concrete slabs and a new geomembrane which was the fourth treatment t4 denoted ncg experiments were performed over the period of 22 september 18 october 2018 each ponding test comprised a constant level stage through the addition of water and a variable water level stage no water added the water level was recorded automatically every 5 min by a water level gauge which was used to monitor and control the water level in the first stage and to calculate the canal seepage rate in the second stage more detailed information about the ponding tests can be found in the literature han et al 2020 2 2 2 canal bed soil characteristics measurements the soil profile in fig 1 was excavated to depths of 1 5 m three soil samples were taken at 0 15 m intervals in each pit the soil samples were originally taken by means of cutting rings and weighed to determine the initial water content next the soil samples were saturated in distilled water for 48 h and k s was measured with a constant head permeameter fu et al 2019 after the k s of the soil samples was determined the samples were dehydrated in a centrifuge h 1400pf at 10 rotational speeds to establish the relationship between the soil matrix potential and water content shang et al 2009 the 10 rotational speeds were set at 0 1000 1700 2200 3100 3800 4400 4900 7000 8500 r min and the time for each rotation was predetermined to be 90 min after the soil water content and matrix potential were measured retc software van genuchten et al 1991 was used to obtain the parameters m n α θr in the vg model van genuchten 1980 as shown in eq 1 at the end of the final measurement the dry bulk density was determined by oven drying lai and ren 2007 and the particle size distributions were determined with the hydrometer method the experimental results for the soil characteristics are shown in table 1 the soil profile was divided into 5 layers according to the soil texture and measured k s 1 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 ah n m h 0 θ s h 0 where θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 θr and θs are the residual and saturated water contents respectively α is the inverse of the air entry value or bubbling pressure l 1 n is a pore size distribution index m 1 1 n and h is the water matric potential l 2 2 3 concrete permeability test the ks of concrete material k sc was measured based on darcy s law li et al 2016b a modified apparatus for measuring the water permeability of concrete was used to add a hydraulic gradient to obtain the flow rate through the concrete samples k sc was calculated by eq 2 2 k sc q l a δ h where q is the stable flow rate though the concrete sample l3t 1 l is the height of the concrete sample l a is the cross sectional area perpendicular to the flow direction l2 and δh is the hydraulic potential difference l three samples were randomly taken from both the bottom and side of the ponding test canal by the core drilling method issaadi et al 2017 the size of each sample is a cylinder with a 10 cm diameter and 6 cm height the measured k sc has a wide range from 2 74 10 11 to 6 17 10 8 m s with an average of 1 08 10 8 m s according to the literature li et al 2017 the water retention curve of concrete is described by the vg model van genuchten 1980 in the present study the parameters a n θ r and θs of concrete were determined according to the literature yao et al 2012 and were assumed to be equivalent to a soil layer with similar permeability 2 2 4 lining damage and parameters a damage survey was conducted before the ponding test approximately 55 67 of the joints were obviously cracked and other joints where the original mortar still existed were slightly damaged mainly because of frost heaving damage due to the half year seasonal freezing thawing period in the region yu et al 2010 there were 125 holes which were mainly caused by weed root growth and lining construction observed in the geomembrane at the canal sides and 10 holes at the canal bottom the current number of holes and hole area located at heights 0 3 m from the canal bottom in the canal sides per metre of length are 0 33 and 8 33 mm2 and these parameters are 2 6 and 794 5 mm2 in the canal bottom respectively the corresponding hole density i e the total hole area divided by the geomembrane area is 4 2 10 4 which was used in the sensitivity analysis fig 2 shows the hole number and hole width per unit length of the canal at different heights from the canal bottom 2 3 model description 2 3 1 governing equation in a canal lined with a concrete and geomembrane combined lining the seepage water is driven by a hydraulic gradient penetrating the concrete and its cracks geomembrane and its holes and then infiltrating the soil to supply the soil water and groundwater see fig 3 a the water flow in concrete and soil follows the theory of porous media water movement and the flow in cracks follows the cubic law the governing equations are described in detail below 1 water flow in soil and concrete based on the assumption of neglecting the gas phase transport the flow moving through the soil and concrete is described by richards equation richards 1931 as follows hall and hall 1989 van belleghem et al 2016 wang and ueda 2011 3 c dh dt x k h h x y k h h y z k h h z 1 s where c is the soil water capacity l 1 t is time t x is the horizontal coordinate perpendicular to the canal l y is the coordinate along the canal l z positive upward is the vertical coordinate l h is the pressure head l the soil water matric potential in the unsaturated zone and k h is the soil hydraulic conductivity as a function of the pressure head lt 1 s is the source sink term which means that the water moves from the soil and concrete to the cracks in the present study t 1 the vg model van genuchten 1980 of the soil water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity function of mualem 1976 are used to calculate k h and θ from h as shown in eq 1 and eqs 4 5 4 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 5 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 se is the normalized water content and θ is calculated by eq 1 2 water flow in the cracks based on previous research li et al 2018 the cracks are modelled by zero thickness elements the water flow through cracks is described as eq 6 6 d f c f h t t d f k f h t h z s c 7 sc k f h n where d f is the width of the crack l cf is the crack water capacity l 1 t l 1 denotes the gradient operator restricting the crack s tangential plane k f is the permeability coefficient of the crack lt 1 h is the matrix potential or pressure head in the crack l z positive upward is the vertical coordinate l and sc is the flux from the crack to the soil or concrete lt 1 which can be described by darcy s law 8 s c up k f d h up d n up 9 s c down k f d h down d n down where n is the unit normal to the crack plane and the subscripts up and down mean the upper and lower surfaces of the crack plane respectively the water flux changes from one side of a crack to the other the sc in eq 6 is the sum of sc up and sc down the term dh d n means the gradient of the water head between the cracks and matrix material which can be written as 10 dh dn h c h 0 5 d f where h c and h are the water heads of the crack and matrix l respectively as the crack width is far smaller than the size of the concrete slabs the h values of the two sides are identical see fig 3 b the complex flow behaviour in cracks is governed by the navier stokes equations brush and thomson 2003 in this study because the joint surface of cracks is smooth and parallel the navier stokes equations can be simplified to the cubic law at a low reynolds number long et al 1982 witherspoon et al 1980 which is commonly adopted for each crack in discrete fracture networks li et al 2016c zhang et al 2019 1996 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 and is proven to be effective for cracks with widths in the range of 0 001 mm 10 mm lomize 1951 louis 1969 thus k f is calculated as follows 11 k f d f 2 ρ g 12 η τ ξ k r h where ρ is the water density ml 3 1000 kg m3 g is the gravitational acceleration lt 2 9 81 m s2 η is the viscosity of water mt 1l 1 ξ is the toughness of the crack which denotes the morphological parameter accounting for the difference between the real fracture and an ideal parallel fracture and τ is the tortuosity of the crack because the crack is relatively shallow flat and smooth τ and ξ are assumed to be 1 0 and the depth of the crack is assumed to be 0 06 m which is the same as the concrete slab thickness 3 transformation of the water flow through the geomembrane governing equation the flow through the geomembrane in this study is not simulated through the normal galerkin fem by meshing the geomembrane interior the water head of which is used to create the global matrix the domain is divided into two subdomains by the geomembrane for the two subdomain areas the surfaces of both sides in the geomembrane are treated as two flux boundaries which are calculated as follows 12 n u u u k g h d h u d g 13 n d u d k g h u h d d g where n is the external normal to the boundary u is the water flow velocity vector lt 1 k g is the permeability coefficient of the geomembrane lt 1 hu is the water head at the upper boundary of the geomembrane l hd is the water head at the bottom boundary of the geomembrane l and d g is the thickness of the geomembrane l the holes in the geomembrane are treated as the contact surface of the upper and lower soil layers of the geomembrane the water head loss at holes is ignored in most cases there is some space between the geomembrane and soil because of wrinkles in the geomembrane clods or irregularities at the underlying soil surface even though the underlying soil surface is apparently smooth the geomembrane bridges the small spaces between the soil particles giroud and bonaparte 1989a hence water first enters the holes and cracks and then laterally moves some distance in the space which is not considered in eq 12 eq 13 an equivalent hole is used to represent the lateral flow effect by increasing the area of the hole the size of the equivalent hole is defined in eqs 14 17 14 d w s p g d w s 0 15 d l s h 1 m 2 16 d w b p g d w b 0 17 d l b p g d l b 0 where dw s and dl s are the width and length of the equivalent hole in the geomembrane at the canal sides l pg is a parameter that represents the lateral flow effect along the horizontal direction ll 1 h is the canal water depth l m is the side slope of canal ll 1 dw s0 is the width of the original hole in the geomembrane at the canal sides l dw b and dl b are the width and length of the equivalent hole in the geomembrane at the canal bottom l dw b0 and dl b0 are the width and length of the original hole in the geomembrane at the canal bottom l the length of the equivalent hole at the canal sides is different from that at the canal bottom because the geomembrane at the canal sides in the test canal is obviously wrinkled and there are clods or irregularities at the underlying soil surface or even where the underlying soil surface is apparently smooth due to weed root growth and the cycle of frost heaving in soil and most holes in the canal sides are caused by weed growth when the weeds in the canal sides grow their roots penetrate the geomembrane and then grow from the locations of holes to canal bottom and top of the canal dyke along the contact surface of the geomembrane and the adjacent soil under the geomembrane in the canal bank see fig 4 when the weeds die their decayed roots cause empty space between the geomembrane and underlaying soil which strengthens the channel from the canal water surface to the canal bottom for the lateral flow after the water infiltrates the holes kraatz 1977 therefore the dl s is assumed to be equal to the length of canal inside slope under canal water depth in the canal cross section in present paper 2 3 2 numerical implementation the fem was used to solve the coupled 3d governing equations eq 3 eq 6 and eqs 12 13 the galerkin fem with linear basis functions was used to obtain the solution of the flow equation subject to the imposed initial and boundary conditions the numerical solution of this problem is built by using the software comsol multiphysics which is a well known tool that provides full access for solving partial differential equations comsol 2015 the water flow in porous media and crack are coupled with the water exchange between the cracks and concrete which is the source sink term in both governing equations the geomembrane boundary is treated as two flux boundaries for the two subdomain regions divided by the geomembrane the details of the numerical implementation are shown in appendix a transient analysis is selected for modelling the dynamic canal seepage process the nonlinear algebraic equation at each time step is solved by the newton raphson iteration scheme and the direct pardiso solver is used to solve the linear algebraic equation during the newton raphson iterations melnikova et al 2013 the water flow in the porous media was modelled by solid elements such as tetrahedral hexahedral and or triangular prismatic elements the zero thickness interface element is used to model cracks and geomembranes as shown in fig 3 b the mesh size is approximately 1 mm to 100 mm a typical scenario mesh has approximately 340 000 nodes and 660 000 elements for the domain area in the experimental canal fig 1 a for each time step the flux is calculated by darcy s law after the water head of all nodes is solved then the infiltration rate is given by integrating the flux along the constant head boundary area the cumulative infiltration ci for each output time is calculated by integrating the infiltration rate from the initial time to the output time 2 3 3 boundary and initial conditions because the canal is relatively small and the test duration of each treatment is relatively short the area affected by canal seepage is relatively limited the horizontal research area is set as 50 m because the soil layers between the right side and left side perpendicular to the canal are similar this study assumes that the seepage flow is symmetric around the vertical axis through the middle line of the canal and only half of the horizontal domain 25 m is simulated both side boundaries parallel to the canal b1 b2 in fig 1 are set as no flux boundaries the groundwater depth of the study area over the simulation duration is approximately 2 2 2 4 m because the groundwater table depth in the simulation domain changes between 1 0 and 3 0 m and there is little vertical exchange in the groundwater zone yang et al 2011 the vertical exchange of groundwater below 4 m can be neglected hence the bottom boundary of the domain area in the simulation b3 in fig 1 is set 4 m below the ground surface as a no flux boundary the ground surface b4 is taken into account as a no flux boundary because there was no precipitation and the evapotranspiration from the soil was very low compared with the canal seepage rate during the simulation period han et al 2020 the canal surface b5 is taken as a constant water head boundary note that the zones above the water surface are also taken as a no flux boundary when the canal seepage is simulated by the coupled 3d model if the whole length of the canal 30 m is set as the domain area more than 3 77 million nodes and 4 6 million elements respectively are required to discretize the mesh since repetitive iterations are inevitable for solving the 3d unsaturated richards equation which is highly nonlinear maintaining calculation efficiency is a great challenge therefore according to the symmetry of the precast concrete lining arrangement a canal 1 2 m long along the direction of the canal is selected as the domain area because the lengths of the bottom and side of the canal are 0 4 m and 0 6 m respectively and 1 2 m is a typical unit length fig 1 the front and back surfaces b6 and b7 in fig 1 in the y coordinate of the canal are set as zero flux boundaries due to symmetry for the constant water level stage the boundary conditions are 18 h z n 0 x y z b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 b 6 b 7 t m t 0 19 h d h w x y z b 5 t m t 0 where n is the normal direction to the boundary d is the vertical coordinate of the canal surface l hw is the water level in the canal l and tm is the duration of the constant level stage in each treatment t the initial value of the model is input as the water head according to the measured groundwater table depth and soil water content which is transformed by the vg model 3 model calibration and validation the ci with time during the stable water level stage and the seepage rates in the variable water level stage in the four treatments are used for model calibration and validation respectively for these cases the statistical indices of the coefficient of determination r2 the relative mean absolute error rmae the root mean squared error rmse and the mean error me cui et al 2020 are chosen to quantify the difference between the simulated results of the model and observation values these indices are defined as follows 20 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 21 rmae 1 n i 1 n x i y i y i 22 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 23 me 1 n i 1 n x i y i where the subscript i represents the serial number of the results n represents the total number of the results xi is the simulated result and yi is the observed result first the s treatment observations were used to calibrate and validate the k s of each soil layer second the ncg treatment results were used to calibrate and validate the initial crack widths at each joint between the precast concrete slabs and the initial k sg it is assumed that the widths and depths of cracks in different locations are the same third based on the calibrated soil parameters and initial k sg the og treatment observations were used to calibrate and validate parameter p g and the equivalent k sg after geomembrane damage of holes and cracks finally the crack width and equivalent k sc were calibrated and validated with the ocg treatment observations fig 5 shows the simulated and observed ci per metre length of the canal with time during the constant water level stage in the calibration of the s ncg og and ncg treatments fig 6 shows the observed and simulated seepage rates per metre length during the variable water level stage at different canal water depths in the validation of each treatment generally the simulated results of the proposed model agree well with the observed results in both the calibration and validation in the calibration of the proposed model all the r2 values are larger than 0 99 and the rmae rmse and me values are smaller than 4 579 0 007 m3 m and 0 006 m3 m respectively in the validation the r2 values are larger than 0 974 and the rmae rmse and me values are smaller than 6 3 3 498 10 6 m3 m s and 1 934 10 6 m3 m s good agreement is obtained by the proposed model during calibration and validation which suggests that the model is accurate and can be used for further simulation to show the effect of the lateral boundary condition b2 on the seepage rate and the direction of movement of water from the canal into the soil and groundwater in detail the flow lines and potential surfaces under the ocg og s and ncg treatments are shown in figs 7 10 respectively it can be found that for the four treatments the regions of water movement are mainly within 10 m near the centre of the canal the results simulated by the proposed model are not influenced by the lateral boundary condition because the ratio of the horizontal research area 50 m to the maximum canal water surface width 1 56 m in the present study is 32 which is more than factor of 15 required according to hosseinzadeh asl et al 2020 3 1 soil parameters the calibrated soil parameters are shown in table 1 the k s of the sand layer increases from 4 25 10 6 to 5 31 10 6 m s there are no changes in the other parameters which shows that the soil parameters are reasonable 3 2 the k sg and p g of the geomembrane lining the equivalent k s of geomembrane lining k sge which accounts for holes and the permeability of the geomembrane material calibrated from the ncg and og treatments are shown in table 2 the initial k sg after construction and the k sge with a three year service time are 1 0 10 10 m s and 1 0 10 8 m s respectively in the calibration and validation of the og treatment when p g is 10 0 the r2 rmse rmae and me values are 0 996 0 005 m3 m 5 534 and 0 m3 m and 0 99 3 256 10 6 m3 m s 4 933 and 0 487 10 6 m3 m s respectively this shows that the proposed method simulates canal seepage well by using the equivalent hole to represent the flow through the surface between the soil and geomembrane the calibrated initial k sg is 1 0 10 10 m s which is close to the 1 37 10 10 m s reported by jiang et al 2010 but smaller than the approximately 1 0 10 13 m s generally considered andersen and nelson 1997 giroud and bonaparte 1989b this is because of the difference in the test conditions and defects of the installations under laboratory conditions the area of the sample is usually in the range of 0 003 m2 0 03 m2 andersen and nelson 1997 giroud and bonaparte 1989b and the samples are taken before construction under these field conditions the usable area of the geomembrane in the ponding test canal is 56 62 m2 which is larger than that in the laboratory and includes defects caused by punctures tears excessive stresses etc giroud and bonaparte 1989a after the lining was constructed holes caused by animal and weed root growth provided channels for water through the geomembrane comer et al 1996 uchdadiya and patel 2014 and this damage was amplified by the lateral flow along the contact surface of the soil and geomembrane this lateral flow is considered to have an important effect on the total flow through the geomembrane giroud and bonaparte 1989a touze foltz 2001 and is influenced by the pressure on the geomembrane walton et al 1997 weber and zornberg 2005 the contact condition of the soil and geomembrane and the wrinkling of the geomembrane el zein and rowe 2008 rowe 1998 the experimental results show that the seepage through holes under low pressure on geomembrane less than 10 kpa is approximately 2 5 times that under high pressure walton et al 1997 due to the geomembrane wrinkles caused by the construction of the canal geomembrane lining freezing thawing process and weed root growth as shown in fig 4 the geomembrane and underlying soil contact condition is worse which increases the transmissive layer thickness and wrinkle width as presented by rowe 2005 and saidi et al 2008 this leads to an obvious increase in the seepage based on the equivalent hole size being a multiple of the real hole size therefore the size of the equivalent hole is 10 times that of the original hole and the k sge is increased by 100 fold due to defects after 3 years this confirms that the seepage control efficacy is greatly affected by the holes in the geomembrane rowe et al 2003 3 3 the k sc and crack width of the concrete lining the equivalent k s of concrete lining k sce which accounts for cracks and the permeability of concrete material calibrated from the ncg and ocg treatments are 1 0 10 7 and 1 6 10 5 m s respectively the crack widths calibrated from ncg and ocg are 0 025 mm and 2 mm respectively the calibrated k sce is reasonable compared with the k sce in the range of 6 95 10 7 1 97 10 6 m s shi et al 2006 and at 1 63 10 6 m s yao et al 2012 which is calibrated by hydrus 2d based on the ponding test because the k s of mortar is smaller than the k sc li et al 2016b the k sce values of both ncg and ocg are larger than the tested k sc of 1 08 10 7 m s after 3 years the crack width increases by approximately 80 fold which causes the k sce to increase by approximately 160 fold 4 sensitivity analysis of the model parameters to study the impact of the lining characteristics and k s of layered soil and the main factors on canal seepage sensitivity analysis was conducted the one factor at a time oat method melching and yoon 1996 was used for the sensitivity analyses a normalized sensitive index rs was computed using the following equation zheng and bennett 2002 24 rs δ y y δ x x where δy y and δx x are the relative changes in the objective and parameter respectively y is the initial value of the objective value δy is the change in the objective x is the initial value of the parameter and δx is the change in the parameter ci was used as the objective factor in the sensitivity analysis of five treatments including the aforementioned 4 lining treatments and a hypothetical treatment nc based on ncg in which the canal is lined only with newly built precast concrete slabs the parameters include the hole density p g k sg crack width k sc and k s of each soil layer the ranges of the parameter values are set as 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 5 and 10 times the original values which are the parameters calibrated as shown in table 1 and table 2 4 1 the sensitivities of the parameters in each lining treatment the relative changes in the ci values with the variation in the parameters of the five treatments are shown in fig 11 a e for the canal without a lining i e s fig 11 a the k s of soil layer 2 has the greatest impact followed by those of soil layer 1 and layer 0 a sand layer see table 1 because the three layers are relatively close to the canal bottom and because the k s of soil layer 2 is smaller than those of the other layers and dominates the infiltration for a canal lined with newly built concrete and a geomembrane lining i e ncg fig 11 b as the parameter values decrease the most influential parameter is k sg followed by the crack width because the k sg and k sc values are 2 4 orders of magnitude lower than the k s values of the soil layers the geomembrane and crack domains infiltrate through the geomembrane lining and concrete lining therefore the ci decreases greatly with decreasing crack width and k sg as the values of the parameters increase the ci greatly increases with k sg and k sc but minimally increases with the crack width because the seepage through cracks reaches a maximum the initial k sc is so small that a decrease in this parameter has little influence but an increase in this parameter produces a large increase in the ci for a canal lined with a damaged geomembrane lining i e og fig 11 c the ci is most sensitive to the hole density followed by p g and k sg and is less sensitive to the k s of the soil layers this is because increases in the hole density and p g cause increases in the equivalent area of the holes dominating the seepage through the geomembrane lining the ci is more sensitive to the hole density than p g because an increase in the hole density not only increases the total equivalent area but also makes the distribution of holes more even which increases the lateral flow seepage in the soil after the water passes through the holes for a canal lined with damaged concrete and a geomembrane lining i e ocg fig 11 d when the values of the parameters decrease the ci is most sensitive to the k s of the sand followed by the k sg hole density p g and crack width when the values of all the parameters increase the ci is most sensitive to the hole density followed by the p g crack width and k sg in the combined lining water mainly infiltrates through the cracks and then into the sand through the holes in the geomembrane and finally into the soil therefore a decrease in the k s of the sand causes an obvious decrease in the ci however because the original k s of the sand layer is relatively large the ci is less sensitive to this parameter than to the lining parameters as the parameters increase for a canal lined with a newly built concrete lining i e nc fig 11 e when the values of the parameters decrease the ci is most sensitive to the crack width followed by the k s of the sand and is not sensitive to k sc this is because the original k sc is very small and the cracks are the main channel through which water passes through in the concrete lining thus the ci is not sensitive to a decrease in k sc in contrast as k sc increases the seepage through the concrete lining increases correspondingly hence as the parameters increase ci is more sensitive to k sc than to the sand layer the above analysis shows that the ci is not sensitive to the k s values of the soil layers that are farther from the bottom of the canal such as soil layer 4 and soil layer 5 as shown in table 1 although they are highly permeable which is also confirmed by the normalized sensitivity parameter rs in fig 12 the soil layers that are adjacent to the canal bottom are more sensitive which is consistent with the literature yao et al 2012 salmasi and abraham 2020 also showed the hydraulic conductivity of the underlying soil of a canal has great influence on canal seepage by comparing experimental results measured by input output flow method and estimated by numerical simulation and empirical formulas e g davis wilson moleswerth moritz compared with the relation of ci to the k s of the soil layers the ci is more sensitive to the parameters related to the canal lining such as the crack width hole density k sg k sc and p g which is confirmed by the fact that seepage can be reduced greatly by newly built concrete or geomembrane lining jadhav et al 2014 snell 2001 zhang et al 2017 however this is different from the results in the literature rastogi and prasad 1992 yao et al 2012 because k s of the liner in the literature rastogi and prasad 1992 was not obtained from laboratory tests which was assumed to be 1 10 of the topsoil k s thus the variation in k s of the liner was in a large value range which did not include the real k s of the liner so that the performance was only similar to a soil layer with a smaller k s such as soil layer 2 in the present study in the study conducted by yao et al 2012 the k s of the lining layer is an equivalent value of lining and lining damage which is close to the k s of the soil layers thus the variation in the lining characteristics is not accurately reflected by the variation in k s of the lining layer 4 2 the lining influence on the parameter sensitivity the cis of the s ncg og ocg and nc treatments under the same conditions are 0 488 0 044 0 223 0 21 and 0 198 m3 m respectively which shows that the ncg lining treatment has the best seepage control lining efficacy followed by those of nc ocg and og fig 12 shows that the sensitivity of the lining parameters varies greatly with the parameter values and lining conditions and that the parameters are influenced by each other in fig 12 a parameter with a larger rs means that the canal seepage is more sensitive to that parameter the parameters that do not dominate the infiltration are more influential in a lined canal with worse seepage control efficacy as shown in fig 12 a e the rs values of the k s of the soil layers of the s and og treatments are obviously larger than those of the ncg nc and ocg treatments because the infiltration is dominated by the lining this can also be found in fig 12 g i the rs values of the k sg hole density and p g of the ocg treatment are obviously smaller than those of the og treatment because the infiltration of the ocg treatment is dominated by the k sc crack width and k s of sand however for a parameter that dominates the infiltration in a lining treatment the rs value is larger than those in other treatments whether the treatment has a better or worse lining condition for example the rs of the k sg of the ncg treatment is greater than those of the ocg and og treatments although ncg has the best seepage control efficacy because there are no holes in the geomembrane and all seepage passes through the geomembrane in the ncg treatment see fig 12 g fig 12 a also shows that the rs value of soil layer 1 in the og treatment is greater than that in the s treatment as shown in fig 12 f the rs values of the sand layer in the nc and ocg treatments are greater than those in the s og and ocg treatments for the p g hole density and crack width of the nc and ncg treatments shown in fig 12 g h and k respectively the rs values first increase and then gradually decrease this shows that lining damage has a strong influence on canal seepage however as the hole area or crack width increases there are interactions between the seepage through the cracks in the sand and through the holes in the soil and the rs gradually decreases because the seepage loss is gradually dominated by other factors because the geomembrane of ncg also reduces the seepage the crack width and k sc of ncg are less influential than those of nc for the k sc and crack width shown in fig 12 j and k respectively the rs values of the ocg treatment are smallest because the crack widths of ocg are larger than those of ncg and nc providing ocg with sufficient seepage channels through the concrete lining in comparison with those of ncg and nc therefore variation in the k sc or crack width minimally affects the ci of ocg but causes greater changes in those of ncg and nc the rs values of the k sc of ncg and nc increase with k sc because the crack width is only 0 0025 mm which is so small that the ci is greatly influenced by k sc especially when k sc is larger from the above analysis the main factors affecting canal seepage are as follows for lined canals without cracks or holes or with little damage k sg or k sc is the most influential parameter after the lining is damaged as the crack width or hole density increases the influence of the crack width or hole density increases first and then decreases gradually while the influence of k sg or k sc gradually decreases when the canal lining is nearly ineffective the most influential parameters are the k s of the soil layers that are in or adjacent to the canal bottom or layers with lower k s for example the k s of sand soil layer 1 and soil layer 2 given that k sg is generally in the range of 1 0 10 13 m s 1 0 10 10 m s andersen and nelson 1997 giroud and bonaparte 1989b jiang et al 2010 and k sc is generally in the range of 1 0 10 13 m s 1 0 10 10 m s the crack width and hole density and p g are the most important factors influencing canal seepage 5 discussion the proposed model which includes the water flow in the soil concrete lining and geomembrane lining with explicit representation of cracks and holes provides a flexible and quantitative research tool to simulate the canal seepage from a lined canal under different lining damage conditions compared with the equivalent method because the quantitative relationship between the equivalent k s of lining and the damage characteristics is not explicit the proposed model could be used to improve the accuracy of estimation of the seepage loss from a canal lined only by concrete lined only by geomembrane or lined by both concrete and geomembrane under different lining conditions furthermore based on the change in the lining parameters e g k sc k sg crack width and hole density with the service time of the lining the variation in seepage loss from a lined canal with time could also be obtained by the proposed model this is of great importance for assessing the agricultural water use efficiency cost and benefit performance of linings and for proper irrigation management hameed et al 1996 tabari et al 2014 xu et al 2010 for a specific canal the parameters of lining are important for the proposed model in realistic applications the parameters of concrete lining include k sc crack length crack width crack depth crack location and orientation for geomembrane lining the parameters include k sg hole size hole location and p g all parameters mentioned except p g could be obtained by direct measurement because many parameters are required it is important to reduce the preparation work on the parameters to improve the practicability of the model the results of the sensitivity analysis in the present study provide a reference in which the sensitive parameters under a specific lining condition should be paid more attention with less attention paid to the common parameters with little influence for the cracks if for a canal lined by newly built concrete lining such as nc treatment in the present study the crack width has great influence on ci then all cracks must be measured however only the cracks with widths in the sensitive range are suggested to be measured carefully for a canal with a similar damage condition to ocg treatment a reference crack width and k sc may be sufficient since ci is not sensitive to crack width and k sc while precise measurements are required on the hole size hole location p g k sg and k s of soil underlying the lining more attention should be paid to the parameter p g which is difficult to obtain directly because it is influenced by many factors such as wrinkles in the geomembrane el zein and rowe 2008 rowe 1998 pressure on the geomembrane walton et al 1997 weber and zornberg 2005 and clods or irregularities in the underlying soil surface giroud and bonaparte 1989a p g is very important in the estimation of canal seepage from a canal lined by geomembrane with holes although a reference p g when geomembrane and underlying soil are in poor contact is provided in the present study it may be site specific and more precise experimental studies are required to provide more accurate p g under different conditions as model inputs for describing the water seepage through geomembrane lining due to the lack of a reference p g value under different conditions a p g value calibrated from the result of a ponding test on a canal with similar conditions is a practical compromise the proposed model requires many parameters concerning to the lining characteristics and a large amount of repetitive iterations are needed since the model is based on the 3d richard s equation so it is challenging for the model to capture large scale canal seepage consequently the simplification of the model is significant and necessary to make the model more suitable in practical applications the estimation of seepage from a lined canal would be more convenient and accurate if the whole lining both concrete and geomembrane could be represented as a single layer of porous medium with equivalent parameters including the equivalent k s in numerical simulation or an equivalent coefficient used to describe the lining permeability in empirical formulas akkuzu 2012 zhang et al 2017 the equivalent k s could be used in the equivalent method numerical model such as hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 2008 seep w krahn 2004 or comsol multiphysics comsol 2015 to simplify the seepage process as a two dimensional problem such a step is based on the proposed model to study the relationship between the equivalent k s and the lining characteristics involving the material parameters e g permeability coefficient thickness etc and damage characteristics crack width crack location crack density hole size hole location etc also the proposed model can be used to establish the relationship between the equivalent coefficient of the lining in empirical formulas e g the c in davis wilson formula and β in kostiakov formula akkuzu 2012 guo 1997 zhang et al 2017 and the actual lining conditions moreover the equivalent k s or equivalent coefficient varying with time can be obtained through the degradation of the lining materials and development of damage characteristics with lining service time by the proposed model which can significantly improve the accuracy for estimation of seepage loss in practical 6 conclusions in this paper a numerical approach is proposed to simulate the effects of different kinds of concrete and geomembrane damage on canal seepage at a typical length 1 2 m according to richard s equation in porous media the cubic law in cracks and the transformation of seepage through geomembrane simulation the 3d fem is utilized to solve the nonlinear governing equations of mass transport similarly ponding tests on a canal with four different lining treatments and additional experiments are conducted to quantify the effect of lining damage on canal seepage and provide the material parameters and validation data for the numerical model based on the experimental results and further sensitivity analysis with the validated model the following conclusions are drawn 1 the results of the proposed model agree well with the experimental results showing that the model provides an accurate approach for simulating the water flow from canals with concrete and geomembrane linings and can accommodate different kinds of crack and hole scenarios 2 the experimental and simulated results show that canal linings of concrete and geomembranes with little damage exhibit good seepage control efficacy however as the hole density or crack width increases the seepage loss gradually increases and becomes dependent on the hole density or crack width and k sc and k sg play a negotiable role in seepage control the water lost through the crack and holes are the main part of seepage through the concrete and geomembrane lining 3 for seepage from the lined canal the lining parameters such as the crack width hole density k sg and k sc are more influential than the k s of the soil layers especially for newly built linings with better seepage control efficacy 4 the seepage loss is sensitive to the k s of the soil layers that are closer to the canal bottom and is not sensitive to the k s of the soil layers that are farther from the canal bottom the sensitivity of the soil layer k s to seepage loss decreases with increasing value and increases when the seepage control efficacy of the lining decreases it should be noted that estimated parameters for the crack width and p g were used in the present study in the future more precise experimental measurements should be used as model inputs for describing the water seepage through concrete and geomembrane

anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive comments appendix a a 1 coupled modelling of the flow in porous media and cracks the water flow in porous media and cracks is coupled with the water exchange between the cracks and concrete sc up and sc down see fig 3 b which is the source sink term in both governing equations the discretized equation of eq 3 can be expressed as follows in matrix form chen et al 2013 simunek et al 1995 a 1 c j 1 h j 1 h j δ t j k j 1 h j 1 q j d j 1 where a 2 c e ω n t c n d ω a 3 k e ω k n t n d ω a 4 q e γ 1 n t q f n d γ 1 a 5 d e ω n t s n d ω where ω is the domain of porous media n is the shape function q f is the outflow flux of the porous media boundary and crack boundary lt 1 γ 1 is the boundary of ω j 1 denotes the current time level at which the solution is being considered j refers the previous time level and δt j t j 1 t j eq a 1 can be converted to a 6 a j 1 h j 1 q j d j 1 e j where a j 1 k j 1 c j 1 δt j e j c j 1 h j δt j similarly the discretized governing equation of crack flow eq 6 can be expressed as a 7 a c j 1 h c j 1 q c j d c j 1 e c j because the water flow in the crack is simulated as two dimensions the exchange flux dc j 1 for node i is calculated as follows a 8 d c i j 1 e a e 3 s c i j 1 where a e is the area of element e l2 and sci is the source sink flux of node i in the crack plane lt 1 according to eqs 8 10 sci is calculated as follows a 9 s c i j 1 k fi h ci j 1 h di j 1 0 5 d f k f i h ci j 1 h ui j 1 0 5 d f where k fi is the permeability coefficient lt 1 of crack node i and h ci h di and h ui are the water heads l of crack node i and the attached nodes in the bottom and upper boundaries of the porous media respectively a 10 h ci j 1 h ci j 1 z ci a 11 h di j 1 h di j 1 z di a 12 h ui j 1 h ui j 1 z ui where h ci h di h ui and z ci z di z ui are the pressure head and z coordinates of crack node i and the attached node in the bottom and upper boundary of porous media l by substituting eqs a 10 a 12 into eq a 9 we have a 13 d c i j 1 e 4 a e k fi 3 d f h ci j 1 e 2 a e k fi 3 d f h di j 1 h ui j 1 z ci z di z ci z ui because the node of the crack is in the middle plane of the upper and lower boundaries of the crack and the crack width is far smaller than the size of the concrete slabs the pressure head values of the two sides hdi and hui are identical see fig 3 b eq a 13 is simplified as eq a 14 a 14 d c i j 1 e 4 a e k fl 3 d f h ci j 1 e 4 a e k f i 3 d f h i j 1 for the source sink term d j 1 of porous media in eq a 1 because there is exchange only between the porous media and crack the d j 1 is zero for other nodes the exchange occurs only in the crack plane which is equal to the water from porous media into the crack for node i in the crack plane of porous media d j 1 i is calculated as follow a 15 d i j 1 e 4 a e k f i 3 d f h i j 1 e 4 a e k f i 3 d f h ci j 1 therefore the water flow in the porous media and cracks can be coupled in matrix form by adjusting the coefficient in the matrix and forming a global stiffness matrix of the porous media and crack flow the matrices of eq a 6 and eq a 7 can be modified according to eq a 14 and a 15 to be integrated into one matrix an illustrative example is given to show the key idea of the coupling procedure we assume that porous media are discretized by n nodes and the crack plane is discretized by l nodes which are nodes m 1 to m l and nodes n 1 n l are added as the nodes of the crack the global matrix for this assumption is shown as follows a 16 a 1 1 a 1 m a 1 m 1 a 1 m i a 1 m l a 1 n a m

the capital letters am i m i am i n i dm i am i n i an i n i dn i i 1 2 l represent the items that should be modified according to eq a 14 and eq a 15 according to eq a 14 and eq a 15 am i m i am i n

a 21 a n i m i e 4 a e k fl 3 d f a 22 d n i 0 eq a 16 is then simplified as eq a 23 because d is a zero vector after modification by eqs a 17 a 22 a 23 a j 1 h j 1 q j e j a 2 transformation of the global matrix by the geomembrane boundary based on the coupled flow in porous media and cracks canal seepage can be simulated by solving eq a 23 when the geomembrane is not used in the canal lining when the canal is lined with a geomembrane the domain region is divided into two subdomain regions the geomembrane is simulated as two flux boundaries by the zero thickness interface element see fig 3 c the water heads in the up and down surfaces of the geomembrane are used to calculate the global stiffness matrix eq a 23 is transferred to eq a 24 because the flux of the node in the geomembrane surface is calculated by the water head at time level j 1 a 24 a j 1 h j 1 q j 1 e j an illustrative example is given to show the key idea of the geomembrane boundary treatment it is assumed that the domain area is meshed by total n nodes without geomembrane and p nodes from node m 1 to m p are selected as the geomembrane boundary m 1 is the node that starts as the geomembrane boundary nodes m 1 to m p are assumed in the upper boundary of the geomembrane nodes n 1 to n p are added as corresponding nodes of nodes m 1 to m p in the bottom boundary of the geomembrane for node m i in the geomembrane upper surface qm i is calculated as follows a 25 q m i e σ m i l m i where σ m i is the flux lt 1 across the boundary in the vicinity of boundary node m i positive when directed outward of the system and lm i is the area of the boundary segment connected to node m i l2 according to eq 12 σ m i is calculated as follows a 26 σ m i k g h z m i h z n i d g where node n i is the corresponding node of m i in the down surface of the geomembrane by substituting eq a 26 into eq a 25 q m i is calculated as follows a 27 q m i e k g l m i d g h n i e k g l m i d g h m i e k g l m i d g z n i z m i similarly qn i is calculated as follows a 28 q n i e k g l n i d g h m i e k g l n i d g h n i e k g l n i d g z m i z n i where ln i is the area of the boundary segment connected to

4591,concrete and geomembranes are common materials used in canal linings to decrease canal seepage current numerical studies focus on concrete linings only by equivalent continuous models and seldom are about geomembrane and are suitable to quantify the seepage loss from canals with damaged linings in this study a new model is developed for the coupled numerical simulation of seepage through concrete with cracks and a geomembrane with holes in canal lining damage based on the finite element method in this model the porous media is discretized into solid elements whereas discrete cracks and geomembranes are modelled by zero thickness elements with the richards equation and cubic law applied to describe the water seepage process the porous media and crack zones are implicitly coupled in time and space through the exchange flow between the concrete and the crack zones in that the heads are integrated in a single matrix equation the domain area is divided into two subdomain areas by the geomembrane for the two subdomain areas the surfaces of both sides in the geomembrane are treated as two flux boundaries the proposed model is calibrated and validated by the results of ponding tests conducted on a canal with four lining treatments and additional experiments which showed that the model fit the experiments very well the model is applied to sensitivity analyses by varying the model parameters the model is shown to be capable of simulating the seepage of canals lined by concrete and geomembrane lining with different cracks and holes the sensitivity analysis shows that canal seepage mainly depends on the lining characteristics such as the crack width hole density saturated hydraulic conductivity k s of the geomembrane k s of the concrete and k s of the soil layers adjacent to the canal bottom keywords canal seepage canal lining numerical simulation damaged lining combined lining fully coupled model 1 introduction water loss from canals is the main source of water loss during water conveyance in irrigation areas and accounts for more than 15 50 of the total irrigation water in some regions van der leeden et al 1990 wang et al 2002 canal seepage not only wastes water but also maintains groundwater and soil water at high levels around the canal upadhyaya and chauhan 2001 and can lead to soil salinization and waterlogging singh 2017 because of the increasing irrigation demands and climate change it is a widespread and urgent challenge to maintain the sustainable use of water resources especially in arid and semiarid regions fasakhodi et al 2010 mariolakos 2007 thus the use of canal linings is an important approach for decreasing seepage loss concrete and geomembranes are two popular materials used in canal linings due to their simple construction and good seepage control performance soomro et al 2018 as an increasing number of canals are lined the accurate estimation of the seepage from lined canals is the basis for assessing agricultural water use efficiency cost and benefit performance of linings and for ensuring proper irrigation management hameed et al 1996 tabari et al 2014 xu et al 2010 canal seepage is greatly reduced by newly built canal linings jadhav et al 2014 snell 2001 zhang et al 2017 however significant seepage loss starts to occur from lined canals after the deterioration of the linings especially with poor maintenance of the lining barkhordari et al 2020 ghazaw 2011 kilic and tuylu 2011 many studies have shown that the permeability coefficient increases dramatically after the emergence of concrete cracks aldea et al 1999 wang et al 1997 yi et al 2011 and the liner loses functionality to some extent as the cracks expand merkley 2007 swamee and chahar 2015 the factors affecting canal seepage include the soil hydraulic properties canal bottom depth to the groundwater table lining material type damage conditions and lining service time for concrete and geomembrane combined linings seepage loss normally occurs in the cracks of the concrete or through holes in the geomembrane and only a negligible amount of water is lost through the concrete and geomembrane giroud et al 1992 reginato and myers 1966 therefore the focus of estimating the seepage losses from concrete and geomembrane lined canals is the identification of the seepage through cracks and holes this is the basis for explaining the mechanism of seepage loss through canal linings and studying the influence of different types of lining damage on canal seepage the seepage from a canal is obtained by direct measurements empirical equations theoretical analysis and numerical simulation the direct methods include the inflow outflow method ponding test method and seepage meter method akkuzu 2012 alam and bhutta 2004 brockway and worstell 1968 the effect of the lining and its damage on canal seepage can be obtained directly with these methods the inflow outflow test and ponding test are two common methods to measure canals directly the inflow outflow test is easy to conduct but is limited by the measurements as a result this test is widely used but more precise instruments are needed to obtain more accurate results kinzli et al 2010 the ponding test is difficult to conduct compared with the inflow outflow method but is more accurate and dependable alam and bhutta 2004 kraatz 1977 empirical formulas are often used to estimate canal seepage losses which include the davis wilson model moritz model ingham model molesworth model kostiakov model etc guo 1997 kraatz 1977 among these formulas the lining efficacy is reflected only in the davis wilson model and kostiakov model by a lining coefficient multiplying the earthen canal seepage rate empirical formulas are a simple and convenient way to estimate canal seepage but do not consider the lining effect variation with time or different types of lining damage because the coefficient is treated as a constant value with a wide range for the same type of canal lining material consequently the seepage loss from a lined canal cannot be estimated accurately by empirical formulas for example akkuzu 2012 compared the seepage loss calculated by the moritz and davis wilson equations with inflow outflow methods in a concrete lined canal which showed that the empirical equations are not sufficiently accurate for estimating seepage losses from lined canals theoretical analyses based on the steady state flow or unsteady state flow equation in groundwater and an underlying medium assume that only one or two homogeneous isotropic porous media are involved and based on these equations the quantity of seepage from canals has been given by some researchers bouwer 1969 1965 choudhary and chahar 2007 herrmann and bucksch 2014 swamee et al 2000 theoretical analyses explain an explicit mechanism and obtain a relatively accurate result but they are seldom used in the estimation of canal seepage from lined canals with different canal sections and groundwater levels because of the spatial variability in the soil characteristics and idealized conditions simplified for analytical tractability rastogi and prasad 1992 yao et al 2012 numerical simulation can accurately show the spatial and temporal seepage development under various boundary conditions mirnateghi and bruch 1983 showed that the finite difference method fdm was easy and efficient to modify for various conditions compared with the analytical method from a partly lined canal reported by subramanya et al 1975 rastogi and prasad 1992 assumed that the k s value of the lining layer was 1 10 of the soil at the bottom of the canal bed and used the finite element method fem to study the canal seepage loss in a canal phreatic aquifer system yao et al 2012 showed that hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 2008 reliably simulated the canal seepage and soil response under layered soil structures and four different linings by considering the lining material as a whole porous medium numerical simulation which takes multilayer soils and canal lining characteristics into consideration is the most accurate among the above methods however few numerical simulations concern canal seepage through geomembrane linings the method used in most studies to simulate seepage through concrete linings is the equivalent continuum model khoei et al 2015 the k s value used in the equivalent continuum model is an equivalent value for the lining and its damage this simplification provides a relatively accurate simulation result especially for canals with high integrity linings or those close to failure however because the relationship between the equivalent k s value of the lining and the lining damage is not explicit the equivalent continuum model is not suitable for quantifying the effects of the cracks and holes in a combined lining of a concrete lining with cracks and a geomembrane lining with holes on the canal seepage the discrete crack method is more suitable for detecting the seepage flow in cracked concrete lining because cracks are explicitly simulated and the representative element volume rev of the equivalent continuum model may not exist or is larger than the scale of the flow region of interest jiang et al 2014 some studies have shown that discrete crack method can feasibly simulate saturated and unsaturated flows in concrete lining cracks li et al 2016a 2018 long et al 1982 miao et al 2015 yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 for example long et al 1982 studied equivalent homogeneous anisotropic porous media by numerical simulation of the flow in discrete crack networks and the results showed that the fracture system behaved more like porous media in four cases in a study conducted by yan et al 2018 the flows in rock and cracks are modelled by darcy s law and the cubic law respectively and the results of the numerical solutions agree well with the analytical solutions which correctly calculated unsteady state seepage li et al 2018 proposed a model to simulate the capillary water absorption of concrete with a discrete crack network in which the concrete and cracks are modelled by solid elements and zero thickness crack elements respectively these studies show that the discrete crack method is an accurate and dependable approach to simulate canal seepage when the concrete lining is cracked due to the small thickness and small value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of geomembrane material k sg there are large numbers of calculations to implement and the many singular elements pose a difficulty for the mesh pretreatment which directly affects the calculation accuracy lu et al 1994 nayroles et al 1992 neuman 1973 zhang et al 2001 foose et al 2001 used modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 to simulate seepage through a composite lining with soil and a geomembrane with a hole in which the geomembrane and the lateral flow through the soil and geomembrane are modelled by a no flow boundary and a thin layer with a thickness up to 0 03 mm respectively based on the discontinuous fem zhan et al 2009 presented a membrane element method to simulate the fluid flow through a membrane that can be easily coupled with the normal galerkin fem el zein et al 2012 developed a three dimensional 3d model with the fem and simulated the flow and containment through a geomembrane composite lining with defects however there are few studies about the flow passing through geomembranes with many holes and the lack of coupling of the flow in cracks and porous media and geomembranes the main goal of this paper is to establish a 3d model coupling continuous porous media discrete cracks and thin geomembranes that can be used to simulate the seepage process through concrete with cracks and geomembranes with holes and cracks zero thickness elements are used to model the crack structure and geomembrane because they reduce the number of degrees of freedom without generating new solid elements and consequently reduce the computational burden based on the results of ponding tests and additional experiments the 3d numerical model was calibrated and validated and then applied to sensitivity analysis of canal seepage under different canal lining damage scenarios these efforts aimed to quantify the cracks and holes influencing canal seepage and to identify the main factors influencing canal seepage 2 material and methods 2 1 study area field experiments were carried out at the yonglian experimental station n41 4 6 18 e108 0 15 50 and altitude 1027 17 m above sea level in the hetao irrigation district hid which is located in inner mongolia china the site is in a typical arid continental climate zone with a mean annual temperature of 6 c xu et al 2012 the mean annual precipitation is 130 mm to 215 mm and the average annual evaporation from the water surface is 2100 mm to 2300 mm zhu et al 2013 the groundwater table is 1 0 4 0 m below the ground surface during a year zhang et al 2018 there is an approximately five month freezing thawing period from middle november to late april of the next year which results in extensive frost heaving damage to the concrete lining zhou et al 2014 2 2 experimental design and measurements 2 2 1 ponding test a canal 30 m long in the yonglian experiment station was selected for the ponding test following the chinese standard technical mwrc 2010 the canal was lined with a concrete and geomembrane combined lining in september 2015 the precast concrete slabs were 0 6 m in length 0 4 m in width and 0 06 m in thickness the joints between the precast concrete slabs were filled with cement mortar where cracks occurred there was an approximately 0 03 m thick sand layer between the concrete and geomembrane the whole test was divided into four treatments according to the canal lining status treatment 1 t1 was applied to the initial conditions of the canal denoted ocg treatment 2 denoted og was based on treatment 1 and involved the removal of the concrete slabs meaning the canal was lined only with a geomembrane with a 3 year service time then the geomembrane was also removed in treatment 3 denoted s after the ponding test of the t3 treatment the canal was repaired and lined with a combination of new precast concrete slabs and a new geomembrane which was the fourth treatment t4 denoted ncg experiments were performed over the period of 22 september 18 october 2018 each ponding test comprised a constant level stage through the addition of water and a variable water level stage no water added the water level was recorded automatically every 5 min by a water level gauge which was used to monitor and control the water level in the first stage and to calculate the canal seepage rate in the second stage more detailed information about the ponding tests can be found in the literature han et al 2020 2 2 2 canal bed soil characteristics measurements the soil profile in fig 1 was excavated to depths of 1 5 m three soil samples were taken at 0 15 m intervals in each pit the soil samples were originally taken by means of cutting rings and weighed to determine the initial water content next the soil samples were saturated in distilled water for 48 h and k s was measured with a constant head permeameter fu et al 2019 after the k s of the soil samples was determined the samples were dehydrated in a centrifuge h 1400pf at 10 rotational speeds to establish the relationship between the soil matrix potential and water content shang et al 2009 the 10 rotational speeds were set at 0 1000 1700 2200 3100 3800 4400 4900 7000 8500 r min and the time for each rotation was predetermined to be 90 min after the soil water content and matrix potential were measured retc software van genuchten et al 1991 was used to obtain the parameters m n α θr in the vg model van genuchten 1980 as shown in eq 1 at the end of the final measurement the dry bulk density was determined by oven drying lai and ren 2007 and the particle size distributions were determined with the hydrometer method the experimental results for the soil characteristics are shown in table 1 the soil profile was divided into 5 layers according to the soil texture and measured k s 1 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 ah n m h 0 θ s h 0 where θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 θr and θs are the residual and saturated water contents respectively α is the inverse of the air entry value or bubbling pressure l 1 n is a pore size distribution index m 1 1 n and h is the water matric potential l 2 2 3 concrete permeability test the ks of concrete material k sc was measured based on darcy s law li et al 2016b a modified apparatus for measuring the water permeability of concrete was used to add a hydraulic gradient to obtain the flow rate through the concrete samples k sc was calculated by eq 2 2 k sc q l a δ h where q is the stable flow rate though the concrete sample l3t 1 l is the height of the concrete sample l a is the cross sectional area perpendicular to the flow direction l2 and δh is the hydraulic potential difference l three samples were randomly taken from both the bottom and side of the ponding test canal by the core drilling method issaadi et al 2017 the size of each sample is a cylinder with a 10 cm diameter and 6 cm height the measured k sc has a wide range from 2 74 10 11 to 6 17 10 8 m s with an average of 1 08 10 8 m s according to the literature li et al 2017 the water retention curve of concrete is described by the vg model van genuchten 1980 in the present study the parameters a n θ r and θs of concrete were determined according to the literature yao et al 2012 and were assumed to be equivalent to a soil layer with similar permeability 2 2 4 lining damage and parameters a damage survey was conducted before the ponding test approximately 55 67 of the joints were obviously cracked and other joints where the original mortar still existed were slightly damaged mainly because of frost heaving damage due to the half year seasonal freezing thawing period in the region yu et al 2010 there were 125 holes which were mainly caused by weed root growth and lining construction observed in the geomembrane at the canal sides and 10 holes at the canal bottom the current number of holes and hole area located at heights 0 3 m from the canal bottom in the canal sides per metre of length are 0 33 and 8 33 mm2 and these parameters are 2 6 and 794 5 mm2 in the canal bottom respectively the corresponding hole density i e the total hole area divided by the geomembrane area is 4 2 10 4 which was used in the sensitivity analysis fig 2 shows the hole number and hole width per unit length of the canal at different heights from the canal bottom 2 3 model description 2 3 1 governing equation in a canal lined with a concrete and geomembrane combined lining the seepage water is driven by a hydraulic gradient penetrating the concrete and its cracks geomembrane and its holes and then infiltrating the soil to supply the soil water and groundwater see fig 3 a the water flow in concrete and soil follows the theory of porous media water movement and the flow in cracks follows the cubic law the governing equations are described in detail below 1 water flow in soil and concrete based on the assumption of neglecting the gas phase transport the flow moving through the soil and concrete is described by richards equation richards 1931 as follows hall and hall 1989 van belleghem et al 2016 wang and ueda 2011 3 c dh dt x k h h x y k h h y z k h h z 1 s where c is the soil water capacity l 1 t is time t x is the horizontal coordinate perpendicular to the canal l y is the coordinate along the canal l z positive upward is the vertical coordinate l h is the pressure head l the soil water matric potential in the unsaturated zone and k h is the soil hydraulic conductivity as a function of the pressure head lt 1 s is the source sink term which means that the water moves from the soil and concrete to the cracks in the present study t 1 the vg model van genuchten 1980 of the soil water retention curve and the hydraulic conductivity function of mualem 1976 are used to calculate k h and θ from h as shown in eq 1 and eqs 4 5 4 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 5 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 se is the normalized water content and θ is calculated by eq 1 2 water flow in the cracks based on previous research li et al 2018 the cracks are modelled by zero thickness elements the water flow through cracks is described as eq 6 6 d f c f h t t d f k f h t h z s c 7 sc k f h n where d f is the width of the crack l cf is the crack water capacity l 1 t l 1 denotes the gradient operator restricting the crack s tangential plane k f is the permeability coefficient of the crack lt 1 h is the matrix potential or pressure head in the crack l z positive upward is the vertical coordinate l and sc is the flux from the crack to the soil or concrete lt 1 which can be described by darcy s law 8 s c up k f d h up d n up 9 s c down k f d h down d n down where n is the unit normal to the crack plane and the subscripts up and down mean the upper and lower surfaces of the crack plane respectively the water flux changes from one side of a crack to the other the sc in eq 6 is the sum of sc up and sc down the term dh d n means the gradient of the water head between the cracks and matrix material which can be written as 10 dh dn h c h 0 5 d f where h c and h are the water heads of the crack and matrix l respectively as the crack width is far smaller than the size of the concrete slabs the h values of the two sides are identical see fig 3 b the complex flow behaviour in cracks is governed by the navier stokes equations brush and thomson 2003 in this study because the joint surface of cracks is smooth and parallel the navier stokes equations can be simplified to the cubic law at a low reynolds number long et al 1982 witherspoon et al 1980 which is commonly adopted for each crack in discrete fracture networks li et al 2016c zhang et al 2019 1996 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 and is proven to be effective for cracks with widths in the range of 0 001 mm 10 mm lomize 1951 louis 1969 thus k f is calculated as follows 11 k f d f 2 ρ g 12 η τ ξ k r h where ρ is the water density ml 3 1000 kg m3 g is the gravitational acceleration lt 2 9 81 m s2 η is the viscosity of water mt 1l 1 ξ is the toughness of the crack which denotes the morphological parameter accounting for the difference between the real fracture and an ideal parallel fracture and τ is the tortuosity of the crack because the crack is relatively shallow flat and smooth τ and ξ are assumed to be 1 0 and the depth of the crack is assumed to be 0 06 m which is the same as the concrete slab thickness 3 transformation of the water flow through the geomembrane governing equation the flow through the geomembrane in this study is not simulated through the normal galerkin fem by meshing the geomembrane interior the water head of which is used to create the global matrix the domain is divided into two subdomains by the geomembrane for the two subdomain areas the surfaces of both sides in the geomembrane are treated as two flux boundaries which are calculated as follows 12 n u u u k g h d h u d g 13 n d u d k g h u h d d g where n is the external normal to the boundary u is the water flow velocity vector lt 1 k g is the permeability coefficient of the geomembrane lt 1 hu is the water head at the upper boundary of the geomembrane l hd is the water head at the bottom boundary of the geomembrane l and d g is the thickness of the geomembrane l the holes in the geomembrane are treated as the contact surface of the upper and lower soil layers of the geomembrane the water head loss at holes is ignored in most cases there is some space between the geomembrane and soil because of wrinkles in the geomembrane clods or irregularities at the underlying soil surface even though the underlying soil surface is apparently smooth the geomembrane bridges the small spaces between the soil particles giroud and bonaparte 1989a hence water first enters the holes and cracks and then laterally moves some distance in the space which is not considered in eq 12 eq 13 an equivalent hole is used to represent the lateral flow effect by increasing the area of the hole the size of the equivalent hole is defined in eqs 14 17 14 d w s p g d w s 0 15 d l s h 1 m 2 16 d w b p g d w b 0 17 d l b p g d l b 0 where dw s and dl s are the width and length of the equivalent hole in the geomembrane at the canal sides l pg is a parameter that represents the lateral flow effect along the horizontal direction ll 1 h is the canal water depth l m is the side slope of canal ll 1 dw s0 is the width of the original hole in the geomembrane at the canal sides l dw b and dl b are the width and length of the equivalent hole in the geomembrane at the canal bottom l dw b0 and dl b0 are the width and length of the original hole in the geomembrane at the canal bottom l the length of the equivalent hole at the canal sides is different from that at the canal bottom because the geomembrane at the canal sides in the test canal is obviously wrinkled and there are clods or irregularities at the underlying soil surface or even where the underlying soil surface is apparently smooth due to weed root growth and the cycle of frost heaving in soil and most holes in the canal sides are caused by weed growth when the weeds in the canal sides grow their roots penetrate the geomembrane and then grow from the locations of holes to canal bottom and top of the canal dyke along the contact surface of the geomembrane and the adjacent soil under the geomembrane in the canal bank see fig 4 when the weeds die their decayed roots cause empty space between the geomembrane and underlaying soil which strengthens the channel from the canal water surface to the canal bottom for the lateral flow after the water infiltrates the holes kraatz 1977 therefore the dl s is assumed to be equal to the length of canal inside slope under canal water depth in the canal cross section in present paper 2 3 2 numerical implementation the fem was used to solve the coupled 3d governing equations eq 3 eq 6 and eqs 12 13 the galerkin fem with linear basis functions was used to obtain the solution of the flow equation subject to the imposed initial and boundary conditions the numerical solution of this problem is built by using the software comsol multiphysics which is a well known tool that provides full access for solving partial differential equations comsol 2015 the water flow in porous media and crack are coupled with the water exchange between the cracks and concrete which is the source sink term in both governing equations the geomembrane boundary is treated as two flux boundaries for the two subdomain regions divided by the geomembrane the details of the numerical implementation are shown in appendix a transient analysis is selected for modelling the dynamic canal seepage process the nonlinear algebraic equation at each time step is solved by the newton raphson iteration scheme and the direct pardiso solver is used to solve the linear algebraic equation during the newton raphson iterations melnikova et al 2013 the water flow in the porous media was modelled by solid elements such as tetrahedral hexahedral and or triangular prismatic elements the zero thickness interface element is used to model cracks and geomembranes as shown in fig 3 b the mesh size is approximately 1 mm to 100 mm a typical scenario mesh has approximately 340 000 nodes and 660 000 elements for the domain area in the experimental canal fig 1 a for each time step the flux is calculated by darcy s law after the water head of all nodes is solved then the infiltration rate is given by integrating the flux along the constant head boundary area the cumulative infiltration ci for each output time is calculated by integrating the infiltration rate from the initial time to the output time 2 3 3 boundary and initial conditions because the canal is relatively small and the test duration of each treatment is relatively short the area affected by canal seepage is relatively limited the horizontal research area is set as 50 m because the soil layers between the right side and left side perpendicular to the canal are similar this study assumes that the seepage flow is symmetric around the vertical axis through the middle line of the canal and only half of the horizontal domain 25 m is simulated both side boundaries parallel to the canal b1 b2 in fig 1 are set as no flux boundaries the groundwater depth of the study area over the simulation duration is approximately 2 2 2 4 m because the groundwater table depth in the simulation domain changes between 1 0 and 3 0 m and there is little vertical exchange in the groundwater zone yang et al 2011 the vertical exchange of groundwater below 4 m can be neglected hence the bottom boundary of the domain area in the simulation b3 in fig 1 is set 4 m below the ground surface as a no flux boundary the ground surface b4 is taken into account as a no flux boundary because there was no precipitation and the evapotranspiration from the soil was very low compared with the canal seepage rate during the simulation period han et al 2020 the canal surface b5 is taken as a constant water head boundary note that the zones above the water surface are also taken as a no flux boundary when the canal seepage is simulated by the coupled 3d model if the whole length of the canal 30 m is set as the domain area more than 3 77 million nodes and 4 6 million elements respectively are required to discretize the mesh since repetitive iterations are inevitable for solving the 3d unsaturated richards equation which is highly nonlinear maintaining calculation efficiency is a great challenge therefore according to the symmetry of the precast concrete lining arrangement a canal 1 2 m long along the direction of the canal is selected as the domain area because the lengths of the bottom and side of the canal are 0 4 m and 0 6 m respectively and 1 2 m is a typical unit length fig 1 the front and back surfaces b6 and b7 in fig 1 in the y coordinate of the canal are set as zero flux boundaries due to symmetry for the constant water level stage the boundary conditions are 18 h z n 0 x y z b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 b 6 b 7 t m t 0 19 h d h w x y z b 5 t m t 0 where n is the normal direction to the boundary d is the vertical coordinate of the canal surface l hw is the water level in the canal l and tm is the duration of the constant level stage in each treatment t the initial value of the model is input as the water head according to the measured groundwater table depth and soil water content which is transformed by the vg model 3 model calibration and validation the ci with time during the stable water level stage and the seepage rates in the variable water level stage in the four treatments are used for model calibration and validation respectively for these cases the statistical indices of the coefficient of determination r2 the relative mean absolute error rmae the root mean squared error rmse and the mean error me cui et al 2020 are chosen to quantify the difference between the simulated results of the model and observation values these indices are defined as follows 20 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 21 rmae 1 n i 1 n x i y i y i 22 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 23 me 1 n i 1 n x i y i where the subscript i represents the serial number of the results n represents the total number of the results xi is the simulated result and yi is the observed result first the s treatment observations were used to calibrate and validate the k s of each soil layer second the ncg treatment results were used to calibrate and validate the initial crack widths at each joint between the precast concrete slabs and the initial k sg it is assumed that the widths and depths of cracks in different locations are the same third based on the calibrated soil parameters and initial k sg the og treatment observations were used to calibrate and validate parameter p g and the equivalent k sg after geomembrane damage of holes and cracks finally the crack width and equivalent k sc were calibrated and validated with the ocg treatment observations fig 5 shows the simulated and observed ci per metre length of the canal with time during the constant water level stage in the calibration of the s ncg og and ncg treatments fig 6 shows the observed and simulated seepage rates per metre length during the variable water level stage at different canal water depths in the validation of each treatment generally the simulated results of the proposed model agree well with the observed results in both the calibration and validation in the calibration of the proposed model all the r2 values are larger than 0 99 and the rmae rmse and me values are smaller than 4 579 0 007 m3 m and 0 006 m3 m respectively in the validation the r2 values are larger than 0 974 and the rmae rmse and me values are smaller than 6 3 3 498 10 6 m3 m s and 1 934 10 6 m3 m s good agreement is obtained by the proposed model during calibration and validation which suggests that the model is accurate and can be used for further simulation to show the effect of the lateral boundary condition b2 on the seepage rate and the direction of movement of water from the canal into the soil and groundwater in detail the flow lines and potential surfaces under the ocg og s and ncg treatments are shown in figs 7 10 respectively it can be found that for the four treatments the regions of water movement are mainly within 10 m near the centre of the canal the results simulated by the proposed model are not influenced by the lateral boundary condition because the ratio of the horizontal research area 50 m to the maximum canal water surface width 1 56 m in the present study is 32 which is more than factor of 15 required according to hosseinzadeh asl et al 2020 3 1 soil parameters the calibrated soil parameters are shown in table 1 the k s of the sand layer increases from 4 25 10 6 to 5 31 10 6 m s there are no changes in the other parameters which shows that the soil parameters are reasonable 3 2 the k sg and p g of the geomembrane lining the equivalent k s of geomembrane lining k sge which accounts for holes and the permeability of the geomembrane material calibrated from the ncg and og treatments are shown in table 2 the initial k sg after construction and the k sge with a three year service time are 1 0 10 10 m s and 1 0 10 8 m s respectively in the calibration and validation of the og treatment when p g is 10 0 the r2 rmse rmae and me values are 0 996 0 005 m3 m 5 534 and 0 m3 m and 0 99 3 256 10 6 m3 m s 4 933 and 0 487 10 6 m3 m s respectively this shows that the proposed method simulates canal seepage well by using the equivalent hole to represent the flow through the surface between the soil and geomembrane the calibrated initial k sg is 1 0 10 10 m s which is close to the 1 37 10 10 m s reported by jiang et al 2010 but smaller than the approximately 1 0 10 13 m s generally considered andersen and nelson 1997 giroud and bonaparte 1989b this is because of the difference in the test conditions and defects of the installations under laboratory conditions the area of the sample is usually in the range of 0 003 m2 0 03 m2 andersen and nelson 1997 giroud and bonaparte 1989b and the samples are taken before construction under these field conditions the usable area of the geomembrane in the ponding test canal is 56 62 m2 which is larger than that in the laboratory and includes defects caused by punctures tears excessive stresses etc giroud and bonaparte 1989a after the lining was constructed holes caused by animal and weed root growth provided channels for water through the geomembrane comer et al 1996 uchdadiya and patel 2014 and this damage was amplified by the lateral flow along the contact surface of the soil and geomembrane this lateral flow is considered to have an important effect on the total flow through the geomembrane giroud and bonaparte 1989a touze foltz 2001 and is influenced by the pressure on the geomembrane walton et al 1997 weber and zornberg 2005 the contact condition of the soil and geomembrane and the wrinkling of the geomembrane el zein and rowe 2008 rowe 1998 the experimental results show that the seepage through holes under low pressure on geomembrane less than 10 kpa is approximately 2 5 times that under high pressure walton et al 1997 due to the geomembrane wrinkles caused by the construction of the canal geomembrane lining freezing thawing process and weed root growth as shown in fig 4 the geomembrane and underlying soil contact condition is worse which increases the transmissive layer thickness and wrinkle width as presented by rowe 2005 and saidi et al 2008 this leads to an obvious increase in the seepage based on the equivalent hole size being a multiple of the real hole size therefore the size of the equivalent hole is 10 times that of the original hole and the k sge is increased by 100 fold due to defects after 3 years this confirms that the seepage control efficacy is greatly affected by the holes in the geomembrane rowe et al 2003 3 3 the k sc and crack width of the concrete lining the equivalent k s of concrete lining k sce which accounts for cracks and the permeability of concrete material calibrated from the ncg and ocg treatments are 1 0 10 7 and 1 6 10 5 m s respectively the crack widths calibrated from ncg and ocg are 0 025 mm and 2 mm respectively the calibrated k sce is reasonable compared with the k sce in the range of 6 95 10 7 1 97 10 6 m s shi et al 2006 and at 1 63 10 6 m s yao et al 2012 which is calibrated by hydrus 2d based on the ponding test because the k s of mortar is smaller than the k sc li et al 2016b the k sce values of both ncg and ocg are larger than the tested k sc of 1 08 10 7 m s after 3 years the crack width increases by approximately 80 fold which causes the k sce to increase by approximately 160 fold 4 sensitivity analysis of the model parameters to study the impact of the lining characteristics and k s of layered soil and the main factors on canal seepage sensitivity analysis was conducted the one factor at a time oat method melching and yoon 1996 was used for the sensitivity analyses a normalized sensitive index rs was computed using the following equation zheng and bennett 2002 24 rs δ y y δ x x where δy y and δx x are the relative changes in the objective and parameter respectively y is the initial value of the objective value δy is the change in the objective x is the initial value of the parameter and δx is the change in the parameter ci was used as the objective factor in the sensitivity analysis of five treatments including the aforementioned 4 lining treatments and a hypothetical treatment nc based on ncg in which the canal is lined only with newly built precast concrete slabs the parameters include the hole density p g k sg crack width k sc and k s of each soil layer the ranges of the parameter values are set as 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 5 and 10 times the original values which are the parameters calibrated as shown in table 1 and table 2 4 1 the sensitivities of the parameters in each lining treatment the relative changes in the ci values with the variation in the parameters of the five treatments are shown in fig 11 a e for the canal without a lining i e s fig 11 a the k s of soil layer 2 has the greatest impact followed by those of soil layer 1 and layer 0 a sand layer see table 1 because the three layers are relatively close to the canal bottom and because the k s of soil layer 2 is smaller than those of the other layers and dominates the infiltration for a canal lined with newly built concrete and a geomembrane lining i e ncg fig 11 b as the parameter values decrease the most influential parameter is k sg followed by the crack width because the k sg and k sc values are 2 4 orders of magnitude lower than the k s values of the soil layers the geomembrane and crack domains infiltrate through the geomembrane lining and concrete lining therefore the ci decreases greatly with decreasing crack width and k sg as the values of the parameters increase the ci greatly increases with k sg and k sc but minimally increases with the crack width because the seepage through cracks reaches a maximum the initial k sc is so small that a decrease in this parameter has little influence but an increase in this parameter produces a large increase in the ci for a canal lined with a damaged geomembrane lining i e og fig 11 c the ci is most sensitive to the hole density followed by p g and k sg and is less sensitive to the k s of the soil layers this is because increases in the hole density and p g cause increases in the equivalent area of the holes dominating the seepage through the geomembrane lining the ci is more sensitive to the hole density than p g because an increase in the hole density not only increases the total equivalent area but also makes the distribution of holes more even which increases the lateral flow seepage in the soil after the water passes through the holes for a canal lined with damaged concrete and a geomembrane lining i e ocg fig 11 d when the values of the parameters decrease the ci is most sensitive to the k s of the sand followed by the k sg hole density p g and crack width when the values of all the parameters increase the ci is most sensitive to the hole density followed by the p g crack width and k sg in the combined lining water mainly infiltrates through the cracks and then into the sand through the holes in the geomembrane and finally into the soil therefore a decrease in the k s of the sand causes an obvious decrease in the ci however because the original k s of the sand layer is relatively large the ci is less sensitive to this parameter than to the lining parameters as the parameters increase for a canal lined with a newly built concrete lining i e nc fig 11 e when the values of the parameters decrease the ci is most sensitive to the crack width followed by the k s of the sand and is not sensitive to k sc this is because the original k sc is very small and the cracks are the main channel through which water passes through in the concrete lining thus the ci is not sensitive to a decrease in k sc in contrast as k sc increases the seepage through the concrete lining increases correspondingly hence as the parameters increase ci is more sensitive to k sc than to the sand layer the above analysis shows that the ci is not sensitive to the k s values of the soil layers that are farther from the bottom of the canal such as soil layer 4 and soil layer 5 as shown in table 1 although they are highly permeable which is also confirmed by the normalized sensitivity parameter rs in fig 12 the soil layers that are adjacent to the canal bottom are more sensitive which is consistent with the literature yao et al 2012 salmasi and abraham 2020 also showed the hydraulic conductivity of the underlying soil of a canal has great influence on canal seepage by comparing experimental results measured by input output flow method and estimated by numerical simulation and empirical formulas e g davis wilson moleswerth moritz compared with the relation of ci to the k s of the soil layers the ci is more sensitive to the parameters related to the canal lining such as the crack width hole density k sg k sc and p g which is confirmed by the fact that seepage can be reduced greatly by newly built concrete or geomembrane lining jadhav et al 2014 snell 2001 zhang et al 2017 however this is different from the results in the literature rastogi and prasad 1992 yao et al 2012 because k s of the liner in the literature rastogi and prasad 1992 was not obtained from laboratory tests which was assumed to be 1 10 of the topsoil k s thus the variation in k s of the liner was in a large value range which did not include the real k s of the liner so that the performance was only similar to a soil layer with a smaller k s such as soil layer 2 in the present study in the study conducted by yao et al 2012 the k s of the lining layer is an equivalent value of lining and lining damage which is close to the k s of the soil layers thus the variation in the lining characteristics is not accurately reflected by the variation in k s of the lining layer 4 2 the lining influence on the parameter sensitivity the cis of the s ncg og ocg and nc treatments under the same conditions are 0 488 0 044 0 223 0 21 and 0 198 m3 m respectively which shows that the ncg lining treatment has the best seepage control lining efficacy followed by those of nc ocg and og fig 12 shows that the sensitivity of the lining parameters varies greatly with the parameter values and lining conditions and that the parameters are influenced by each other in fig 12 a parameter with a larger rs means that the canal seepage is more sensitive to that parameter the parameters that do not dominate the infiltration are more influential in a lined canal with worse seepage control efficacy as shown in fig 12 a e the rs values of the k s of the soil layers of the s and og treatments are obviously larger than those of the ncg nc and ocg treatments because the infiltration is dominated by the lining this can also be found in fig 12 g i the rs values of the k sg hole density and p g of the ocg treatment are obviously smaller than those of the og treatment because the infiltration of the ocg treatment is dominated by the k sc crack width and k s of sand however for a parameter that dominates the infiltration in a lining treatment the rs value is larger than those in other treatments whether the treatment has a better or worse lining condition for example the rs of the k sg of the ncg treatment is greater than those of the ocg and og treatments although ncg has the best seepage control efficacy because there are no holes in the geomembrane and all seepage passes through the geomembrane in the ncg treatment see fig 12 g fig 12 a also shows that the rs value of soil layer 1 in the og treatment is greater than that in the s treatment as shown in fig 12 f the rs values of the sand layer in the nc and ocg treatments are greater than those in the s og and ocg treatments for the p g hole density and crack width of the nc and ncg treatments shown in fig 12 g h and k respectively the rs values first increase and then gradually decrease this shows that lining damage has a strong influence on canal seepage however as the hole area or crack width increases there are interactions between the seepage through the cracks in the sand and through the holes in the soil and the rs gradually decreases because the seepage loss is gradually dominated by other factors because the geomembrane of ncg also reduces the seepage the crack width and k sc of ncg are less influential than those of nc for the k sc and crack width shown in fig 12 j and k respectively the rs values of the ocg treatment are smallest because the crack widths of ocg are larger than those of ncg and nc providing ocg with sufficient seepage channels through the concrete lining in comparison with those of ncg and nc therefore variation in the k sc or crack width minimally affects the ci of ocg but causes greater changes in those of ncg and nc the rs values of the k sc of ncg and nc increase with k sc because the crack width is only 0 0025 mm which is so small that the ci is greatly influenced by k sc especially when k sc is larger from the above analysis the main factors affecting canal seepage are as follows for lined canals without cracks or holes or with little damage k sg or k sc is the most influential parameter after the lining is damaged as the crack width or hole density increases the influence of the crack width or hole density increases first and then decreases gradually while the influence of k sg or k sc gradually decreases when the canal lining is nearly ineffective the most influential parameters are the k s of the soil layers that are in or adjacent to the canal bottom or layers with lower k s for example the k s of sand soil layer 1 and soil layer 2 given that k sg is generally in the range of 1 0 10 13 m s 1 0 10 10 m s andersen and nelson 1997 giroud and bonaparte 1989b jiang et al 2010 and k sc is generally in the range of 1 0 10 13 m s 1 0 10 10 m s the crack width and hole density and p g are the most important factors influencing canal seepage 5 discussion the proposed model which includes the water flow in the soil concrete lining and geomembrane lining with explicit representation of cracks and holes provides a flexible and quantitative research tool to simulate the canal seepage from a lined canal under different lining damage conditions compared with the equivalent method because the quantitative relationship between the equivalent k s of lining and the damage characteristics is not explicit the proposed model could be used to improve the accuracy of estimation of the seepage loss from a canal lined only by concrete lined only by geomembrane or lined by both concrete and geomembrane under different lining conditions furthermore based on the change in the lining parameters e g k sc k sg crack width and hole density with the service time of the lining the variation in seepage loss from a lined canal with time could also be obtained by the proposed model this is of great importance for assessing the agricultural water use efficiency cost and benefit performance of linings and for proper irrigation management hameed et al 1996 tabari et al 2014 xu et al 2010 for a specific canal the parameters of lining are important for the proposed model in realistic applications the parameters of concrete lining include k sc crack length crack width crack depth crack location and orientation for geomembrane lining the parameters include k sg hole size hole location and p g all parameters mentioned except p g could be obtained by direct measurement because many parameters are required it is important to reduce the preparation work on the parameters to improve the practicability of the model the results of the sensitivity analysis in the present study provide a reference in which the sensitive parameters under a specific lining condition should be paid more attention with less attention paid to the common parameters with little influence for the cracks if for a canal lined by newly built concrete lining such as nc treatment in the present study the crack width has great influence on ci then all cracks must be measured however only the cracks with widths in the sensitive range are suggested to be measured carefully for a canal with a similar damage condition to ocg treatment a reference crack width and k sc may be sufficient since ci is not sensitive to crack width and k sc while precise measurements are required on the hole size hole location p g k sg and k s of soil underlying the lining more attention should be paid to the parameter p g which is difficult to obtain directly because it is influenced by many factors such as wrinkles in the geomembrane el zein and rowe 2008 rowe 1998 pressure on the geomembrane walton et al 1997 weber and zornberg 2005 and clods or irregularities in the underlying soil surface giroud and bonaparte 1989a p g is very important in the estimation of canal seepage from a canal lined by geomembrane with holes although a reference p g when geomembrane and underlying soil are in poor contact is provided in the present study it may be site specific and more precise experimental studies are required to provide more accurate p g under different conditions as model inputs for describing the water seepage through geomembrane lining due to the lack of a reference p g value under different conditions a p g value calibrated from the result of a ponding test on a canal with similar conditions is a practical compromise the proposed model requires many parameters concerning to the lining characteristics and a large amount of repetitive iterations are needed since the model is based on the 3d richard s equation so it is challenging for the model to capture large scale canal seepage consequently the simplification of the model is significant and necessary to make the model more suitable in practical applications the estimation of seepage from a lined canal would be more convenient and accurate if the whole lining both concrete and geomembrane could be represented as a single layer of porous medium with equivalent parameters including the equivalent k s in numerical simulation or an equivalent coefficient used to describe the lining permeability in empirical formulas akkuzu 2012 zhang et al 2017 the equivalent k s could be used in the equivalent method numerical model such as hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 2008 seep w krahn 2004 or comsol multiphysics comsol 2015 to simplify the seepage process as a two dimensional problem such a step is based on the proposed model to study the relationship between the equivalent k s and the lining characteristics involving the material parameters e g permeability coefficient thickness etc and damage characteristics crack width crack location crack density hole size hole location etc also the proposed model can be used to establish the relationship between the equivalent coefficient of the lining in empirical formulas e g the c in davis wilson formula and β in kostiakov formula akkuzu 2012 guo 1997 zhang et al 2017 and the actual lining conditions moreover the equivalent k s or equivalent coefficient varying with time can be obtained through the degradation of the lining materials and development of damage characteristics with lining service time by the proposed model which can significantly improve the accuracy for estimation of seepage loss in practical 6 conclusions in this paper a numerical approach is proposed to simulate the effects of different kinds of concrete and geomembrane damage on canal seepage at a typical length 1 2 m according to richard s equation in porous media the cubic law in cracks and the transformation of seepage through geomembrane simulation the 3d fem is utilized to solve the nonlinear governing equations of mass transport similarly ponding tests on a canal with four different lining treatments and additional experiments are conducted to quantify the effect of lining damage on canal seepage and provide the material parameters and validation data for the numerical model based on the experimental results and further sensitivity analysis with the validated model the following conclusions are drawn 1 the results of the proposed model agree well with the experimental results showing that the model provides an accurate approach for simulating the water flow from canals with concrete and geomembrane linings and can accommodate different kinds of crack and hole scenarios 2 the experimental and simulated results show that canal linings of concrete and geomembranes with little damage exhibit good seepage control efficacy however as the hole density or crack width increases the seepage loss gradually increases and becomes dependent on the hole density or crack width and k sc and k sg play a negotiable role in seepage control the water lost through the crack and holes are the main part of seepage through the concrete and geomembrane lining 3 for seepage from the lined canal the lining parameters such as the crack width hole density k sg and k sc are more influential than the k s of the soil layers especially for newly built linings with better seepage control efficacy 4 the seepage loss is sensitive to the k s of the soil layers that are closer to the canal bottom and is not sensitive to the k s of the soil layers that are farther from the canal bottom the sensitivity of the soil layer k s to seepage loss decreases with increasing value and increases when the seepage control efficacy of the lining decreases it should be noted that estimated parameters for the crack width and p g were used in the present study in the future more precise experimental measurements should be used as model inputs for describing the water seepage through concrete and geomembrane

anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive comments appendix a a 1 coupled modelling of the flow in porous media and cracks the water flow in porous media and cracks is coupled with the water exchange between the cracks and concrete sc up and sc down see fig 3 b which is the source sink term in both governing equations the discretized equation of eq 3 can be expressed as follows in matrix form chen et al 2013 simunek et al 1995 a 1 c j 1 h j 1 h j δ t j k j 1 h j 1 q j d j 1 where a 2 c e ω n t c n d ω a 3 k e ω k n t n d ω a 4 q e γ 1 n t q f n d γ 1 a 5 d e ω n t s n d ω where ω is the domain of porous media n is the shape function q f is the outflow flux of the porous media boundary and crack boundary lt 1 γ 1 is the boundary of ω j 1 denotes the current time level at which the solution is being considered j refers the previous time level and δt j t j 1 t j eq a 1 can be converted to a 6 a j 1 h j 1 q j d j 1 e j where a j 1 k j 1 c j 1 δt j e j c j 1 h j δt j similarly the discretized governing equation of crack flow eq 6 can be expressed as a 7 a c j 1 h c j 1 q c j d c j 1 e c j because the water flow in the crack is simulated as two dimensions the exchange flux dc j 1 for node i is calculated as follows a 8 d c i j 1 e a e 3 s c i j 1 where a e is the area of element e l2 and sci is the source sink flux of node i in the crack plane lt 1 according to eqs 8 10 sci is calculated as follows a 9 s c i j 1 k fi h ci j 1 h di j 1 0 5 d f k f i h ci j 1 h ui j 1 0 5 d f where k fi is the permeability coefficient lt 1 of crack node i and h ci h di and h ui are the water heads l of crack node i and the attached nodes in the bottom and upper boundaries of the porous media respectively a 10 h ci j 1 h ci j 1 z ci a 11 h di j 1 h di j 1 z di a 12 h ui j 1 h ui j 1 z ui where h ci h di h ui and z ci z di z ui are the pressure head and z coordinates of crack node i and the attached node in the bottom and upper boundary of porous media l by substituting eqs a 10 a 12 into eq a 9 we have a 13 d c i j 1 e 4 a e k fi 3 d f h ci j 1 e 2 a e k fi 3 d f h di j 1 h ui j 1 z ci z di z ci z ui because the node of the crack is in the middle plane of the upper and lower boundaries of the crack and the crack width is far smaller than the size of the concrete slabs the pressure head values of the two sides hdi and hui are identical see fig 3 b eq a 13 is simplified as eq a 14 a 14 d c i j 1 e 4 a e k fl 3 d f h ci j 1 e 4 a e k f i 3 d f h i j 1 for the source sink term d j 1 of porous media in eq a 1 because there is exchange only between the porous media and crack the d j 1 is zero for other nodes the exchange occurs only in the crack plane which is equal to the water from porous media into the crack for node i in the crack plane of porous media d j 1 i is calculated as follow a 15 d i j 1 e 4 a e k f i 3 d f h i j 1 e 4 a e k f i 3 d f h ci j 1 therefore the water flow in the porous media and cracks can be coupled in matrix form by adjusting the coefficient in the matrix and forming a global stiffness matrix of the porous media and crack flow the matrices of eq a 6 and eq a 7 can be modified according to eq a 14 and a 15 to be integrated into one matrix an illustrative example is given to show the key idea of the coupling procedure we assume that porous media are discretized by n nodes and the crack plane is discretized by l nodes which are nodes m 1 to m l and nodes n 1 n l are added as the nodes of the crack the global matrix for this assumption is shown as follows a 16 a 1 1 a 1 m a 1 m 1 a 1 m i a 1 m l a 1 n a m

the capital letters am i m i am i n i dm i am i n i an i n i dn i i 1 2 l represent the items that should be modified according to eq a 14 and eq a 15 according to eq a 14 and eq a 15 am i m i am i n

a 21 a n i m i e 4 a e k fl 3 d f a 22 d n i 0 eq a 16 is then simplified as eq a 23 because d is a zero vector after modification by eqs a 17 a 22 a 23 a j 1 h j 1 q j e j a 2 transformation of the global matrix by the geomembrane boundary based on the coupled flow in porous media and cracks canal seepage can be simulated by solving eq a 23 when the geomembrane is not used in the canal lining when the canal is lined with a geomembrane the domain region is divided into two subdomain regions the geomembrane is simulated as two flux boundaries by the zero thickness interface element see fig 3 c the water heads in the up and down surfaces of the geomembrane are used to calculate the global stiffness matrix eq a 23 is transferred to eq a 24 because the flux of the node in the geomembrane surface is calculated by the water head at time level j 1 a 24 a j 1 h j 1 q j 1 e j an illustrative example is given to show the key idea of the geomembrane boundary treatment it is assumed that the domain area is meshed by total n nodes without geomembrane and p nodes from node m 1 to m p are selected as the geomembrane boundary m 1 is the node that starts as the geomembrane boundary nodes m 1 to m p are assumed in the upper boundary of the geomembrane nodes n 1 to n p are added as corresponding nodes of nodes m 1 to m p in the bottom boundary of the geomembrane for node m i in the geomembrane upper surface qm i is calculated as follows a 25 q m i e σ m i l m i where σ m i is the flux lt 1 across the boundary in the vicinity of boundary node m i positive when directed outward of the system and lm i is the area of the boundary segment connected to node m i l2 according to eq 12 σ m i is calculated as follows a 26 σ m i k g h z m i h z n i d g where node n i is the corresponding node of m i in the down surface of the geomembrane by substituting eq a 26 into eq a 25 q m i is calculated as follows a 27 q m i e k g l m i d g h n i e k g l m i d g h m i e k g l m i

4592,this study proposes a method to consider the high rise building in the rainfall runoff analysis of an urban basin this study uses a rainfall runoff model based on the shot noise process to evaluate the relative roles of the building rooftop sub basin and the wall sub basin in addition the rainfall runoff experiment is conducted in a laboratory environment to validate the proposed method considering high rise buildings the major results of this study can be summarized as follow 1 the rainfall intercepted by the building wall increases the runoff volume and peak flow but the longer flow path from the rooftop basin decreases the peak flow overall the role of the building wall is found to be more significant than the rooftop in resulting in increased runoff volume and peak flow 2 the experimental results also confirm the simulation results the contribution of the building wall to the peak flow is found to be highly significant especially when the wind speed is high for example when the mean wind speed is 1 11 m s the contribution of the building wall to the peak flow is found to be 6 3 6 9 and 14 2 17 0 for the 1 0 and 1 4 m building height respectively 3 the accuracy of the rainfall runoff model can be improved by considering the building as the building is considered the rmse and the difference of peak flow between the observed and simulated hydrograph decrease in all cases the results of this study support the idea that in the urban basin the contribution of the high rise building to runoff can be significant keywords high rise building rainfall runoff analysis rainfall runoff experiment shot noise process model 1 introduction urbanization is a common issue worldwide more than 50 of the world population lives in cities seto and shepherd 2009 douglas 2012 zhou et al 2015 phillis et al 2017 cleophas et al 2019 during the 20 year period 1990 2010 the urban area increased by more than 70 zhou et al 2015 liu et al 2018 the number of megacities with population of 10 million or greater is also expected to rise from 33 to 43 in the period 2018 to 2030 desa 2018 in those cities the numbers of so called high rise buildings e g 300 meter or higher tall buildings are also increasing safarik et al 2015 gabel and shehadi 2017 increased impervious area in the city increases the runoff volume as well as the runoff peak the peak time has also been shortening to increase flood risk liu et al 2005 nirupama and simonovic 2007 saghafian et al 2008 suriya and mudgal 2012 more and more city residents are threatened by the increased flood risk cançado et al 2008 tingsanchali 2012 the effect of urbanization on the rainfall runoff analysis has been one of the most important issues in hydrology hejazi and markus 2009 roy et al 2009 o driscoll et al 2010 du et al 2012 li et al 2013 chen et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2015 yao et al 2016 jung and kim 2017 niemi et al 2019 most of these studies have focused on urban flood although some studies have also raised the problems of decreased infiltration and dry stream roy et al 2009 o driscoll et al 2010 jung and kim 2017 in those analyses urbanization is considered simply by increasing the impervious area that is the impervious area is the sole and key factor used to consider urbanization models like illudas terstriep and stall 1974 swmm cole and shutt 1976 tr 55 usda 1985 hspf bicknell et al 1996 and storm wiles and levine 2002 have been used for this purpose however recent megacities are characterized by the high rise building these cities are totally different from conventional cities that are simply characterized by the urban area or impervious area megacities are three dimensional in reality while the conventional two dimensional cities are characterized by impervious area megacities should be characterized by additionally considering the high rise building that is the conventional two dimensional cities consider the change of infiltration to be important but the three dimensional megacities should additionally consider the rainfall interception by the high rise building in previous studies the interception on buildings was considered as a loss grimmond and oke 1991 lemonsu et al 2007 hamdi et al 2011 or buildings were regarded as a factor that slows the runoff schubert et al 2008 cea et al 2010 chan 2012 dottori and todini 2013 however in the three dimensional city the intercepted rainfall should be analyzed as an additional source of runoff the role of interception by the high rise building in an urban basin is similar to the role of high mountains in a natural basin both high rise buildings and high mountains have a major effect on the interception of rainfall that falls obliquely due to the wind it is difficult to find previous studies on the phenomenon that rainfall runoff characteristics are changed by high rise buildings on the other hand the authors could find several references of analyzing the effect of the high mountains for example hughes et al 2009 showed the role of the mountain specifically big pine mountain located in california is to make different runoff patterns on its coastal side and its inland side simply the mountain intercepts rainfall to make additional runoff on the coastal side a similar result can also be found in murphy et al 2017 who compared the runoff on the eastern and western sides of luquillo mountain in puerto rico the total amount of rainfall on the western side of luquillo mountain was found to be 46 higher than that on the eastern side the role of the high rise buildings in megacities can be assumed to be similar to those mountains it should also be mentioned that the high rise building changes and complicates the route of runoff the change is also dependent upon the shape of the building as well as the density of buildings in an urban area the raindrops that have reached the wall of a building roll down for a while and then free fall again to the ground the rainfall on the rooftop of a building is generally drained through the vertical pipe various studies have been done for the runoff on the wall of a building beijer and johansson 1977 hall and kalimeris 1982 blocken and carmeliet 2012 for example beijer and johansson 1977 simulated the runoff on the wall of a building using a simple rainfall runoff model hall and kalimeris 1982 calculated the runoff depth on the wall which was then used to estimate the flow velocity blocken and carmeliet 2012 numerically simulated the runoff on the wall to show that the flow itself is very similar to that in the open channel these studies confirm that the runoff does exist on the wall of a building which can also be considered in the rainfall runoff analysis in an urban basin the objective of this study is to consider the high rise buildings in the rainfall runoff analysis of an urban basin in particular the difference should be evaluated between the conventional two dimensional rainfall runoff analysis and the three dimensional analysis considering the high rise building the rainfall runoff analysis method in this study is basically simulation based and some additional experiments will also be conducted in a laboratory environment to validate the proposed method 2 distortion of the rainfall runoff process by high rise buildings 2 1 rainfall interception in general the amount of intercepted rainfall is regarded as being evaporated and does not contribute to the runoff during the short term of the rainfall runoff process on the other hand rainfall intercepted by a high rise building could reach the ground and contribute to the runoff therefore the intercepted rainfall in this case may not be assumed to be evaporated as in the conventional rainfall runoff analysis method cho et al 2020 proposed an empirical equation for estimating the amount of rainfall intercepted by a building wall the basic form of the empirical equation was determined by analyzing prior studies on the spatial distribution of wind driven rain wdr and a laboratory experiment was conducted to fit the proposed empirical equation in addition the empirical equation was validated by comparing its estimates with the in situ observation the empirical equation proposed by cho et al 2020 is as follows 1 q 0 161 b h u r h 0 88 where r h is the rainfall intensity observed at the ground mm h b is the width of the building wall m h is the height of the building wall m u is the wind speed m s and q is the amount of intercepted rainfall m2 mm h in this study the amount of intercepted rainfall was estimated using eq 1 which was then used as input data for the runoff analysis from the wall of a high rise building 2 2 three dimensional flow path consideration of the high rise building changes the flow path of runoff in the basin generally the flow path is considered over the two dimensional plane the flow length is estimated as the horizontal distance and the flow velocity is determined by considering the slope of the land surface in urban basins buildings are assumed to be simply a part of the impervious area the building s shape including the height and width is not considered in the flow path in some two dimensional rainfall runoff models the flow path on the land surface is determined by considering the barrier role of a building seyoum et al 2012 bisht et al 2016 leandro and martins 2016 huang and jin 2019 fig 1 shows the possible change of flow path due to high rise building fig 1 b shows the changed flow paths due to a high rise building over the two dimensional plane which are very different from the conventional one as shown in fig 1 a additionally the high rise building makes the flow path three dimensional fig 1 d the flow path cannot be two dimensional such as in the conventional model fig 1 c the vertical path is especially important in the case that the travel time from the rooftop of a building to the ground is relatively long in a small urban center with many high rise buildings this change will surely be concentrated in this case the flow path from the building wall to the ground can also be important 2 3 sub basin division the sub basin division is important to consider various areas with different characteristics in the runoff estimation in particular the high rise building itself can be divided into several sub basins fig 2 b shows an example of the sub basin division of a high rise building the conventional method of sub basin division is as in fig 2 a even in the case of considering a building as a barrier against surface runoff fig 2 b shows that the high rise building can be divided into one sub basin of the rooftop and four building walls the flow path from the rooftop of a building sub basin ① 1 includes the rooftop itself and the flow through the vertical drainage pipe the flow path from the building wall sub basins ① 2 ① 5 is composed of the surface flow on the building wall and the free fall again to the ground in particular when the wind is rather high the sub basins ① 2 ① 5 i e building walls are important if the wind speed is greater than 8 2 m s the intensity of wind driven rain on building walls can be higher than that on the rooftop of a building cho et al 2020 in this case the slope of wind driven rain becomes 45 determined by comparing the terminal velocity of a raindrop and the wind speed 3 rainfall runoff model and parameters 3 1 model this study uses the rainfall runoff model proposed by kang and yoo 2018 this rainfall runoff model is based on the concept of the shot noise process weiss 1977 the shot noise process was developed to model the noise from a diode or transistor this noise has the peak at the occurrence point and as time continues decays exponentially due to the characteristic feature of the noise it is called as a shot noise if many noises occur the resulting overall noise simply becomes the sum of each noise kang and yoo 2018 proposed the use of the shot noise process to model flood runoff in fact the shot noise process model has been used more to model the long term runoff rather than the flood this is because the sharp peak at the occurrence of the noise was assumed to be inappropriate to model flood runoff however the concept of the linear reservoir model which also produces a shot noise like response function has been frequently used in the modeling of the instantaneous unit hydrograph nash and hrs 1960 diskin et al 1973 singh 2004 sahoo et al 2006 as many shot noises or linear reservoirs are considered the characteristic feature of each shot noise naturally disappears another interesting feature of the shot noise process considered by kang and yoo 2018 is that the sum of each shot noise simply becomes the overall result that is different from other rainfall runoff models channel flood routing is not considered the runoff from any sub basin is considered as a single shot noise the shape of the shot noise can be different according to the sub basin characteristics channel characteristics to the exit of the basin and the rainfall input however each shot noise becomes independent from others as all of them flow to the exit of the basin each shot noise is simply added at the exit of the basin see fig 3 as this study assumes that the rooftop of a building as well as each building wall is an independent sub basin it is easy to evaluate the contribution of each sub basin to the total runoff at the exit of the basin the runoff at the exit of the basin due to a unit effective rainfall can be expressed as a sum of shot noises from all contributing sub basins 2 u t n p n e t t c n k n where n is the number of sub basins p n is the peak value of the runoff generated by the unit effective rainfall from each sub basin t c n is the travel time from the center of each sub basin to the exit of the basin and k n is the decay coefficient of the shot noise or the storage coefficient representing the entire flow path from the center of the sub basin to the exit of the basin in this study as the basin area is small the rainfall intensity is assumed to be the same all over the basin as a result the runoff hydrograph due to continuous rainfall can be derived as follows 3 o t i r i u t i i r i n p n e t i t c n k n where i represents the time of rainfall occurrence and r i represents the rainfall intensity the parameters of the rainfall runoff model are the peak value p n the travel time t c n and the decay coefficient k n of the shot noise representing each sub basin first the travel time t c n is determined as the sum of each travel time from the center of the basin to the exit of the basin the surface runoff of the sub basin and several open channel flows are considered to estimate the travel time in ungauged basins empirical equations are generally used to estimate the travel time the kirpich kirpich 1940 rziha rziha 1876 kraven i jsce 1999 kraven ii jsce 1999 and kerby kerby 1959 formulae are among those that are available for this purpose each formula was derived under certain specific conditions which should also be considered in its application if the observed data are available the travel time can be easily estimated the decay coefficient k n can be replaced by the storage coefficient this arises from the fact that the shot noise process is also the response of a linear reservoir basically the storage coefficient can be estimated by analyzing the observed data however in the case of ungauged basins the storage coefficient should also be estimated using some empirical equations the equations of clark 1945 linsley 1945 russell et al 1979 and sabol 1988 are among those frequently used finally the peak value p n is determined by considering the total runoff volume at each sub basin the total runoff volume volume at each sub basin can be easily estimated by applying the modified rational formula with the given runoff coefficient hua et al 2003 4 volume p n 0 e t k n d t 3 2 travel time and storage coefficient in a small urban basin the travel time of a raindrop even from the farthest point is not long it can take just a few minutes to reach the nearest manhole however if considering a high rise building the flow path can be longer and thus the travel time can also be longer obviously a longer travel time alleviates peak flow but the problem is that the high rise building has four walls and a rooftop to contribute to runoff how to consider these changes is of interest in this study estimation of the travel time is thus important in this study first the rainfall on the rooftop of a building reaches the ground via three different paths one is the flow on the rooftop to the inlet of the vertical drainage pipe next is the flow in the vertical drainage pipe and finally there is the flow on the ground from the exit of the vertical drainage pipe to the nearest manhole the travel time in the first and third paths may be estimated by the kraven ii formula or the kerby formula in particular the kerby formula is applied to a very small basin of less than 0 04 km2 so it is useful to estimate the travel time in a lab experiment soliman 2010 the kraven ii formula is also known to be valid for small basins the kerby and kraven ii formulae are as follow 5 t c 36 264 l n 0 467 s 0 2335 6 t c 16 667 l v where t c is the travel time min l is the flow length km n is the roughness coefficient s is the slope of the basin and v is the flow velocity m s in eq 6 for the slope less than 0 005 the flow velocity v 2 1 m s is applied and for the slope higher than 0 005 but less than 0 01 v 3 0 m s is applied for the slope higher than 0 01 v 3 5 m s is applied the travel time in a vertical drainage pipe can be estimated by wyly and eaton formula wyly and eaton 1961 their formula provides the mean falling velocity 7 v pipe 16 2 q d 0 4 where v pipe is the fall velocity m s in a vertical drainage pipe q is the flow rate m3 s and d is the diameter m of the pipe the flow rate is generally estimated by applying the rational formula ponce 1989 maidment 1993 bedient et al 2008 and the diameter of the pipe is assumed to be 0 2 m which is the maximum one available for the high rise building me 2015 the travel time of a raindrop rolling down the building wall was estimated using the experimental result by de vogelaere and pacco 2012 according to their study the mean velocity of a raindrop rolling on a similar wall to that in this experiment is 0 027 m s in fact this velocity is very slow to make the travel time so long in a tall building thus one more assumption should be introduced for application on the real urban basin which is that the raindrop becomes larger as it rolls down the wall and finally becomes detached from the wall to free fall the free fall velocity can be estimated by the equation proposed by ferro 2001 8 v free v max 1 e a n d where v free represents the mean free fall velocity m s v max is the maximum free fall velocity m s d is the diameter of a raindrop mm and a n is a parameter determined by considering the experimental conditions when the drop height of a raindrop is higher than 20 m then v max and a n are assumed to be 9 55 m s and 6 respectively the diameter of a raindrop used in this study was the median value representing the given rainfall intensity rziha 1876 the storage coefficient is more complicated to determine this is affected by the basin characteristics as well as the channel characteristics if some amount of rainfall runoff data are available it may be estimated in ungauged basins any given empirical formula if it is available must be relied on however it may be an exceptional situation for a reliable formula to be given on the other hand in this study the authors relied on the study of russell et al 1979 where the storage coefficient was assumed to be more or less the same as the concentration time i e the overall travel time to the exit of the basin for each sub basin kang and yoo 2018 also assumed the storage coefficient to be identical to the concentration time this assumption may not be strictly accurate but may be acceptable in the study of handling the rainfall runoff analysis in an urban basin 4 validation of rainfall runoff analysis in the experimental basin 4 1 experimental setting in general laboratory experiment had been conducted to analyze factors affecting rainfall runoff processes pappas et al 2008 shuster et al 2008 shuster and pappas 2011 isidoro et al 2012 isidoro and de lima 2014 leandro et al 2016 ferreira et al 2019 liu et al 2020 this study prepared an experimental basin with the rainfall nozzles and fans for the rainfall runoff experiment the experimental basin was slanted by 10 and a basin outlet was located in the lower right corner fig 4 a shows a schematic diagram of the experimental basin 10 nozzles diameter 0 5 mm were used to simulate rainfall and 12 fans to simulate wind there are two rows of five rain nozzles and the height of each row is 2 61 m and 2 71 m from the experimental basin simply the average height of all rainfall nozzles is 2 66 m in the case of 12 fans the average height is 1 80 m from the experimental basin in fig 4 a the building location indicates where the building model will be placed the width and length of the building were fixed in this experiment as 0 8 m but two different heights of the building 1 0 and 1 4 m were considered in addition the rainfall runoff experiment without any building was also conducted to evaluate the effect of the building fig 4 b and 4 c show schematic diagrams of building models with their heights 1 0 and 1 4 m respectively in this experiment the wind speed was controlled by adjusting the voltage of the power supply of the fan three different voltages i e 140 180 and 220 v were used for the fan the location of the wind speed measurement was done at the cross section 1 2 m apart in front of the fan the cross section was then divided into six columns and for each column the wind speed measurement was done at every 0 1 m interval from the bottom to the top 1 8 m the measurement was repeated several times to obtain the valid value fig 5 shows the vertical variation of the wind speed with respect to the input voltage obviously the distributions of the average wind speed are different depending on the input voltage the average wind speed was up to 1 83 m s at 140 v 2 05 m s at 180 v and 2 31 m s at 220 v table 1 summarizes the wind speed at the building height for each input voltage the cross sectional average of the wind speed for each voltage was then calculated to be 0 80 m s for 140 v 0 94 m s for 180 v and 1 11 m s for 220 v these cross sectional averages were similar regardless of the building height the rainfall intensity was controlled by changing the flow rate of the pump three flow rates i e 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 l min were considered in this experiment the rainfall intensity on the experimental basin was not evenly distributed so the representative rainfall intensity was determined as the mean of nine measurements over the experimental basin that is the experimental basin was divided into nine equal zones and the rainfall intensity was measured at the center of each zone the representative rainfall intensity was then determined to be their arithmetic average the measurements were repeated three times and finally their average was used as the rainfall condition in this study the authors found that the rainfall measurement method in this study was very similar to that of isidoro et al 2012 isidoro et al 2012 measured the rainfall intensity at every 0 3 m intervals over the 2 m 2 m experimental basin also isidoro et al 2012 repeated measurement three times to determine the rainfall condition table 2 summarizes the representative rainfall intensities determined with respect to various conditions table 2 shows that as the pump flow rate increases the rainfall intensity increases on the other hand as the wind speed increases the rainfall intensity decreases obviously as the wind speed increases a significant amount of raindrops fall outside of the experimental basin this is the reason why as the wind speed increases the rainfall intensity decreases when the pump flow rate was the highest i e 3 0 l min and the wind speed was the lowest i e 0 8 m s the average rainfall intensity was the highest at 37 7 mm h in contrast when the pump flow rate was the lowest i e 2 0 l min and the wind speed was the highest i e 1 11 m s the average rainfall intensity was the lowest at 21 4 mm h the rainfall runoff experiment using several buildings had been conducted in previous studies isidoro et al 2012 liu et al 2020 on the other hand in this study only one building is considered and experiments are conducted by changing the height of the building with various rainfall and wind speed conditions through these experiments this study evaluates the effect of the intercepted rainfall by a building model on the rainfall runoff process under various rainfall wind speed conditions in addition the authors try to show that the influence of the building which would be verified by the experiment can be theoretically simulated by the rainfall runoff model 4 2 rainfall runoff analysis 4 2 1 sub basin division and travel time fig 6 shows that the sub basin division was done by considering the rooftop and each wall of the building located at the center of the basin to compare the runoff results from the basin with and without the building the basin without the building was also divided into five sub basins fig 6 a with the building at the center of the basin the total number of sub basins was increased to be eight fig 6 b in this case the rooftop of the building sub basin ① 1 has a longer travel time than the sub basin ① as the raindrops on the rooftop should drain by rolling down the building wall also in this experiment not all four building walls contribute to the runoff depending on the wind direction just one or two walls contribute to the runoff this is also the same in the real world in this experiment just one building wall the sub basin ① 2 was considered in the runoff estimation table 3 summarizes the basic characteristics of each sub basin without the building the sub basin area varies from 0 32 to 1 20 m2 the flow length was determined separately for the inside and outside of the sub basin the flow length inside of the sub basin indicates the length from the farthest point to the exit of the sub basin also in additional to the slope 10 in the flow direction of the basin the slopes in the cross direction were all assigned to be 0 1 this slope in the cross direction was introduced to apply the empirical formulae to estimate the travel time the area and flow length of the sub basin ① 1 are the same as those of the sub basin ① but the slope inside of the sub basin ① 1 is assumed to be 0 1 the flow length outside of the sub basin ① 1 additionally includes the height of the building the area of the sub basin ① 2 varies according to the height of the building the flow length within the sub basin is the same as the building height and the flow length outside of the sub basin becomes 1 4 m in the cross direction and 1 2 m in the flow direction the formulae by kerby 1959 and de vogelaere and pacco 2012 were used in this study to estimate the travel time the formula by kerby 1959 was used to estimate the travel time on the rooftop of the building and that on the land surface the roughness coefficient required to apply the kerby formula was assumed to be 0 01 for the wood rooftop and wall of the building and 0 009 for the acrylic basin surface the travel time on the building wall was estimated by applying the experimental result of de vogelaere and pacco 2012 based on de vogelaere and pacco 2012 the flow velocity of a raindrop rolling down the building wall is about 0 027 m s the travel time in the building wall was thus estimated simply by dividing the building height by this flow velocity in reality the raindrops that reach the rooftop of a building are collected and drained by vertical pipes but in this experiment they are drained simply by rolling down the building wall table 4 summarizes the travel time estimated for each sub basin in fig 5 a and 5 b both inside and outside the sub basin were considered to estimate the travel time as the slope in the cross direction was assumed to be small the travel time was estimated longer if the travel path included a rather long portion in the cross direction as can be found in table 4 the travel time for the sub basins ② ⑤ remained the same in both cases of with or without the building at the center of the basin however the sub basin ① in fig 6 a was divided into two sub basins ① 1 and ① 2 as a building was introduced such as in fig 6 b as the wind direction in this experiment was fixed to be perpendicular to the building wall in this case only one building wall ① 2 was considered the travel time of sub basin ① 1 is very different from that of sub basin ① one reason is that the building wall is additionally considered in its estimation and the second reason is that the slope of the rooftop of the building is assumed to be much milder than that of the basin surface the decay coefficient of all the basin was assumed to be the same as its travel time this assumption is based on russell et al 1979 in which the travel time and storage coefficient in an urban basin can be assumed to be identical 4 2 2 evaluation of impulse response functions fig 7 a and b compare the impulse response functions measured at the exit of each sub basin while fig 7 c and d do the same but are measured at the exit of the entire basin fig 7 b and d contain more graphs as the number of sub basins are increased as the building is additionally considered as the building is introduced a sub basin is replaced by two a rooftop sub basin of the building and another sub basin representing the building wall in fact these two constitute the difference between the two cases of with and without the building as a result of this difference the resulting impulse response function solid line in fig 7 d shows a slightly higher peak than that in fig 7 c without the building this is mainly due to the contribution from the building wall sub basin on the other hand as the travel time significantly increases the rooftop sub basin instead of the corresponding ground one decreases the peak flow 4 2 3 determination of experiment time the rainfall duration in the experiment was determined to confirm the occurrence of peak flow two different wind speeds of 0 80 and 1 11 m s and three rainfall intensities were considered in this experiment with the building of width 0 8 m and height 1 4 m fig 8 shows the observed runoff for 20 min in those experimental settings additionally the same condition was applied for the rainfall runoff simulation whose result is also compared in the same figure this figure shows that the peak flow occurred at around 300 s in the experiment on the other hand the peak time in the rainfall runoff simulation was found to be a bit retarded compared with that of the experiment this difference might be due to the rather long travel time on the building wall in the rainfall runoff simulation the simulation result shows that the peak flow occurred at about 800 s based on these experimental and simulation results this study determined the rainfall duration to be 1 200 s the runoff measurement was extended by an additional 600 s to see the behavior of the hydrograph in the falling limb the simulation was also done for the same condition 4 2 4 sensitivity analysis of the simulation results in this study the authors conducted the sensitivity analysis of simulation results on peak value and travel time the peak value of the shot noise is related to the peak flow of the hydrograph and the travel time is related to the peak time and the recession curve the peak value can be estimated by using the results of the modified rational formula in which the key parameter is the runoff coefficient in the experimental basin in this study infiltration does not occur and all rainfall contributes to the runoff therefore the peak value was estimated assuming that the runoff coefficient of the basin is 1 0 to analyze the sensitivity on the peak value this study simulated the hydrograph by changing the runoff coefficients to 0 80 0 85 0 90 0 95 and 1 00 while other parameters are fixed to analyze the sensitivity on the travel time the hydrograph was simulated by changing the average of the travel time to 50 sec 70 sec 90 sec 110 sec and 130 sec in this analysis the height of the building model was fixed to 1 4 m figs 9 10 show the simulation results with various runoff coefficients and the average of the travel time figs 9 10 shows the influence of the peak value of the shot noise and travel time on the simulation results in fig 9 as the runoff coefficient increases the peak of the hydrograph also increases when the runoff coefficient is 1 00 the peak flow is 1 25 times bigger than that with the runoff coefficient of 0 80 in fig 10 the peak time increases as the average of the travel time increases when the average of the travel time was 130 sec the peak time was increased by 2 32 times on average compared to that with the average of the travel time of 50 sec through the sensitivity analysis the authors were able to confirm the effect of peak value and travel time on the simulation results in this study 4 3 comparison of the simulation and experimental results in the rainfall runoff simulation considering the building located at the center of the basin it was required to add the wdr on the building wall this study used the empirical equation by cho et al 2020 i e eq 1 in section 2 which is in fact the equation to estimate the amount of rainfall intercepted by a building the amount of rainfall interception was then converted into the rainfall intensity over the building wall to be used as input of the rainfall runoff model for example under the condition of the wind speed 1 62 m s and rainfall intensity on the basin surface 27 2 mm h the rainfall amount intercepted by the building wall with its height 1 4 m and width 0 8 m comprises up to 27 4 of the rainfall amount collected over the rooftop of the building fig 11 compares the runoff results based on the experiment and simulation all the symbols represent the experimental results the circle represents the experimental results for the building height 1 4 m the triangle for the building height 1 0 m and the square with no building in the basin the solid lines represent the simulation results the darkest one for the building height 1 4 m and the lightest one with no building in the basin basically the experimental results matched the simulation results well the overall shape was the same and the peak flows were also very similar to each other however in the simulation of the cases the peak time was found to be slightly retarded especially when considering the building at the center of the basin this problem was also noticed in the pre experiment for determining the rainfall duration for the experiment this difference indicates a possible overestimation of the travel time in the building wall however the difference between the cases with and without the building at the center of the basin was clearly evident the difference between the cases with different building heights even though it was smaller than that between the cases with and without the building could also be clearly observed as a result the effect of the building wall on the runoff could be confirmed in this experiment in particular the contribution of the building wall to the peak flow was found to be highly significant especially when the wind speed was high for example when the mean wind speed was 0 80 m s the contribution of the building wall on the peak flow was 2 9 3 9 for the building height 1 0 m and 4 7 5 2 for the building height 1 4 m it became even higher when the mean wind speed was 1 11 m s to become 6 3 6 9 for the building height 1 0 m and 14 2 17 0 for the building height 1 4 m if considering higher buildings the contribution from the wall could be much higher than that from the rooftop of the building cho et al 2020 estimated the amount of rainwater that could possibly be collected from the building wall according to the ratio of the wall area to the rooftop area based on their study when the ratio of the wall area to the rooftop area is one the rainwater collected from the building wall can be greater than 50 of the rainwater collected from the rooftop under wind speed higher than 4 m s furthermore the amount of rainwater from the building wall can be greater than that from the rooftop if the ratio of the wall area to the rooftop area increases to 10 even in the case where the wind speed is only around 1 m s in addition the authors investigated how the rmse and the difference between the peak flows changed in the case of considering the building the observed hydrograph used in the analysis is the result of considering the building and the simulated hydrographs are the results with and without considering the building table 5 shows the rmse and table 6 shows the difference between peak flows table 5 shows that the accuracy of the rainfall runoff model can be improved as the building is considered in all cases the rmse between the observed and simulated hydrograph decreased as the building was considered in some cases the rmse decreased by more than 50 as the building was considered table 6 also shows that the difference of peak flow decreases significantly as the building is considered 5 conclusions this study proposed the rainfall runoff analysis method considering the high rise building in an urban basin the high rise building changes the role of rainfall interception and complicates the flow path of the runoff the rooftop and wall of the building were assumed to be independent sub basins to analyze the effect of high rise buildings the rainfall runoff model based on the shot noise process was applied to consider the building rooftop sub basin and the wall sub basin independently in addition the rainfall runoff experiment was conducted in a laboratory environment to validate the proposed method considering the high rise buildings the major results of this study can be summarized as follow 1 this study analyzed the effect of the high rise building on the rainfall runoff analysis the intercepted rainfall by the building wall can contribute to the increase of the runoff volume and peak flow but the longer flow path from the rooftop basin can decrease the peak flow overall the role of the building wall was found to be more significant resulting in increased runoff volume and peak flow 2 both the simulation study and the experimental study were conducted to evaluate the effect of the high rise building on the runoff both results i e the runoff hydrographs were very similar to each other which confirms the effect of the high rise building on the runoff additionally the experimental result could validate the rainfall runoff analysis method used in this study 3 it was confirmed that the contribution of the building wall to the peak flow was highly significant particularly when the wind speed was high for example when the mean wind speed was 1 11 m s the contribution of the building wall to the peak flow was 6 3 6 9 for the building height 1 0 m and 14 2 17 0 for the building height 1 4 m if considering higher buildings it becomes even higher based on cho et al 2020 if the ratio of the wall area to the rooftop area increases to 10 the amount of rainwater from the building wall can be larger than that from the rooftop even in the case where the wind speed is only around 1 m s 4 this study found that the accuracy of the rainfall runoff model can be improved by considering the building when the building was considered the rmse between the observed and simulated hydrograph decreased in all cases in some cases the rmse decreased by more than 50 and the difference of peak flow also decreased significantly as the building is considered the above results of this study confirm that in urban basins the contribution of the high rise building to the runoff can be significant however it should be mentioned that the experiment was conducted indoors so it was impossible to satisfy all the conditions mimicking the natural phenomena to conduct the more accurate experiment the rainfall nozzle should be located very high for the raindrops to reach the terminal velocity however the maximum height available in the lab was just 3 0 m that is the rainfall simulation may be assumed to be somewhat limited instead cho et al 2020 tried to prove the applicability of the empirical equation using the data collected from a building model located on the rooftop of engineering hall korea university located in seoul korea fortunately the result was very similar to that derived in the lab and as a result the authors could confirm that the empirical equation derived is valid in addition this study simulated the rainfall runoff processes using various empirical formulas in this study the empirical formulas worked well in the laboratory scale but it is true that the authors cannot guarantee their applicability to the real world to prove the applicability of those empirical equations it is necessary to analyze the observed data collected from the real basin the authors are currently conducting additional research to verify the methodology proposed in this study the authors also expect that the proposed empirical formula can be applied to real world with real buildings and real urban basins

4592,this study proposes a method to consider the high rise building in the rainfall runoff analysis of an urban basin this study uses a rainfall runoff model based on the shot noise process to evaluate the relative roles of the building rooftop sub basin and the wall sub basin in addition the rainfall runoff experiment is conducted in a laboratory environment to validate the proposed method considering high rise buildings the major results of this study can be summarized as follow 1 the rainfall intercepted by the building wall increases the runoff volume and peak flow but the longer flow path from the rooftop basin decreases the peak flow overall the role of the building wall is found to be more significant than the rooftop in resulting in increased runoff volume and peak flow 2 the experimental results also confirm the simulation results the contribution of the building wall to the peak flow is found to be highly significant especially when the wind speed is high for example when the mean wind speed is 1 11 m s the contribution of the building wall to the peak flow is found to be 6 3 6 9 and 14 2 17 0 for the 1 0 and 1 4 m building height respectively 3 the accuracy of the rainfall runoff model can be improved by considering the building as the building is considered the rmse and the difference of peak flow between the observed and simulated hydrograph decrease in all cases the results of this study support the idea that in the urban basin the contribution of the high rise building to runoff can be significant keywords high rise building rainfall runoff analysis rainfall runoff experiment shot noise process model 1 introduction urbanization is a common issue worldwide more than 50 of the world population lives in cities seto and shepherd 2009 douglas 2012 zhou et al 2015 phillis et al 2017 cleophas et al 2019 during the 20 year period 1990 2010 the urban area increased by more than 70 zhou et al 2015 liu et al 2018 the number of megacities with population of 10 million or greater is also expected to rise from 33 to 43 in the period 2018 to 2030 desa 2018 in those cities the numbers of so called high rise buildings e g 300 meter or higher tall buildings are also increasing safarik et al 2015 gabel and shehadi 2017 increased impervious area in the city increases the runoff volume as well as the runoff peak the peak time has also been shortening to increase flood risk liu et al 2005 nirupama and simonovic 2007 saghafian et al 2008 suriya and mudgal 2012 more and more city residents are threatened by the increased flood risk cançado et al 2008 tingsanchali 2012 the effect of urbanization on the rainfall runoff analysis has been one of the most important issues in hydrology hejazi and markus 2009 roy et al 2009 o driscoll et al 2010 du et al 2012 li et al 2013 chen et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2015 yao et al 2016 jung and kim 2017 niemi et al 2019 most of these studies have focused on urban flood although some studies have also raised the problems of decreased infiltration and dry stream roy et al 2009 o driscoll et al 2010 jung and kim 2017 in those analyses urbanization is considered simply by increasing the impervious area that is the impervious area is the sole and key factor used to consider urbanization models like illudas terstriep and stall 1974 swmm cole and shutt 1976 tr 55 usda 1985 hspf bicknell et al 1996 and storm wiles and levine 2002 have been used for this purpose however recent megacities are characterized by the high rise building these cities are totally different from conventional cities that are simply characterized by the urban area or impervious area megacities are three dimensional in reality while the conventional two dimensional cities are characterized by impervious area megacities should be characterized by additionally considering the high rise building that is the conventional two dimensional cities consider the change of infiltration to be important but the three dimensional megacities should additionally consider the rainfall interception by the high rise building in previous studies the interception on buildings was considered as a loss grimmond and oke 1991 lemonsu et al 2007 hamdi et al 2011 or buildings were regarded as a factor that slows the runoff schubert et al 2008 cea et al 2010 chan 2012 dottori and todini 2013 however in the three dimensional city the intercepted rainfall should be analyzed as an additional source of runoff the role of interception by the high rise building in an urban basin is similar to the role of high mountains in a natural basin both high rise buildings and high mountains have a major effect on the interception of rainfall that falls obliquely due to the wind it is difficult to find previous studies on the phenomenon that rainfall runoff characteristics are changed by high rise buildings on the other hand the authors could find several references of analyzing the effect of the high mountains for example hughes et al 2009 showed the role of the mountain specifically big pine mountain located in california is to make different runoff patterns on its coastal side and its inland side simply the mountain intercepts rainfall to make additional runoff on the coastal side a similar result can also be found in murphy et al 2017 who compared the runoff on the eastern and western sides of luquillo mountain in puerto rico the total amount of rainfall on the western side of luquillo mountain was found to be 46 higher than that on the eastern side the role of the high rise buildings in megacities can be assumed to be similar to those mountains it should also be mentioned that the high rise building changes and complicates the route of runoff the change is also dependent upon the shape of the building as well as the density of buildings in an urban area the raindrops that have reached the wall of a building roll down for a while and then free fall again to the ground the rainfall on the rooftop of a building is generally drained through the vertical pipe various studies have been done for the runoff on the wall of a building beijer and johansson 1977 hall and kalimeris 1982 blocken and carmeliet 2012 for example beijer and johansson 1977 simulated the runoff on the wall of a building using a simple rainfall runoff model hall and kalimeris 1982 calculated the runoff depth on the wall which was then used to estimate the flow velocity blocken and carmeliet 2012 numerically simulated the runoff on the wall to show that the flow itself is very similar to that in the open channel these studies confirm that the runoff does exist on the wall of a building which can also be considered in the rainfall runoff analysis in an urban basin the objective of this study is to consider the high rise buildings in the rainfall runoff analysis of an urban basin in particular the difference should be evaluated between the conventional two dimensional rainfall runoff analysis and the three dimensional analysis considering the high rise building the rainfall runoff analysis method in this study is basically simulation based and some additional experiments will also be conducted in a laboratory environment to validate the proposed method 2 distortion of the rainfall runoff process by high rise buildings 2 1 rainfall interception in general the amount of intercepted rainfall is regarded as being evaporated and does not contribute to the runoff during the short term of the rainfall runoff process on the other hand rainfall intercepted by a high rise building could reach the ground and contribute to the runoff therefore the intercepted rainfall in this case may not be assumed to be evaporated as in the conventional rainfall runoff analysis method cho et al 2020 proposed an empirical equation for estimating the amount of rainfall intercepted by a building wall the basic form of the empirical equation was determined by analyzing prior studies on the spatial distribution of wind driven rain wdr and a laboratory experiment was conducted to fit the proposed empirical equation in addition the empirical equation was validated by comparing its estimates with the in situ observation the empirical equation proposed by cho et al 2020 is as follows 1 q 0 161 b h u r h 0 88 where r h is the rainfall intensity observed at the ground mm h b is the width of the building wall m h is the height of the building wall m u is the wind speed m s and q is the amount of intercepted rainfall m2 mm h in this study the amount of intercepted rainfall was estimated using eq 1 which was then used as input data for the runoff analysis from the wall of a high rise building 2 2 three dimensional flow path consideration of the high rise building changes the flow path of runoff in the basin generally the flow path is considered over the two dimensional plane the flow length is estimated as the horizontal distance and the flow velocity is determined by considering the slope of the land surface in urban basins buildings are assumed to be simply a part of the impervious area the building s shape including the height and width is not considered in the flow path in some two dimensional rainfall runoff models the flow path on the land surface is determined by considering the barrier role of a building seyoum et al 2012 bisht et al 2016 leandro and martins 2016 huang and jin 2019 fig 1 shows the possible change of flow path due to high rise building fig 1 b shows the changed flow paths due to a high rise building over the two dimensional plane which are very different from the conventional one as shown in fig 1 a additionally the high rise building makes the flow path three dimensional fig 1 d the flow path cannot be two dimensional such as in the conventional model fig 1 c the vertical path is especially important in the case that the travel time from the rooftop of a building to the ground is relatively long in a small urban center with many high rise buildings this change will surely be concentrated in this case the flow path from the building wall to the ground can also be important 2 3 sub basin division the sub basin division is important to consider various areas with different characteristics in the runoff estimation in particular the high rise building itself can be divided into several sub basins fig 2 b shows an example of the sub basin division of a high rise building the conventional method of sub basin division is as in fig 2 a even in the case of considering a building as a barrier against surface runoff fig 2 b shows that the high rise building can be divided into one sub basin of the rooftop and four building walls the flow path from the rooftop of a building sub basin ① 1 includes the rooftop itself and the flow through the vertical drainage pipe the flow path from the building wall sub basins ① 2 ① 5 is composed of the surface flow on the building wall and the free fall again to the ground in particular when the wind is rather high the sub basins ① 2 ① 5 i e building walls are important if the wind speed is greater than 8 2 m s the intensity of wind driven rain on building walls can be higher than that on the rooftop of a building cho et al 2020 in this case the slope of wind driven rain becomes 45 determined by comparing the terminal velocity of a raindrop and the wind speed 3 rainfall runoff model and parameters 3 1 model this study uses the rainfall runoff model proposed by kang and yoo 2018 this rainfall runoff model is based on the concept of the shot noise process weiss 1977 the shot noise process was developed to model the noise from a diode or transistor this noise has the peak at the occurrence point and as time continues decays exponentially due to the characteristic feature of the noise it is called as a shot noise if many noises occur the resulting overall noise simply becomes the sum of each noise kang and yoo 2018 proposed the use of the shot noise process to model flood runoff in fact the shot noise process model has been used more to model the long term runoff rather than the flood this is because the sharp peak at the occurrence of the noise was assumed to be inappropriate to model flood runoff however the concept of the linear reservoir model which also produces a shot noise like response function has been frequently used in the modeling of the instantaneous unit hydrograph nash and hrs 1960 diskin et al 1973 singh 2004 sahoo et al 2006 as many shot noises or linear reservoirs are considered the characteristic feature of each shot noise naturally disappears another interesting feature of the shot noise process considered by kang and yoo 2018 is that the sum of each shot noise simply becomes the overall result that is different from other rainfall runoff models channel flood routing is not considered the runoff from any sub basin is considered as a single shot noise the shape of the shot noise can be different according to the sub basin characteristics channel characteristics to the exit of the basin and the rainfall input however each shot noise becomes independent from others as all of them flow to the exit of the basin each shot noise is simply added at the exit of the basin see fig 3 as this study assumes that the rooftop of a building as well as each building wall is an independent sub basin it is easy to evaluate the contribution of each sub basin to the total runoff at the exit of the basin the runoff at the exit of the basin due to a unit effective rainfall can be expressed as a sum of shot noises from all contributing sub basins 2 u t n p n e t t c n k n where n is the number of sub basins p n is the peak value of the runoff generated by the unit effective rainfall from each sub basin t c n is the travel time from the center of each sub basin to the exit of the basin and k n is the decay coefficient of the shot noise or the storage coefficient representing the entire flow path from the center of the sub basin to the exit of the basin in this study as the basin area is small the rainfall intensity is assumed to be the same all over the basin as a result the runoff hydrograph due to continuous rainfall can be derived as follows 3 o t i r i u t i i r i n p n e t i t c n k n where i represents the time of rainfall occurrence and r i represents the rainfall intensity the parameters of the rainfall runoff model are the peak value p n the travel time t c n and the decay coefficient k n of the shot noise representing each sub basin first the travel time t c n is determined as the sum of each travel time from the center of the basin to the exit of the basin the surface runoff of the sub basin and several open channel flows are considered to estimate the travel time in ungauged basins empirical equations are generally used to estimate the travel time the kirpich kirpich 1940 rziha rziha 1876 kraven i jsce 1999 kraven ii jsce 1999 and kerby kerby 1959 formulae are among those that are available for this purpose each formula was derived under certain specific conditions which should also be considered in its application if the observed data are available the travel time can be easily estimated the decay coefficient k n can be replaced by the storage coefficient this arises from the fact that the shot noise process is also the response of a linear reservoir basically the storage coefficient can be estimated by analyzing the observed data however in the case of ungauged basins the storage coefficient should also be estimated using some empirical equations the equations of clark 1945 linsley 1945 russell et al 1979 and sabol 1988 are among those frequently used finally the peak value p n is determined by considering the total runoff volume at each sub basin the total runoff volume volume at each sub basin can be easily estimated by applying the modified rational formula with the given runoff coefficient hua et al 2003 4 volume p n 0 e t k n d t 3 2 travel time and storage coefficient in a small urban basin the travel time of a raindrop even from the farthest point is not long it can take just a few minutes to reach the nearest manhole however if considering a high rise building the flow path can be longer and thus the travel time can also be longer obviously a longer travel time alleviates peak flow but the problem is that the high rise building has four walls and a rooftop to contribute to runoff how to consider these changes is of interest in this study estimation of the travel time is thus important in this study first the rainfall on the rooftop of a building reaches the ground via three different paths one is the flow on the rooftop to the inlet of the vertical drainage pipe next is the flow in the vertical drainage pipe and finally there is the flow on the ground from the exit of the vertical drainage pipe to the nearest manhole the travel time in the first and third paths may be estimated by the kraven ii formula or the kerby formula in particular the kerby formula is applied to a very small basin of less than 0 04 km2 so it is useful to estimate the travel time in a lab experiment soliman 2010 the kraven ii formula is also known to be valid for small basins the kerby and kraven ii formulae are as follow 5 t c 36 264 l n 0 467 s 0 2335 6 t c 16 667 l v where t c is the travel time min l is the flow length km n is the roughness coefficient s is the slope of the basin and v is the flow velocity m s in eq 6 for the slope less than 0 005 the flow velocity v 2 1 m s is applied and for the slope higher than 0 005 but less than 0 01 v 3 0 m s is applied for the slope higher than 0 01 v 3 5 m s is applied the travel time in a vertical drainage pipe can be estimated by wyly and eaton formula wyly and eaton 1961 their formula provides the mean falling velocity 7 v pipe 16 2 q d 0 4 where v pipe is the fall velocity m s in a vertical drainage pipe q is the flow rate m3 s and d is the diameter m of the pipe the flow rate is generally estimated by applying the rational formula ponce 1989 maidment 1993 bedient et al 2008 and the diameter of the pipe is assumed to be 0 2 m which is the maximum one available for the high rise building me 2015 the travel time of a raindrop rolling down the building wall was estimated using the experimental result by de vogelaere and pacco 2012 according to their study the mean velocity of a raindrop rolling on a similar wall to that in this experiment is 0 027 m s in fact this velocity is very slow to make the travel time so long in a tall building thus one more assumption should be introduced for application on the real urban basin which is that the raindrop becomes larger as it rolls down the wall and finally becomes detached from the wall to free fall the free fall velocity can be estimated by the equation proposed by ferro 2001 8 v free v max 1 e a n d where v free represents the mean free fall velocity m s v max is the maximum free fall velocity m s d is the diameter of a raindrop mm and a n is a parameter determined by considering the experimental conditions when the drop height of a raindrop is higher than 20 m then v max and a n are assumed to be 9 55 m s and 6 respectively the diameter of a raindrop used in this study was the median value representing the given rainfall intensity rziha 1876 the storage coefficient is more complicated to determine this is affected by the basin characteristics as well as the channel characteristics if some amount of rainfall runoff data are available it may be estimated in ungauged basins any given empirical formula if it is available must be relied on however it may be an exceptional situation for a reliable formula to be given on the other hand in this study the authors relied on the study of russell et al 1979 where the storage coefficient was assumed to be more or less the same as the concentration time i e the overall travel time to the exit of the basin for each sub basin kang and yoo 2018 also assumed the storage coefficient to be identical to the concentration time this assumption may not be strictly accurate but may be acceptable in the study of handling the rainfall runoff analysis in an urban basin 4 validation of rainfall runoff analysis in the experimental basin 4 1 experimental setting in general laboratory experiment had been conducted to analyze factors affecting rainfall runoff processes pappas et al 2008 shuster et al 2008 shuster and pappas 2011 isidoro et al 2012 isidoro and de lima 2014 leandro et al 2016 ferreira et al 2019 liu et al 2020 this study prepared an experimental basin with the rainfall nozzles and fans for the rainfall runoff experiment the experimental basin was slanted by 10 and a basin outlet was located in the lower right corner fig 4 a shows a schematic diagram of the experimental basin 10 nozzles diameter 0 5 mm were used to simulate rainfall and 12 fans to simulate wind there are two rows of five rain nozzles and the height of each row is 2 61 m and 2 71 m from the experimental basin simply the average height of all rainfall nozzles is 2 66 m in the case of 12 fans the average height is 1 80 m from the experimental basin in fig 4 a the building location indicates where the building model will be placed the width and length of the building were fixed in this experiment as 0 8 m but two different heights of the building 1 0 and 1 4 m were considered in addition the rainfall runoff experiment without any building was also conducted to evaluate the effect of the building fig 4 b and 4 c show schematic diagrams of building models with their heights 1 0 and 1 4 m respectively in this experiment the wind speed was controlled by adjusting the voltage of the power supply of the fan three different voltages i e 140 180 and 220 v were used for the fan the location of the wind speed measurement was done at the cross section 1 2 m apart in front of the fan the cross section was then divided into six columns and for each column the wind speed measurement was done at every 0 1 m interval from the bottom to the top 1 8 m the measurement was repeated several times to obtain the valid value fig 5 shows the vertical variation of the wind speed with respect to the input voltage obviously the distributions of the average wind speed are different depending on the input voltage the average wind speed was up to 1 83 m s at 140 v 2 05 m s at 180 v and 2 31 m s at 220 v table 1 summarizes the wind speed at the building height for each input voltage the cross sectional average of the wind speed for each voltage was then calculated to be 0 80 m s for 140 v 0 94 m s for 180 v and 1 11 m s for 220 v these cross sectional averages were similar regardless of the building height the rainfall intensity was controlled by changing the flow rate of the pump three flow rates i e 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 l min were considered in this experiment the rainfall intensity on the experimental basin was not evenly distributed so the representative rainfall intensity was determined as the mean of nine measurements over the experimental basin that is the experimental basin was divided into nine equal zones and the rainfall intensity was measured at the center of each zone the representative rainfall intensity was then determined to be their arithmetic average the measurements were repeated three times and finally their average was used as the rainfall condition in this study the authors found that the rainfall measurement method in this study was very similar to that of isidoro et al 2012 isidoro et al 2012 measured the rainfall intensity at every 0 3 m intervals over the 2 m 2 m experimental basin also isidoro et al 2012 repeated measurement three times to determine the rainfall condition table 2 summarizes the representative rainfall intensities determined with respect to various conditions table 2 shows that as the pump flow rate increases the rainfall intensity increases on the other hand as the wind speed increases the rainfall intensity decreases obviously as the wind speed increases a significant amount of raindrops fall outside of the experimental basin this is the reason why as the wind speed increases the rainfall intensity decreases when the pump flow rate was the highest i e 3 0 l min and the wind speed was the lowest i e 0 8 m s the average rainfall intensity was the highest at 37 7 mm h in contrast when the pump flow rate was the lowest i e 2 0 l min and the wind speed was the highest i e 1 11 m s the average rainfall intensity was the lowest at 21 4 mm h the rainfall runoff experiment using several buildings had been conducted in previous studies isidoro et al 2012 liu et al 2020 on the other hand in this study only one building is considered and experiments are conducted by changing the height of the building with various rainfall and wind speed conditions through these experiments this study evaluates the effect of the intercepted rainfall by a building model on the rainfall runoff process under various rainfall wind speed conditions in addition the authors try to show that the influence of the building which would be verified by the experiment can be theoretically simulated by the rainfall runoff model 4 2 rainfall runoff analysis 4 2 1 sub basin division and travel time fig 6 shows that the sub basin division was done by considering the rooftop and each wall of the building located at the center of the basin to compare the runoff results from the basin with and without the building the basin without the building was also divided into five sub basins fig 6 a with the building at the center of the basin the total number of sub basins was increased to be eight fig 6 b in this case the rooftop of the building sub basin ① 1 has a longer travel time than the sub basin ① as the raindrops on the rooftop should drain by rolling down the building wall also in this experiment not all four building walls contribute to the runoff depending on the wind direction just one or two walls contribute to the runoff this is also the same in the real world in this experiment just one building wall the sub basin ① 2 was considered in the runoff estimation table 3 summarizes the basic characteristics of each sub basin without the building the sub basin area varies from 0 32 to 1 20 m2 the flow length was determined separately for the inside and outside of the sub basin the flow length inside of the sub basin indicates the length from the farthest point to the exit of the sub basin also in additional to the slope 10 in the flow direction of the basin the slopes in the cross direction were all assigned to be 0 1 this slope in the cross direction was introduced to apply the empirical formulae to estimate the travel time the area and flow length of the sub basin ① 1 are the same as those of the sub basin ① but the slope inside of the sub basin ① 1 is assumed to be 0 1 the flow length outside of the sub basin ① 1 additionally includes the height of the building the area of the sub basin ① 2 varies according to the height of the building the flow length within the sub basin is the same as the building height and the flow length outside of the sub basin becomes 1 4 m in the cross direction and 1 2 m in the flow direction the formulae by kerby 1959 and de vogelaere and pacco 2012 were used in this study to estimate the travel time the formula by kerby 1959 was used to estimate the travel time on the rooftop of the building and that on the land surface the roughness coefficient required to apply the kerby formula was assumed to be 0 01 for the wood rooftop and wall of the building and 0 009 for the acrylic basin surface the travel time on the building wall was estimated by applying the experimental result of de vogelaere and pacco 2012 based on de vogelaere and pacco 2012 the flow velocity of a raindrop rolling down the building wall is about 0 027 m s the travel time in the building wall was thus estimated simply by dividing the building height by this flow velocity in reality the raindrops that reach the rooftop of a building are collected and drained by vertical pipes but in this experiment they are drained simply by rolling down the building wall table 4 summarizes the travel time estimated for each sub basin in fig 5 a and 5 b both inside and outside the sub basin were considered to estimate the travel time as the slope in the cross direction was assumed to be small the travel time was estimated longer if the travel path included a rather long portion in the cross direction as can be found in table 4 the travel time for the sub basins ② ⑤ remained the same in both cases of with or without the building at the center of the basin however the sub basin ① in fig 6 a was divided into two sub basins ① 1 and ① 2 as a building was introduced such as in fig 6 b as the wind direction in this experiment was fixed to be perpendicular to the building wall in this case only one building wall ① 2 was considered the travel time of sub basin ① 1 is very different from that of sub basin ① one reason is that the building wall is additionally considered in its estimation and the second reason is that the slope of the rooftop of the building is assumed to be much milder than that of the basin surface the decay coefficient of all the basin was assumed to be the same as its travel time this assumption is based on russell et al 1979 in which the travel time and storage coefficient in an urban basin can be assumed to be identical 4 2 2 evaluation of impulse response functions fig 7 a and b compare the impulse response functions measured at the exit of each sub basin while fig 7 c and d do the same but are measured at the exit of the entire basin fig 7 b and d contain more graphs as the number of sub basins are increased as the building is additionally considered as the building is introduced a sub basin is replaced by two a rooftop sub basin of the building and another sub basin representing the building wall in fact these two constitute the difference between the two cases of with and without the building as a result of this difference the resulting impulse response function solid line in fig 7 d shows a slightly higher peak than that in fig 7 c without the building this is mainly due to the contribution from the building wall sub basin on the other hand as the travel time significantly increases the rooftop sub basin instead of the corresponding ground one decreases the peak flow 4 2 3 determination of experiment time the rainfall duration in the experiment was determined to confirm the occurrence of peak flow two different wind speeds of 0 80 and 1 11 m s and three rainfall intensities were considered in this experiment with the building of width 0 8 m and height 1 4 m fig 8 shows the observed runoff for 20 min in those experimental settings additionally the same condition was applied for the rainfall runoff simulation whose result is also compared in the same figure this figure shows that the peak flow occurred at around 300 s in the experiment on the other hand the peak time in the rainfall runoff simulation was found to be a bit retarded compared with that of the experiment this difference might be due to the rather long travel time on the building wall in the rainfall runoff simulation the simulation result shows that the peak flow occurred at about 800 s based on these experimental and simulation results this study determined the rainfall duration to be 1 200 s the runoff measurement was extended by an additional 600 s to see the behavior of the hydrograph in the falling limb the simulation was also done for the same condition 4 2 4 sensitivity analysis of the simulation results in this study the authors conducted the sensitivity analysis of simulation results on peak value and travel time the peak value of the shot noise is related to the peak flow of the hydrograph and the travel time is related to the peak time and the recession curve the peak value can be estimated by using the results of the modified rational formula in which the key parameter is the runoff coefficient in the experimental basin in this study infiltration does not occur and all rainfall contributes to the runoff therefore the peak value was estimated assuming that the runoff coefficient of the basin is 1 0 to analyze the sensitivity on the peak value this study simulated the hydrograph by changing the runoff coefficients to 0 80 0 85 0 90 0 95 and 1 00 while other parameters are fixed to analyze the sensitivity on the travel time the hydrograph was simulated by changing the average of the travel time to 50 sec 70 sec 90 sec 110 sec and 130 sec in this analysis the height of the building model was fixed to 1 4 m figs 9 10 show the simulation results with various runoff coefficients and the average of the travel time figs 9 10 shows the influence of the peak value of the shot noise and travel time on the simulation results in fig 9 as the runoff coefficient increases the peak of the hydrograph also increases when the runoff coefficient is 1 00 the peak flow is 1 25 times bigger than that with the runoff coefficient of 0 80 in fig 10 the peak time increases as the average of the travel time increases when the average of the travel time was 130 sec the peak time was increased by 2 32 times on average compared to that with the average of the travel time of 50 sec through the sensitivity analysis the authors were able to confirm the effect of peak value and travel time on the simulation results in this study 4 3 comparison of the simulation and experimental results in the rainfall runoff simulation considering the building located at the center of the basin it was required to add the wdr on the building wall this study used the empirical equation by cho et al 2020 i e eq 1 in section 2 which is in fact the equation to estimate the amount of rainfall intercepted by a building the amount of rainfall interception was then converted into the rainfall intensity over the building wall to be used as input of the rainfall runoff model for example under the condition of the wind speed 1 62 m s and rainfall intensity on the basin surface 27 2 mm h the rainfall amount intercepted by the building wall with its height 1 4 m and width 0 8 m comprises up to 27 4 of the rainfall amount collected over the rooftop of the building fig 11 compares the runoff results based on the experiment and simulation all the symbols represent the experimental results the circle represents the experimental results for the building height 1 4 m the triangle for the building height 1 0 m and the square with no building in the basin the solid lines represent the simulation results the darkest one for the building height 1 4 m and the lightest one with no building in the basin basically the experimental results matched the simulation results well the overall shape was the same and the peak flows were also very similar to each other however in the simulation of the cases the peak time was found to be slightly retarded especially when considering the building at the center of the basin this problem was also noticed in the pre experiment for determining the rainfall duration for the experiment this difference indicates a possible overestimation of the travel time in the building wall however the difference between the cases with and without the building at the center of the basin was clearly evident the difference between the cases with different building heights even though it was smaller than that between the cases with and without the building could also be clearly observed as a result the effect of the building wall on the runoff could be confirmed in this experiment in particular the contribution of the building wall to the peak flow was found to be highly significant especially when the wind speed was high for example when the mean wind speed was 0 80 m s the contribution of the building wall on the peak flow was 2 9 3 9 for the building height 1 0 m and 4 7 5 2 for the building height 1 4 m it became even higher when the mean wind speed was 1 11 m s to become 6 3 6 9 for the building height 1 0 m and 14 2 17 0 for the building height 1 4 m if considering higher buildings the contribution from the wall could be much higher than that from the rooftop of the building cho et al 2020 estimated the amount of rainwater that could possibly be collected from the building wall according to the ratio of the wall area to the rooftop area based on their study when the ratio of the wall area to the rooftop area is one the rainwater collected from the building wall can be greater than 50 of the rainwater collected from the rooftop under wind speed higher than 4 m s furthermore the amount of rainwater from the building wall can be greater than that from the rooftop if the ratio of the wall area to the rooftop area increases to 10 even in the case where the wind speed is only around 1 m s in addition the authors investigated how the rmse and the difference between the peak flows changed in the case of considering the building the observed hydrograph used in the analysis is the result of considering the building and the simulated hydrographs are the results with and without considering the building table 5 shows the rmse and table 6 shows the difference between peak flows table 5 shows that the accuracy of the rainfall runoff model can be improved as the building is considered in all cases the rmse between the observed and simulated hydrograph decreased as the building was considered in some cases the rmse decreased by more than 50 as the building was considered table 6 also shows that the difference of peak flow decreases significantly as the building is considered 5 conclusions this study proposed the rainfall runoff analysis method considering the high rise building in an urban basin the high rise building changes the role of rainfall interception and complicates the flow path of the runoff the rooftop and wall of the building were assumed to be independent sub basins to analyze the effect of high rise buildings the rainfall runoff model based on the shot noise process was applied to consider the building rooftop sub basin and the wall sub basin independently in addition the rainfall runoff experiment was conducted in a laboratory environment to validate the proposed method considering the high rise buildings the major results of this study can be summarized as follow 1 this study analyzed the effect of the high rise building on the rainfall runoff analysis the intercepted rainfall by the building wall can contribute to the increase of the runoff volume and peak flow but the longer flow path from the rooftop basin can decrease the peak flow overall the role of the building wall was found to be more significant resulting in increased runoff volume and peak flow 2 both the simulation study and the experimental study were conducted to evaluate the effect of the high rise building on the runoff both results i e the runoff hydrographs were very similar to each other which confirms the effect of the high rise building on the runoff additionally the experimental result could validate the rainfall runoff analysis method used in this study 3 it was confirmed that the contribution of the building wall to the peak flow was highly significant particularly when the wind speed was high for example when the mean wind speed was 1 11 m s the contribution of the building wall to the peak flow was 6 3 6 9 for the building height 1 0 m and 14 2 17 0 for the building height 1 4 m if considering higher buildings it becomes even higher based on cho et al 2020 if the ratio of the wall area to the rooftop area increases to 10 the amount of rainwater from the building wall can be larger than that from the rooftop even in the case where the wind speed is only around 1 m s 4 this study found that the accuracy of the rainfall runoff model can be improved by considering the building when the building was considered the rmse between the observed and simulated hydrograph decreased in all cases in some cases the rmse decreased by more than 50 and the difference of peak flow also decreased significantly as the building is considered the above results of this study confirm that in urban basins the contribution of the high rise building to the runoff can be significant however it should be mentioned that the experiment was conducted indoors so it was impossible to satisfy all the conditions mimicking the natural phenomena to conduct the more accurate experiment the rainfall nozzle should be located very high for the raindrops to reach the terminal velocity however the maximum height available in the lab was just 3 0 m that is the rainfall simulation may be assumed to be somewhat limited instead cho et al 2020 tried to prove the applicability of the empirical equation using the data collected from a building model located on the rooftop of engineering hall korea university located in seoul korea fortunately the result was very similar to that derived in the lab and as a result the authors could confirm that the empirical equation derived is valid in addition this study simulated the rainfall runoff processes using various empirical formulas in this study the empirical formulas worked well in the laboratory scale but it is true that the authors cannot guarantee their applicability to the real world to prove the applicability of those empirical equations it is necessary to analyze the observed data collected from the real basin the authors are currently conducting additional research to verify the methodology proposed in this study the authors also expect that the proposed empirical formula can be applied to real world with real buildings and real urban basins

conductivity σ the ability of a soil to conduct electrical current is a key parameter in soil science and related fields such as reservoir engineering and petrophysics soil electrical conductivity has been widely used in monitoring water deficit measuring soil salinity mapping electrical resistivity tomography and estimating hydraulic conductivity profiles brunet et al 2010 moret fernández et al 2012 vereecken et al 2014 xu et al 2019 kaleris and ziogas 2020 fu et al 2021 there are many factors that affect σ including soil porosity ϕ water content θ structure particle shape and orientation particle size distribution mineralogy and temperature rhoades et al 1989 revil and glover 1998 friedman and robinson 2002 friedman 2005 samouelian et al 2005 brillante et al 2014 one of the main pathways of electrical conduction in variably saturated soils is via electrolyte solutions thus θ is a dominant factor in determining soil σ robinson et al 2008 archie 1942 presented a power law formula that described the relationship between σ and degree of saturation s waxman and smits 1968 further extended archie s power law to account for the surface conduction in the electrical double layer near clay minerals gupta and hanks 1972 established a linear relationship between σ and θ based on data from two loamy soils rhoades et al 1976 proposed a parabolic σ θ function by assuming that bulk σ was resulted mainly from two parallel pathways electrolytic water pathway and interfacial pathway later this empirical model was extended to account for mobile continuous and immobile and discontinuous aqueous phases and allowed for different parallel and series pathways in the solid liquid pathway rhoades et al 1989 alternatively glover et al 2000 introduced a mixing model that extended the archie s equation for rocks with conducting matrix which had two conducting phases solid and liquid and each phase had a phase exponent related to its degree of connectedness the σ values can also be related to the electrical formation factor f introduced by archie 1942 which represents an approximate representation of the true geometrical configuration of porous rocks ghanbarian et al 2014 nadler 1982 noted that the relationship between f and θ resembled the shape of the water retention curve one of the commonly used semi empirical σ models is the mualem and friedman 1991 model which is built on the hypothesis that the tortuosity factor for bulk σ is identical to that for hydraulic conductivity in recent years the number of theoretical approaches for modeling the electrical conductivity of complex porous media has increased dramatically particularly as new theories e g percolation theory critical path analysis effective medium approximation become available hunt 2004 sahimi 2011 ghanbarian et al 2014 nonetheless a universal σ θ model that relies on easily attainable soil parameters has not yet been developed the objective of this study is to develop a general form of archie s model to estimate the bulk soil σ from θ and other basic soil properties i e soil porosity and sand silt and clay contents the new model is calibrated with measured σ θ datasets obtained from a variety of soils and is then validated using σ θ datasets obtained from independent soils 2 development of the general form of archie s model there are three mechanisms that dominate electrical conduction in soils ionic conduction through the continuous liquid phase electronic conduction in the dispersed solid phase and surface conduction at the solid liquid phase urish 1981 knight and endres 2005 ionic conduction is the movement of charged ions in the pores which is affected by the concentration charge and mobility of the ions electronic conduction involves the movement of electrons through interfacial pathways between solid particles and its magnitude depends on atomic structure surface conduction is associated with the ionic migration in the electrical double layer at the solid water interface because of excessive charges at the interface electrostatic attraction causes counterions to migrate in the porewater to the interface resulting in an increase in ion density at the grain surface some soil minerals e g pyrite magnetite and clays conduct current through electronic conduction however conducting minerals rarely exist in sufficient quantity to have considerable effect on the electrical properties of soils in the case of massive sulfides and graphite in soils the bulk electrical conductivity is entirely due to electronic conduction in the solid phase ionic electrolytic conduction is mainly responsible for the bulk electrical conduction in soils with an insulating solid phases and small surface areas surface conduction which is important in soils with high clay contents can be the dominant conduction mechanism in soils having fresh water or large surface areas 2 1 the rhoades model for a soil made of nonconductive solid particles rhoades et al 1976 treated the bulk electrical conduction in soils as having two parallel pathways one path for conductance via the soil solution and the other path via the solid liquid interface 1 σ σ water θ t σ s where σwater is the electrical conductivity of soil water and σs is referred to as bulk surface conductivity that is associated primarily with exchangeable cations adsorbed on clay minerals the variable t is a transmission factor that accounts for the impedance of current flow through soil water within the void space and any decrease in the mobility of ions near the solid liquid interface t 1 is equivalent to the ratio of straight line length l to path length for electrical current l e which is the reciprocal of the electrical conductivity tortuosity factor l e l rhoades et al 1976 1989 it can be expressed as 2 t a θ b where parameters a and b vary among soils and are obtained by fitting the model to observed values linear relationships between t and θ were also reported by others gupta and hanks 1972 mojid et al 2007 thus the rhoades model becomes 3 σ a σ water θ 2 b σ water θ σ s 2 2 ewing and hunt model archie s law is one of the earliest and most widely used models relating σ and ϕ archie s law is expressed as archie 1942 4 σ σ water ϕ m where m is a shape cementation exponent relating to the connectivity of the conducting water phase archie s law is limited to the scenario where water is the only conducting phase that occupies the pore space archie s second law has broader applications in unsaturated porous media 5 σ c 1 σ water s l ϕ m where c 1 as well as c 2 c 3 and c 4 in eqs 6 8 is a unitless empirical constant the saturation exponent l is commonly assumed to have a value of about 2 for both consolidated and unconsolidated sands glover 2017 by using the theory of continuum percolation ewing and hunt 2006 recast archie s second law as 6 σ c 2 σ water θ θ c μ where θc is the critical water content for percolation at which continuous pathways are just connected and μ is an exponent from the continuum percolation theory to adopt the ewing and hunt 2006 model for a limiting condition lim θ ϕ 1 σ σ water eq 6 becomes 7 σ c 3 σ water θ θ c μ 1 θ c μ following the assumption of rhoades et al 1976 that surface and liquid phases conduct electricity in parallel a bulk surface conduction term σs is added to eq 7 8 σ c 4 σ water θ θ c μ 1 θ c μ σ s it is noteworthy that in a porous medium with non negligible surface conduction eq 8 the critical water content for percolation θc should be set to equal to 0 ewing and hunt 2006 ghanbarian et al 2015 2 3 the general form of archie s model for soil electrical conductivity neither the first form nor the second form of archie s law accounts for surface conduction which can be significant in porous media containing large amounts of clay particles sen et al 1988 revil et al 1998 even if the effects of surface conduction are included archie s law fails if there are two or more conducting phases in rocks glover 2010 modified archie s law to account for n conducting phases in rocks 9 σ σ 1 f 1 m 1 σ 2 f 2 m 2 σ 3 f 3 m 3 σ n f n m n g σ i σ j θ ij where σi and f i are the electrical conductivity and volume fraction of the ith phase respectively m i is the exponent of the ith phase which relates to degree of connectedness of the phase g σi σj θij is known as the sum of the stieltjes integrals that represents the interactions between each pair of phases ith phase and jth phase and θij represents the resonance density functions that depend on the topology glover et al 2000 similarly a generalized form of archie s law for soil σ which accounts for the contributions of solids water and air is expressed in the following form 10 σ σ solid 1 ϕ s σ water θ w σ air ϕ θ a g σ i σ j θ ij where σsolid and σair are the electrical conductivity of soil solids grain scale and air respectively s w and a are the phase exponents of solid water and air respectively considering that air is an excellent insulator the third and fourth terms in eq 10 associated with the air phase can be eliminated thus eq 10 reduces to 11 σ σ solid 1 ϕ s σ water θ w g σ solid σ water θ sw where g σsolid σw θsw represents the interaction between the solid and water phases it should be noted that in the modified archie s law introduced by glover 2000 and glover 2010 the stieltjes integrals are assumed to be negligible as a first order simplification in addition both the surface conduction and electronic conduction are accounted for in the first term of eq 11 because the conduction pathways taken for the surface conduction are the same as those through the soil solids glover et al 2000 however this may lead to significant errors when the generalized archie s law is applied to clay soils where surface conduction is the dominant conduction mechanism but the geometric distribution of surface of pore space is likely to be different from that of the solid phase therefore the stieltjes integral is kept in eq 11 to represent the surface conduction pathway in soils surface conduction involves the movement of charge in the electrical double layer i e stern layer and diffuse layer which forms at the interface between water and soil solids surface conduction is dependent on the saturation vinegar and waxman 1984 revil 2013a 2013b as soil dries the thickness of the surface films decreases and most clay particles do not remain in electrical contact with one another through their diffuse double layer and hence do not form any conductive path through the soil but remain as isolated groups of charge it also has been found that the type of clay mineralogy influences the magnitude of surface conduction revil et al 1998 not only can there be high clay contents in soils but in soils with fresh water pore conductivity in the range of 0 08 1 0 s m 1 even with very low clay content surface conduction can be the dominant form of electrical conduction revil et al 2014 several theoretical and or empirical models have been proposed for porous media containing clay and exhibiting high surface conductivity sen et al 1988 revil et al 1998 klein and santamarina 2003 choo and burns 2014 among these the waxman and smits 1968 model is frequently used for the interpretation of σ considering surface conduction 12 σ s γ f σ water σ surface s where γ is a saturation exponent and σsurface is the electrical conductivity of solid surfaces associated with counter ions in the electrical double layer note that σs used in earlier equations represents the bulk surface conduction and σsolid is the electrical conductivity of soil solids the electrical formation factor f is defined by bussian 1983 13 f lim σ surface 0 σ water σ sat ϕ m where σsat is the saturated electrical conductivity and m is the cementation factor in the waxman and smits model unifying the ionic conduction in eqs 11 and 12 yields 14 θ γ ϕ m γ θ w therefore the surface conduction from the waxman and smits model can be given by 15 θ ϕ γ 1 ϕ m σ surface θ w 1 ϕσ surface incorporating the surface conduction from the waxman and smits model eq 15 into eq 11 yields 16 σ σ solid 1 ϕ s σ water θ w θ w 1 ϕσ surface at either saturation or dry condition eq 16 can be simplified the σsat and σ of soil at the dry condition σdry can be obtained from 17 σ sat σ solid 1 ϕ s σ water σ surface ϕ w 18 σ dry σ solid 1 ϕ s this leads to the following equation involving w ϕ and σ 19 ϕ w σ sat σ dry σ water σ surface therefore 20 σ water σ sat σ dry ϕ w σ surface additionally σsurface is related to cation exchange capacity and thus to clay content waxman and smits 1968 rhoades et al 1989 based on the results from 13 soils with a wide range of texture clay content ranging from 0 to 36 and bulk density varies from 1 22 to 1 56 g cm 3 doussan and ruy 2009 proposed an empirical equation to estimate σsurface ds m 1 from sand silt and clay content 21 σ surface d f clay f sand f silt e where f sand f silt and f clay are the fractions of sand silt and clay in a soil respectively and d and e are fitted constants d 6 539 e 0 183 thus eq 16 can be rewritten as 22 σ σ dry σ sat σ dry ϕ w d f c l a y f s a n d f s i l t e θ w d f clay f sand f silt e ϕθ w 1 eq 22 is the generalized form of archie s model for estimating soil σ from θ porosity and sand silt and clay contents the new model has three parameters i e σsat σdry and w parameters σsat and σdry can be obtained from direct σ measurements at saturated and dry conditions therefore the general form of archie s model is left with only one unknown parameter w which makes it simpler and easier to use than the rhoades model and the ewing and hunt model 3 materials and methods 3 1 calibration dataset we made measurements on six soils soils 1 6 and obtained literature data for nine soils soils 7 15 for model calibration the soils have wide ranges of texture and bulk density table 1 laboratory measurements of σ and θ were performed on soils 1 6 at room temperature 25 1 c the soil samples were air dried ground and sieved through a 2 mm screen for soils 1 3 various soil water contents were obtained by adding known amounts of water to the samples and mixing thoroughly the moist soil was packed into a column 50 2 mm inner diameter and 50 2 mm high at a desired ρb before making measurements the packed soil samples were sealed and placed in a constant temperature room for at least 24 h to ensure thermal equilibration between water soil and the environment for the sandy loam and silty soils we followed the same procedures of horton et al 1982 to establish uniform water distributions in the high water content samples i e 0 25 and 0 30 cm3 cm 3 those soil samples were initially packed with water content of 0 10 cm3 cm 3 then the top end was covered with gauze and sealed a desired amount of additional water was added to each column the packed columns were covered with plastic wrap and heated in a 700 w microwave oven to enhance water movement in order to obtain uniform distributions after heating the soil columns in the microwave oven the columns were allowed to cool to room temperature then a thermo time domain reflectometry thermo tdr sensor was inserted into each column obtain σ measurements from tdr waveforms details about thermo tdr sensors have been provided by lu et al 2017 and the procedures for calculating σ from tdr waveforms are described in heimovaara et al 1995 and ren et al 1999 for soils 4 6 soil water contents from saturation to drier conditions were achieved by desorption the soil cores were placed on a tension table 08 01 sandbox eijkelkamp zeitz germany and slowly saturated with tap water from the bottom thermo tdr sensors were inserted vertically into the samples from the top to determine σ and θ water was drained from the soil samples stepwise from complete saturation to matric potentials of 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 80 100 cm sequentially after hydraulic equilibrium at each matric potential was achieved σ and θ were measured three times the pressure plate extractor method dane and hopmans 2002 was used to achieve θ values at matric potential of 50 100 500 1000 and 1500 kpa an additional measurement at 30 kpa was included for soil 6 to obtain σ and θ data corresponding to these conditions we packed the soil columns at selected θ values corresponding to target θ values based on the pressure plate measurements thermo tdr sensors were used to determine σ and θ with three repetitions we also obtained σ and θ data for nine soils from the literature three soils soils 7 9 were from tokoro et al 2016 in which σ data were collected with the four electrode technique for soils 10 12 σ and the corresponding θ data were obtained with a pair of electrodes embedded in soil samples on a tension table or in a pressure chamber for a range of matric potential values from 0 to 1471 kpa doussan and ruy 2009 the data for soils 13 15 were from hailemariam et al 2017 where σ was measured with an open ended coaxial line technique soils 7 9 and 13 15 were incrementally wetted from air dry to saturation by adding pre determined amounts of distilled water 3 2 validation dataset for model verification we used σ data for six soils i e soils 16 21 table 2 soil 16 is a fine silt loam rhoades et al 1976 intact core samples were collected in cylinders 39 mm high and 75 mm in diameter and electrodes were inserted into the soil columns to measure σ the samples were first leached with nacl and cacl2 solutions at a concentration of 0 8 mol l 1 and then were leached with four additional concentrations with σwater ranging from 2 5 ds m 1 to 56 2 ds m 1 a pressure plate apparatus was used to establish θ values at selected values of matric potential between 0 and 500 kpa at each matric potential the corresponding θ and σ values were determined rhoades et al 1976 soil 17 is a clay loam from ren et al 1999 in which σ was measured on repacked soil columns at various θ and bulk density values prior to packing the soil was air dried ground sieved through a 2 mm screen and wetted to a selected θ value with either distilled water or nacl solutions of five different σwater values the wet soil sample was mixed thoroughly and packed into cylinders 60 mm high and 52 mm inner diameter the packed columns were then tightly covered and placed in a constant temperature 20 c room for 48 h before determining σ and θ simultaneously with the thermo tdr sensor ren et al 1999 tuli and hopmans 2004 measured σ of a sand soil soil 18 as a function of θ and ρb soil samples were uniformly packed into brass columns 60 mm high and 82 5 mm inner diameter soaked in cacl2 solution with σwater ranging from 0 3 to 2 5 ds m 1 upon saturation various water contents were achieved following the multistep outflow method tuli et al 2001 the soil samples were allowed to equilibrate with the applied pressure and σ values were determined by using the tdr method the data for soil 19 were obtained from kizito et al 2008 the disturbed sandy loam samples were mixed with water or kcl solutions 6 concentrations and packed into plexiglass columns 30 mm tall and 80 mm in diameter at a bulk density of 1 33 g cm 3 and various water contents the σ measurements were made with the ech2o te sensor decagon devices inc pullman wa soil 20 callovo oxfordian clay rock was sampled from the bure test site meuse haute marne france the core samples were drilled with a nacl saturated mud and then packed in 200 mm length cylinders a series of water contents were achieved by using an automated humidity system likos and lu 2003 the σ measurements were made at different saturations using the equipment developed at the central laboratory for electronics based on the four electrode theory jougnot et al 2010 the data for soil 21 were obtained from amente et al 2000 soil samples were packed in cylinders of 77 5 mm inner diameter and 150 mm high then kcl solution was added at the column top to obtain a total of six different levels of σwater ranging from 1 ds m 1 to 5 6 ds m 1 various θ values were obtained by a step wise increase of pressure to the soil columns and σ and θ were determined with a two wire tdr probe 3 3 statistical analysis the performance of the general form of archie s model was evaluated with root mean square error rmse relative error re

data points p is the number of model parameters and σestimated and σmeasured are the model estimates and measured values respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 model parameters the general form of archie s model eq 22 was compared to the rhoades model eq 3 and the ewing and hunt model eq 8 using measured σ θ data on soils 1 15 each model was fitted to the measured soil σ θ data of soils 1 15 in order to calibrate the model parameters overall the slopes of regression lines were nearly equal to one and the intercepts were close to zero indicating that all three models were well fitted to the measured values fig 1 the parameters of the rhoades et al 1976 model and the ewing and hunt 2006 model varied considerably among soil types rhoades et al 1976 obtained a value of 2 1 for a and a value of 0 245 for b on clay soils but a ranged from 1 3 to 1 4 and b ranged from 0 11 to 0 06 on three loam soils in the ewing and hunt 2006 study c 4 ranged from 1 07 to 2 73 and θc varied from 0 to 0 07 cm3 cm 3 on 14 soils in this study parameters a b and c 4 ranged from 1 2 to 78 1 0 1 to 150 6 and 0 26 to 4 20 respectively on the 15 soils as for the conductivity exponent μ a value of 2 was normally used for three dimensional systems but non universality of this μ value had been reported feng et al 1987 for example an exponent of 1 88 was given for cases where the conductivities of solid and liquid phases were similar hunt 2004 this agreed with our fitted values that μ had a wide range between 0 70 and 4 70 for soils 1 15 4 2 liquid phase exponent w in the generalized archie type model eq 22 w is the exponent of the water phase that relates to the connectedness among soil pores which can take any value from unity to infinity glover 2010 in general a large w value indicates low water phase connectedness a value of unity represents a pore system composed of a bundle of capillary tubes that cross the soil pore space in a straight line and a value of approximately 2 represents the degree of connectedness that is associated with the pore network in sandstone we obtained the values of parameter w by fitting eq 22 to the σ and θ data of soils 1 15 by using the least squares method fig 2 except for soil 10 that had a w value of 4 2 the w values of the other soils fell in the range between 1 3 and 2 5 the large w value for soil 10 was caused by the fact that it was an aggregated soil with bimodal pore size distribution see fig 4 of doussan and ruy 2009 for soils with bimodal pore size distribution both intra and inter aggregate pores contribute to the bulk σ friedman 2005 which led to large w values because most of the w values were distributed between 1 3 and 2 5 we chose to use the mean value to represent the general situation the mean value of w in fig 2 was 1 98 when soil 10 was excluded and was 2 06 when soil 10 was included thus we set w at a constant value of 2 and eq 22 was simplified to 26 σ σ dry σ sat σ dry ϕ 2 0 654 f clay f sand f silt 0 018 θ 2 0 654 f clay f sand f silt 0 018 ϕθ the above σ θ relationship is a second degree polynomial function which is comparable to the rhoades model with an exponential constant of 2 for θ and the ewing and hunt model with a μ value of 2 although the coefficients of the three models have different meanings this is no coincidence because the phenomenology may indicate a universal dependence of σ on θ the parameters in the rhoades model are empirical and have no physical meaning for the ewing and hunt model in contrast c gives the medium s tortuosity at saturation and θc represents the critical volume for percolation the variables in eq 26 include basic soil properties i e sand silt and clay contents and porosity and σ values at saturated σsat and dry σdry conditions fig 3 shows the contribution of each phase to the bulk σ in eq 26 for two representative soils a sand with 90 sand 5 silt and 5 clay and a clay loam with 40 sand 30 silt and 30 clay with increasing θ the contributions of both ionic conduction σpore the second term in eq 26 and surface conduction σs the third term in eq 26 were increased while that of electronic conduction σdry the first term in eq 26 remained unchanged in addition for the sandy soil σpore made the dominant contribution whereas both σs as well as σpore had important roles for the bulk σ of the clay loam soil 4 3 performance of the general form of archie s model in the previous section we developed a general form of the archie s model eq 26 that was capable of estimating σ from θ σsat σdry ϕ and sand silt and clay contents in this section we examine the performance of the general form of archie s model on soils 16 21 fig 4 presents the model σ estimates versus measured σ values as a function of θ except for soil 17 at bulk electrical conductivity values greater than 10 2 ds m 1 the estimated σ values agreed well with the measured σ values indicating that the general form of archie s model was able to provide accurate σ estimates as a function of θ error analysis showed that the rmse values ranged from 0 008 to 0 399 ds m 1 and the re varied from 0 7 to 29 8 table 3 the coefficients of determination r2 for all six soils were greater than 0 93 for soil 17 the general form of archie s model overestimated σ at θ 0 2 cm3 cm 3 and underestimated σ at θ greater than 0 2 cm3 cm 3 the measured σ θ values of soil 17 showed a pronounced decrease in the slope of the σ θ curve when θ was between 0 2 and 0 3 cm3 cm 3 this might be due to the two different regions of the σ θ relationship keller and frischnecht 1966 split the σ θ curve into two regions that were divided by a critical water content θcr at which a continuous film of water was formed over all of the soil particle surfaces they suggested a saturation exponent of 4 5 for the low θ range i e θ θcr and a value of 2 for the high θ range for clay soils θcr was relatively large because of the large surface area of clay particles thus such a phenomenon slope of the σ θ curve decreased at large θ values was manifested in soil 17 fig 5 compares measured σ values to model estimated values for soils 16 21 generally the plotted points in the figure distributed randomly along the 1 1 line with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 96 an average rmse of 0 311 ds m 1 and an average bias of 0 074 ds m 1 thus the general form of archie s model provided reliable σ estimations on these soils compared to the rhoades model and the ewing and hunt model the general form of archie s model eq 26 has several advantages first the rhoades model requires three parameters σwater a and b and the ewing and hunt model needs four parameters c 4 σwater θc and μ to apply the rhoades model and the ewing and hunt model under different conditions soil specific calibration is required to determine these parameters for the general form of archie s model a value of 2 is selected for the parameter w and σdry and σsat can be measured directly in the lab in addition σwater is no longer an input parameter σwater can be estimated with eq 20 in the general form of archie s model which eliminates the need to determine σ of extract solutions from soil samples finally in both the rhoades model and the ewing and hunt model the surface conduction σs is treated as a variable independent of θ and the contribution of matrix conductivity to bulk σ is ignored there are reports that σs varies with θ rhoades et al 1989 amente et al 2000 thus the general form of archie s model has the advantages of being simple and easy to use in practice 5 conclusion in this study we developed a general form of archie s model to estimate σ from easily measured soil properties including σsat σdry soil porosity and sand silt and clay contents we used σ θ values from 15 soils to obtain the model parameter w for each soil and an average w value of 2 was determined the new σ θ model provided accurate estimates of σ on six independent soils with a range of textures and a range of electrical conductivity because σsat and σdry can be easily determined and θ can be monitored continuously the new model has the advantages of being simpler and easier to use than the

conductivity σ the ability of a soil to conduct electrical current is a key parameter in soil science and related fields such as reservoir engineering and petrophysics soil electrical conductivity has been widely used in monitoring water deficit measuring soil salinity mapping electrical resistivity tomography and estimating hydraulic conductivity profiles brunet et al 2010 moret fernández et al 2012 vereecken et al 2014 xu et al 2019 kaleris and ziogas 2020 fu et al 2021 there are many factors that affect σ including soil porosity ϕ water content θ structure particle shape and orientation particle size distribution mineralogy and temperature rhoades et al 1989 revil and glover 1998 friedman and robinson 2002 friedman 2005 samouelian et al 2005 brillante et al 2014 one of the main pathways of electrical conduction in variably saturated soils is via electrolyte solutions thus θ is a dominant factor in determining soil σ robinson et al 2008 archie 1942 presented a power law formula that described the relationship between σ and degree of saturation s waxman and smits 1968 further extended archie s power law to account for the surface conduction in the electrical double layer near clay minerals gupta and hanks 1972 established a linear relationship between σ and θ based on data from two loamy soils rhoades et al 1976 proposed a parabolic σ θ function by assuming that bulk σ was resulted mainly from two parallel pathways electrolytic water pathway and interfacial pathway later this empirical model was extended to account for mobile continuous and immobile and discontinuous aqueous phases and allowed for different parallel and series pathways in the solid liquid pathway rhoades et al 1989 alternatively glover et al 2000 introduced a mixing model that extended the archie s equation for rocks with conducting matrix which had two conducting phases solid and liquid and each phase had a phase exponent related to its degree of connectedness the σ values can also be related to the electrical formation factor f introduced by archie 1942 which represents an approximate representation of the true geometrical configuration of porous rocks ghanbarian et al 2014 nadler 1982 noted that the relationship between f and θ resembled the shape of the water retention curve one of the commonly used semi empirical σ models is the mualem and friedman 1991 model which is built on the hypothesis that the tortuosity factor for bulk σ is identical to that for hydraulic conductivity in recent years the number of theoretical approaches for modeling the electrical conductivity of complex porous media has increased dramatically particularly as new theories e g percolation theory critical path analysis effective medium approximation become available hunt 2004 sahimi 2011 ghanbarian et al 2014 nonetheless a universal σ θ model that relies on easily attainable soil parameters has not yet been developed the objective of this study is to develop a general form of archie s model to estimate the bulk soil σ from θ and other basic soil properties i e soil porosity and sand silt and clay contents the new model is calibrated with measured σ θ datasets obtained from a variety of soils and is then validated using σ θ datasets obtained from independent soils 2 development of the general form of archie s model there are three mechanisms that dominate electrical conduction in soils ionic conduction through the continuous liquid phase electronic conduction in the dispersed solid phase and surface conduction at the solid liquid phase urish 1981 knight and endres 2005 ionic conduction is the movement of charged ions in the pores which is affected by the concentration charge and mobility of the ions electronic conduction involves the movement of electrons through interfacial pathways between solid particles and its magnitude depends on atomic structure surface conduction is associated with the ionic migration in the electrical double layer at the solid water interface because of excessive charges at the interface electrostatic attraction causes counterions to migrate in the porewater to the interface resulting in an increase in ion density at the grain surface some soil minerals e g pyrite magnetite and clays conduct current through electronic conduction however conducting minerals rarely exist in sufficient quantity to have considerable effect on the electrical properties of soils in the case of massive sulfides and graphite in soils the bulk electrical conductivity is entirely due to electronic conduction in the solid phase ionic electrolytic conduction is mainly responsible for the bulk electrical conduction in soils with an insulating solid phases and small surface areas surface conduction which is important in soils with high clay contents can be the dominant conduction mechanism in soils having fresh water or large surface areas 2 1 the rhoades model for a soil made of nonconductive solid particles rhoades et al 1976 treated the bulk electrical conduction in soils as having two parallel pathways one path for conductance via the soil solution and the other path via the solid liquid interface 1 σ σ water θ t σ s where σwater is the electrical conductivity of soil water and σs is referred to as bulk surface conductivity that is associated primarily with exchangeable cations adsorbed on clay minerals the variable t is a transmission factor that accounts for the impedance of current flow through soil water within the void space and any decrease in the mobility of ions near the solid liquid interface t 1 is equivalent to the ratio of straight line length l to path length for electrical current l e which is the reciprocal of the electrical conductivity tortuosity factor l e l rhoades et al 1976 1989 it can be expressed as 2 t a θ b where parameters a and b vary among soils and are obtained by fitting the model to observed values linear relationships between t and θ were also reported by others gupta and hanks 1972 mojid et al 2007 thus the rhoades model becomes 3 σ a σ water θ 2 b σ water θ σ s 2 2 ewing and hunt model archie s law is one of the earliest and most widely used models relating σ and ϕ archie s law is expressed as archie 1942 4 σ σ water ϕ m where m is a shape cementation exponent relating to the connectivity of the conducting water phase archie s law is limited to the scenario where water is the only conducting phase that occupies the pore space archie s second law has broader applications in unsaturated porous media 5 σ c 1 σ water s l ϕ m where c 1 as well as c 2 c 3 and c 4 in eqs 6 8 is a unitless empirical constant the saturation exponent l is commonly assumed to have a value of about 2 for both consolidated and unconsolidated sands glover 2017 by using the theory of continuum percolation ewing and hunt 2006 recast archie s second law as 6 σ c 2 σ water θ θ c μ where θc is the critical water content for percolation at which continuous pathways are just connected and μ is an exponent from the continuum percolation theory to adopt the ewing and hunt 2006 model for a limiting condition lim θ ϕ 1 σ σ water eq 6 becomes 7 σ c 3 σ water θ θ c μ 1 θ c μ following the assumption of rhoades et al 1976 that surface and liquid phases conduct electricity in parallel a bulk surface conduction term σs is added to eq 7 8 σ c 4 σ water θ θ c μ 1 θ c μ σ s it is noteworthy that in a porous medium with non negligible surface conduction eq 8 the critical water content for percolation θc should be set to equal to 0 ewing and hunt 2006 ghanbarian et al 2015 2 3 the general form of archie s model for soil electrical conductivity neither the first form nor the second form of archie s law accounts for surface conduction which can be significant in porous media containing large amounts of clay particles sen et al 1988 revil et al 1998 even if the effects of surface conduction are included archie s law fails if there are two or more conducting phases in rocks glover 2010 modified archie s law to account for n conducting phases in rocks 9 σ σ 1 f 1 m 1 σ 2 f 2 m 2 σ 3 f 3 m 3 σ n f n m n g σ i σ j θ ij where σi and f i are the electrical conductivity and volume fraction of the ith phase respectively m i is the exponent of the ith phase which relates to degree of connectedness of the phase g σi σj θij is known as the sum of the stieltjes integrals that represents the interactions between each pair of phases ith phase and jth phase and θij represents the resonance density functions that depend on the topology glover et al 2000 similarly a generalized form of archie s law for soil σ which accounts for the contributions of solids water and air is expressed in the following form 10 σ σ solid 1 ϕ s σ water θ w σ air ϕ θ a g σ i σ j θ ij where σsolid and σair are the electrical conductivity of soil solids grain scale and air respectively s w and a are the phase exponents of solid water and air respectively considering that air is an excellent insulator the third and fourth terms in eq 10 associated with the air phase can be eliminated thus eq 10 reduces to 11 σ σ solid 1 ϕ s σ water θ w g σ solid σ water θ sw where g σsolid σw θsw represents the interaction between the solid and water phases it should be noted that in the modified archie s law introduced by glover 2000 and glover 2010 the stieltjes integrals are assumed to be negligible as a first order simplification in addition both the surface conduction and electronic conduction are accounted for in the first term of eq 11 because the conduction pathways taken for the surface conduction are the same as those through the soil solids glover et al 2000 however this may lead to significant errors when the generalized archie s law is applied to clay soils where surface conduction is the dominant conduction mechanism but the geometric distribution of surface of pore space is likely to be different from that of the solid phase therefore the stieltjes integral is kept in eq 11 to represent the surface conduction pathway in soils surface conduction involves the movement of charge in the electrical double layer i e stern layer and diffuse layer which forms at the interface between water and soil solids surface conduction is dependent on the saturation vinegar and waxman 1984 revil 2013a 2013b as soil dries the thickness of the surface films decreases and most clay particles do not remain in electrical contact with one another through their diffuse double layer and hence do not form any conductive path through the soil but remain as isolated groups of charge it also has been found that the type of clay mineralogy influences the magnitude of surface conduction revil et al 1998 not only can there be high clay contents in soils but in soils with fresh water pore conductivity in the range of 0 08 1 0 s m 1 even with very low clay content surface conduction can be the dominant form of electrical conduction revil et al 2014 several theoretical and or empirical models have been proposed for porous media containing clay and exhibiting high surface conductivity sen et al 1988 revil et al 1998 klein and santamarina 2003 choo and burns 2014 among these the waxman and smits 1968 model is frequently used for the interpretation of σ considering surface conduction 12 σ s γ f σ water σ surface s where γ is a saturation exponent and σsurface is the electrical conductivity of solid surfaces associated with counter ions in the electrical double layer note that σs used in earlier equations represents the bulk surface conduction and σsolid is the electrical conductivity of soil solids the electrical formation factor f is defined by bussian 1983 13 f lim σ surface 0 σ water σ sat ϕ m where σsat is the saturated electrical conductivity and m is the cementation factor in the waxman and smits model unifying the ionic conduction in eqs 11 and 12 yields 14 θ γ ϕ m γ θ w therefore the surface conduction from the waxman and smits model can be given by 15 θ ϕ γ 1 ϕ m σ surface θ w 1 ϕσ surface incorporating the surface conduction from the waxman and smits model eq 15 into eq 11 yields 16 σ σ solid 1 ϕ s σ water θ w θ w 1 ϕσ surface at either saturation or dry condition eq 16 can be simplified the σsat and σ of soil at the dry condition σdry can be obtained from 17 σ sat σ solid 1 ϕ s σ water σ surface ϕ w 18 σ dry σ solid 1 ϕ s this leads to the following equation involving w ϕ and σ 19 ϕ w σ sat σ dry σ water σ surface therefore 20 σ water σ sat σ dry ϕ w σ surface additionally σsurface is related to cation exchange capacity and thus to clay content waxman and smits 1968 rhoades et al 1989 based on the results from 13 soils with a wide range of texture clay content ranging from 0 to 36 and bulk density varies from 1 22 to 1 56 g cm 3 doussan and ruy 2009 proposed an empirical equation to estimate σsurface ds m 1 from sand silt and clay content 21 σ surface d f clay f sand f silt e where f sand f silt and f clay are the fractions of sand silt and clay in a soil respectively and d and e are fitted constants d 6 539 e 0 183 thus eq 16 can be rewritten as 22 σ σ dry σ sat σ dry ϕ w d f c l a y f s a n d f s i l t e θ w d f clay f sand f silt e ϕθ w 1 eq 22 is the generalized form of archie s model for estimating soil σ from θ porosity and sand silt and clay contents the new model has three parameters i e σsat σdry and w parameters σsat and σdry can be obtained from direct σ measurements at saturated and dry conditions therefore the general form of archie s model is left with only one unknown parameter w which makes it simpler and easier to use than the rhoades model and the ewing and hunt model 3 materials and methods 3 1 calibration dataset we made measurements on six soils soils 1 6 and obtained literature data for nine soils soils 7 15 for model calibration the soils have wide ranges of texture and bulk density table 1 laboratory measurements of σ and θ were performed on soils 1 6 at room temperature 25 1 c the soil samples were air dried ground and sieved through a 2 mm screen for soils 1 3 various soil water contents were obtained by adding known amounts of water to the samples and mixing thoroughly the moist soil was packed into a column 50 2 mm inner diameter and 50 2 mm high at a desired ρb before making measurements the packed soil samples were sealed and placed in a constant temperature room for at least 24 h to ensure thermal equilibration between water soil and the environment for the sandy loam and silty soils we followed the same procedures of horton et al 1982 to establish uniform water distributions in the high water content samples i e 0 25 and 0 30 cm3 cm 3 those soil samples were initially packed with water content of 0 10 cm3 cm 3 then the top end was covered with gauze and sealed a desired amount of additional water was added to each column the packed columns were covered with plastic wrap and heated in a 700 w microwave oven to enhance water movement in order to obtain uniform distributions after heating the soil columns in the microwave oven the columns were allowed to cool to room temperature then a thermo time domain reflectometry thermo tdr sensor was inserted into each column obtain σ measurements from tdr waveforms details about thermo tdr sensors have been provided by lu et al 2017 and the procedures for calculating σ from tdr waveforms are described in heimovaara et al 1995 and ren et al 1999 for soils 4 6 soil water contents from saturation to drier conditions were achieved by desorption the soil cores were placed on a tension table 08 01 sandbox eijkelkamp zeitz germany and slowly saturated with tap water from the bottom thermo tdr sensors were inserted vertically into the samples from the top to determine σ and θ water was drained from the soil samples stepwise from complete saturation to matric potentials of 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 80 100 cm sequentially after hydraulic equilibrium at each matric potential was achieved σ and θ were measured three times the pressure plate extractor method dane and hopmans 2002 was used to achieve θ values at matric potential of 50 100 500 1000 and 1500 kpa an additional measurement at 30 kpa was included for soil 6 to obtain σ and θ data corresponding to these conditions we packed the soil columns at selected θ values corresponding to target θ values based on the pressure plate measurements thermo tdr sensors were used to determine σ and θ with three repetitions we also obtained σ and θ data for nine soils from the literature three soils soils 7 9 were from tokoro et al 2016 in which σ data were collected with the four electrode technique for soils 10 12 σ and the corresponding θ data were obtained with a pair of electrodes embedded in soil samples on a tension table or in a pressure chamber for a range of matric potential values from 0 to 1471 kpa doussan and ruy 2009 the data for soils 13 15 were from hailemariam et al 2017 where σ was measured with an open ended coaxial line technique soils 7 9 and 13 15 were incrementally wetted from air dry to saturation by adding pre determined amounts of distilled water 3 2 validation dataset for model verification we used σ data for six soils i e soils 16 21 table 2 soil 16 is a fine silt loam rhoades et al 1976 intact core samples were collected in cylinders 39 mm high and 75 mm in diameter and electrodes were inserted into the soil columns to measure σ the samples were first leached with nacl and cacl2 solutions at a concentration of 0 8 mol l 1 and then were leached with four additional concentrations with σwater ranging from 2 5 ds m 1 to 56 2 ds m 1 a pressure plate apparatus was used to establish θ values at selected values of matric potential between 0 and 500 kpa at each matric potential the corresponding θ and σ values were determined rhoades et al 1976 soil 17 is a clay loam from ren et al 1999 in which σ was measured on repacked soil columns at various θ and bulk density values prior to packing the soil was air dried ground sieved through a 2 mm screen and wetted to a selected θ value with either distilled water or nacl solutions of five different σwater values the wet soil sample was mixed thoroughly and packed into cylinders 60 mm high and 52 mm inner diameter the packed columns were then tightly covered and placed in a constant temperature 20 c room for 48 h before determining σ and θ simultaneously with the thermo tdr sensor ren et al 1999 tuli and hopmans 2004 measured σ of a sand soil soil 18 as a function of θ and ρb soil samples were uniformly packed into brass columns 60 mm high and 82 5 mm inner diameter soaked in cacl2 solution with σwater ranging from 0 3 to 2 5 ds m 1 upon saturation various water contents were achieved following the multistep outflow method tuli et al 2001 the soil samples were allowed to equilibrate with the applied pressure and σ values were determined by using the tdr method the data for soil 19 were obtained from kizito et al 2008 the disturbed sandy loam samples were mixed with water or kcl solutions 6 concentrations and packed into plexiglass columns 30 mm tall and 80 mm in diameter at a bulk density of 1 33 g cm 3 and various water contents the σ measurements were made with the ech2o te sensor decagon devices inc pullman wa soil 20 callovo oxfordian clay rock was sampled from the bure test site meuse haute marne france the core samples were drilled with a nacl saturated mud and then packed in 200 mm length cylinders a series of water contents were achieved by using an automated humidity system likos and lu 2003 the σ measurements were made at different saturations using the equipment developed at the central laboratory for electronics based on the four electrode theory jougnot et al 2010 the data for soil 21 were obtained from amente et al 2000 soil samples were packed in cylinders of 77 5 mm inner diameter and 150 mm high then kcl solution was added at the column top to obtain a total of six different levels of σwater ranging from 1 ds m 1 to 5 6 ds m 1 various θ values were obtained by a step wise increase of pressure to the soil columns and σ and θ were determined with a two wire tdr probe 3 3 statistical analysis the performance of the general form of archie s model was evaluated with root mean square error rmse relative error re and akaike s information criterion aic 23 rmse σ estimated σ measured 2 n 24 re σ estimated σ measured σ measured n 100 25 aic n log 2 π log σ estimated σ measured 2 n p 1 p where n is the number of data points p is the number of model parameters and σestimated and σmeasured are the model estimates and measured values respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 model parameters the general form of archie s model eq 22 was compared to the rhoades model eq 3 and the ewing and hunt model eq 8 using measured σ θ data on soils 1 15 each model was fitted to the measured soil σ θ data of soils 1 15 in order to calibrate the model parameters overall the slopes of regression lines were nearly equal to one and the intercepts were close to zero indicating that all three models were well fitted to the measured values fig 1 the parameters of the rhoades et al 1976 model and the ewing and hunt 2006 model varied considerably among soil types rhoades et al 1976 obtained a value of 2 1 for a and a value of 0 245 for b on clay soils but a ranged from 1 3 to 1 4 and b ranged from 0 11 to 0 06 on three loam soils in the ewing and hunt 2006 study c 4 ranged from 1 07 to 2 73 and θc varied from 0 to 0 07 cm3 cm 3 on 14 soils in this study parameters a b and c 4 ranged from 1 2 to 78 1 0 1 to 150 6 and 0 26 to 4 20 respectively on the 15 soils as for the conductivity exponent μ a value of 2 was normally used for three dimensional systems but non universality of this μ value had been reported feng et al 1987 for example an exponent of 1 88 was given for cases where the conductivities of solid and liquid phases were similar hunt 2004 this agreed with our fitted values that μ had a wide range between 0 70 and 4 70 for soils 1 15 4 2 liquid phase exponent w in the generalized archie type model eq 22 w is the exponent of the water phase that relates to the connectedness among soil pores which can take any value from unity to infinity glover 2010 in general a large w value indicates low water phase connectedness a value of unity represents a pore system composed of a bundle of capillary tubes that cross the soil pore space in a straight line and a value of approximately 2 represents the degree of connectedness that is associated with the pore network in sandstone we obtained the values of parameter w by fitting eq 22 to the σ and θ data of soils 1 15 by using the least squares method fig 2 except for soil 10 that had a w value of 4 2 the w values of the other soils fell in the range between 1 3 and 2 5 the large w value for soil 10 was caused by the fact that it was an aggregated soil with bimodal pore size distribution see fig 4 of doussan and ruy 2009 for soils with bimodal pore size distribution both intra and inter aggregate pores contribute to the bulk σ friedman 2005 which led to large w values because most of the w values were distributed between 1 3 and 2 5 we chose to use the mean value to represent the general situation the mean value of w in fig 2 was 1 98 when soil 10 was excluded and was 2 06 when soil 10 was included thus we set w at a constant value of 2 and eq 22 was simplified to 26 σ σ dry σ sat σ dry ϕ 2 0 654 f clay f sand f silt 0 018 θ 2 0 654 f clay f sand f silt 0 018 ϕθ the above σ θ relationship is a second degree polynomial function which is comparable to the rhoades model with an exponential constant of 2 for θ and the ewing and hunt model with a μ value of 2 although the coefficients of the three models have different meanings this is no coincidence because the phenomenology may indicate a universal dependence of σ on θ the parameters in the rhoades model are empirical and have no physical meaning for the ewing and hunt model in contrast c gives the medium s tortuosity at saturation and θc represents the critical volume for percolation the variables in eq 26 include basic soil properties i e sand silt and clay contents and porosity and σ values at saturated σsat and dry σdry conditions fig 3 shows the contribution of each phase to the bulk σ in eq 26 for two representative soils a sand with 90 sand 5 silt and 5 clay and a clay loam with 40 sand 30 silt and 30 clay with increasing θ the contributions of both ionic conduction σpore the second term in eq 26 and surface conduction σs the third term in eq 26 were increased while that of electronic conduction σdry the first term in eq 26 remained unchanged in addition for the sandy soil σpore made the dominant contribution whereas both σs as well as σpore had important roles for the bulk σ of the clay loam soil 4 3 performance of the general form of archie s model in the previous section we developed a general form of the archie s model eq 26 that was capable of estimating σ from θ σsat σdry ϕ and sand silt and clay contents in this section we examine the performance of the general form of archie s model on soils 16 21 fig 4 presents the model σ estimates versus measured σ values as a function of θ except for soil 17 at bulk electrical conductivity values greater than 10 2 ds m 1 the estimated σ values agreed well with the measured σ values indicating that the general form of archie s model was able to provide accurate σ estimates as a function of θ error analysis showed that the rmse values ranged from 0 008 to 0 399 ds m 1 and the re varied from 0 7 to 29 8 table 3 the coefficients of determination r2 for all six soils were greater than 0 93 for soil 17 the general form of archie s model overestimated σ at θ 0 2 cm3 cm 3 and underestimated σ at θ greater than 0 2 cm3 cm 3 the measured σ θ values of soil 17 showed a pronounced decrease in the slope of the σ θ curve when θ was between 0 2 and 0 3 cm3 cm 3 this might be due to the two different regions of the σ θ relationship keller and frischnecht 1966 split the σ θ curve into two regions that were divided by a critical water content θcr at which a continuous film of water was formed over all of the soil particle surfaces they suggested a saturation exponent of 4 5 for the low θ range i e θ θcr and a value of 2 for the high θ range for clay soils θcr was relatively large because of the large surface area of clay particles thus such a phenomenon slope of the σ θ curve decreased at large θ values was manifested in soil 17 fig 5 compares measured σ values to model estimated values for soils 16 21 generally the plotted points in the figure distributed randomly along the 1 1 line with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 96 an average rmse of 0 311 ds m 1 and an average bias of 0 074 ds m 1 thus the general form of archie s model provided reliable σ estimations on these soils compared to the rhoades model and the ewing and hunt model the general form of archie s model eq 26 has several advantages first the rhoades model requires three parameters σwater a and b and the ewing and hunt model needs four parameters c 4 σwater θc and μ to apply the rhoades model and the ewing and hunt model under different conditions soil specific calibration is required to determine these parameters for the general form of archie s model a value of 2 is selected for the parameter w and σdry and σsat can be measured directly in the lab in addition σwater is no longer an input parameter σwater can be estimated with eq 20 in the general form of archie s model which eliminates the need to determine σ of extract solutions from soil samples finally in both the rhoades model and the ewing and hunt model the surface conduction σs is treated as a variable independent of θ and the contribution of matrix conductivity to bulk σ is ignored there are reports that σs varies with θ rhoades et al 1989 amente et al 2000 thus the general form of archie s model has the advantages of being simple and easy to use in practice 5 conclusion in this study we developed a general form of archie s model to estimate σ from easily measured soil properties including σsat σdry soil porosity and sand silt and clay contents we used σ θ values from 15 soils to obtain the model parameter w for each soil and an average w value of 2 was determined the new σ θ model provided accurate estimates of σ on six independent soils with a range of textures and a range of electrical conductivity because σsat and σdry can be easily determined and θ can be monitored continuously the new model has the advantages of being simpler and easier to use than the

4594,shallow lakes are characterized by strong hydrological fluctuations affecting their biochemistry and carbon c balance this study explored carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 flux under strong water level fluctuations in a shallow lake while also addressing its implications regarding wetland restoration the denitrification decomposition dndc model a process based biogeochemical model was used to simulate co2 and ch4 flux under intensive water level fluctuations in lake baiyangdian byd northern china results showed that i the dndc model was able to reasonably capture co2 and ch4 dynamics which were determined to be extremely sensitive to water depth fluctuations at a 10 cm to 10 cm range ii the lowest co2 flux was observed at a 40 day duration while the trend in annual ch4 flux was to increase as inundation time increased changing from 2 27 kg c ha y to 1 57 kg c ha y and iii co2 and ch4 flux increased under higher fluctuation frequencies wherein co2 flux was lowest in january and february and ch4 flux increased from december to march under certain frequencies our results indicate that water level fluctuations e g water depth duration frequency and timing affected both co2 and ch4 flux as it pertains to water diversion projects used for shallow lake restoration initiatives the optimum approach pertinent to water yields diversion time and duration should first be considered carefully results from this study provide useful information for assisting policymakers with respect to reducing gaseous c emissions during ecological water transfer project regulations

biogeochemistry and ecology olefeldt et al 2017 cui et al 2017 moreover the hydrological regimes of shallow lake wetlands play a vital role in controlling physical chemical and biological processes

socioeconomic demands e g flood protection water storage and irrigation however abrupt wetland flooding events caused by ecological water transfer projects as well as increases in minimum water levels and reductions in seasonal water level fluctuations resulting from water level controls have inevitably induced changes to occur in biological processes while also influencing carbon c balances martínez santos et al 2008 olefeldt et al 2017 kong et al 2017 in this way water level fluctuations govern shifts between anaerobic methane ch4 production and aerobic ch4 oxidation processes higher water levels are generally associated with higher net ch4 emissions jacinthe 2015 li et al 2019a ye et al 2019 we used several mechanisms in this study to clarify wetland c response to water level fluctuations such as the enzyme latch theory ise et al 2008 recently wang et al 2017 reported that ferrous iron fe ii has been shown to decrease with a decrease in water levels while also acting as a controlling factor of oxidative phenolic activity this will in turn lead to an accumulation in aromatic solubility as well as a reduction in hydrolytic enzyme activities which explains the positive neutral and negative effects that a reduction in water levels has on soil organic carbon soc fundamentally water level fluctuations will alter wetland type redox environments subsequently triggering ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 emissions to occur e g granberg et al 1997 chimner et al 2016 however due to variations in vegetation composition caused by water level fluctuations the ecosystem respiration and water level relationship remains uncertain juszczak et al 2013 mcconnell et al 2013 ballantyne et al 2014 yuan et al 2015 zeng et al 2019 this uncertainty potentially results from the independent response of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration kong et al 2017 on the one hand mineralization processes namely heterotrophic respiration increases substantially under aerobic conditions on the other hand droughts can also influence the gross primary productivity gpp of wetland plant species and thus affect rates of autotrophic respiration kong et al 2017 water level

anthropogenic activities in recent decades e g water transfer initiatives and irrigation activities liu et al 2010 ecosystem processes and functions in byd being a typical shallow lake for which reeds are the dominant emergent plant are sensitive to water level fluctuations namely fluctuations related to net primary productivity and organic matter with a decline in water level macrophytes especially reeds have exhibited a tendency to expand resulting in terrestrialization in some shallow lakes within byd e g zaozha lake and guding lake cui et al 2017 to maintain the water ecology and integrity of byd ecological water transfer projects have been implemented since the 1980s to replenish the lake wang et al 2012 specifically the planning outline of the xiong an new area which has jurisdiction over byd includes an ordinance for its ecological restoration inevitably under highly intensive anthropogenic activities hydrological regime alterations have caused aquatic ecosystem changes to occur wang et al 2018 li et al 2019b and affected the c sequestration capacity of the lake li et al 2009 chen et al 2017 2 2 lake baiyangdian water level fluctuations water levels of byd fluctuated significantly changing over time under different timescales at an annual scale water levels range from 5 43 m to 9 49 m exhibiting a decreasing trend between 1951 and 2017 0 02 m a2 slope fig 2 a it is noteworthy that the highest annual water level was detected between december and march while the lowest annual water level was generally detected in the month of july between 2006 and 2011 with a fluctuation range i e the difference between the highest and the lowest water level that varied from 0 77 m in 2009 to 1 23 m in 2008 due to water transfer operations in june and november the monthly water level in 2009 for which approx 17 25 and 65 00 million m3 of water flowed into byd ranged from 6 68 m to 7 50 m in particular under the influence of the water transfer project the amplitude in the rise of water levels reached 0 22 m and 0 33 m in june and december respectively by contrast monthly water levels exhibited a decreasing trend prior to the enactment of water transfer operations on december 15 2010 moreover water levels decreased from 7 06 m in june to 6 72 m in december 2010 2 3 model description the dndc model a process based biogeochemical model was used in this study to simulate c dynamics in both the forest wetland ecosystem and the littoral zone of the reservoir lamers et al 2007 geng et al 2016 the wetland module in the dndc model can be used to simulate co2 and ch4 emission dynamics based on inputs associated with meteorological conditions water table dynamics moss and herbaceous plant growth and soil or sediment properties zhang et al 2002 2012 the model outputs include the production of plant biomass and daily co2 and ch4 flux zhang et al 2002 provides a detailed schematic of the model in this study appendix a provides detail on the model used to simulate c emission dynamics 2 4 model validation and simulation scenarios as shown in fig 1 two study sites i e donglizhuang and dadiantou were selected to validate the model the monthly biomass maximum biomass biomass allocation soil texture ph soc and bulk density were ascertained from a field experiment conducted at the dadiantou study site to validate the model soil and vegetation parameters also were collected from niu et al 2018 biomass was partitioned as follows grains 1 roots 74 stems 15 and leaves 10 and the c n ratio was set as follows the grains 33 roots 21 8 stems 175 2 and leaves 41 9 of reeds phragmites australis lan 2013 li et al 2016 appendix a provides the soil and vegetation parameters of the two sites for model validation this study used monthly observed data from the donglizhuang site obtained from the study by niu et al 2018 employing the closed chamber technique while monthly observed data from the dadiantou site were obtained through means of in situ observations this study applied several scenarios as shown in appendix b to reflect impacts of alterations in hydrological regime fluctuations e g water depth duration frequency and timing on co2 and ch4 flux for the water depth scenarios we applied 14 fixed water depths ranging from 80 cm to 50 cm at 10 cm intervals from the surface to the bottom of the lake appendix table 2 the duration changed from 10 to 90 days per fluctuation period fluctuation frequency varied from one to three times per year and fluctuation timing was set from january to december appendix b provides detailed information on all scenarios 2 5 assessing the wetland dndc model using field data quadrats were established within the byd during the growing season from april to october along the water level gradient of the reed phragmites australis community non flooding nf seasonal flooding sf and continuous flooding cf sites during the growing season from april to october 2019 gas samples i e co2 and ch4 and aboveground vegetation biomass samples were collected at each site using the closed chamber technique moore and roulet 1991 yang et al 2014 and vegetation removal appendix c provides detail on the in situ method used 2 6 analytical method used to determine carbon flux response to water depth to explore the sensitivity range of c emissions to water depth this study analyzed dynamics associated with relative changes in c flux represented as δr in this study for each initial water depth this study assumed that the δr value of each water depth range would vary with the initial water depth if the c flux correlated to the water level for the sensitivity range we assumed that a decreasing δr trend followed by an increasing δr trend would likely result in a tipping point where a higher δr value would represent a higher byd c flux this study used one way analysis of variance anova to analyze differences in c flux among the different water depths at a 95 confidence level δr was calculated as follows 1 δ r r ci 1 r ci r ci where δr is the relative change in c flux i e co2 or ch4 flux in this study i represents changes from 1 to 14 when scenarios vary from s 0 1 to s 0 14 without calculating s 0 14 rc i 1 and rc i are the c flux in the corresponding i kg c ha d 3 results 3 1 wetland dndc model validation against observational co2 and ch4 flux data both co2 and ch4 flux varied over time under different water level conditions fig 3 the maximum co2 flux was observed during july namely from 5759 06 5677 77 and 4051 98 mg m2 h in the nf sf and cf respectively the observed maximum ch4 flux lagged behind the maximum co2 flux observed during august ranging from 0 23 2 08 and 0 28 mg m2 h in the nf sf and cf respectively according to anova results co2 flux exhibited no significant differences among the different water level treatments i e nf sf and cf p 0 442 however we found significant ch4 flux differences p 0 05 among the different water level treatments a comparison between observed and simulated results showed that the dndc model was able to capture temporal co2 and ch4 dynamics at both sites with a fitted linear model slope of 0 85 r2 0 73 and 0 98 r2 0 61 and relative error re of 11 39 and 11 39 respectively fig 4 3 2 carbon emission dynamics under static water level scenarios as shown in fig 5 annual c flux was characterized by phasing and c emission dynamics varied between co2 and ch4 flux water depth can be divided into three phases from 80 cm to 50 cm from 40 cm to 10 cm and from 0 cm to 50 cm under a stable water depth from 80 cm to 50 cm minimal co2 flux emissions occurred when the water depth changed from 40 cm to 10 cm i e 106 94 kg c ha y compared to the other two water depth ranges i e 6932 08 kg c ha y from 80 cm to 50 cm and 11789 93 kg c ha y from 0 cm to 50 cm fig 5a however the lowest and highest annual ch4 flux occurred at depths from 80 cm to 50 cm 2 57 kg c ha y and from 0 to 50 cm 22 62 kg c ha y respectively fig 5b both co2 and ch4 flux were extremely sensitive at a 10 cm to 10 cm water depth with δr ranging from 0 02 to 0 75 and from 0 03 to 1 00 respectively while δr did not significantly change from a 80 cm to 50 cm i e from 0 00 to 0 07 and from 0 06 to 0 00 for co2 and ch4 respectively and from a 10 cm to 50 cm ranging from 0 00 to 0 02 and from 0 00 to 0 00 for co2 and ch4 respectively water depth fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the probable tipping point occurred at a water depth of 0 cm and the trend in δr was to first decrease and then increase when the water depth increased from 10 cm to 10 cm although no potential sensitivity was detected within a range from 50 cm to 30 cm the trend in the δr value was the opposite alongside a water depth turning point of 40 cm with value of 0 69 and 1 00 respectively this was because the water depth was below the soil surface less than 0 cm as indicated by the minus sign which did not coincide with annual variation of the actual water depth under the target restoration plan 3 3 carbon emission dynamics under the different water level scenarios over a 40 day duration c emissions exhibited minimal annual flux with values of 6867 17 kg c ha y and 1 90 kg c ha y for co2 and ch4 respectively this study found a decreasing trend in annual co2 flux when the duration was prolonged from 10 days to 40 days and this was followed by an increasing trend when the duration was prolonged to 90 days fig 7 a moreover co2 flux varied from 6867 17 kg c ha y to 7277 76 kg c ha y yielding the lowest flux at a 40 day duration annual ch4 flux increased as inundation time increased namely from 2 27 kg c ha y to 1 57 kg c ha y fig 7b time played a role in increasing ch4 flux rates namely increasing beyond the 40 day duration however only a slight increasing trend was detectable when the duration changed from 10 days 2 27 kg c ha y to 40 days 1 90 kg c ha y additionally the trend in both co2 and ch4 flux was to increase alongside water level fluctuation frequencies fig 7c and fig 7d moreover both co2 and ch4 flux increased with an increase in fluctuation frequency increasing by 12 65 and 712 26 respectively when the fluctuation frequency increased from one to three times per year furthermore different characteristics in c dynamics occurred over fluctuation time additionally the lowest annual co2 and ch4 flux was observed in january and february with values of 6821 87 to 6867 17 kg c ha y and 2 17 to 1 90 kg c ha y respectively fig 8 the fluctuation duration trend in annual co2 was as follows an increase before may i e the annual emission varying from 6821 87 to 7870 23 kg c ha y and a decrease between may and july with a value 7179 59 kg c ha y in july exhibiting no significant increasing or decreasing trends from august to december i e from 7181 75 kg c ha y in august to 7256 12 kg c ha y in december january and february yielded the lowest annual co2 emissions with values of 6821 87 kg c ha y and 6867 17 kg c ha y respectively the fluctuation duration trend in annual ch4 was as follows an increase before august and a decrease between august and december moreover ch4 flux was negative from january to march and in december i e from 2 17 to 0 73 kg c ha y and 0 79 kg c ha y respectively 4 discussion 4 1 carbon emission dynamics under water level fluctuations as shown in fig 5 c dynamics varied under hydrology regime alterations moreover c flux was sensitive to water fluctuations when it varied between 10 cm and 10 cm as shown in fig 5 causes of this phenomenon include i high organic c accumulation in areas that alternate between dry and wet periods tautges et al 2019 watanabe et al 2019 yin et al 2019 and ii significant alterations in the status of anaerobic and aerobic conditions resulting from water level fluctuations kim et al 2012 van der lee et al 2017 the current paradigm on c dynamics is that methanogenesis can only occur under anoxic conditions while oxic environments promote co2 it is widely accepted among researchers that c emissions are controlled by both monthly and inter annual variability in water level depth yang et al 2013 strachan et al 2016 compared to flux at water levels from 2 cm to 14 cm one study showed that mean co2 emissions increased by 120 and ch4 emissions decreased by 75 at a water level depth from 11 cm to 0 cm yang et al 2013 however the response of c emissions to water levels remains highly uncertain angle et al 2017 reported in their study that up to 80 of ch4 flux could be attributed to methanogenesis in oxygenated soil which also supports the methane paradox to some degree the methane paradox can explain why frequent alterations between wet and dry periods resulted in both co2 and ch4 flux sensitivity to water levels that ranged from 10 to 10 cm rather than those that ranged from 10 cm to 0 cm co2 or from 0 cm to 10 cm ch4 franz et al 2016 in this study co2 flux was minimal at a 40 day duration while the trend in ch4 flux increased as the duration increased moreover longer inundation times can promote anaerobic conditions field et al 1988 under such conditions more oxygen o2 can enter into the soil helping to drive oxidation during c decomposition processes which will primarily result in co2 production shen et al 2019 this is also the main driving factor for the fluctuation frequency of c dynamics with the highest flux observed at a scenario frequency of three times per year as shown in fig 7 previous studies also found similar results geng et al 2016 yang et al 2016 yakimovich et al 2020 furthermore fluctuation time will either decrease or invert shallow lake wetland functions causing them to act as a sink or source strachan et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 results from this study showed that ch4 flux was positive when the fluctuation event occurred in july while ch4 flux was inverted in february and october fig 8 this could be due to the effect that fluctuation time has on vegetation growth and ecological processes zhang et al 2018 2019a liu et al 2020b strachan et al 2016 reported that the net ecosystem co2 exchange which depends on photosynthesis is mainly controlled by inter annual water depth variability 4 2 implications of wetland restoration and optimal water levels water level is a key indicator for understanding hydrologic processes during ecological restoration initiatives ruiz jaen and aide 2005 liu et al 2020b although water level changes driven by water level fluctuations are generally greater gao and fang 2013 ahmadi et al 2016 li et al 2019b in shallow lake wetlands the coupled hydrologic and ecological process effect will also have an impact on ecological restoration as many studies have reported various ecological effects could result from this coupled effect such as changes to vegetation distribution patterns and the ecological functions of wetlands poff and zimmerman 2010 cui et al 2017a 2017b zhang et al 2017 the timing and frequency of water fluctuations will either intensify or decrease these ecological effects studies have suggested that decreasing water depths and prolonged dry seasons will lead to an increase in the plant growth season meng et al 2018 when water conditions exceed optimum values or the ecological extent of plant growth they will trigger adaptive mechanisms of vegetation morphology zhang et al 2019b thus water depth fluctuations impact c emissions by altering the biochemical processes of shallow wetlands jacinthe 2015 ye et al 2019 furthermore the byd hydrologic regime is also significantly affected by anthropogenic activities yang et al 2016 yin 2017 wang et al 2008 in the planning outline of the xiong an new area exogenous water transfer was determined to be the best method for wetland restoration wherein shallow lake wetlands undergo significant water level fluctuations over short term periods ahmadi et al 2016 however the main goal of water transfer operations is to maintain a high water depth and a large water area during the dry season i e from april to june which based on hydrological methods improves water supplies ren and liu 2017 considering the potential ecological effects it is critical to take the growth rhythms of typical wetland vegetation into account while ensuring the stability of their function when selecting water diversion timings and modes results from this study suggest that water transfer timings should be set to either february or january as an ecological water supplement after which it should be done once annually at a 40 day duration 5 conclusions biogeochemical processes i e c generation and emissions in shallow lakes are strongly influenced by hydrological regimes in this study co2 and ch4 emissions were sensitive to water level fluctuations as simulated by the wetland dndc model key findings are as follows i alterations in c flux are the result of combined water level fluctuation impacts namely water depth duration frequency and timing wherein the wetland module of the dndc model was able to provide reasonable results in simulating c flux ii c flux is strongly sensitive to water depth variation between 10 cm and 10 cm a water depth around 0 cm was determined to be the potential tipping point while the trend in δr was to first decrease and then to increase when water depth increased from 10 cm to 10 cm iii both co2 and ch4 exhibited their lowest emissions at a 40 day duration moreover c flux decreased at a lower water level fluctuation frequency particularly in january or february water levels fluctuate strongly in shallow lakes resulting from climate change and anthropogenic activities including practices associated with wetland restoration a greater understanding of suitable water level operation procedures is therefore essential as well as the application of optimal methods based on balancing c budgets during water diversion projects aimed solely at hydrologic recovery this study found that a concentrated water transfer supplement in january or february was better than dispersive water transfers at other times of the year special attention must be paid to studies that focus on comparable research as well as

4594,shallow lakes are characterized by strong hydrological fluctuations affecting their biochemistry and carbon c balance this study explored carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 flux under strong water level fluctuations in a shallow lake while also addressing its implications regarding wetland restoration the denitrification decomposition dndc model a process based biogeochemical model was used to simulate co2 and ch4 flux under intensive water level fluctuations in lake baiyangdian byd northern china results showed that i the dndc model was able to reasonably capture co2 and ch4 dynamics which were determined to be extremely sensitive to water depth fluctuations at a 10 cm to 10 cm range ii the lowest co2 flux was observed at a 40 day duration while the trend in annual ch4 flux was to increase as inundation time increased changing from 2 27 kg c ha y to 1 57 kg c ha y and iii co2 and ch4 flux increased under higher fluctuation frequencies wherein co2 flux was lowest in january and february and ch4 flux increased from december to march under certain frequencies our results indicate that water level fluctuations e g water depth duration frequency and timing affected both co2 and ch4 flux as it pertains to water diversion projects used for shallow lake restoration initiatives the optimum approach pertinent to water yields diversion time and duration should first be considered carefully results from this study provide useful information for assisting policymakers with respect to reducing gaseous c emissions during ecological water transfer project regulations

biogeochemistry and ecology olefeldt et al 2017 cui et al 2017 moreover the hydrological regimes of shallow lake wetlands play a vital role in controlling physical chemical and biological processes poff et al 1997 palmer and ruhi 2019 which has even been regarded as the single most important determinant in the establishment and maintenance of specific wetland types mitsch and gosselink 2015 yang et al 2020 through alterations hydrological regimes influenced by extreme climate change and increased anthropogenic activities have deviated from natural water level regimes contributing to the

socioeconomic demands e g flood protection water storage and irrigation however abrupt wetland flooding events caused by ecological water transfer projects as well as increases in minimum water levels and reductions in seasonal water level fluctuations resulting from water level controls have inevitably induced changes to occur in biological processes while also influencing carbon c balances martínez santos et al 2008 olefeldt et al 2017 kong et al 2017 in this way water level fluctuations govern shifts between anaerobic methane ch4 production and aerobic ch4 oxidation processes higher water levels are generally associated with higher net ch4 emissions jacinthe 2015 li et al 2019a ye et al 2019 we used several mechanisms in this study to clarify wetland c response to water level fluctuations such as the enzyme latch theory ise et al 2008 recently wang et al 2017 reported that ferrous iron fe ii has been shown to decrease with a decrease in water levels while also acting as a controlling factor of oxidative phenolic activity this will in turn lead to an accumulation in aromatic solubility as well as a reduction in hydrolytic enzyme activities which explains the positive neutral and negative effects that a reduction in water levels has on soil organic carbon soc fundamentally water level fluctuations will alter wetland type redox environments subsequently triggering ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 emissions to occur e g granberg et al 1997 chimner et al 2016 however due to variations in vegetation composition caused by water level fluctuations the ecosystem respiration and water level relationship remains uncertain juszczak et al 2013 mcconnell et al 2013 ballantyne et al 2014 yuan et al 2015 zeng et al 2019 this uncertainty potentially results from the independent response of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration kong et al 2017 on the one hand mineralization processes namely heterotrophic respiration increases substantially under aerobic conditions on the other hand droughts can also influence the gross primary productivity gpp of wetland plant species and thus affect rates of autotrophic respiration kong et al 2017 water level fluctuations particularly those associated with extreme climate events can cause substantial changes to aquatic vegetation community foti et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 impacting vegetation composition

when the maximum gpp and net ecosystem exchange are reached yurova et al 2007 adkinson et al 2011 wang et al 2019 thus changes in the frequency or severity of drought and flooding events resulting

observations this study applied several scenarios as shown in appendix b to reflect impacts of alterations in hydrological regime fluctuations e g water depth duration frequency and timing on co2 and ch4 flux for the water depth scenarios we applied 14 fixed water depths ranging from 80 cm to 50 cm at 10 cm intervals from the surface to the bottom of the lake appendix table 2 the duration changed from 10 to 90 days per fluctuation period fluctuation frequency varied from one to three times per year and fluctuation timing was set from january to december appendix b provides detailed information on all scenarios 2 5 assessing the wetland dndc model using field data quadrats were established within the byd during the growing season from april to october along the water level gradient of the reed phragmites australis community non flooding nf seasonal flooding sf and continuous flooding cf sites during the growing season from april to october 2019 gas samples i e co2 and ch4 and aboveground vegetation biomass samples were collected at each site using the closed chamber technique moore and roulet 1991 yang et al 2014 and vegetation removal appendix c provides detail on the in situ method used 2 6 analytical method used to determine carbon flux response to water depth to explore the sensitivity range of c emissions to water depth this study analyzed dynamics associated with relative changes in c flux represented as δr in this study for each initial water depth this study assumed that the δr value of each water depth range would vary with the initial water depth if the c flux correlated to the water level for the sensitivity range we assumed that a decreasing δr trend followed by an increasing δr trend would likely result in a tipping point where a higher δr value would represent a higher byd c flux this study used one way analysis of variance anova to analyze differences in c flux among the different water depths at a 95 confidence level δr was calculated as follows 1 δ r r ci 1 r ci r ci where δr is the relative change in c flux i e co2 or ch4 flux in this study i represents changes from 1 to 14 when scenarios vary from s 0 1 to s 0 14 without calculating s 0 14 rc i 1 and rc i are the c flux in the corresponding i kg c ha d 3 results 3 1 wetland dndc model validation against observational co2 and ch4 flux data both co2 and ch4 flux varied over time under different water level conditions fig 3 the maximum co2 flux was observed during july namely from 5759 06 5677 77 and 4051 98 mg m2 h in the nf sf and cf respectively the observed maximum ch4 flux lagged behind the maximum co2 flux observed during august ranging from 0 23 2 08 and 0 28 mg m2 h in the nf sf and cf respectively according to anova results co2 flux exhibited no significant differences among the different water level treatments i e nf sf and cf p 0 442 however we found significant ch4 flux differences p 0 05 among the different water level treatments a comparison between observed and simulated results showed that the dndc model was able to capture temporal co2 and ch4 dynamics at both sites with a fitted linear model slope of 0 85 r2 0 73 and 0 98 r2 0 61 and relative error re of 11 39 and 11 39 respectively fig 4 3 2 carbon emission dynamics under static water level scenarios as shown in fig 5 annual c flux was characterized by phasing and c emission dynamics varied between co2 and ch4 flux water depth can be divided into three phases from 80 cm to 50 cm from 40 cm to 10 cm and from 0 cm to 50 cm under a stable water depth from 80 cm to 50 cm minimal co2 flux emissions occurred when the water depth changed from 40 cm to 10 cm i e 106 94 kg c ha y compared to the other two water depth ranges i e 6932 08 kg c ha y from 80 cm to 50 cm and 11789 93 kg c ha y from 0 cm to 50 cm fig 5a however the lowest and highest annual ch4 flux occurred at depths from 80 cm to 50 cm 2 57 kg c ha y and from 0 to 50 cm 22 62 kg c ha y respectively fig 5b both co2 and ch4 flux were extremely sensitive at a 10 cm to 10 cm water depth with δr ranging from 0 02 to 0 75 and from 0 03 to 1 00 respectively while δr did not significantly change from a 80 cm to 50 cm i e from 0 00 to 0 07 and from 0 06 to 0 00 for co2 and ch4 respectively and from a 10 cm to 50 cm ranging from 0 00 to 0 02 and from 0 00 to 0 00 for co2 and ch4 respectively water depth fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the probable tipping point occurred at a water depth of 0 cm and the trend in δr was to first decrease and then increase when the water depth increased from 10 cm to 10 cm although no potential sensitivity was detected within a range from 50 cm to 30 cm the trend in the δr value was the opposite alongside a water depth turning point of 40 cm with value of 0 69 and 1 00 respectively this was because the water depth was below the soil surface less than 0 cm as indicated by the minus sign which did not coincide with annual variation of the actual water depth under the target restoration plan 3 3 carbon emission dynamics under the different water level scenarios over a 40 day duration c emissions exhibited minimal annual flux with values of 6867 17 kg c ha y and 1 90 kg c ha y for co2 and ch4 respectively this study found a decreasing trend in annual co2 flux when the duration was prolonged from 10 days to 40 days and this was followed by an increasing trend when the duration was prolonged to 90 days fig 7 a moreover co2 flux varied from 6867 17 kg c ha y to 7277 76 kg c ha y yielding the lowest flux at a 40 day duration annual ch4 flux increased as inundation time increased namely from 2 27 kg c ha y to 1 57 kg c ha y fig 7b time played a role in increasing ch4 flux rates namely increasing beyond the 40 day duration however only a slight increasing trend was detectable when the duration changed from 10 days 2 27 kg c ha y to 40 days 1 90 kg c ha y additionally the trend in both co2 and ch4 flux was to increase alongside water level fluctuation frequencies fig 7c and fig 7d moreover both co2 and ch4 flux increased with an increase in fluctuation frequency increasing by 12 65 and 712 26 respectively when the fluctuation frequency increased from one to three times per year furthermore different characteristics in c dynamics occurred over fluctuation time additionally the lowest annual co2 and ch4 flux was observed in january and february with values of 6821 87 to 6867 17 kg c ha y and 2 17 to 1 90 kg c ha y respectively fig 8 the fluctuation duration trend in annual co2 was as follows an increase before may i e the annual emission varying from 6821 87 to 7870 23 kg c ha y and a decrease between may and july with a value 7179 59 kg c ha y in july exhibiting no significant increasing or decreasing trends from august to december i e from 7181 75 kg c ha y in august to 7256 12 kg c ha y in december january and february yielded the lowest annual co2 emissions with values of 6821 87 kg c ha y and 6867 17 kg c ha y respectively the fluctuation duration trend in annual ch4 was as follows an increase before august and a decrease between august and december moreover ch4 flux was negative from january to march and in december i e from 2 17 to 0 73 kg c ha y and 0 79 kg c ha y respectively 4 discussion 4 1 carbon emission dynamics under water level fluctuations as shown in fig 5 c dynamics varied under hydrology regime alterations moreover c flux was sensitive to water fluctuations when it varied between 10 cm and 10 cm as shown in fig 5 causes of this phenomenon include i high organic c accumulation in areas that alternate between dry and wet periods tautges et al 2019 watanabe et al 2019 yin et al 2019 and ii significant alterations in the status of anaerobic and aerobic conditions resulting from water level fluctuations kim et al 2012 van der lee et al 2017 the current paradigm on c dynamics is that methanogenesis can only occur under anoxic conditions while oxic environments promote co2 it is widely accepted among researchers that c emissions are controlled by both monthly and inter annual variability in water level depth yang et al 2013 strachan et al 2016 compared to flux at water levels from 2 cm to 14 cm one study showed that mean co2 emissions increased by 120 and ch4 emissions decreased by 75 at a water level depth from 11 cm to 0 cm yang et al 2013 however the response of c emissions to water levels remains highly uncertain angle et al 2017 reported in their study that up to 80 of ch4 flux could be attributed to methanogenesis in oxygenated soil which also supports the methane paradox to some degree the methane paradox can explain why frequent alterations between wet and dry periods resulted in both co2 and ch4 flux sensitivity to water levels that ranged from 10 to 10 cm rather than those that ranged from 10 cm to 0 cm co2 or from 0 cm to 10 cm ch4 franz et al 2016 in this study co2 flux was minimal at a 40 day duration while the trend in ch4 flux increased as the duration increased moreover longer inundation times can promote anaerobic conditions field et al 1988 under such conditions more oxygen o2 can enter into the soil helping to drive oxidation during c decomposition processes which will primarily result in co2 production shen et al 2019 this is also the main driving factor for the fluctuation frequency of c dynamics with the highest flux observed at a scenario frequency of three times per year as shown in fig 7 previous studies also found similar results geng et al 2016 yang et al 2016 yakimovich et al 2020 furthermore fluctuation time will either decrease or invert shallow lake wetland functions causing them to act as a sink or source strachan et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 results from this study showed that ch4 flux was positive when the fluctuation event occurred in july while ch4 flux was inverted in february and october fig 8 this could be due to the effect that fluctuation time has on vegetation growth and ecological processes zhang et al 2018 2019a liu et al 2020b strachan et al 2016 reported that the net ecosystem co2 exchange which depends on photosynthesis is mainly controlled by inter annual water depth variability 4 2 implications of wetland restoration and optimal water levels water level is a key indicator for understanding hydrologic processes during ecological restoration initiatives ruiz jaen and aide 2005 liu et al 2020b although water level changes driven by water level fluctuations are generally greater gao and fang 2013 ahmadi et al 2016 li et al 2019b in shallow lake wetlands the coupled hydrologic and ecological process effect will also have an impact on ecological restoration as many studies have reported various ecological effects could result from this coupled effect such as changes to vegetation distribution patterns and the ecological functions of wetlands poff and zimmerman 2010 cui et al 2017a 2017b zhang et al 2017 the timing and frequency of water fluctuations will either intensify or decrease these ecological effects studies have suggested that decreasing water depths and prolonged dry seasons will lead to an increase in the plant growth season meng et al 2018 when water conditions exceed optimum values or the ecological extent of plant growth they will trigger adaptive mechanisms of vegetation morphology zhang et al 2019b thus water depth fluctuations impact c emissions by altering the biochemical processes of shallow wetlands jacinthe 2015 ye et al 2019 furthermore the byd hydrologic regime is also significantly affected by anthropogenic activities yang et al 2016 yin 2017 wang et al 2008 in the planning outline of the xiong an new area exogenous water transfer was determined to be the best method for wetland restoration wherein shallow lake wetlands undergo significant water level fluctuations over short term periods ahmadi et al 2016 however the main goal of water transfer operations is to maintain a high water depth and a large water area during the dry season i e from april to june which based on hydrological methods improves water supplies ren and liu 2017 considering the potential ecological effects it is critical to take the growth rhythms of typical wetland vegetation into account while ensuring the stability of their function when selecting water diversion timings and modes results from this study suggest that water transfer timings should be set to either february or january as an ecological water supplement after which it should be done once annually at a 40 day duration 5 conclusions biogeochemical processes i e c generation and emissions in shallow lakes are strongly influenced by hydrological regimes in this study co2 and ch4 emissions were sensitive to water level fluctuations as simulated by the wetland dndc model key findings are as follows i alterations in c flux are the result of combined water level fluctuation impacts namely water depth duration frequency and timing wherein the wetland module of the dndc model was able to provide reasonable results in simulating c flux ii c flux is strongly sensitive to water depth variation between 10 cm and 10 cm a water depth around 0 cm was determined to be the potential tipping point while the trend in δr was to first decrease and then to increase when water depth increased from 10 cm to 10 cm iii both co2 and ch4 exhibited their lowest emissions at a 40 day duration moreover c flux decreased at a lower water level fluctuation frequency particularly in january or february water levels fluctuate strongly in shallow lakes resulting from climate change and anthropogenic activities including practices associated with wetland restoration a greater understanding of suitable water level operation procedures is therefore essential as well as the application of optimal methods based on balancing c budgets during water diversion projects aimed solely at hydrologic recovery this study found that a concentrated water transfer supplement in january or february was better than dispersive water transfers at other times of the year special attention must be paid to studies that focus on comparable research as well as
