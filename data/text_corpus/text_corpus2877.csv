14385,the membrane composite of polyethersulfone pes integrated with hpei trimesoyl chloride tmc and cysteamine sh was prepared through interfacial polymerisation method for the removal of cadmium ii ions from water the prepared composite membranes were characterised for chemical composition surface charge and morphology of the polyamide thin layer the modified composite membranes known as polyethersulfone hyperbranched polyethyleneimine cysteamine pes hpei sh showed improved hydrophilicity and water intake capacity as compared to the unmodified pes membrane the batch experiments quantification analysis revealed that there was 22 53 and 99 cd2 removal for pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh respectively after 20 min of analyte adsorption pes hpei sh membrane displayed the highest adsorption efficiency which was due to the adsorption properties of sh that is based on the hard soft acid and base theory thiol has high affinity to form a strong covalent bond with heavy metal ions soft lewis acid subsequently forming co ordination 2r s cd2 r s cd 2h complexes hence the pes hpei sh membrane had the highest adsorption capacity of 135 59 mg cm 2 kinetics revealed that the adsorption reactions followed pseudo second order kinetic model meaning that chemisorption reaction took place keywords cadmium ii polyethersulfone hyperbranched polyethyleneimine cysteamine 1 introduction there is a lack of clean water worldwide as a result of water pollution 1 sources of water contamination include natural organic matter nom micro pollutants pesticides viruses bacteria nitrates and heavy metals 2 heavy metals are not easily degraded hence they bio accumulate in the environment and reach excessive levels in water 3 cadmium in particular has been reported to be toxic however there is limited literature on the removal of cadmium using membranes conventional water treatment methods such as chemical precipitation and ion exchange have been implemented in removal of toxic metal ions from water conversely these methods possess limitations in terms of cost secondary waste production and energy consumption 4 membrane technology amongst other water treatment methods has shown the ability to efficiently remove heavy metals membrane technology can be used in conjunction with other conventional methods for water treatment 5 sepehri et al conducted a study where a membrane bioreactor was used in conjunction with activated sludge the study focused mainly on the effect of nitrifying bacteria found in activated sludge on a membrane bioreactor an increase in the nitrifying bacteria in the activated sludge was found to increase permeation in the membrane bioreactor thus reducing fouling and consequently operation time 6 membrane technology is based on pressure driven process the advantages of membrane technology include low energy consumption flexibility selective permeation and low cost 7 8 functionalization of polymer membranes induces selectivity and performance efficiency 9 high performance membranes were developed via interfacial polymerisation by forming a thin film composite layer on the membrane thin film composite membranes have been widely explored in the synthesis of nanofiltration membranes the thin film top selective layer can be prepared via plasma initiated polymerization photo initiated polymerization and interfacial polymerization methods 10 however in this study an interfacial polymerization method was used for the preparation of thin film membrane composite due to its ability of producing a high permeable membrane at a room temperature the thin film forms at the interface during the reaction between trimesoyl chloride and polyamine source i e hyperbranched polyethyleneimine hpei this method is capable of enhancing the separation properties of the nanofiltration membranes 11 thin film composite membranes can easily be functionalized with different selective ligands 10 hyperbranched and dendritic polymers have been widely used in membrane fabrication as ligands and adsorption sites for heavy metal removal these dendritic polymers possess a high density of internal amine functional groups that are capable of acting as complexing ligands for metal ions such as cu2 fe2 and ni2 12 hyperbranched polyethyleneimine hpei also possess a high density of peripheral amine groups which can be used to easily functionalise the polymer with other molecules 12 hpei in this study was selected for this study based on its hydrophilic properties because of the presence of highly branched peripheral amine groups moreover this dendritic polymer has chelating abilities towards heavy metals thus leading to enhanced metal uptake 13 chen et al prepared a microfiltration membrane by blending cellulose acetate with hyperbranched polyethyleneimine 14 the membrane composite was used for the absorption of cu2 and bovine serum albumin bsa separately 14 the highest adsorption capacity of cu2 ion on the blended membrane was 7 42 mg g 15 on the other hand snoussi et al grafted hpei on the surface of mesoporous silica for the removal of cd2 from water 15 cadmium extraction experiments revealed that cd2 was effectively removed at ph 5 the adsorption uptake reached 625 mg g both studies showed improved cd2 removal efficiency due to the presence of hpei 15 cysteamine was chosen in this study to further enhance cd2 uptake and or the selectivity of cd2 zhang et al conducted a study where a thiol functionalized metal organic framework mof material was synthesized using the modified stöber method 16 the mof was used for the removal of cd2 and lead pb2 from water the mof adsorbent that was modified with thiol showed better adsorption capacity of 312 5 mg g for cd2 16 each layer of the thin film can be optimized during preparation thus interfacial polymerized membranes exhibit massive overall separation performance thin film composite membrane uses two type of removal mechanisms namely donnan exclusion theory and size exclusion where pollutants are removed based on their size and charge respectively 17 pes was used as a support due to its chemical mechanical thermal properties and a wide range of ph tolerance thus the main aim of this study was to functionalise a neat pes membranes with cysteamine and hpei and form a nanofiltration membranes so as to selectively remove cadmium from water 2 experimental 2 1 material hyperbranched polyethyleneimine hpei 50 w v lupasol wf mw 25 kda was purchased from basf calfornia usa commercially supplied flat sheet microdym nadir

at the interphase between organic and aqueous solution the aqueous phase was prepared by dissolving hpei in varying concentrations 2 4 6 and 8 in deionized water a microporous pes support substrate was attached to a glass plate followed by immersion in the hpei aqueous solution for 24 h pes hpei membranes were further immersed in trimesoyl chloride 0 15 hexane mixture for 60 s to form a polyamide thin film composite the thin film composite membranes were then rinsed with pure hexane and dried for 30 min at 80 c fig 1 a the membranes were denoted pes hpei and stored in the deionized water until further use 14 2 3 preparation of pes hpei sh functionalised membrane 4 dimethylaminopyridine 1 mmol and k2co3 15 mmol were dissolved in deionised water 20 ml potassium hydroxide koh 5 m

the cysteamine mixture for 1 h the membranes were then rinsed with deionised water and denoted pes hpei sh membranes as shown in fig 1b 15 the membranes were stored in the deionized water until further use 2 4 membrane characterisation pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh membranes were analysed using perkin elmer 100 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectrophotometer usa in order to

capacity was calculated by using eq 1 1 w a t e r i n t a k e c a p a c i t y w w w d w w 100 2 6 adsorption of heavy metals adsorption studies were performed using a modified method reported by zhu et al 18 pes hpei sh 16 cm2 thin film composite membrane was immersed in a 50 mg l of cd2 synthetic solution and real samples the samples were collected at different time intervals 5 10 15 and 20 min using a syringe the concentration of cd2 samples collected at various contact time with the membrane adsorbed at different ph was determined by asv and icp oes the amount of adsorbed cd2 was

detection of cadmium the square wave anodic stripping voltammetry swasv was used for the detection of cd2 in synthetic solution 0 1 ppm 50 ppm and real water samples using bare gce as the working electrode the optimized electrochemical parameters for the experiment which include electrodeposition potential of 200 mv deposition time of 180 s scan rate 50 mv s and 0 1 m hcl as the supporting electrolyte were applied analysis for these tests were performed in replicates 2 9 inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes the amount of cd2 in the solution before and after

is rearranged to eq 5 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t 3 results and discussion 3 1 atr ftir analysis attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir spectroscopy was used to verify the formation of polyamide thin film layer functionalised with cysteamine sh the interfacial polymerisation process between hpei fig 2 b and tmc fig 2c gave rise to the two bands at 1650 cm 1 and 1573 cm 1 which were ascribed to amide i c o and amide ii nh and this confirmed a newly formed amide bond in fig 2 d furthermore the disappearance of the acid chloride occl fig 2c at 1759 cm 1 gave further evidence that the polymerisation reaction occurred between the peripheral amine groups of hpei and tmc reactant moreover the bands at 2949 cm 1 and 1584 cm 1 are associated with ch stretching and nh bending respectively further confirming the polycondensation reaction between a polyfunctional amine and an acyl chloride fig 2d 19 fig 2 e displayed the spectra of pes hpei sh membrane due to the intrinsic nature of the sh group and the low concentration of the cysteamine introduced on the surface of the membranes the sh peak appeared to be very weak fig 2e 20 this could be due to low sensitivity of thiol group in atr ftir as a result of the high polarisability of the sulphur group 20 a zoomed image showing the sh peak at 2956 cm 1 figure s1 indicated that the cysteamine molecule was successfully attached to the surface of the thin film composite layer of the membrane xia et al observed similar results after the functionalization of oxide hydroxide nanowhiskers with thiol and the thionyl peak was detected at 2550 cm 1 using ftir analysis 21 3 2 raman analysis the membranes were analysed using raman spectroscopy to further confirm the attachment of the sh group onto the surface of the membrane the pes hpei sh membrane exhibited sh peak at 2520 cm 1 which is not present in pes hpei as illustrated in fig 3 the confirmation of the attachment of a thiol functional group using raman analysis by different researchers has been reported for example yin et al prepared thiol functionalised tfc membranes and observed the sh peak at 2520 cm 1 19 gökce et al also observed sh peak around 2650 2550 cm 1 when he was analysing 5 3 pyridyl 4h 1 2 4 triazole 3 thiol molecule using raman analysis 22 3 3 sem edx analysis fig 4 illustrated the scanning electron microscope sem images of pes pes hpei fig 4b e and pes hpei sh fig 4f membranes pes showed a smooth surface with no noticeable morphologies on the surface upon the formation of the thin film layer on the surface changes in surface morphology were observed an increase in the concentration of hpei i e from 2 to 8 loading led to the formation of more dense and rough membrane surface mahdavi et al obtained similar trend when preparing a polyurethane thin film composite membranes via interfacial polymerization of poly bis mpa and mdi on the polyethersulfone support 23 the membranes revealed rougher and non uniform surface the morphology of the polyurethane active layers became rougher as to different generations of hamster buccal pouch epithelium hbpe molecules were embedded on the membrane 23 zuo et al also observed similar change in morphology after interfacial polymerization between m phenylenediamine and tmc on torlon 4000t mv polyamide imide substrate 24 the unmodified membrane showed smooth surface however after modification via interfacial polymerization the surface become rougher and thicker confirming formation of a thin film layer 24 this further confirms the formation of the polyamide thin film on the surface of the pes fig 4 f shows the pes hpei sh membrane which demonstrates ridge valley and noodle morphology the addition of another layer on the surface of the thin film composite membrane often leads to a dense and irregular surface wu et al prepared a pes pei tmc membrane composite and observed a similar dense compact and ridge valley structure on the surface of the membrane with noodle like morphology 25 the energy dispersive x ray edx spectra assigned to pes figure s2a indicated the presence of o 0 52 kev c 0 27 kev and s 2 31 kev which is characteristic of polyethersulfone substrate moreover pes hpei spectra figure s2b showed presence n 2 27 kev and cl 0 27 kev and 2 61 kev the presence of n is due to the incorporation of hpei onto pes substrate the cl is due to the unreacted acyl chloride group from the tmc which was beneficial for the attachment of cysteamine onto the surface of the membrane the edx spectra of pes hpei sh figure s2c shows same elements as pes hpei figure s2b 3 4 afm analyses atomic force microscope afm is considered to be an imperative characterization technique for studying the surface roughness of the membranes the afm image analysis were carried out on a 3d dimensional mode the images showed and proved that the surface of pes became rougher after the addition of hpei the analysis further confirmed that pes hpei possess ridge valley structure where the bright areas represents the ridges and the dark ones represents the valleys 26 as displayed in fig 5 a pes and fig 5 b e pes hpei there was an increase in the surface roughness the surface roughness is explained in terms of the root mean square r q after interfacial polymerisation the root mean square for pes increased from 5 90 nm to 54 30 nm 74 50 nm 86 50 nm 124 80 nm and 101 67 nm for pes hpei 2 pes hpei 4 pes hpei 6 pes hpei 8 pes hpei sh respectively table 1 10 mansourpanah et al prepared thin film membranes via interfacial polymerisation between polyamidoamine and different acyl chloride reagents the mean surface roughness of the unmodified pes 90 nm was found to increase drastically to 140 nm when membranes were modified with pamam 1 5 go 3 10 this was due to the presence of the polyamine in an aqueous phase which changed the structure and morphology of the thin layers into more dense and compact structure 10 wu et al reported on a similar study where the mean surface roughness pes pei thin film membranes was found to increase with an increase in polymer loading 25 specifically in that study the modified thin film composite membranes showed a rougher surface than the pristine membrane the surface roughness increased with increasing concentration of pei moreover the composite membranes possessed ridge valley morphology 25 3 5 contact angle analysis the hydrophilic nature of the membranes was characterised using a sessile drop method fig 6 confirmed that the addition of different hpei concentration improved the hydrophilicity of the membranes the contact angle of pes 86 88 4 3 was decreased drastically after the edition of hpei to 56 4 6 38 3 7 32 5 1 26 2 3 and 32 9 7 for pes hpei 2 pes hpei 4 pes hpei 6 pes hpei 8 and pes hpei sh respectively this is due to the presence of the hydrophilicity primary and tertiary amine groups from the hpei molecule which induces hydrophilicity 18 zhu et al observed a similar trend where pes pristine substrate was modified with poly amidoamine dendrimer via interfacial polymerisation 18 the pes contact angle was found to be 70 however after incorporation of different generations of poly amidoamine dendrimer the contact angle of the membrane decreased to 50 the results confirmed that contact angle decreased as the generation of poly amidoamine dendrimer increased 18 this was due to the presence of polar primary and tertiary amine groups present in the dendritic polymer molecule which induces hydrophilicity in the membrane 3 6 water intake capacity there was an increase in water intake capacity as the concentration hpei increased on the surface of pes support substrate as shown in fig 7 water intake capacities increased from 9 3 0 5 for pes to 21 4 1 0 23 1 2 35 9 1 7 48 1 2 4 and 49 5 2 5 for pes pes hpei 2 pes hpei 4 pes hpei 6 and pes hpei 8 pes hpei sh respectively this is due to the presence of a long chain of primary and tertiary amine groups from the hpei 18 amine is a polar group thus easily form bonds with water molecules the water intake capacity of pes was very low due to its hydrophobic nature as shown contact angle results fig 7 this is associated with the extent of crosslinking during interfacial polymerisation in general thin film layer composites are not entirely cross linked hence they are less rigid this enhances the water uptake capacity of the membrane 27 the adsorption capacity of the membrane can be improved by a loosely packed structure thus resulting in hpei prone to swelling which in turn can increase water uptake of the membranes 27 3 7 heavy metal batch adsorption 3 7 1 electro chemical detection of cd2 the square wave voltammetry from varying cd2 concentrations 0 1 mg l 50 mg l was recorded the peak currents increased linearly with cd2 concentrations as displayed in fig 8 a however 10 mg l current peak was overlapping with 50 mg l the linear regression equation for the detection of cd2 was 1 39604 10 5 10 5 x 6 22189 10 5 10 5 with correlation coefficient of r2 0 97 fig 8b idris et al obtained a similar trend where the current signal was increasing with an increase in as3 concentration during electro chemical detection of as3 using glassy carbon electrode and glassy carbon electrode aunp s 12 3 8 electro chemical detection of cd2 in synthetic solutions and water sample there was a decrease in the current signal due to a decrease in cd2 concentrations after adsorption using pes membrane composites the 50 ppm cd2 current signal decreased from 0 00121 i ma to 0 00101 i ma 6 606 10 4 10 4 i ma and 2 254 10 5 10 5 i ma for pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh respectively as shown in fig 9 this meant that there was 22 53 and 99 cadmium removal after 20 min adsorption by pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh respectively the calculated adsorption capacities for the membranes were 33 32 84 03 and 135 59 mg cm 2 for pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh respectively the decrease in cd2 is directly proportional to the increase in the adsorption periods 0 min 5 min 10 min 15 min and 20 this was due to the fact that the longer the contact time between membrane and the metal ion solution more cd2 ions were able to reach more adsorption active sites until equilibrium was reached 28 pes adsorption exhibited a negligible decline in the current signal due to lack of selectivity and adsorption efficiency pes hpei showed greater adsorption efficiency compared to pristine pes this is due to the presence of the lone pair in the amine groups from hpei the lone pairs chelated and complexed the metal ion by forming a metal ligand complex 28 however pes hpei showed lower adsorption efficiency in comparison to pes hpei sh this could be due to the protonation of the amine groups h2n r h h3n r ph 7 in the acidic medium ph 2 consequently reducing adsorption through repulsion between the positively charged metal ion and the membrane surface 12 pes hpei sh membrane showed the highest adsorption efficiency in comparison to both pes and pes hpei membranes this is due to the adsorption properties of s h based on the hard soft acid and base hsab theory 29 cadmium ion as a soft acid has high affinity for thiol soft base thiol is highly polarisable as a result it is capable of strongly interacting with low lying orbitals of soft acids cd2 30 according to hard soft acid and base theory cadmium is classified as a soft lewis acid with high affinity to form a strong covalent bond with sh soft lewis base subsequently forming co ordination 2r s cd2 r s cd 2h complexes with heavy metal ions 31 the thiol molecule is highly polarisable and as a result it can easily transfer the electrons to the centre of the metal forming coordination complex fardmousavi et al reported a high selectivity and adsorption efficiency of a thiol functionalised hierarchical zeolite nanocomposite 30 the adsorption experiments showed that the adsorbent has excellent adsorption capacity of 8 2 mg g 1 towards mercury soft lewis acid the adsorption was also explained using hard soft acid and base theory 30 3 9 adsorption kinetics and adsorption capacity as shown in fig 10 a and b the adsorption of cd2 was quite rapid for 5 min of adsorption however it slowed down until the equilibrium with regard to pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh most metals ions were adsorbed in the first 10 min which showed that the adsorption rates of all membranes were quite high as shown in fig 10 a the initial faster adsorption rate maybe due the availability uncovered adsorption sites on the surface since the rate of adsorption depend mainly of the surface area of the adsorbent 31 however pes hpei showed lower adsorption capacity in comparison to pes hpei sh fig 10b this could be due to the protonation of the amine groups h2n r h h3n r ph 7 in the acidic medium ph 2 consequently reducing adsorption capacity through repulsion between the positively charged metal ion and the membrane surface 32 also the adsorption capacity of pes hpei was higher than that of pes this is due to the ability of amine groups to chelate metal ions through transfer of electrons from tertiary amine to the centre of the metal via ligand to metal charge transfer figure s3 32 pes hpei sh membrane showed the highest adsorption efficiency in comparison to both pes and pes hpei membranes this is due to the adsorption properties of s h based on the hard soft acid and base hsab theory in order to precisely evaluate the adsorption reaction kinetics the two kinetics models namely pseudo first order kinetics and pseudo second order kinetics were to assess empirical data and to find the regulating mechanisms of the adsorption process the kinetic parameters are as shown in table 2 the correlation coefficient values of pseudo second order kinetics are higher than those of pseudo first order kinetics consequently confirming that the reaction follows pseudo second order kinetics and is chemisorption as it can be seen in table 2 pseudo second order rate constant k2 is the lowest indicating the saturation of the available adsorption sites by forming a monolayer coverage of the metal ion on the surface of the membrane 29 pseudo second order kinetic equation was developed for the sorption process and there are three consecutive steps taking place on the surface of the porous membrane adsorbent 1 migration of the metal ions from the solution to the surface of the adsorbent 2 migration of the metal ions into the pores of the adsorbent and 3 adsorption of the metal ions on the interior surface 33 3 10 quantification of cd2 in synthetic solution using icp oes the quantification of cd2 in standard solutions by asv was compared to icp oes to establish whether the methods complemented each other but during icpoes analysis of cd2 a multi element standard synthetic solution containing other metal ions such as cr2 fe2 zn2 co2 pb2 and cu2 was used the effect of contact time between the membranes and the metal ion solution was detected by using icp oes analysis and the results are illustrated in fig 11 the adsorption increased over increasing contact time between cd2 and the adsorbent the adsorption of cd2 was quite fast 5 min of adsorption and slowed down until the equilibrium this is due to saturation of adsorption sites by metals ions and presence of other metals ions such as cr2 fe2 zn2 co2 pb2 and cu2 competing for the adsorption sites the initial faster adsorption rate was due the availability of multiple adsorption sites on the membrane since the rate of adsorption depend mainly of the surface area of the adsorbent 31 pes hpei sh gave the highest adsorption performance followed by pes hpei and pes i e after 20 min adsorption the removal percentages for pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh were 1 02 13 96 and 34 68 respectively 28 pes adsorption showed a negligible decline in the concentration signal due to lack of selectivity and adsorption efficiency 28 pes hpei sh membrane showed the highest adsorption efficiency in comparison to both pes and pes hpei membranes this is due to the adsorption properties of s h based on the hard soft acid and base hsab theory 3 11 quantification of cadmium in real water sample using asv and icp oes the cd2 was adsorbed from the real water sample from municipality east london using pes hpei sh membrane under optimized conditions the cadmium ii concentration detected using asv before adsorption was 0 5905 ppm afterwards it decreased to 0 07590 ppm therefore 87 of cd2 was removed from the real water sample the same analysis was repeated where the concentration of cadmium ii removed by pes hpei sh membrane was analysed using icpoes the thiol modified membrane showed 62 50 cd2 removal after 20 min contact time with real water sample fig 12 more cd2 could have been removed but due to the interferences of other organic pollutants in the real water samples competing for the active sides on the membrane resulted in only 62 50 cadmium ii removal 34 the mechanism of cd2 adsorption onto the pes hpei sh confirmed that the thiol groups played a major role in complexing the metal ion on the surface of this membrane 4 4 conclusion the thin film polyamide layer was successfully grafted on the surface of pes support substrate via interfacial polymerization method thiol was covalently bonded on polyamide thin film layer via acyl chloride substitution afm analysis revealed that the modified membrane composites possess ridge valley and noodle morphology with increased surface roughness contact angle and water intake capacity revealed that varying concentrations of hpei have an impact on the hydrophilicity of the membrane due to the presence of peripheral tertiary amine groups from the hpei polymer the batch adsorption experiments of 50 mg l cd2 using asv showed removal percentage of 22 53 and 99 cadmium removal after 20 min adsorption for pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh respectively the calculated adsorption capacities for the membranes were 33 32 84 03 and 135 59 mg cm 2 ml for pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh respectively in icp oes results pes hpei sh presented the highest adsorption performance followed by pes hpei and pes i e after 20 min adsorption the removal percentage for pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh were 1 02 13 96 and 34 68 respectively icp oes analysis for the real water samples revealed that the optimum membrane pes hpei sh had 62 5 successful removal of cd2 after 20 min adsorption kinetic studies confirmed that the adsorption reactions follows pseudo second order kinetics which means the adsorption was chemisorption the results showed that the attachment of sh on the membrane enhances the selectivity and subsequently increased the cadmium

14385,the membrane composite of polyethersulfone pes integrated with hpei trimesoyl chloride tmc and cysteamine sh was prepared through interfacial polymerisation method for the removal of cadmium ii ions from water the prepared composite membranes were characterised for chemical composition surface charge and morphology of the polyamide thin layer the modified composite membranes known as polyethersulfone hyperbranched polyethyleneimine cysteamine pes hpei sh showed improved hydrophilicity and water intake capacity as compared to the unmodified pes membrane the batch experiments quantification analysis revealed that there was 22 53 and 99 cd2 removal for pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh respectively after 20 min of analyte adsorption pes hpei sh membrane displayed the highest adsorption efficiency which was due to the adsorption properties of sh that is based on the hard soft acid and base theory thiol has high affinity to form a strong covalent bond with heavy metal ions soft lewis acid subsequently forming co ordination 2r s cd2 r s cd 2h complexes hence the pes hpei sh membrane had the highest adsorption capacity of 135 59 mg cm 2 kinetics revealed that the adsorption reactions followed pseudo second order kinetic model meaning that chemisorption reaction took place keywords cadmium ii polyethersulfone hyperbranched polyethyleneimine cysteamine 1 introduction there is a lack of clean water worldwide as a result of water pollution 1 sources of water contamination include natural organic matter nom micro pollutants pesticides viruses bacteria nitrates and heavy metals 2 heavy metals are not easily degraded hence they bio accumulate in the environment and reach excessive levels in water 3 cadmium in particular has been reported to be toxic however there is limited literature on the removal of cadmium using membranes conventional water treatment methods such as chemical precipitation and ion exchange have been implemented in removal of toxic metal ions from water conversely these methods possess limitations in terms of cost secondary waste production and energy consumption 4 membrane technology amongst other water treatment methods has shown the ability to efficiently remove heavy metals membrane technology can be used in conjunction with other conventional methods for water treatment 5 sepehri et al conducted a study where a membrane bioreactor was used in conjunction with activated sludge the study focused mainly on the effect of nitrifying bacteria found in activated sludge on a membrane bioreactor an increase in the nitrifying bacteria in the activated sludge was found to increase permeation in the membrane bioreactor thus reducing fouling and consequently operation time 6 membrane technology is based on pressure driven process the advantages of membrane technology include low energy consumption flexibility selective permeation and low cost 7 8 functionalization of polymer membranes induces selectivity and performance efficiency 9 high performance membranes were developed via interfacial polymerisation by forming a thin film composite layer on the membrane thin film composite membranes have been widely explored in the synthesis of nanofiltration membranes the thin film top selective layer can be prepared via plasma initiated polymerization photo initiated polymerization and interfacial polymerization methods 10 however in this study an interfacial polymerization method was used for the preparation of thin film membrane composite due to its ability of producing a high permeable membrane at a room temperature the thin film forms at the interface during the reaction between trimesoyl chloride and polyamine source i e hyperbranched polyethyleneimine hpei this method is capable of enhancing the separation properties of the nanofiltration membranes 11 thin film composite membranes can easily be functionalized with different selective ligands 10 hyperbranched and dendritic polymers have been widely used in membrane fabrication as ligands and adsorption sites for heavy metal removal these dendritic polymers possess a high density of internal amine functional groups that are capable of acting as complexing ligands for metal ions such as cu2 fe2 and ni2 12 hyperbranched polyethyleneimine hpei also possess a high density of peripheral amine groups which can be used to easily functionalise the polymer with other molecules 12 hpei in this study was selected for this study based on its hydrophilic properties because of the presence of highly branched peripheral amine groups moreover this dendritic polymer has chelating abilities towards heavy metals thus leading to enhanced metal uptake 13 chen et al prepared a microfiltration membrane by blending cellulose acetate with hyperbranched polyethyleneimine 14 the membrane composite was used for the absorption of cu2 and bovine serum albumin bsa separately 14 the highest adsorption capacity of cu2 ion on the blended membrane was 7 42 mg g 15 on the other hand snoussi et al grafted hpei on the surface of mesoporous silica for the removal of cd2 from water 15 cadmium extraction experiments revealed that cd2 was effectively removed at ph 5 the adsorption uptake reached 625 mg g both studies showed improved cd2 removal efficiency due to the presence of hpei 15 cysteamine was chosen in this study to further enhance cd2 uptake and or the selectivity of cd2 zhang et al conducted a study where a thiol functionalized metal organic framework mof material was synthesized using the modified stöber method 16 the mof was used for the removal of cd2 and lead pb2 from water the mof adsorbent that was modified with thiol showed better adsorption capacity of 312 5 mg g for cd2 16 each layer of the thin film can be optimized during preparation thus interfacial polymerized membranes exhibit massive overall separation performance thin film composite membrane uses two type of removal mechanisms namely donnan exclusion theory and size exclusion where pollutants are removed based on their size and charge respectively 17 pes was used as a support due to its chemical mechanical thermal properties and a wide range of ph tolerance thus the main aim of this study was to functionalise a neat pes membranes with cysteamine and hpei and form a nanofiltration membranes so as to selectively remove cadmium from water 2 experimental 2 1 material hyperbranched polyethyleneimine hpei 50 w v lupasol wf mw 25 kda was purchased from basf calfornia usa commercially supplied flat sheet microdym nadir

the cysteamine mixture for 1 h the membranes were then rinsed with deionised water and denoted pes hpei sh membranes as shown in fig 1b 15 the membranes were stored in the deionized water until further use 2 4 membrane characterisation pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh membranes were analysed using perkin elmer 100 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectrophotometer usa in order to

et al 18 pes hpei sh 16 cm2 thin film composite membrane was immersed in a 50 mg l of cd2 synthetic solution and real samples the samples were collected at different time intervals 5 10 15 and 20 min using a syringe the concentration of cd2 samples collected at various contact time with the membrane adsorbed at different ph was determined by asv and icp oes the amount of adsorbed cd2 was

verify the formation of polyamide thin film layer functionalised with cysteamine sh the interfacial polymerisation process between hpei fig 2 b and tmc fig 2c gave rise to the two bands at 1650 cm 1 and 1573 cm 1 which were ascribed to amide i c o and amide ii nh and this confirmed a newly formed amide bond in fig 2 d furthermore the disappearance of the acid chloride occl fig 2c at 1759 cm 1 gave further evidence that the polymerisation reaction occurred between the peripheral amine groups of hpei and tmc reactant moreover the bands at 2949 cm 1 and 1584 cm 1 are associated with ch stretching and nh bending respectively further confirming the polycondensation reaction between a polyfunctional amine and an acyl chloride fig 2d 19 fig 2 e displayed the spectra of pes hpei sh membrane due to the intrinsic nature of the sh group and the low concentration of the cysteamine introduced on the surface of the membranes the sh peak appeared to be very weak fig 2e 20 this could be due to low sensitivity of thiol group in atr ftir as a result of the high polarisability of the sulphur group 20 a zoomed image showing the sh peak at 2956 cm 1 figure s1 indicated that the cysteamine molecule was successfully attached to the surface of the thin film composite layer of the membrane xia et al observed similar results after the functionalization of oxide hydroxide nanowhiskers with thiol and the thionyl peak was detected at 2550 cm 1 using ftir analysis 21 3 2 raman analysis the membranes were analysed using raman spectroscopy to further confirm the attachment of the sh group onto the surface of the membrane the pes hpei sh membrane exhibited sh peak at 2520 cm 1 which is not present in pes hpei as illustrated in fig 3 the confirmation of the attachment of a thiol functional group using raman analysis by different researchers has been reported for example yin et al prepared thiol functionalised tfc membranes and observed the sh peak at 2520 cm 1 19 gökce et al also observed sh peak around 2650 2550 cm 1 when he was analysing 5 3 pyridyl 4h 1 2 4 triazole 3 thiol molecule using raman analysis 22 3 3 sem edx analysis fig 4 illustrated the scanning electron microscope sem images of pes pes hpei fig 4b e and pes hpei sh fig 4f membranes pes showed a smooth surface with no noticeable morphologies on the surface upon the formation of the thin film layer on the surface changes in surface morphology were observed an increase in the concentration of hpei i e from 2 to 8 loading led to the formation of more dense and rough membrane surface mahdavi et al obtained similar trend when preparing a polyurethane thin film composite membranes via interfacial polymerization of poly bis mpa and mdi on the polyethersulfone support 23 the membranes revealed rougher and non uniform surface the morphology of the polyurethane active layers became rougher as to different generations of hamster buccal pouch epithelium hbpe molecules were embedded on the membrane 23 zuo et al also observed similar change in morphology after interfacial polymerization between m phenylenediamine and tmc on torlon 4000t mv polyamide imide substrate 24 the unmodified membrane showed smooth surface however after modification via interfacial polymerization the surface become rougher and thicker confirming formation of a thin film layer 24 this further confirms the formation of the polyamide thin film on the surface of the pes fig 4 f shows the pes hpei sh membrane which demonstrates ridge valley and noodle morphology the addition of another layer on the surface of the thin film composite membrane often leads to a dense and irregular surface wu et al prepared a pes pei tmc membrane composite and observed a similar dense compact and ridge valley structure on the surface of the membrane with noodle like morphology 25 the energy dispersive x ray edx spectra assigned to pes figure s2a indicated the presence of o 0 52 kev c 0 27 kev and s 2 31 kev which is characteristic of polyethersulfone substrate moreover pes hpei spectra figure s2b showed presence n 2 27 kev and cl 0 27 kev and 2 61 kev the presence of n is due to the incorporation of hpei onto pes substrate the cl is due to the unreacted acyl chloride group from the tmc which was beneficial for the attachment of cysteamine onto the surface of the membrane the edx spectra of pes hpei sh figure s2c shows same elements as pes hpei figure s2b 3 4 afm analyses atomic force microscope afm is considered to be an imperative characterization technique for studying the surface roughness of the membranes the afm image analysis were carried out on a 3d dimensional mode the images showed and proved that the surface of pes became rougher after the addition of hpei the analysis further confirmed that pes hpei possess ridge valley structure where the bright areas represents the ridges and the dark ones represents the valleys 26 as displayed in fig 5 a pes and fig 5 b e pes hpei there was an increase in the surface roughness the surface roughness is explained in terms of the root mean square r q after interfacial polymerisation the root mean square for pes increased from 5 90 nm to 54 30 nm 74 50 nm 86 50 nm 124 80 nm and 101 67 nm for pes hpei 2 pes hpei 4 pes hpei 6 pes hpei 8 pes hpei sh respectively table 1 10 mansourpanah et al prepared thin film membranes via interfacial polymerisation between polyamidoamine and different acyl chloride reagents the mean surface roughness of the unmodified pes 90 nm was found to increase drastically to 140 nm when membranes were modified with pamam 1 5 go 3 10 this was due to the presence of the polyamine in an aqueous phase which changed the structure and morphology of the thin layers into more dense and compact structure 10 wu et al reported on a similar study where the mean surface roughness pes pei thin film membranes was found to increase with an increase in polymer loading 25 specifically in that study the modified thin film composite membranes showed a rougher surface than the pristine membrane the surface roughness increased with increasing concentration of pei moreover the composite membranes possessed ridge valley morphology 25 3 5 contact angle analysis the hydrophilic nature of the membranes was characterised using a sessile drop method fig 6 confirmed that the addition of different hpei concentration improved the hydrophilicity of the membranes the contact angle of pes 86 88 4 3 was decreased drastically after the edition of hpei to 56 4 6 38 3 7 32 5 1 26 2 3 and 32 9 7 for pes hpei 2 pes hpei 4 pes hpei 6 pes hpei 8 and pes hpei sh respectively this is due to the presence of the hydrophilicity primary and tertiary amine groups from the hpei molecule which induces hydrophilicity 18 zhu et al observed a similar trend where pes pristine substrate was modified with poly amidoamine dendrimer via interfacial polymerisation 18 the pes contact angle was found to be 70 however after incorporation of different generations of poly amidoamine dendrimer the contact angle of the membrane decreased to 50 the results confirmed that contact angle decreased as the generation of poly amidoamine dendrimer increased 18 this was due to the presence of polar primary and tertiary amine groups present in the dendritic polymer molecule which induces hydrophilicity in the membrane 3 6 water intake capacity there was an increase in water intake capacity as the concentration hpei increased on the surface of pes support substrate as shown in fig 7 water intake capacities increased from 9 3 0 5 for pes to 21 4 1 0 23 1 2 35 9 1 7 48 1 2 4 and 49 5 2 5 for pes pes hpei 2 pes hpei 4 pes hpei 6 and pes hpei 8 pes hpei sh respectively this is due to the presence of a long chain of primary and tertiary amine groups from the hpei 18 amine is a polar group thus easily form bonds with water molecules the water intake capacity of pes was very low due to its hydrophobic nature as shown contact angle results fig 7 this is associated with the extent of crosslinking during interfacial polymerisation in general thin film layer composites are not entirely cross linked hence they are less rigid this enhances the water uptake capacity of the membrane 27 the adsorption capacity of the membrane can be improved by a loosely packed structure thus resulting in hpei prone to swelling which in turn can increase water uptake of the membranes 27 3 7 heavy metal batch adsorption 3 7 1 electro chemical detection of cd2 the square wave voltammetry from varying cd2 concentrations 0 1 mg l 50 mg l was recorded the peak currents increased linearly with cd2 concentrations as displayed in fig 8 a however 10 mg l current peak was overlapping with 50 mg l the linear regression equation for the detection of cd2 was 1 39604 10 5 10 5 x 6 22189 10 5 10 5 with correlation coefficient of r2 0 97 fig 8b idris et al obtained a similar trend where the current signal was increasing with an increase in as3 concentration during electro chemical detection of as3 using glassy carbon electrode and glassy carbon electrode aunp s 12 3 8 electro chemical detection of cd2 in synthetic solutions and water sample there was a decrease in the current signal due to a decrease in cd2 concentrations after adsorption using pes membrane composites the 50 ppm cd2 current signal decreased from 0 00121 i ma to 0 00101 i ma 6 606 10 4 10 4 i ma and 2 254 10 5 10 5 i ma for pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh respectively as shown in fig 9 this meant that there was 22 53 and 99 cadmium removal after 20 min adsorption by pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh respectively the calculated adsorption capacities for the membranes were 33 32 84 03 and 135 59 mg cm 2 for pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh respectively the decrease in cd2 is directly proportional to the increase in the adsorption periods 0 min 5 min 10 min 15 min and 20 this was due to the fact that the longer the contact time between membrane and the metal ion solution more cd2 ions were able to reach more adsorption active sites until equilibrium was reached 28 pes adsorption exhibited a negligible decline in the current signal due to lack of selectivity and adsorption efficiency pes hpei showed greater adsorption efficiency compared to pristine pes this is due to the presence of the lone pair in the amine groups from hpei the lone pairs chelated and complexed the metal ion by forming a metal ligand complex 28 however pes hpei showed lower adsorption efficiency in comparison to pes hpei sh this could be due to the protonation of the amine groups h2n r h h3n r ph 7 in the acidic medium ph 2 consequently reducing adsorption through repulsion between the positively charged metal ion and the membrane surface 12 pes hpei sh membrane showed the highest adsorption efficiency in comparison to both pes and pes hpei membranes this is due to the adsorption properties of s h based on the hard soft acid and base hsab theory 29 cadmium ion as a soft acid has high affinity for thiol soft base thiol is highly polarisable as a result it is capable of strongly interacting with low lying orbitals of soft acids cd2 30 according to hard soft acid and base theory cadmium is classified as a soft lewis acid with high affinity to form a strong covalent bond with sh soft lewis base subsequently forming co ordination 2r s cd2 r s cd 2h complexes with heavy metal ions 31 the thiol molecule is highly polarisable and as a result it can easily transfer the electrons to the centre of the metal forming coordination complex fardmousavi et al reported a high selectivity and adsorption efficiency of a thiol functionalised hierarchical zeolite nanocomposite 30 the adsorption experiments showed that the adsorbent has excellent adsorption capacity of 8 2 mg g 1 towards mercury soft lewis acid the adsorption was also explained using hard soft acid and base theory 30 3 9 adsorption kinetics and adsorption capacity as shown in fig 10 a and b the adsorption of cd2 was quite rapid for 5 min of adsorption however it slowed down until the equilibrium with regard to pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh most metals ions were adsorbed in the first 10 min which showed that the adsorption rates of all membranes were quite high as shown in fig 10 a the initial faster adsorption rate maybe due the availability uncovered adsorption sites on the surface since the rate of adsorption depend mainly of the surface area of the adsorbent 31 however pes hpei showed lower adsorption capacity in comparison to pes hpei sh fig 10b this could be due to the protonation of the amine groups h2n r h h3n r ph 7 in the acidic medium ph 2 consequently reducing adsorption capacity through repulsion between the positively charged metal ion and the membrane surface 32 also the adsorption capacity of pes hpei was higher than that of pes this is due to the ability of amine groups to chelate metal ions through transfer of electrons from tertiary amine to the centre of the metal via ligand to metal charge transfer figure s3 32 pes hpei sh membrane showed the highest adsorption efficiency in comparison to both pes and pes hpei membranes this is due to the adsorption properties of s h based on the hard soft acid and base hsab theory in order to precisely evaluate the adsorption reaction kinetics the two kinetics models namely pseudo first order kinetics and pseudo second order kinetics were to assess empirical data and to find the regulating mechanisms of the adsorption process the kinetic parameters are as shown in table 2 the correlation coefficient values of pseudo second order kinetics are higher than those of pseudo first order kinetics consequently confirming that the reaction follows pseudo second order kinetics and is chemisorption as it can be seen in table 2 pseudo second order rate constant k2 is the lowest indicating the saturation of the available adsorption sites by forming a monolayer coverage of the metal ion on the surface of the membrane 29 pseudo second order kinetic equation was developed for the sorption process and there are three consecutive steps taking place on the surface of the porous membrane adsorbent 1 migration of the metal ions from the solution to the surface of the adsorbent 2 migration of the metal ions into the pores of the adsorbent and 3 adsorption of the metal ions on the interior surface 33 3 10 quantification of cd2 in synthetic solution using icp oes the quantification of cd2 in standard solutions by asv was compared to icp oes to establish whether the methods complemented each other but during icpoes analysis of cd2 a multi element standard synthetic solution containing other metal ions such as cr2 fe2 zn2 co2 pb2 and cu2 was used the effect of contact time between the membranes and the metal ion solution was detected by using icp oes analysis and the results are illustrated in fig 11 the adsorption increased over increasing contact time between cd2 and the adsorbent the adsorption of cd2 was quite fast 5 min of adsorption and slowed down until the equilibrium this is due to saturation of adsorption sites by metals ions and presence of other metals ions such as cr2 fe2 zn2 co2 pb2 and cu2 competing for the adsorption sites the initial faster adsorption rate was due the availability of multiple adsorption sites on the membrane since the rate of adsorption depend mainly of the surface area of the adsorbent 31 pes hpei sh gave the highest adsorption performance followed by pes hpei and pes i e after 20 min adsorption the removal percentages for pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh were 1 02 13 96 and 34 68 respectively 28 pes adsorption showed a negligible decline in the concentration signal due to lack of selectivity and adsorption efficiency 28 pes hpei sh membrane showed the highest adsorption efficiency in comparison to both pes and pes hpei membranes this is due to the adsorption properties of s h based on the hard soft acid and base hsab theory 3 11 quantification of cadmium in real water sample using asv and icp oes the cd2 was adsorbed from the real water sample from municipality east london using pes hpei sh membrane under optimized conditions the cadmium ii concentration detected using asv before adsorption was 0 5905 ppm afterwards it decreased to 0 07590 ppm therefore 87 of cd2 was removed from the real water sample the same analysis was repeated where the concentration of cadmium ii removed by pes hpei sh membrane was analysed using icpoes the thiol modified membrane showed 62 50 cd2 removal after 20 min contact time with real water sample fig 12 more cd2 could have been removed but due to the interferences of other organic pollutants in the real water samples competing for the active sides on the membrane resulted in only 62 50 cadmium ii removal 34 the mechanism of cd2 adsorption onto the pes hpei sh confirmed that the thiol groups played a major role in complexing the metal ion on the surface of this membrane 4 4 conclusion the thin film polyamide layer was successfully grafted on the surface of pes support substrate via interfacial polymerization method thiol was covalently bonded on polyamide thin film layer via acyl chloride substitution afm analysis revealed that the modified membrane composites possess ridge valley and noodle morphology with increased surface roughness contact angle and water intake capacity revealed that varying concentrations of hpei have an impact on the hydrophilicity of the membrane due to the presence of peripheral tertiary amine groups from the hpei polymer the batch adsorption experiments of 50 mg l cd2 using asv showed removal percentage of 22 53 and 99 cadmium removal after 20 min adsorption for pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh respectively the calculated adsorption capacities for the membranes were 33 32 84 03 and 135 59 mg cm 2 ml for pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh respectively in icp oes results pes hpei sh presented the highest adsorption performance followed by pes hpei and pes i e after 20 min adsorption the removal percentage for pes pes hpei and pes hpei sh were 1 02 13 96 and 34 68 respectively icp oes analysis for the real water samples revealed that the optimum membrane pes hpei sh had 62 5 successful removal of cd2 after 20 min adsorption kinetic studies confirmed that the adsorption reactions follows pseudo second order kinetics which means the adsorption was chemisorption the results showed that the attachment of sh on the membrane enhances the selectivity and subsequently increased the cadmium

14386,novel tri bore hollow fiber membranes have been developed from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf for the control the dissolved oxygen do in aquaculture denitrification process the fabricated hollow fibers are characterized in terms of morphology porosity hydrophobicity and mechanical strength two membrane modules each including 200 pieces of hollow fibers are connected in series or parallel in order to determine the optimum operation mode the deoxygenation test is firstly conducted for di water and then for aquaculture water various methods including water flushing air blowing or chemical cleaning have been applied to assure the cleaning efficiency after membrane fouling a mathematical model has been developed by using the resistance in series concept by taking into account boundary layer and membrane characteristics overall mass transfer coefficient radial and axial concentration profiles and molar flux of oxygen at different water flow rates are calculated this work has demonstrated that the developed tri bore hollow fiber membranes are applicable for the control of dissolved oxygen in aquaculture water the observations have provided solid evidence for the development of membrane based denitrification system for recirculating aquaculture system ras keywords tri bore hollow fiber dissolved oxygen mass transfer aquaculture deoxygenation 1 introduction there is growing interest in recirculating aquaculture system ras in recent years due to the worsening pollution of the sea lakes and rivers and the expectation on more intensified production to feed the growing population ras enables minimum water consumption offers improved control of culture conditions and allows accurate quantification of culturing conditions and their effects on physiological rates such as aeration feeding fresh water and waste accumulation and disposal 1 3 ras makes it possible to place the farms in locations where water resources are limited and offers the flexibility of switching the culturing species to follow the market demand or preference for seafood products 4 5 nevertheless the accumulation of nitrate in ras facilities as the end product of nitrification affects the growth of culturing species and it is more serious in the systems where nitrifying biofilters are used 6 water consumption and environmental impact are also driving forces for nitrate control in ras 7 to control the nitrate level in ras two methods have been commonly practiced one method is to exchange a fraction of water in the culturing system each day with water low in nitrate 8 easy to be implemented water replacement is being used in many ras facilities except for the consumption of a large quantity of water the same amount of wastewater containing dissolved solids and dissolved nutrients is discharged everyday discharge of nitrate into receiving water courses would adversely affect the existing aqueous ecosystems and incur unexpected situations such as algal booming 7 9 another method is to convert nitrate through a biological process named as denitrificaiton denitrification depends on facultative heterotrophic bacteria which reduces nitrate no3 to nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o before eventually converted to n2 2 7 9 12 though relatively expensive compared with water replacement biological denitrification attracts more attention recently because it offers high rate of nitrate removal and minimizes the discharge of wastewater and consumption of new water constructed wetland algal pond and aquaponics have also been used for nitrate removal but they are mainly for other culturing systems 13 14 facultative bacteria need a carbon source as food to live while facultative bacteria get their oxygen by taking dissolved oxygen do from water or taking it off nitrate molecules if both do and nitrate are present facultative bacteria tend to prefer oxygen it is commonly perceived that do acts as an inhibitory and toxic agent to anaerobic treatment because the invasion of oxygen influences the activity of denitrifying bacteria 15 17 in the study of tan et al the optimum do level for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification was 0 5 1 0 ppm and the total nitrogen removal efficiency was observed at 70 6 17 the nitrogen removal efficiency was compromised when the do concentration was beyond 1 0 ppm it was reported that denitrification could occur at the do level of 3 5 ppm but the increase in do levels could cause severe drop of the denitrification performance and the consumption rate of the carbon source was increased 18 20 as disclosed by gutieerez wing et al the denitrification rate dropped from 5 5 to 0 5 no3 n l 1 d 1 when the do level increased from 0 5 to 4 0 ppm xu et al observed a denitrification efficiency of 50 at do levels higher than 4 ppm 21 therefore anaerobic environment with proper do control is essential to the efficiency and stability of denitrification it is hard to completely avoid the invasion of oxygen into the anaerobic denitrification system because most reactors are operated within an aerobic open environment however proper control of do level favors the denitrification process and is thus preferable oxygen scavenging agents such as sodium sulfite and iron sulfide were effective to deplete do from anaerobic bioreactors 22 the reaction of reducing agents and do generates solid products that are contaminants and it brings environmental and safety hazards due to storing and handling chemicals 23 more seriously the reducing agents and the products of reduction reaction would have adverse influences on the aquatic species membrane contactors packed with slim hollow fibers have been developed and used for effective control of do level in semiconductor ultrapure water 24 however no suitable membrane contactors are available for anaerobic denitrification systems which contains various foulants dual layer membrane formation using different polymers was reported by xia et al 25 this might be an option to improve the antifouling property of deoxygenation membranes if the fabrication is scalable the objective of this study was to develop robust tri bore hollow fiber hf membranes for the removal of do from aquaculture water the hf membranes were characterized in terms of morphology hydrophobicity porosity and mechanical strength the performance of the fabricated membranes were evaluated for the deoxygenation of deionized di water and aquaculture water various cleaning methods were applied to clean the membranes after fouled by aquaculture water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials kynar hsv 900 pvdf supplied by arkema inc was used for the fabrication of tri bore hf membranes n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 99 5 and polyethylene glycol 200 peg200 99 0 used in membrane fabrication were supplied by merck di water from milli q millipore system was used in all experiments the aquaculture water was supplied by a fish farming company in singapore whatman grade 1 filter paper with pore size of 11 μm was used for the pretreatment of the aquaculture water 2 2 preparation and characterization of tri bore hf membranes tri bore hf membranes were fabricated via a dry jet wet phase inversion spinning process as documented elsewhere 26 28 briefly the dope solution and bore fluid were supplied at specified flow rates by isco syringe pumps teledyne 1000d after entering the coagulation bath the nascent fibers precipitated and were collected by a take up roller detailed spinning conditions are summarized in table 1 after spinning the as spun tri bore hf membranes were immersed in tap water for 2 days to completely remove the residual solvent and additives the fibers were then frozen in a refrigerator and dried overnight in a freeze drier s61 modulyo d thermo electron membrane morphology was inspected using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jeol jsm 7600f for fesem inspection membrane samples were fractured cryogenically in liquid nitrogen and coated with platinum using a sputtering coater jeol jfc 1600 dynamic contact angle of the outer surface of the fibers was measured using a dataphysics dcat21 tensiometer five measurements were made and the results were averaged for report the membrane porosity was measured by following the protocol described in 26 porosity ε is calculated from 1 ε 1 m f i b e r ρ f i b e r v f i b e r v c h a n n e l 100 where mfiber is the mass of the fiber ρfiber is the density of the fiber material 1 78 g cm 3 vfiber is the fiber volume

the pore radius distribution were obtained from the rejections to the neutral solutes a detailed description of the pore structural characterization and corresponding calculation was given elsewhere 29 the tri bore hollow fibers were soaked with ethanol so that they became permeable for liquid water the liquid entry pressure lep value was calculated using the cantor laplace equation 2 l e p 2 γ c

maximum radius of the membrane 2 3 deoxygenation experiments the deoxygenation performance of the freeze dried tri bore hf membranes was evaluated through a pilot scale degassing system as shown in fig 1 prior to the tests two membrane modules were prepared by bundling the fibers into 1 5 inch pvc casing with the two ends sealed using epoxy resin every membrane module contained 200 pieces of fibers with an effective area of 0 3 m2 for the deoxygenation tests di water was pumped to the lumen side of the hollow fibers while vacuum was applied in the shell side circulation operation modes was adopted i e 4 l water being used and it flowing back to the water tank after exiting from the membrane module all the experiments were conducted at fixed temperatures controlled by using a water circulator julabo f12 the deoxygenation performance under different operation modes and flow rates was firstly examined using di water feed in order to avoid the possible influence of membrane fouling fish pond water was then used in the deoxygenation experiments the efficiency e of deoxygenation is expressed as 3 e 1 c o u t l c i n l 100 where c i n l and c o u t l are the do concentrations in water at the inlet and outlet of the membrane respectively 2 4 mass transport of oxygen 2 4 1 experimental mass transfer coefficient for deoxygenation experiments the experimental mass transfer

area to volume ratio l is the length of the hf membranes and v is the water velocity the value of ci is estimated by using the henry s law 5 p i h c i where pi is the pressure of oxygen at the water gas interface 2 4 2 concentration profile fig 2 is a schematic diagram of the mass transport of oxygen with water flowing in the lumen side of the hollow fiber membrane as well as the concentration profile at different phases the steady state two dimensional flow in the lumen side can be written as 31 33 6 v z c z d l 2 c z 2 d r r r c r where c dl r and vz denote the local concentration of oxygen the diffusivity of oxygen in water the radial distance and the axial velocity of water the velocity profile in z direction can be obtained as 7 v z r 2 v 1 r r 2 where v is the average velocity of water in the lumen and r is the radius of the fiber lumen the boundary conditions for eq 6 are as follows z 0 c r 0 c i n b 8 r 0 c 0 z 0 is finite or c r 0 z 0 c r z c r c i the following

transfer coefficient at the water gas interface henry s law is applicable eq 4 as water containing do can be considered as dilute solution since the shell side of the hf membranes is under vacuum and the interface is located at the lumen the resistance at the shell side permeate side is negligible the overall resistance to the transport of oxygen could be expressed using the resistance in series concept 34 20 1 k 0 d i 1 k l d i r g t h k p d m where k 0 kl and kp are the mass transfer coefficients of oxygen in water and the membrane pore rg is the universal gas constant t is the temperature and di and dm are the fiber inner diameter and logarithmic mean diameter respectively kl can be calculated from leveque equation under laminar flow condition 21 k l d i d l 1 62 d i 2 v l d l 1 3 the mass transfer coefficient in the hydrophobic membrane is 34 22 k p d p ε τ b where dp τ and b denote the diffusivity of oxygen in the membrane pore the tortuosity of the pore and the membrane thickness respectively in the membrane pores the transport of oxygen is through knudsen diffusion and the diffusivity can be estimated using the following equation 23 d p d p 3 8 r g t π m w 1 2 where dp is the mean pore diameter and mw is the molecular weight of oxygen 2 4 4 flux analysis water is confined in the cylindrical lumen side so the concentration of do is not constant along aixal position of the fibers the bulk average concentration c b z of do in water could be estimated as follows 33 24 c b z 1 v s 0 r c r z v z r 2 π r d r where s is the cross section area of the fiber lumen the local molar flux of oxygen along at different position of the hollow fiber may be written as 25 n k 0 c j b z p b h where pb is the bulk partial pressure of oxygen 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of tri bore hf membranes as shown in table 2 the inner diameter and outer diameter of the tri bore hollow fibers are 670 and 1600 μm respectively the porosity is about 75 which is beneficial for fast transport of oxygen a water contact angle of 94 indicates necessary hydrophobicity which helps to prevent the entry of liquid water into membrane pores under operating conditions it should be noted that the contact angle is measured for the outer surface because it is very hard to measure it for the inner surface as the contact angle is mainly determined by the material pvdf for this case the measured contact angle may be considered as an indicator of the hydrophobicity of the membrane the tri bore hf membranes are strong and stretchable as indicated by the maximum load at break of 4 04 n the tensile stress of 6 77 mpa and the elongation of 52 3 typical morphology of the as developed fibers is shown in fig 3 the fiber wall and the junction at the center have thickness of about 120 and 200 μm respectively the thin fiber wall is favorable for the reduction in the resistance to oxygen transport the relative thicker junction provides strong support to the membrane which could stand the pressure difference under operation and maintain its integrity a layer of finger like macrovoids is present underneath the inner surface probably due to the rapid phase inversion and nonsolvent i e water intrusion 35 37 the middle portion and outer edge of the fiber have sponge like porous structure which might be due to combined effects from pore forming agent delayed demixing and stretching peg200 is the pore forming agent and it helps to generate pores and porosity as a non solvent additive the addition of peg200 also brings the dope closer to gelation points so that the phase inversion is accelerated 27 using water as the external coagulant for spinning the outer surfaces of the tri bore hf membranes is less porous consisting of interconnected globules once the outer skin is formed the solvent nonsolvent exchange is retarded and causes delayed demixing which is favorable for the formation of porous structure 36 38 39 as well an air gap distance of 10 cm was used for the spinning appropriate stretching after the nascent fibers are extruded from the spinneret might also contribute to the porous inner surface structure the inner surface is apparently porous though the bore fluid for spinning is also water during the spinning phase inversion is supposed to occur at the bore side rightly after the pvdf solution is extruded from the spinneret the polymer concentration at the inner surface would increase rapidly and form a relatively dense structure it should be noted that the outflow of nmp solvent changes the bore fluid from pure water a strong coagulant into a dilute aqueous solution of nmp solvent even though the amount of outflowed solvent is very small its impact on the phase inversion of the inner skin layer cannot be neglected as the amount of bore fluid is also very small 2 0 ml min 1 the bore fluid with continuously incoming solvent might make the inner surface not as dense as of the outer surface similar phenomenon was reported in another study 40 as shown in fig 4 the pores within the inner skin layer of the tri bore hollow fiber membrane are in the range of 2 20 nm with the mean pore radius of 6 3 nm the membrane is in the category of ultrafiltration and the lep value for water is determined at 9 9 bar 3 2 performance of water deoxygenation the as prepared membranes were firstly tested for di water deoxygenation in order to understand the influences of flow rate and operation mode with two membrane modules in series or parallel the do concentration drastically drops in the first 2 min and the change slows down subsequently fig 5 under both operation modes the water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 generates much faster drop in the do concentration than 500 ml min 1 further increase in the water flow rate above 500 ml min 1 does not significantly influence the do removal rate as well as the do concentration in the effluent data not shown pressure buildup on the lumen side was observed when the water flow rate was above 700 ml min 1 to avoid the influence of pressure on the transport of oxygen only results at relatively low flow rates i e 100 and 500 ml min 1 are discussed here at the same water flow rate the do removal rate is faster when the membrane modules are operated in series under 100 and 500 ml min 1 water flow rates the do removal efficiency is 97 5 and 82 2 when the two membranes are operated in series and 87 7 and 75 4 when the membranes are operated in parallel the experimental mass transfer coefficients are determined as of 2 03 10 5 and 4 73 10 5 m s 1 for the series mode and 1 17 10 5 and 4 01 10 5 m s 1 for the parallel mode respectively the mass transfer coefficient determined for the deoxygenation of di water is similar to that for ro water deoxygenation observed by peng at al 41 pristine aquaculture water taken from ras system was subjected to deoxygenation test with the two membrane modules in series and under a circulation mode as shown in table 3 the aquaculture water is slightly acidic it shows a turbidity of 1 39 ntu and chemical oxygen demand cod of 43 mg l 1 and contains 3245 mg l 1 total suspended solids tss 800 mg l 1 total dissolved solids tds and 45 5 mg l 1 nitrate under the four water flow rates tested the mass transfer coefficient does increase with increasing the water flow rate fig 6 surprisingly a flow rate of 100 ml min 1 results in the highest do removal efficiency of 87 3 which is lower than 97 5 observed in di water deoxygenation test the suspended solids and dissolved organic and biological substances adhered to the membrane inner surface might have fouled the membrane reduced the effective membrane area and increased the resistance for oxygen transport the do removal efficiency is 68 1 and 83 2 at 20 and 50 ml min 1 respectively it might be that the flow is too slow and the foulants stay firmly at the membrane inner surface though the flow is more vigorous by increasing the water flow rate to 500 ml min 1 the influence from fouling still cannot be apparently mitigated and a do removal efficiency of 76 8 is achieved based on these observations a water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 was used for the subsequent deoxygenation tests air blowing 1 0 bar 10 min and di water flushing 100 min were firstly applied to clean the membrane after deoxygenation of unfiltered aquaculture water due to the simplicity to implement in the real ras as shown in fig 7 air blowing is applied after the 1st run of deoxygenation followed by di water flushing but it does not completely recover the membrane performance as seen from the 2nd run flushing with di water for 100 min does not show better cleaning efficiency than air blowing and the do concentration in the effluent slightly increases for pristine pond water without any pretreatment either air blowing or di water flushing could not effectively remove the foulants deposited at the membrane inner surface and could not maintain the deoxygenation performance in subsequent experiments the aquaculture water was filtered to remove the suspended solids before deoxygenation performance evaluation using the same membrane modules flushing with di water is tried firstly and used as the reference as seen from fig 8 the do level in the effluent still increases gradually after every experiment and the do removal efficiency slightly drops it seems that the fouling is not apparently mitigated after the suspended solids are removed the fouling might have mainly contributed by dissolved organic substances and microorganisms cleaning with naoh solution ph10 followed by di water flushing works when the flushing time is increased to 60 min but the efficiency is still quite low fig 9 a mixture of naoh ph10 and sds 1 mm is effective to remove the foulants from the membrane surface better recovery of the membrane performance is achieved with lengthening the cleaning time from 20 to 40 and 60 min as well the cleaning with naoh sds solution could help to maintain the performance of the hf membranes i e the exiting aquaculture water not higher than 1 ppm do which is expected for biological denitrification 3 3 mass transport of oxygen 3 3 1 mass transfer coefficient the mass transfer in vacuum deoxygenation involves the diffusion of oxygen in liquid water membrane pores and surrounding vacuum or gas stream 30 42 using eqs 21 23 the mass transfer coefficients in the liquid phase and membrane pore as well as the overall mass transfer coefficient are determined and shown in fig 10 with the objective of understanding the mass transfer the theoretical study here only considers the case that fresh clean water without foulants enters the membrane module and leaves at the exiting point without circulation i e one pass mode generally the calculated mass transfer coefficient is in line with the experimental results shown in fig 6 clearly the mass transfer coefficient in the membrane pores does not change with increasing the water flow rate and it is much higher than that in the liquid phase the reason is as follows the shell side of the fibers i e the bulk gas phase is under vacuum the pores of the membrane are directly or indirectly connected with the bulk gas phase only gas molecules e g oxygen and water vapor could enter the pores resulted from the hydrophobic nature of the membrane while they are immediately taken away upon continuous suction in the shell side within the membrane pores the resistance to the movement of oxygen only comes from the tortuous or interconnected pore walls the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid water phase lumen side is 15 90 times lower than that in the membrane phase in the lumen side do needs to diffuse in water towards the water gas interface and pass through the interface before entering the membrane pores as gas molecules the slow transport of oxygen is directly resulted from the low oxygen diffusivity in the bulk water and the boundary layer near the fiber wall even at a water flow rate of 1 l min 1 water is still at laminar flow and the influence of mass transfer from the boundary layer is significant as a result the overall resistance to the transport of oxygen is dominated by the liquid water phase and the overall mass transfer coefficient k 0 is determined by the mass transfer coefficient in water k l 3 3 2 concentration profiles at a water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 the concentration profiles of do in radial and axial directions were calculated and are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively showing obviously similar trend only radial concentration profiles at water flow rates of 100 and 500 ml min 1 are presented and discussed here at both water flow rates the do concentration at the center of the fiber lumen r 0 is higher than that at the fiber wall r r while the difference is more significant at a higher water flow rate at 100 ml min 1 water flow rate the radial do concentration varies more significantly near the entrance region of the membrane and the variation becomes less with water flowing through the membrane module it drops slowly in the later stages at the half length point l 2 the do concentration drops by 68 6 and 83 3 at the center and fiber wall respectively around the exit region of the membrane module the do reduction is only 83 2 at the center and 85 3 at the fiber wall it seems that at low water flow rate the existing do concentration at the center almost reaches the same level as that at the fiber wall at 500 ml min 1 water flow rate the do removal rate becomes slow as seen from the small change in the radial do concentration fig 11 even though a higher water flow rate means enhanced mass transfer coefficient fig 10 the significantly shortened residence time within the membrane determines lower the ultimate do removal efficiency for the concentration of do in axial direction for different radial points the influence of flow rate on the deoxygenation performance is more clearly seen from fig 12 at the center of the fiber lumen r 0 the axial do concentration falls slowly for 500 ml min 1 water flow rate but falls rapidly at 100 ml min 1 flow rate apart from the lumen center the axial do concentration at different radial points changes slower at 500 ml min 1 water flow rate near the fiber wall there is a sharp decline in the do concentration for both cases the exiting do concentration corresponding to 500 ml min 1 flow rate has a broad distribution which is very different from what seen from another case fig 12 the possible reason for this phenomenon is that the diffusion of do from the bulk to the fiber wall where the water gas interface is located is too slow 3 3 3 molar flux profile the molar flux of do at different axial positions of the membrane module is shown in fig 13 obviously the molar flux of do increases with increasing the water flow rate at low flow rates e g 20 ml min 1 the molar flux is only high in the entrance region z l 0 2 and it is almost constant thereafter for relatively higher water flow rates the molar flux of do gradually decreases with water flowing long the membrane module and reaches the minimum value at the exiting point calculating from the average do concentration the do removal efficiency is about 85 6 84 3 52 4 and 35 1 at water flow rates of 20 100 500 and 1000 ml min 1 respectively consequently slow water flow rate is preferred as it results in better deoxygenation performance it should be noted that these theoretical calculations are based on the assumption that the feed water is clean and there is no membrane fouling if some foulants exist in the feed water they tend to deposit on the membrane surface to form an extra layer which not only reduces the effective membrane surface area for oxygen to transport but also increases the resistance the fouling is more serious if the flow is slow for a real scenario the operation conditions should be optimized by considering the mass transfer rate as well as the membrane fouling propensity simultaneously 4 conclusions novel and robust tri bore hollow fiber membranes have been developed for water deoxygenation its performance is better when two membranes are connected in series based on di water feed a do removal efficiency of 97 5 is achieved at a water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 when applied for aquaculture water the deoxygenation performance slightly decreases and a do removal efficiency of 87 3 is obtained membrane fouling is observed whether the aquaculture water is pre treated or not di water flushing air blowing or cleaning with naoh ph solution are not effective to clean the fouled membranes a combination of naoh oh and 1 mm sds shows satisfactory cleaning efficiency and the deoxygenation performance of the membrane could be maintained mathematic modeling has been conducted to investigate the oxygen transport from water to the gas phase through the membrane with water flowing in the lumen the mass transfer coefficient and molar flux of do increase with increasing the water flow rate the do concentrations in radial and axial directions show very different features at low and high water flow rates however the ultimate do removal efficiency would be higher at low water flow rates due to longer residence time which allows the diffusion of do from the fiber lumen to the boundary layer and the water gas interface the do removal efficiency could be reduced from 85 6 to 35 1 with increasing the water flow rate from 20 to 1000 ml min 1 for the deoxygenation of relatively clean water without or with minimum foulants operation of the membrane modules at low flow rate would be preferable acknowledgments we acknowledge ministry of education singapore for

14386,novel tri bore hollow fiber membranes have been developed from polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf for the control the dissolved oxygen do in aquaculture denitrification process the fabricated hollow fibers are characterized in terms of morphology porosity hydrophobicity and mechanical strength two membrane modules each including 200 pieces of hollow fibers are connected in series or parallel in order to determine the optimum operation mode the deoxygenation test is firstly conducted for di water and then for aquaculture water various methods including water flushing air blowing or chemical cleaning have been applied to assure the cleaning efficiency after membrane fouling a mathematical model has been developed by using the resistance in series concept by taking into account boundary layer and membrane characteristics overall mass transfer coefficient radial and axial concentration profiles and molar flux of oxygen at different water flow rates are calculated this work has demonstrated that the developed tri bore hollow fiber membranes are applicable for the control of dissolved oxygen in aquaculture water the observations have provided solid evidence for the development of membrane based denitrification system for recirculating aquaculture system ras keywords tri bore hollow fiber dissolved oxygen mass transfer aquaculture deoxygenation 1 introduction there is growing interest in recirculating aquaculture system ras in recent years due to the worsening pollution of the sea lakes and rivers and the expectation on more intensified production to feed the growing population ras enables minimum water consumption offers improved control of culture conditions and allows accurate quantification of culturing conditions and their effects on physiological rates such as aeration feeding fresh water and waste accumulation and disposal 1 3 ras makes it possible to place the farms in locations where water resources are limited and offers the flexibility of switching the culturing species to follow the market demand or preference for seafood products 4 5 nevertheless the accumulation of nitrate in ras facilities as the end product of nitrification affects the growth of culturing species and it is more serious in the systems where nitrifying biofilters are used 6 water consumption and environmental impact are also driving forces for nitrate control in ras 7 to control the nitrate level in ras two methods have been commonly practiced one method is to exchange a fraction of water in the culturing system each day with water low in nitrate 8 easy to be implemented water replacement is being used in many ras facilities except for the consumption of a large quantity of water the same amount of wastewater containing dissolved solids and dissolved nutrients is discharged everyday discharge of nitrate into receiving water courses would adversely affect the existing aqueous ecosystems and incur unexpected situations such as algal booming 7 9 another method is to convert nitrate through a biological process named as denitrificaiton denitrification depends on facultative heterotrophic bacteria which reduces nitrate no3 to nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o before eventually converted to n2 2 7 9 12 though relatively expensive compared with water replacement biological denitrification attracts more attention recently because it offers high rate of nitrate removal and minimizes the discharge of wastewater and consumption of new water constructed wetland algal pond and aquaponics have also been used for nitrate removal but they are mainly for other culturing systems 13 14 facultative bacteria need a carbon source as food to live while facultative bacteria get their oxygen by taking dissolved oxygen do from water or taking it off nitrate molecules if both do and nitrate are present facultative bacteria tend to prefer oxygen it is commonly perceived that do acts as an inhibitory and toxic agent to anaerobic treatment because the invasion of oxygen influences the activity of denitrifying bacteria 15 17 in the study of tan et al the optimum do level for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification was 0 5 1 0 ppm and the total nitrogen removal efficiency was observed at 70 6 17 the nitrogen removal efficiency was compromised when the do concentration was beyond 1 0 ppm it was reported that denitrification could occur at the do level of 3 5 ppm but the increase in do levels could cause severe drop of the denitrification performance and the consumption rate of the carbon source was increased 18 20 as disclosed by gutieerez wing et al the denitrification rate dropped from 5 5 to 0 5 no3 n l 1 d 1 when the do level increased from 0 5 to 4 0 ppm xu et al observed a denitrification efficiency of 50 at do levels higher than 4 ppm 21 therefore anaerobic environment with proper do control is essential to the efficiency and stability of denitrification it is hard to completely avoid the invasion of oxygen into the anaerobic denitrification system because most reactors are operated within an aerobic open environment however proper control of do level favors the denitrification process and is thus preferable oxygen scavenging agents such as sodium sulfite and iron sulfide were effective to deplete do from anaerobic bioreactors 22 the reaction of reducing agents and do generates solid products that are contaminants and it brings environmental and safety hazards due to storing and handling chemicals 23 more seriously the reducing agents and the products of reduction reaction would have adverse influences on the aquatic species membrane contactors packed with slim hollow fibers have been developed and used for effective control of do level in semiconductor ultrapure water 24 however no suitable membrane contactors are available for anaerobic denitrification systems which contains various foulants dual layer membrane formation using different polymers was reported by xia et al 25 this might be an option to improve the antifouling property of deoxygenation membranes if the fabrication is scalable the objective of this study was to develop robust tri bore hollow fiber hf membranes for the removal of do from aquaculture water the hf membranes were characterized in terms of morphology hydrophobicity porosity and mechanical strength the performance of the fabricated membranes were evaluated for the deoxygenation of deionized di water and aquaculture water various cleaning methods were applied to clean the membranes after fouled by aquaculture water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials kynar hsv 900 pvdf supplied by arkema inc was used for the fabrication of tri bore hf membranes n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 99 5 and polyethylene glycol 200 peg200 99 0 used in membrane fabrication were supplied by merck di water from milli q millipore system was used in all experiments the aquaculture water was supplied by a fish farming company in singapore whatman grade 1 filter paper with pore size of 11 μm was used for the pretreatment of the aquaculture water 2 2 preparation and characterization of tri bore hf membranes tri bore hf membranes were fabricated via a dry jet wet phase inversion spinning process as documented elsewhere 26 28 briefly the dope solution and bore fluid were supplied at specified flow rates by isco syringe pumps teledyne 1000d after entering the coagulation bath the nascent fibers precipitated and were collected by a take up roller detailed spinning conditions are summarized in table 1 after spinning the as spun tri bore hf membranes were immersed in tap water for 2 days to completely remove the residual solvent and additives the fibers were then frozen in a refrigerator and dried overnight in a freeze drier s61 modulyo d thermo electron membrane morphology was inspected using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jeol jsm 7600f for fesem inspection membrane samples were fractured cryogenically in liquid nitrogen and coated with platinum using a sputtering coater jeol jfc 1600 dynamic contact angle of the outer surface of the fibers was measured using a dataphysics dcat21 tensiometer five measurements were made and the results were averaged for report the membrane porosity was measured by following the protocol described in 26 porosity ε is calculated from 1 ε 1 m f i b e r ρ f i b e r v f i b e r v c h a n n e l 100 where mfiber is the mass of the fiber ρfiber is the density of the fiber material 1 78 g cm 3 vfiber is the fiber volume

the pore radius distribution were obtained from the rejections to the neutral solutes a detailed description of the pore structural characterization and corresponding calculation was given elsewhere 29 the tri bore hollow fibers were soaked with ethanol so that they became permeable for liquid water the liquid entry pressure lep value was calculated using the cantor laplace equation 2 l e p 2 γ c

fig 1 prior to the tests two membrane modules were prepared by bundling the fibers into 1 5 inch pvc casing with the two ends sealed using epoxy resin every membrane module contained 200 pieces of fibers with an effective area of 0 3 m2 for the deoxygenation tests di water was pumped to the lumen side of the hollow fibers while vacuum was applied in the shell side circulation operation modes was adopted i e 4 l water being used and it flowing back to the water tank after exiting from the membrane module all the experiments were conducted at fixed temperatures controlled by using a water circulator julabo f12 the deoxygenation performance under different operation modes and flow rates was firstly examined using di water feed in order to avoid the possible influence of membrane fouling fish pond water was then used in the deoxygenation experiments the efficiency e of deoxygenation is expressed as 3 e 1 c o u t l c i n l 100 where c i n l and c o u t l are the do concentrations in water at the inlet and outlet of the membrane respectively 2 4 mass transport of oxygen 2 4 1 experimental mass transfer coefficient for deoxygenation experiments the experimental mass transfer

area to volume ratio l is the length of the hf membranes and v is the water velocity the value of ci is estimated by using the henry s law 5 p i h c i where pi is the pressure of oxygen at the water gas interface 2 4 2 concentration profile fig 2 is a schematic diagram of the mass transport of oxygen with water flowing in the lumen side of the hollow fiber membrane as well as the concentration profile at different phases the steady state two dimensional flow in the lumen side can be written as 31 33 6 v z c z d l 2 c z 2 d r r r c r where c dl r and vz denote the local concentration of

transfer coefficient at the water gas interface henry s law is applicable eq 4 as water containing do can be considered as dilute solution since the shell side of the hf membranes is under vacuum and the interface is located at the lumen the resistance at the shell side permeate side is negligible the overall resistance to the transport of oxygen could be expressed using the resistance in series concept 34 20 1 k 0 d i 1 k l d i r g t h k p d m where k 0 kl and kp are the mass transfer coefficients of oxygen in water and the membrane pore rg is the universal gas constant t is the temperature and di and dm are the fiber inner diameter and logarithmic mean diameter respectively kl can be calculated from leveque equation under laminar flow condition 21 k l d i d l 1 62 d i 2 v l d l 1 3 the mass transfer coefficient in the hydrophobic membrane is 34 22 k p d p ε τ b where dp τ and b denote the diffusivity of oxygen in the membrane pore the tortuosity of the pore and the membrane thickness respectively in the membrane pores the transport of oxygen is through knudsen diffusion and the diffusivity can be estimated using the following equation 23 d p d p 3 8 r g t π m w 1 2 where dp is the mean pore diameter and mw is the molecular weight of oxygen 2 4 4 flux analysis water is confined in the cylindrical lumen side so the concentration of do is not constant along aixal position of the fibers the bulk average concentration c b z of do in water could be estimated as follows 33 24 c b z 1 v s 0 r c r z v z r 2 π r d r where s is the cross section area of the fiber lumen the local molar flux of oxygen along at different position of the hollow fiber may be written as 25 n k 0 c j b z p b h where pb is the bulk partial pressure of oxygen 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of tri bore hf membranes as shown in table 2 the inner diameter and outer diameter of the tri bore hollow fibers are 670 and 1600 μm respectively the porosity is about 75 which is beneficial for fast transport of oxygen a water contact angle of 94 indicates necessary hydrophobicity which helps to prevent the entry of liquid water into membrane pores under operating conditions it should be noted that the contact angle is measured for the outer surface because it is very hard to measure it for the inner surface as the contact angle is mainly determined by the material pvdf for this case the measured contact angle may be considered as an indicator of the hydrophobicity of the membrane the tri bore hf membranes are strong and stretchable as indicated by the maximum load at break of 4 04 n the tensile stress of 6 77 mpa and the elongation of 52 3 typical morphology of the as developed fibers is shown in fig 3 the fiber wall and the junction at the center have thickness of about 120 and 200 μm respectively the thin fiber wall is favorable for the reduction in the resistance to oxygen transport the relative thicker junction provides strong support to the membrane which could stand the pressure difference under operation and maintain its integrity a layer of finger like macrovoids is present underneath the inner surface probably due to the rapid phase inversion and nonsolvent i e water intrusion 35 37 the middle portion and outer edge of the fiber have sponge like porous structure which might be due to combined effects from pore forming agent delayed demixing and stretching peg200 is the pore forming agent and it helps to generate pores and porosity as a non solvent additive the addition of peg200 also brings the dope closer to gelation points so that the phase inversion is accelerated 27 using water as the external coagulant for spinning the outer surfaces of the tri bore hf membranes is less porous consisting of interconnected globules once the outer skin is formed the solvent nonsolvent exchange is retarded and causes delayed demixing which is favorable for the formation of porous structure 36 38 39 as well an air gap distance of 10 cm was used for the spinning appropriate stretching after the nascent fibers are extruded from the spinneret might also contribute to the porous inner surface structure the inner surface is apparently porous though the bore fluid for spinning is also water during the spinning phase inversion is supposed to occur at the bore side rightly after the pvdf solution is extruded from the spinneret the polymer concentration at the inner surface would increase rapidly and form a relatively dense structure it should be noted that the outflow of nmp solvent changes the bore fluid from pure water a strong coagulant into a dilute aqueous solution of nmp solvent even though the amount of outflowed solvent is very small its impact on the phase inversion of the inner skin layer cannot be neglected as the amount of bore fluid is also very small 2 0 ml min 1 the bore fluid with continuously incoming solvent might make the inner surface not as dense as of the outer surface similar phenomenon was reported in another study 40 as shown in fig 4 the pores within the inner skin layer of the tri bore hollow fiber membrane are in the range of 2 20 nm with the mean pore radius of 6 3 nm the membrane is in the category of ultrafiltration and the lep value for water is determined at 9 9 bar 3 2 performance of water deoxygenation the as prepared membranes were firstly tested for di water deoxygenation in order to understand the influences of flow rate and operation mode with two membrane modules in series or parallel the do concentration drastically drops in the first 2 min and the change slows down subsequently fig 5 under both operation modes the water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 generates much faster drop in the do concentration than 500 ml min 1 further increase in the water flow rate above 500 ml min 1 does not significantly influence the do removal rate as well as the do concentration in the effluent data not shown pressure buildup on the lumen side was observed when the water flow rate was above 700 ml min 1 to avoid the influence of pressure on the transport of oxygen only results at relatively low flow rates i e 100 and 500 ml min 1 are discussed here at the same water flow rate the do removal rate is faster when the membrane modules are operated in series under 100 and 500 ml min 1 water flow rates the do removal efficiency is 97 5 and 82 2 when the two membranes are operated in series and 87 7 and 75 4 when the membranes are operated in parallel the experimental mass transfer coefficients are determined as of 2 03 10 5 and 4 73 10 5 m s 1 for the series mode and 1 17 10 5 and 4 01 10 5 m s 1 for the parallel mode respectively the mass transfer coefficient determined for the deoxygenation of di water is similar to that for ro water deoxygenation observed by peng at al 41 pristine aquaculture water taken from ras system was subjected to deoxygenation test with the two membrane modules in series and under a circulation mode as shown in table 3 the aquaculture water is slightly acidic it shows a turbidity of 1 39 ntu and chemical oxygen demand cod of 43 mg l 1 and contains 3245 mg l 1 total suspended solids tss 800 mg l 1 total dissolved solids tds and 45 5 mg l 1 nitrate under the four water flow rates tested the mass transfer coefficient does increase with increasing the water flow rate fig 6 surprisingly a flow rate of 100 ml min 1 results in the highest do removal efficiency of 87 3 which is lower than 97 5 observed in di water deoxygenation test the suspended solids and dissolved organic and biological substances adhered to the membrane inner surface might have fouled the membrane reduced the effective membrane area and increased the resistance for oxygen transport the do removal efficiency is 68 1 and 83 2 at 20 and 50 ml min 1 respectively it might be that the flow is too slow and the foulants stay firmly at the membrane inner surface though the flow is more vigorous by increasing the water flow rate to 500 ml min 1 the influence from fouling still cannot be apparently mitigated and a do removal efficiency of 76 8 is achieved based on these observations a water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 was used for the subsequent deoxygenation tests air blowing 1 0 bar 10 min and di water flushing 100 min were firstly applied to clean the membrane after deoxygenation of unfiltered aquaculture water due to the simplicity to implement in the real ras as shown in fig 7 air blowing is applied after the 1st run of deoxygenation followed by di water flushing but it does not completely recover the membrane performance as seen from the 2nd run flushing with di water for 100 min does not show better cleaning efficiency than air blowing and the do concentration in the effluent slightly increases for pristine pond water without any pretreatment either air blowing or di water flushing could not effectively remove the foulants deposited at the membrane inner surface and could not maintain the deoxygenation performance in subsequent experiments the aquaculture water was filtered to remove the suspended solids before deoxygenation performance evaluation using the same membrane modules flushing with di water is tried firstly and used as the reference as seen from fig 8 the do level in the effluent still increases gradually after every experiment and the do removal efficiency slightly drops it seems that the fouling is not apparently mitigated after the suspended solids are removed the fouling might have mainly contributed by dissolved organic substances and microorganisms cleaning with naoh solution ph10 followed by di water flushing works when the flushing time is increased to 60 min but the efficiency is still quite low fig 9 a mixture of naoh ph10 and sds 1 mm is effective to remove the foulants from the membrane surface better recovery of the membrane performance is achieved with lengthening the cleaning time from 20 to 40 and 60 min as well the cleaning with naoh sds solution could help to maintain the performance of the hf membranes i e the exiting aquaculture water not higher than 1 ppm do which is expected for biological denitrification 3 3 mass transport of oxygen 3 3 1 mass transfer coefficient the mass transfer in vacuum deoxygenation involves the diffusion of oxygen in liquid water membrane pores and surrounding vacuum or gas stream 30 42 using eqs 21 23 the mass transfer coefficients in the liquid phase and membrane pore as well as the overall mass transfer coefficient are determined and shown in fig 10 with the objective of understanding the mass transfer the theoretical study here only considers the case that fresh clean water without foulants enters the membrane module and leaves at the exiting point without circulation i e one pass mode generally the calculated mass transfer coefficient is in line with the experimental results shown in fig 6 clearly the mass transfer coefficient in the membrane pores does not change with increasing the water flow rate and it is much higher than that in the liquid phase the reason is as follows the shell side of the fibers i e the bulk gas phase is under vacuum the pores of the membrane are directly or indirectly connected with the bulk gas phase only gas molecules e g oxygen and water vapor could enter the pores resulted from the hydrophobic nature of the membrane while they are immediately taken away upon continuous suction in the shell side within the membrane pores the resistance to the movement of oxygen only comes from the tortuous or interconnected pore walls the mass transfer coefficient in the liquid water phase lumen side is 15 90 times lower than that in the membrane phase in the lumen side do needs to diffuse in water towards the water gas interface and pass through the interface before entering the membrane pores as gas molecules the slow transport of oxygen is directly resulted from the low oxygen diffusivity in the bulk water and the boundary layer near the fiber wall even at a water flow rate of 1 l min 1 water is still at laminar flow and the influence of mass transfer from the boundary layer is significant as a result the overall resistance to the transport of oxygen is dominated by the liquid water phase and the overall mass transfer coefficient k 0 is determined by the mass transfer coefficient in water k l 3 3 2 concentration profiles at a water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 the concentration profiles of do in radial and axial directions were calculated and are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively showing obviously similar trend only radial concentration profiles at water flow rates of 100 and 500 ml min 1 are presented and discussed here at both water flow rates the do concentration at the center of the fiber lumen r 0 is higher than that at the fiber wall r r while the difference is more significant at a higher water flow rate at 100 ml min 1 water flow rate the radial do concentration varies more significantly near the entrance region of the membrane and the variation becomes less with water flowing through the membrane module it drops slowly in the later stages at the half length point l 2 the do concentration drops by 68 6 and 83 3 at the center and fiber wall respectively around the exit region of the membrane module the do reduction is only 83 2 at the center and 85 3 at the fiber wall it seems that at low water flow rate the existing do concentration at the center almost reaches the same level as that at the fiber wall at 500 ml min 1 water flow rate the do removal rate becomes slow as seen from the small change in the radial do concentration fig 11 even though a higher water flow rate means enhanced mass transfer coefficient fig 10 the significantly shortened residence time within the membrane determines lower the ultimate do removal efficiency for the concentration of do in axial direction for different radial points the influence of flow rate on the deoxygenation performance is more clearly seen from fig 12 at the center of the fiber lumen r 0 the axial do concentration falls slowly for 500 ml min 1 water flow rate but falls rapidly at 100 ml min 1 flow rate apart from the lumen center the axial do concentration at different radial points changes slower at 500 ml min 1 water flow rate near the fiber wall there is a sharp decline in the do concentration for both cases the exiting do concentration corresponding to 500 ml min 1 flow rate has a broad distribution which is very different from what seen from another case fig 12 the possible reason for this phenomenon is that the diffusion of do from the bulk to the fiber wall where the water gas interface is located is too slow 3 3 3 molar flux profile the molar flux of do at different axial positions of the membrane module is shown in fig 13 obviously the molar flux of do increases with increasing the water flow rate at low flow rates e g 20 ml min 1 the molar flux is only high in the entrance region z l 0 2 and it is almost constant thereafter for relatively higher water flow rates the molar flux of do gradually decreases with water flowing long the membrane module and reaches the minimum value at the exiting point calculating from the average do concentration the do removal efficiency is about 85 6 84 3 52 4 and 35 1 at water flow rates of 20 100 500 and 1000 ml min 1 respectively consequently slow water flow rate is preferred as it results in better deoxygenation performance it should be noted that these theoretical calculations are based on the assumption that the feed water is clean and there is no membrane fouling if some foulants exist in the feed water they tend to deposit on the membrane surface to form an extra layer which not only reduces the effective membrane surface area for oxygen to transport but also increases the resistance the fouling is more serious if the flow is slow for a real scenario the operation conditions should be optimized by considering the mass transfer rate as well as the membrane fouling propensity simultaneously 4 conclusions novel and robust tri bore hollow fiber membranes have been developed for water deoxygenation its performance is better when two membranes are connected in series based on di water feed a do removal efficiency of 97 5 is achieved at a water flow rate of 100 ml min 1 when applied for aquaculture water the deoxygenation performance slightly decreases and a do removal efficiency of 87 3 is obtained membrane fouling is observed whether the aquaculture water is pre treated or not di water flushing air blowing or cleaning with naoh ph solution are not effective to clean the fouled membranes a combination of naoh oh and 1 mm sds shows satisfactory cleaning efficiency and the deoxygenation performance of the membrane could be maintained mathematic modeling has been conducted to investigate the oxygen transport from water to the gas phase through the membrane with water flowing in the lumen the mass transfer coefficient and molar flux of do increase with increasing the water flow rate the do concentrations in radial and axial directions show very different features at low and high water flow rates however the ultimate do removal efficiency would be higher at low water flow rates due to longer residence time which allows the diffusion of do from the fiber lumen to the boundary layer and the water gas interface the do removal efficiency could be reduced from 85 6 to 35 1 with increasing the water flow rate from 20 to 1000 ml min 1 for the deoxygenation of relatively clean water without or with minimum foulants operation of the membrane modules at low flow rate would be preferable acknowledgments we acknowledge ministry of education singapore for

14387,in this study different molecular weights of polyethylene glycol peg mw 4000 and 6000 g mole were used as additives for preparations of modified cellulose acetate ca flat asymmetric membranes the effects of additives on membrane characteristics and power density were investigated using the reverse osmosis and pressure retarded osmosis pro methods membrane characterization and power density of the fabricated membranes were evaluated using the pro setup the results show enhancement in the performance of membranes in terms of power density that can be extracted from the membranes with various additives furthermore a comparison was made on the power density obtained using different molecular weights of peg with ca as a base polymer a power density of 0 7 w m2 was obtained from the unmodified ca membrane which increased to 2 7 w m2 and 3 1 w m2 for the modified membranes with peg 4000 and 6000 respectively the enhanced power density was due to the better membrane characteristics with respect to its hydrophilicity pure water flux pwf salt rejection and porosity therefore this study provides deeper insights on the performance of membranes with higher molecular weight peg to get

first century advancement in technology has also led to increase in consumption of energy globally by an individual and society the conventional sources of energy are potentially dependent on fossil fuels which release huge amount of toxic gases or pollutants and byproducts which harm the environment the rise in energy demand is alarming and warrants renewable sources to replace with the traditionally used non renewable and conventional energy sources from the widely used renewable sources of energy salinity gradient energy remains least harnessed although a number of studies are on going intensive research is needed to assess the feasibility of this process to make it a profitable energy source among the techniques used to generate energy using salinity gradient pressure retarded osmosis pro and reverse electrodyalisis red are widely practiced and studied a number of studies suggest that these two processes are highly effective and productive in terms of energy efficiency and feasibility preparation of effective and modified membranes for extraction of energy from salinity gradient is needed several studies are made on the performance of various forward osmosis and ion exchange membranes in accordance with the results in the previous studies pro is considered to be more efficient over red and is a novel technology with a long history 1 in 1973 after the oil crisis a sudden change in approach of study for renewable sources of energy was experienced and it took 20 years for the field of renewable sources to open up globally 2 5 efforts have been made to increase the efficiency of these processes using more effective and advanced membranes 4 norman 1974 was the first person to analyze the pro process as a feasible method to extract energy with the help of a schematic diagram 5 he explained that the fresh water could permeate through membranes which allows preferential transport of species the resulting pressurized saline water is allowed to discharge in a chamber separated by a selective membrane from a chamber where fresh water is continuously discharged then the water obtained as the output from the saline water chamber can rotate the blades of a turbine loeb et al 1976 presented the experimental basis for the pro process using hollow fiber ro membranes and validated the results 6 afterwards mehta and loeb 1978 discussed the factors affecting the performance of the process using various membranes 7 the effect of internal and external concentration polarization on reducing the power generation in pro was discussed in a subsequent study 8 9 later a number of models and studies were conducted on development of pro process by loeb and mehta using hypersaline draw solution furthermore lee et al 1981 developed a model to calculate power density and water flux from the pro process by considering internal concentration polarization and excluding external concentration polarization ecp 10 11 this model was considered as the reference model for the models studied thereafter a number studies were carried out leading to the progress in the efficiency of the pro process loeb 1998 studied the possibility of generating energy from the pro process in dead sea and estimated the cost of the generated electrical energy to be around 0 058 0 07 kwh after a number of studies developed models results and analysis on various membranes which can be used in pro system the norweign company statkraft launched the very first prototype working on pro process with 10 kw power capacity in 2009 achilli et al 2009 worked further on the model developed by lee et al 1981 using flat sheet cellulose triacetate cta fo membrane 11 later yip et al 2012 investigated using a thin film composite pro membrane with a polysulfone support layer and a polyamide active layer 12 a number of membranes were further manufactured and studied resulting in the advancement of the process although statkraft in 2014 declared its discontinuation in its work it opened wide area of research and scope for development in the pro technology many researchers are now working on the development of the membranes and analysis is being done on obtaining higher power densities the recent studies illustrates the advancement of pressure retarded osmosis pro and has shown major developments in the feasibility of the system for its practical operation to study the performance of the process and the membranes involved real waste water was used in the system to reduce the effect of membrane fouling the pretreatment of the feed water was done the results show a major increase in the water flux for the pro system by using low pressure nanofiltration nf pretreatment 21 another study reports that a sufficient strength to the pro structure is provided by the woven mesh polyester backings this porous support layer was observed to be deformed where the deformation was observed to be dependent on the opening size of the backing these findings explain that the mass transfer resistances in pro can be reduced by implementing more open backing layers is used 22 there are several studies based on various fo membranes for pro among which commercial fo asymmetric cellulose triacetate cta based flat sheet membranes are frequently investigated using deionized water as feed and 35 g l 1 nacl solution achilli et al 11 obtained a maximum power density of 2 73 w m2 at 9 72 bar pressure however power density of 5 06 w m2 at same pressure was also obtained with 60 g l 1 nacl solution and deionized water as feed she et al 2012 explored a peak power density of 4 5 w m2 can be obtained using cellulose triacetate forward osmosis membrane utilizing 1 m and 10 mm nacl solution as draw and feed 14 furthermore li et al 2013 explained that the conventionally prepared tfc fo membranes compacted and undergo deformation under high pressures he concluded that the membranes with sponge like cross section morphology are comparatively better than the finger like cross sections so as to withstand high pressures and undergo less membrane deformation 14 therefore in this study we have focused on increasing the membrane characteristics of ca membranes by adding various compositions of peg to examine the improvements in the power density values of the obtained using the pro methods which is not studied in details yet 2 material and methods 2 1 membrane preparation polyethylene glycol of average molecular weight 4000 6000 g mol n n dimethyl formamide dmf sodium chloride nacl and ca were obtained from the merck specialties private ltd germany deionized millipore water has been used throughout the experiments flat asymmetric pure ca membranes were prepared by phase inversion method using dimethyl forma amide dmf 80 wt as solvent and ca 20 wt whereas peg modified membranes were prepared using dmf 80 wt peg 4000 6000 5 wt and ca 20 wt the preparation of different membranes is shown in table 1 the compositions were mixed together with help of magnetic stirrer kept at 120 rpm speed on a hot plate for 12 h at 70 c and further degassed for 12 h in hot air oven at a 70 c the prepared solution was then casted on a transparent clean glass where the thickness was maintained to 120 μm with help of a casting knife the casted solution was then immediately immersed in deionized water the phase inversion occurs and color of the membranes immediately changes to milky white and eventually flat sheet membranes are formed these thin sheets were kept immersed in deionized water overnight and were further carefully peeled out and kept in air at normal temperature for drying 2 2 pure water flux pwf and salt rejection experiments an unstirred batch cell made of stainless steel having capacity 350 ml was used for both compaction for measuring pwf and salt rejection analysis it consists of a membrane steel support containing numerous minute pores as the base on which the membrane was kept the diameter of membrane was found to be 5 4 10 2 m and the effective area of membrane for permeation study was calculated to be 22 9 10 4 m2 the flux diagnosis was carried out in di water and permeate was collected from the base of the batch cell the compaction was carried out for nearly an hour and permeate was collected at an interval of 10 min the initial pwf and the final pwf at steady state were noted the experimental setup is schematically shown in fig 1 salt rejection analysis was carried out in the same manner with a 0 6 m nacl solution where ca membranes both modified and unmodified were used after compaction the pressure for salt rejection was kept lower than that for the compaction study at 240 kpa the solution permeate was collected after every 10 min and the salt concentration was measured at the end of 30 min 2 3 membrane characterization the important criteria for deciding membrane performance are pure water flux pwf porosity and pore size distribution of the membrane 13 membrane characterization depends both on morphological and permeation analysis the morphological analysis of the prepared membranes were done by microscopic evaluation and the performance was evaluated with respect to equilibrium water content ewc pwf compaction factor cf water contact angle average pore size of the prepared membranes was measured through mercury intrusion porosimetry mip make porous materials inc model amp 60k a 1 and compared with fesem images of the membranes the zeta potential of the membranes was performed using zeta analyzer make beckman coulter model delsa nano c 2 3 1 microscopic observation morphological analysis was done under microscopic observations and was performed by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem zeiss lsm 510 meta with an acceleration voltage after the samples were coated with thin gold layer the cross sectional images show how the pores have been formed also the porous asymmetric structure of the membrane with top dense layer and the thickness of the membrane were found 12 13 2 3 2 pwf salt rejection and cf for pressure driven flux study of prepared polymeric membrane compaction factor and pwf plays an important role the pwf was determined by passing deionized water through the compacted membrane the permeate flux was recorded at every 10 min by keeping the pressure constant at 275 kpa for 2 h the flux was calculated by the equation 1 j q a δ t j l m2h represents pure water flux q a and δt denotes volume of water collected l membrane area m2 and time interval h respectively in order to find out the water permeation coefficient the pure water flux was measured at different trans membrane pressure at the end of 2 h 2 j w a m δ p am represents water permeation coefficient cm3cm 2 s 1 atm 1 which was calculated from the slope value by plotting pure water flux vs different trans membrane pressure after doing salt rejection study permeate salt concentration was measured through conductivity studies and rejection was obtained by following equation 3 s a l t r e j e c t i o n 1 c p c f 100 sponginess of the prepared membrane was observed by the compaction factor cf which illustrates the pores inside the membrane it is defined as the ratio of the pwfinitial to pwfsteadystate at the end of 2 h run 4 c f p w f i n i t i a l p w f s t e a d y s t a t e 2 3 3 equilibrium water content ewc porosity and hydrophilicity increase in porosity enhances the water content flow through the membrane and hence effects the ewc and porosity of the membranes whereas hydrophilicity depends on the internal porous structure and the hydrophilic groups present in the membrane ewc at room temperature was calculated as 5 e w c w w w d w w 100 the membrane porosity was determined by 6 p o r o s i t y w w w d ρ v where ww and wd are the weight of membrane in wet and dry states respectively ρ is the density of water and v is volume of the membrane wet membranes after being mopped with tissue paper were weighed using an electronic balance furthermore the wet membranes were dried by putting in a vacuum oven for 24 h at a temperature of 50 60 c and were weighed again in dry state for calculation of membrane volume thickness of the membranes was measured by fesem image at different places and the average thickness was considered the hydrophilic property of the membranes was evaluated by measuring the average static contact angle up to 5 min at a regular interval of 1 min between the deionized water and membrane films at ambient condition at room temperature using contact angle goniometer make holmarc model ho iad cam 01b and image j software for measuring the contact angle membrane coupons of about 2cm 2 cm area were prepared by cutting the membrane sheet and fixing these samples at the glass plate with the help of adhesive tape then a drop of di water 20 μl was placed on the surface using a micropipette 3 pro analysis 3 1 methodology the water permeation flux jw through an ideal semipermeable membrane allowing water to pass through it but rejecting the solute particles or ions is related to the water permeability am the effective transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference δp

at the surface of the active and support layers while the permeation of salt takes place in the opposite direction of the water flux i e into the feed solution from the draw solution the salt permeation coefficient b can be computed as 16 20 9 b a 1 r δ p δ π r here b is the salt permeability coefficient of the active layer of the membrane whereas r represents salt rejection δp and δπ

experiments were conducted in a two sided closed diffusion chamber at an ambient temperature of 28 2 c the chambers consist of fresh and saline water separated by the prepared asymmetric ca membranes supported with a muslin cloth the membrane module was made with a dimension of 7 cm 6 cm the saline chamber side was filled with 0 6 m nacl solution with the help of a high pressure motor at a velocity of 149 75 cm s and output samples were collected at an interval of 10 min for further tests the values for diffusion coefficient d and kinematic viscosity η for 0 6 m nacl were obtained from touati et al 15 the fresh chamber containing deionized water was filled at lower velocity of 28 3 cm s under the effect of gravity and similarly the samples obtained at the output side were collected and tested the saline chamber output was kept at a height of 40 cm using a pipe of diameter 6 mm the output was collected in a container kept on a weighing balance to quantify the saline water collected during the experiment for a specific duration the whole experimental setup for pro analysis is illustrated in fig 2 4 results and discussions 4 1 membrane analysis through fesem fig 3 presents the cross sections at different magnifications for mf 1 mf 2 and mf 3 membranes from the analysis results present in fig 3a i the asymmetric density and porous nature of mf 1 was observed and fig 3a ii shows the porous nature of the membrane at higher magnification the thickness of membrane was nearly 120 μm and because of the asymmetric structure permeation and retention of solutes takes place furthermore there is a porous bulk containing finger like structure at the bottom which is responsible for mechanical support figs 3b i and 3 b ii of mf 2 membrane respectively shows the asymmetric structure and they demonstrate more porous nature with respect to mf 1 the porous nature and pore size of mf 3 were found to increase as compared to those of mf 1 and mf 2 henceforth the increase in peg molecular weight increases the porous layer and decreases dense layer from the different cross sectional images of mf 1 and mf 3 it can be concluded that mf 1 pore walls are less elongated and stretched as compared to mf 3 membranes when the casting solution film was immersed in the non solvent bath containing millipore water the fast solvent non solvent as well as the additive non solvent exchange occurs across the interface this leads to immediate precipitation of the polymer at the interface and thus a thin skinned layer and porous sub layer along with sponge like pores are formed fig 4 shows the top surface fesem images of mf 1 mf 2 and mf 3 the average pore size of the different membranes was calculated from the fesem images using image j software it was found out that all the membranes were of ultrafiltration range for mf 1 the average pore size was the highest but as the peg molecular weight increases the membrane pore size got decreased mf 1 mf 2 mf 3 this can be explained due to the fact that on addition of higher molecular weight peg more pores got formed since porosity and hydrophilicity enhanced and hence to accommodate more number of pores the average pore size got reduced moreover from mercury intrusion porosimetry mip analysis the pore size was found to be around 30 3 nm 27 67 nm and 23 4 nm for mf 1 mf 2 and mf 3 respectively the increase in size for mip analysis may be due to internal large pores which were not obtained under fesem images the results were summarized in table 2 4 2 compaction analysis of prepared membranes 4 2 1 effect of additives on pwf of the prepared membranes pure water flux for different peg modified membranes was calculated using eq 1 the effect of various molecular weights of peg on ca membranes at 275 kpa trans membrane pressures is illustrated in fig 5 it was found that mf 1 has the lowest pwf of 143 l m2h whereas the pwf for mf 2 and mf 3 was 561 l m2h and 621 l m2h respectively the formation of better pores and enhanced porosity were already discussed figs 3 and 4 these results show that mf 2 and mf 3 have better pore formation and are more hydrophilic with respect to mf 1 13 14 the peg additives enhances hydrophilicity of the modified membranes and with the increase in peg molecular weight from 4000 to 6000 pwf also increased from 561 l m2h to 621 l m2h the increase in porous layer of the membrane is experienced with increase in peg molecular weight which increases the hydrophilicity and the pwf of the modified membranes 4 2 2 effect of additives on compaction factor c f of the prepared membranes the membrane sublayer structure plays a key role in determining the cf of the prepared membranes which was calculated using eq 4 due to the presence of large macro voids in the membrane the compactness increases to a higher level and signifies the sponginess of the prepared membranes 13 the compaction behavior of the prepared membrane is illustrated in fig 5 which signifies that pwf falls sharply and by 80 min it reaches to a steady state the compaction values are given in table 2 which indicates that the membrane is quite dense as the cf is small due to the compaction of prepared membrane pore walls become closer straightens and average size of the pores get reduced which decreases the water flux the figure demonstrates that the pwf increases due to the higher molecular weight of peg mf 3 containing peg 6000 as additive shows a pwf of 621 2 l m2h whereas the mf 2 with peg 4000 results pwf of 561 2 l m2h and mf 1 containing no additive has pwf of 143 5 l m2h the additives formed can either enlarge or suppress the macro void region in the sublayer which accounts for the cf values of all the prepared membranes given in table 2 4 3 membrane characterization by ewc porosity and hydrophilicity 4 3 1 effect of additive on ewc the results of ewc for different membranes were calculated using eq 5 and are provided in table 2 the ewc values recorded are 30 7 1 5 38 1 1 3 and 44 6 1 7 for mf 1 mf 2 and mf 3 respectively this value has a similar relation with pwf and plays an important role for evaluating hydrophilicity of a membrane the use of higher molecular weight peg leads to better pore formation on the surface and cavities in the sublayer which are responsible for holding more number of water molecules in the membranes 13 as pwf and ewc have a close relation for evaluating hydrophilicity it concludes that with higher molecular weight peg the above mentioned parameter increases hence the mf 3 membrane is more hydrophilic a s compared to the other prepared membranes 4 3 2 effect of additive on porosity and hydrophilicity the porosity and hydrophilicity of the membrane play an important role for membrane permeation and separation process the porosity of the prepared membranes was calculated using eq 5 and diagrams for contact angle as shown in fig 6 the results clearly indicates that with increase in peg molecular weight the porosity of the prepared membranes increases the porosity for mf 1 mf 2 and mf 3 are 0 17 0 03 0 22 0 02 and 0 27 0 01 respectively the surface hydrophilicity was measured by contact angle fig 6 which also rises due to the above fact that with the use of higher molecular weight peg the hydrophilicity increases and as a result the contact angle decreases here the contact angle decreased from 58 2 1 03 53 0 23 for mf 1 and mf 3 membranes respectively moreover the zeta potential was found to be 1 17 mv 23 16 mv and 23 62 mv for mf 1 mf 2 and mf 3 respectively it was found out that with addition of higher molecular weight peg containing oh groups the surface charge increases which helps for better water permeation for water permeation hydrogen bonding between the water molecules and membrane surface is very crucial the peg molecules within mf 2 and mf 3 enhance this phenomenon and thus water flux increases for these membranes hence it was concluded that not only porosity and hydrophilicity but surface charge also plays an important role for water flux characterization of membranes the porosity variation of membranes is based on the thermodynamic and kinetic consideration the thermodynamic enhancement of phase separation occurs due to the inclusion of additives to the casting solution due to which the miscibility of casting solution with non solvent reduces and instantaneous de mixing gets enhanced 12 14 the kinetic hindrance factor against phase separation gets enhanced due to increase in viscosity of the casting solution which results in delayed de mixing 2 3 the viscosities of casting solutions were measured as 1 6 pa s 1 77 pa s and 1 86 pa s for mf 1 mf 2 and mf 3 respectively as suggested by young and chen 14 for the increase in viscosity of the casting solution the ratio of non solvent inflow to solvent outflow increases resulting in increased porous structure of the membrane therefore with increase in molecular weight of the additive in the casting solution the miscibility of solution with non solvent water decreases which accounts for more porosity similarly due to the bulkiness of the additive formed its gets retained within the membrane pore walls and enhances hydrophilicity of the prepared membranes 5 pro analysis 5 1 effect of additives on conductivity osmotic water flux conductivity of a solution determines the amount of dissociable ions present within a solution conducting electricity the initial conductivity of feed 0 6 m nacl was 35 2 ms cm from fig 7 it can be seen that conductivity on the saline side for mf 3 decreased to 25 15 ms cm whereas for mf 2 and mf 1 the value reduces to 27 17 ms cm and 30 1 ms cm respectively also the conductivity increases to 19 9 ms cm 18 6 ms cm and 16 9 ms cm for mf 3 mf 2 and mf 1 respectively in the fresh water chamber the porous nature of the membrane though the rejection increases for mf 3 but due to molar diffusion more salt permeates towards fresh water side table 3 shows the osmotic water flux permeating through different peg modified membrane the unmodified membrane mf 1 was found to have a water flux of 4 14 10 2 cm3 cm2s whereas mf 2 and mf 3 have osmotic water fluxes of 15 97 10 2 cm3 cm2s and 18 34 10 2 cm3 cm2s respectively therefore it can be said that porosity surface charge and hydrophilicity of the membrane plays an important role for transportation of salt and water molecules as mf 3 is more hydrophilic and porous in nature it shows better results than other membranes 5 2 effect of additives on power density of the system the extractable power density w watt m2 can be defined as the power generated per unit area of the membrane and is calculated using eq 20 on the basis of the tests performed in this work the effect of additives on porosity and hydrophilicity of the membranes were closely observed the major hindrance in the power generation by pro was the unavailability of adequate and high performance membranes the hydrophilicity and porosity of the membrane plays an important role in the performance of membrane the increasing porosity and hydrophilicity increases the permeation of fresh water from the fresh water side to the saline water side in this section we discuss the performance of the membranes obtained from ca and analyze their performance with addition of various additives from the tests performed a significant change in the water flux was observed with the varying additives the water flux for unmodified membrane was 4 14 10 2 cm3 cm2s but it increased to 15 97 10 2 cm3 cm2s when peg 4000 was added to the casting solution it again increased up to 18 34 10 2 cm3 cm2s when peg was 6000 these results indicate that with the increase in porosity of the membrane there is a corresponding increase in the hydrophilicity of the membranes and it eventually increases the power density also with the increase in the water flux the power density values were increased too for the unmodified membranes the obtained power density was 0 7 w m2 whereas it increased for peg 4000 2 7 w m2 and 3 1 w m2 for membrane with peg 6000 as additive during the experiments it was observed that with the movement of water from the feed side across the active layer into the draw side the layer of the semipermeable membranes retains salts from the feed solution and it causes the increase in their local concentration within the support layer this phenomenon adversely affects the performance of the process by increasing the local osmotic pressure of feed solution this reduces the effective osmotic driving force and hence decreasing the water flow during our experiment we worked on controlling the support layer casting conditions for increasing the performance of fabricated membranes and have been successful in reducing the effective thickness of the boundary layer which produced higher water flux and enhanced power density performance 6 conclusions in this study a prototype working on pro process was developed and various thin film ca membranes with various molecular weights of peg were fabricated the modified membranes were studied for varying porosity and hydrophilicity with changing additives furthermore these membranes were used in the prototype for power density performance calculations the effect of changing porosity for selected membranes in pro process was also studied the calculations show that the power density great has a great capability to predict the behavior of pro process it can be concluded from the obtained results that there is a significant increase in the porosity surface charge and hydrophilicity of the membranes when additives of peg with higher molecular weights were applied to the membrane solution during membrane fabrication which significantly increases the power density therefore this work demonstrates that enhanced power production is possible with the membranes having peg 6000 as additives along with ca as a polymer acknowledgements this work would not have been possible without the financial support of the mhrd and incois and the indian institute of technology kharagpur we are especially indebted to indian institute of technology guwahati for allowing us to perform various experiments at its chemical engineering department and use various research facilities which made the work easier and effective we are grateful to all of those with whom we have had the pleasure to work during this and other related projects 
14387,in this study different molecular weights of polyethylene glycol peg mw 4000 and 6000 g mole were used as additives for preparations of modified cellulose acetate ca flat asymmetric membranes the effects of additives on membrane characteristics and power density were investigated using the reverse osmosis and pressure retarded osmosis pro methods membrane characterization and power density of the fabricated membranes were evaluated using the pro setup the results show enhancement in the performance of membranes in terms of power density that can be extracted from the membranes with various additives furthermore a comparison was made on the power density obtained using different molecular weights of peg with ca as a base polymer a power density of 0 7 w m2 was obtained from the unmodified ca membrane which increased to 2 7 w m2 and 3 1 w m2 for the modified membranes with peg 4000 and 6000 respectively the enhanced power density was due to the better membrane characteristics with respect to its hydrophilicity pure water flux pwf salt rejection and porosity therefore this study provides deeper insights on the performance of membranes with higher molecular weight peg to get better power density values and attests importance of similar studies in energy science keywords flat asymmetric membrane salt rejection hydrophilicity power density pressure retarded osmosis

first century advancement in technology has also led to increase in consumption of energy globally by an individual and society the conventional sources of energy are potentially dependent on fossil fuels which release huge amount of toxic gases or pollutants and byproducts which harm the environment the rise in energy demand is alarming and warrants renewable sources to replace with the traditionally used non renewable and conventional energy sources from the widely used renewable sources of energy salinity gradient energy remains least harnessed although a number of studies are on going intensive research is needed to assess the feasibility of this process to make it a profitable energy source among the techniques used to generate energy using salinity gradient pressure retarded osmosis pro and reverse electrodyalisis red are widely practiced and studied a number of studies suggest that these two processes are highly effective and productive in terms of energy efficiency and feasibility preparation of effective and modified membranes for extraction of energy from salinity gradient is needed several studies are made on the performance of various forward osmosis and ion exchange membranes in accordance with the results in the previous studies pro is considered to be more efficient over red and is a novel technology with a long history 1 in 1973 after the oil crisis a sudden change in approach of study for renewable sources of energy was experienced and it took 20 years for the field of renewable sources to open up globally 2 5 efforts have been made to increase the efficiency of these processes using more effective and advanced membranes 4 norman 1974 was the first person to analyze the pro process as a feasible method to extract energy with the help of a schematic diagram 5 he explained that the fresh water could permeate through membranes which allows preferential transport of species the resulting pressurized saline water is allowed to discharge in a chamber separated by a selective membrane from a chamber where fresh water is continuously discharged then the water obtained as the output from the saline water chamber can rotate the blades of a turbine loeb et al 1976 presented the experimental basis for the pro process using hollow fiber ro membranes and validated the results 6 afterwards mehta and loeb 1978 discussed the factors affecting the performance of the process using various membranes 7 the effect of internal and external concentration polarization on reducing the power generation in pro was discussed in a subsequent study 8 9 later a number of models and studies were conducted on development of pro process by loeb and mehta using hypersaline draw solution furthermore lee et al 1981 developed a model to calculate power density and water flux from the pro process by considering internal concentration polarization and excluding external concentration polarization ecp 10 11 this model was considered as the reference model for the models studied thereafter a number studies were carried out leading to the progress in the efficiency of the pro process loeb 1998 studied the possibility of generating energy from the pro process in dead sea and estimated the cost of the generated electrical energy to be around 0 058 0 07 kwh after a number of studies developed models results and analysis on various membranes which can be used in pro system the norweign company statkraft launched the very first prototype working on pro process with 10 kw power capacity in 2009 achilli et al 2009 worked further on the model developed by lee et al 1981 using flat sheet cellulose triacetate cta fo membrane 11 later yip et al 2012 investigated using a thin film composite pro membrane with a polysulfone support layer and a polyamide active layer 12 a number of membranes were further manufactured and studied resulting in the advancement of the process although statkraft in 2014 declared its discontinuation in its work it opened wide area of research and scope for development in the pro technology many researchers are now working on the development of the membranes and analysis is being done on obtaining higher power densities the recent studies illustrates the advancement of pressure retarded osmosis pro and has shown major developments in the feasibility of the system for its practical operation to study the performance of the process and the membranes involved real waste water was used in the system to reduce the effect of membrane fouling the pretreatment of the feed water was done the results show a major increase in the water flux for the pro system by using low pressure nanofiltration nf pretreatment 21 another study reports that a sufficient strength to the pro structure is provided by the woven mesh polyester backings this porous support layer was observed to be deformed where the deformation was observed to be dependent on the opening size of the backing these findings explain that the mass transfer resistances in pro can be reduced by implementing more open backing layers is used 22 there are several studies based on various fo membranes for pro among which commercial fo asymmetric cellulose triacetate cta based flat sheet membranes are frequently investigated using deionized water as feed and 35 g l 1 nacl solution achilli et al 11 obtained a maximum power density of 2 73 w m2 at 9 72 bar pressure however power density of 5 06 w m2 at same pressure was also obtained with 60 g l 1 nacl solution and deionized water as feed she et al 2012 explored a peak power density of 4 5 w m2 can be obtained using cellulose triacetate forward osmosis membrane utilizing 1 m and 10 mm nacl solution as draw and feed 14 furthermore li et al 2013 explained that the conventionally prepared tfc fo membranes compacted and undergo deformation under high pressures he concluded that the membranes with sponge like cross section morphology are comparatively better than the finger like cross sections so as to withstand high pressures and undergo less membrane deformation 14 therefore in this study we have focused on increasing the membrane characteristics of ca membranes by adding various compositions of peg to examine the improvements in the power density values of the obtained using the pro methods which is not studied in details yet 2 material and methods 2 1 membrane preparation polyethylene glycol of average molecular weight 4000 6000 g mol n n dimethyl formamide dmf sodium chloride nacl and ca were obtained from the merck specialties private ltd germany deionized millipore water has been used throughout the experiments flat asymmetric pure ca membranes were prepared by phase inversion method using dimethyl forma amide dmf 80 wt as solvent and ca 20 wt whereas peg modified membranes were prepared using dmf 80 wt peg 4000 6000 5 wt and ca 20 wt the preparation of different membranes is shown in table 1 the compositions were mixed together with help of magnetic stirrer kept at 120 rpm speed on a hot plate for 12 h at 70 c and further degassed for 12 h in hot air oven at a 70 c the prepared solution was then casted on a transparent clean glass where the thickness was maintained to 120 μm with help of a casting knife the casted solution was then immediately immersed in deionized water the phase inversion occurs and color of the membranes immediately changes to milky white and eventually flat sheet membranes are formed these thin sheets were kept immersed in deionized water overnight and were further carefully peeled out and kept in air at normal temperature for drying 2 2 pure water flux pwf and salt rejection experiments an unstirred batch cell made of stainless steel having capacity 350 ml was used for both compaction for measuring pwf and salt rejection analysis it consists of a membrane steel support containing numerous minute pores as the base on which the membrane was kept the diameter of membrane was found to be 5 4 10 2 m and the effective area of membrane for permeation study was calculated to be 22 9 10 4 m2 the flux diagnosis was carried out in di water and permeate was collected from the base of the batch cell the compaction was carried out for nearly an hour and permeate was collected at an interval of 10 min the initial pwf and the final pwf at steady state were noted the experimental setup is schematically shown in fig 1 salt rejection analysis was carried out in the same manner with a 0 6 m nacl solution where ca membranes both modified and unmodified were used after compaction the pressure for salt rejection was kept lower than that for the compaction study at 240 kpa the solution permeate was collected after every 10 min and the salt concentration was measured at the end of 30 min 2 3 membrane characterization the important criteria for deciding membrane performance are pure water flux pwf porosity and pore size distribution of the membrane 13 membrane characterization depends both on morphological and permeation analysis the morphological analysis of the prepared membranes were done by microscopic evaluation and the performance was evaluated with respect to equilibrium water content ewc pwf compaction factor cf water contact angle average pore size of the prepared membranes was measured through mercury intrusion porosimetry mip make porous materials inc model amp 60k a 1 and compared with fesem images of the membranes the zeta potential of the membranes was performed using zeta analyzer make beckman coulter model delsa nano c 2 3 1 microscopic observation morphological analysis was done under microscopic observations and was performed by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem zeiss lsm 510 meta with an acceleration voltage after the samples were coated with thin gold layer the cross sectional images show how the pores have been formed also the porous asymmetric structure of the membrane with top dense layer and the thickness of the membrane were found 12 13 2 3 2 pwf salt rejection and cf for pressure driven flux study of prepared polymeric membrane compaction factor and pwf plays an important role the pwf was determined by passing deionized water through the compacted membrane the permeate flux was recorded at every 10 min by keeping the pressure constant at 275 kpa for 2 h the flux was calculated by the equation 1 j q a δ t j l m2h represents pure water flux q a and δt denotes volume of water collected l membrane area m2 and time interval h respectively in order to find out the water permeation coefficient the pure water flux was measured at different trans membrane pressure at the end of 2 h 2 j w a m δ p am represents water permeation coefficient cm3cm 2 s 1 atm 1 which was calculated from the slope value by plotting pure water flux vs different trans membrane pressure after doing salt rejection study permeate salt concentration was measured through conductivity studies and rejection

hydrophilicity increase in porosity enhances the water content flow through the membrane and hence effects the ewc and porosity of the membranes whereas hydrophilicity depends on the internal porous structure and the hydrophilic groups present in the membrane ewc at room temperature was calculated as 5 e w c w w w d w w 100 the membrane porosity was determined by 6 p o r o s i t y w w w d ρ v where ww and wd are the weight of membrane in wet and dry states respectively ρ is the density of water and v is volume of the membrane wet membranes after being mopped with tissue paper were weighed using an electronic balance furthermore the wet membranes were dried by putting in a vacuum oven for 24 h at a temperature of 50 60 c and were weighed again in dry state for calculation of membrane volume thickness of the membranes was measured by fesem image at different places and the average thickness was considered the hydrophilic property of the membranes was evaluated by measuring the average static contact angle up to 5 min at a regular interval of 1 min between the deionized water and membrane films at ambient condition at room temperature using contact angle goniometer make holmarc model ho iad cam 01b and image j software for measuring the contact angle membrane coupons of about 2cm 2 cm area were prepared by cutting the membrane sheet and fixing these samples at the glass plate with the help of adhesive tape then a drop of di water 20 μl was placed on the surface using a micropipette 3 pro analysis 3 1 methodology the water permeation flux jw through an ideal

experiments were conducted in a two sided closed diffusion chamber at an ambient temperature of 28 2 c the chambers consist of fresh and saline water separated by the prepared asymmetric ca membranes supported with a muslin cloth the membrane module was made with a dimension of 7 cm 6 cm the saline chamber side was filled with 0 6 m nacl solution with the help of a high pressure motor at a velocity of 149 75 cm s and output samples were collected at an interval of 10 min for further tests the values for diffusion coefficient d and kinematic viscosity η for 0 6 m nacl were obtained from touati et al 15 the fresh chamber containing deionized water was filled at lower velocity of 28 3 cm s under the effect of gravity and similarly the samples obtained at the output side were collected and tested the saline chamber output was kept at a height of 40 cm using a pipe of diameter 6 mm the output was collected in a container kept on a weighing balance to quantify the saline water collected during the experiment for a specific duration the whole experimental setup for pro analysis is illustrated in fig 2 4 results and discussions 4 1 membrane analysis through fesem fig 3 presents the cross sections at different magnifications for mf 1 mf 2 and mf 3 membranes from the analysis results present in fig 3a i the asymmetric density and porous nature of mf 1 was observed and fig 3a ii shows the porous nature of the membrane at higher magnification the thickness of membrane was nearly 120 μm and because of the asymmetric structure permeation and retention of solutes takes place furthermore there is a porous bulk containing finger like structure at the bottom which is responsible for mechanical support figs 3b i and 3 b ii of mf 2 membrane respectively shows the asymmetric structure and they demonstrate more porous nature with respect to mf 1 the porous nature and pore size of mf 3 were found to increase as compared to those of mf 1 and mf 2 henceforth the increase in peg molecular weight increases the porous layer and decreases dense layer from the different cross sectional images of mf 1 and mf 3 it can be concluded that mf 1 pore walls are less elongated and stretched as compared to mf 3 membranes when the casting solution film was immersed in the non solvent bath containing millipore water the fast solvent non solvent as well as the additive non solvent exchange occurs across the interface this leads to immediate precipitation of the polymer at the interface and thus a thin skinned layer and porous sub layer along with sponge like pores are formed fig 4 shows the top surface fesem images of mf 1 mf 2 and mf 3 the average pore size of the different membranes was calculated from the fesem images using image j software it was found out that all the membranes were of ultrafiltration range for mf 1 the average pore size was the highest but as the peg molecular weight increases the membrane pore size got decreased mf 1 mf 2 mf 3 this can be explained due to the fact that on addition of higher molecular weight peg more pores got formed since porosity and hydrophilicity enhanced and hence to accommodate more number of pores the average pore size got reduced moreover from mercury intrusion porosimetry mip analysis the pore size was found to be around 30 3 nm 27 67 nm and 23 4 nm for mf 1 mf 2 and mf 3 respectively the increase in size for mip analysis may be due to internal large pores which were not obtained under fesem images the results were summarized in table 2 4 2 compaction analysis of prepared membranes 4 2 1 effect of additives on pwf of the prepared membranes pure water flux for different peg modified membranes was calculated using eq 1 the effect of various molecular weights of peg on ca membranes at 275 kpa trans membrane pressures is illustrated in fig 5 it was found that mf 1 has the lowest pwf of 143 l m2h whereas the pwf for mf 2 and mf 3 was 561 l m2h and 621 l m2h respectively the formation of better pores and enhanced porosity were already discussed figs 3 and 4 these results show that mf 2 and mf 3 have better pore formation and are more hydrophilic with respect to mf 1 13 14 the peg additives enhances hydrophilicity of the modified membranes and with the increase in peg molecular weight from 4000 to 6000 pwf also increased from 561 l m2h to 621 l m2h the increase in porous layer of the membrane is experienced with increase in peg molecular weight which increases the hydrophilicity and the pwf of the modified membranes 4 2 2 effect of additives on compaction factor c f of the prepared membranes the membrane sublayer structure plays a key role in determining the cf of the prepared membranes which was calculated using eq 4 due to the presence of large macro voids in the membrane the compactness increases to a higher level and signifies the sponginess of the prepared membranes 13 the compaction behavior of the prepared membrane is illustrated in fig 5 which signifies that pwf falls sharply and by 80 min it reaches to a steady state the compaction values are given in table 2 which indicates that the membrane is quite dense as the cf is small due to the compaction of prepared membrane pore walls become closer straightens and average size of the pores get reduced which decreases the water flux the figure demonstrates that the pwf increases due to the higher molecular weight of peg mf 3 containing peg 6000 as additive shows a pwf of 621 2 l m2h whereas the mf 2 with peg 4000 results pwf of 561 2 l m2h and mf 1 containing no additive has pwf of 143 5 l m2h the additives formed can either enlarge or suppress the macro void region in the sublayer which accounts for the cf values of all the prepared membranes given in table 2 4 3 membrane characterization by ewc porosity and hydrophilicity 4 3 1 effect of additive on ewc the results of ewc for different membranes were calculated using eq 5 and are provided in table 2 the ewc values recorded are 30 7 1 5 38 1 1 3 and 44 6 1 7 for mf 1 mf 2 and mf 3 respectively this value has a similar relation with pwf and plays an important role for evaluating hydrophilicity of a membrane the use of higher molecular weight peg leads to better pore formation on the surface and cavities in the sublayer which are responsible for holding more number of water molecules in the membranes 13 as pwf and ewc have a close relation for evaluating hydrophilicity it concludes that with higher molecular weight peg the above mentioned parameter increases hence the mf 3 membrane is more hydrophilic a s compared to the other prepared membranes 4 3 2 effect of additive on porosity and hydrophilicity the porosity and hydrophilicity of the membrane play an important role for membrane permeation and separation process the porosity of the prepared membranes was calculated using eq 5 and diagrams for contact angle as shown in fig 6 the results clearly indicates that with increase in peg molecular weight the porosity of the prepared membranes increases the porosity for mf 1 mf 2 and mf 3 are 0 17 0 03 0 22 0 02 and 0 27 0 01 respectively the surface hydrophilicity was measured by contact angle fig 6 which also rises due to the above fact that with the use of higher molecular weight peg the hydrophilicity increases and as a result the contact angle decreases here the contact angle decreased from 58 2 1 03 53 0 23 for mf 1 and mf 3 membranes respectively moreover the zeta potential was found to be 1 17 mv 23 16 mv and 23 62 mv for mf 1 mf 2 and mf 3 respectively it was found out that with addition of higher molecular weight peg containing oh groups the surface charge increases which helps for better water permeation for water permeation hydrogen bonding between the water molecules and membrane surface is very crucial the peg molecules within mf 2 and mf 3 enhance this phenomenon and thus water flux increases for these membranes hence it was concluded that not only porosity and hydrophilicity but surface charge also plays an important role for water flux characterization of membranes the porosity variation of membranes is based on the thermodynamic and kinetic consideration the thermodynamic enhancement of phase separation occurs due to the inclusion of additives to the casting solution due to which the miscibility of casting solution with non solvent reduces and instantaneous de mixing gets enhanced 12 14 the kinetic hindrance factor against phase separation gets enhanced due to increase in viscosity of the casting solution which results in delayed de mixing 2 3 the viscosities of casting solutions were measured as 1 6 pa s 1 77 pa s and 1 86 pa s for mf 1 mf 2 and mf 3 respectively as suggested by young and chen 14 for the increase in viscosity of the casting solution the ratio of non solvent inflow to solvent outflow increases resulting in increased porous structure of the membrane therefore with increase in molecular weight of the additive in the casting solution the miscibility of solution with non solvent water decreases which accounts for more porosity similarly due to the bulkiness of the additive formed its gets retained within the membrane pore walls and enhances hydrophilicity of the prepared membranes 5 pro analysis 5 1 effect of additives on conductivity osmotic water flux conductivity of a solution determines the amount of dissociable ions present within a solution conducting electricity the initial conductivity of feed 0 6 m nacl was 35 2 ms cm from fig 7 it can be seen that conductivity on the saline side for mf 3 decreased to 25 15 ms cm whereas for mf 2 and mf 1 the value reduces to 27 17 ms cm and 30 1 ms cm respectively also the conductivity increases to 19 9 ms cm 18 6 ms cm and 16 9 ms cm for mf 3 mf 2 and mf 1 respectively in the fresh water chamber the porous nature of the membrane though the rejection increases for mf 3 but due to molar diffusion more salt permeates towards fresh water side table 3 shows the osmotic water flux permeating through different peg modified membrane the unmodified membrane mf 1 was found to have a water flux of 4 14 10 2 cm3 cm2s whereas mf 2 and mf 3 have osmotic water fluxes of 15 97 10 2 cm3 cm2s and 18 34 10 2 cm3 cm2s respectively therefore it can be said that porosity surface charge and hydrophilicity of the membrane plays an important role for transportation of salt and water molecules as mf 3 is more hydrophilic and porous in nature it shows better results than other membranes 5 2 effect of additives on power density of the system the extractable power density w watt m2 can be defined as the power generated per unit area of the membrane and is calculated using eq 20 on the basis of the tests performed in this work the effect of additives on porosity and hydrophilicity of the membranes were closely observed the major hindrance in the power generation by pro was the unavailability of adequate and high performance membranes the hydrophilicity and porosity of the membrane plays an important role in the performance of membrane the increasing porosity and hydrophilicity increases the permeation of fresh water from the fresh water side to the saline water side in this section we discuss the performance of the membranes obtained from ca and analyze their performance with addition of various additives from the tests performed a significant change in the water flux was observed with the varying additives the water flux for unmodified membrane was 4 14 10 2 cm3 cm2s but it increased to 15 97 10 2 cm3 cm2s when peg 4000 was added to the casting solution it again increased up to 18 34 10 2 cm3 cm2s when peg was 6000 these results indicate that with the increase in porosity of the membrane there is a corresponding increase in the hydrophilicity of the membranes and it eventually increases the power density also with the increase in the water flux the power density values were increased too for the unmodified membranes the obtained power density was 0 7 w m2 whereas it increased for peg 4000 2 7 w m2 and 3 1 w m2 for membrane with peg 6000 as additive during the experiments it was observed that with the movement of water from the feed side across the active layer into the draw side the layer of the semipermeable membranes retains salts from the feed solution and it causes the increase in their local concentration within the support layer this phenomenon adversely affects the performance of the process by increasing the local osmotic pressure of feed solution this reduces the effective osmotic driving force and hence decreasing the water flow during our experiment we worked on controlling the support layer casting conditions for increasing the performance of fabricated membranes and have been successful in reducing the effective thickness of the boundary layer which produced higher water flux and enhanced power density performance 6 conclusions in this study a prototype working on pro process was developed and various thin film ca membranes with various molecular weights of peg were fabricated the modified membranes were studied for varying porosity and hydrophilicity with changing additives furthermore these membranes were used in the prototype for power density performance calculations the effect of changing porosity for selected membranes in pro process was also studied the calculations show that the power density great has a great capability to predict the behavior of pro process it can be concluded from the obtained results that there is a significant increase in the porosity surface charge and hydrophilicity of the membranes when additives of peg with higher molecular weights were applied to the membrane solution during membrane fabrication which significantly increases the power density therefore this work demonstrates that enhanced power production is possible with the membranes having peg 6000 as additives along with ca as a polymer acknowledgements this work would not have been possible without the financial support of the mhrd and incois and the indian institute of technology kharagpur we are especially indebted to indian institute of technology guwahati for allowing us to perform various experiments at its chemical engineering department and use various research facilities which made the work easier and effective we are grateful to all of those with whom we have had the pleasure to work during this and other related projects 
14388,reverse osmosis ro is one of the most globally competitive technologies for desalination and water purification in which thin film composite tfc membrane is the common form of membranes used in this paper we examined changes in membrane performance by studying the effects of 1 m phenylenediamine mpd and trimesoyl chloride tmc exposure times 2 different phase inversion methods to prepare polysulfone psu support sheets 3 the support sheet thickness and 4 the fabricated membrane s drying temperature operational conditions of 300 psi 25 c 2000 ppm nacl and sample run time of at least 8 h were applied optimal performance results were achieved when the interfacial polymerization time was short and a vertical immersion during psu layer preparation was applied increasing psu sheet thickness increased the salt rejection but decreased the water flux while rising the curing temperature led to an enhancement in salt rejection and water flux at short reaction times based on this study a tfc membrane of nacl rejection 98 8 0 5 and water flux 76 1 2 7 l m2 h was fabricated using 25 s mpd contacting time 5 s tmc reaction time and 110 c drying temperature this result is considered high among reported outcomes in the literature for simply prepared tfc membranes keywords reverse osmosis ro thin film composite tfc membranes desalination interfacial polymerization ip phase inversion membranes preparation 1 introduction water shortage is a serious challenge arising from and limiting human growth and development different forms of technologies were developed to treat and use water from different resources 1 since the first recorded membrane was invented in the nineteenth century by traube 2 membrane technology has been increasingly used in different separation systems such as gas separation and water treatment 3 reverse osmosis ro is a relatively mature method of desalination that produces potable water from a saline solution 4 large scale ro plants are of high interest due to the increase in demand for pure water to illustrate the number of large scale plants in operation has doubled within the past decade 5 this trend also indicates the reliability of this technology and its competitiveness in terms of energy and scaling up in operation the membrane is the key part of the ro process its development took place in the late 1950 s when loeb and sourirajan invented the first applicable membrane made of cellulose acetate 6 this membrane dominated research and practical applications till the early 1980s when john caddote invented the polyamide pa thin film composite membrane by the interfacial polymerization ip of mpd in aqueous solution and tmc in organic solvent 7 the tfc membrane has become the state of the art for ro processes including efforts to improve its performance by incorporating additives filling nanoparticles nps such as silica 8 9 clay 10 zeolite 11 and metal organic frameworks 12 13 inside the membrane results in the thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes with enhanced performance also following the preparation by post treatments 14 was another way to improve the membrane product the tfc membrane is normally few hundred nanometer thick that attached to a polymeric supporting sheet such as psu which is manufactured using the phase inversion phenomenon 15 16 desalination through membranes has been explained by different theories including the solution diffusion theory in which water and salts molecules diffuse inside the pa layer and transport from one side to another 17 here high membrane hydrophilicity is an important property since it helps prevent bio fouling and attracts water molecules 18 of course a broader perspective is needed to study the development and optimization of membrane performance among many parameters affecting membrane water desalination wilf et al studied the effect of salt concentrations in feed water on membrane salt rejection 19 results showed that higher amounts of salt passed through the membrane at low and high feed salinity when compared with moderate salt concentration the highly negatively charged membranes imparted strong donnan potential for moderate salinity feed however this potential became weak by using high nacl concentration feed ghosh et al 20 investigated and reported the effects of 1 dissolving tmc in four organic solvents 2 adding tea csa salt to mpd solution 3 the temperature of the tmc solution when the pa layer was synthesized and 4 the curing temperature on the membranes efficiency a more recent study from our group 21 focused on the role of the psu support layer showing that by increasing psu concentration in the casting solution the water flux decreased ho s group has also examined the effects of controlling the membrane synthesis conditions including the tmc exposure time curing time tea csa salt concentration tmc and mpd concentrations and different post treatment approaches 22 23 these studies showed that many factors and conditions may affect membrane efficiency nevertheless mpd exposure time was not studied as much as the reaction time even though it influenced the membrane specifications also many groups are using commercial support layers so the effects of support layer thickness and phase inversion procedures were not commonly reported in this work the effects of mpd aqueous solution and tmc organic solution exposure time were studied also three phase inversion approaches for psu sheet preparation were applied and the best was selected by the scanning electron microscopy sem examination the influence on membrane performance by varying the support sheet thickness and increasing the curing temperature during the membrane manufacturing were reported as well this work produced very high performance membranes by only controlling the synthesis conditions the best among them had a water flux of 76 1 2 7 l m2hr and 98 8 0 5 salt rejection as tested by 2000 ppb nacl and at 300 psi transmembrane pressure 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polysulfone pellets psu mw 35000 and n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 8 were purchased from sigma aldrich and used for psu sheet preparation the membrane synthesis materials m phenylenediamine mpd 99 and trimesoyl chloride tmc 98 5 were purchased from fisher scientific and sigma aldrich respectively 2 2 4 trimethylpentane isooctane 99 and calcium chloride cacl2 were obtained from fisher scientific triethylamine tea 99 1s 10 camphorsulfonic acid csa 99 and sodium chloride nacl were purchased from sigma aldrich a millipore di water synergy185 18 2 mω cm system was employed to prepare mpd aqueous solution and for cleaning purposes 2 2 preparation and characterization of psu support layer sheets psu supporting sheets were prepared by the phase inversion process briefly a solution was made by dissolving polysulfone pellets in dmf solvent in portions of 15 85 wt respectively the mixture was heated to 60 c and stirred for 6 h until a clear solution formed which was left over night for degassing the process involved in taking an aliquot from the solution by a pipette to spread on a glass plate then a casting knife mti corp eq se ktq 150 was used to cast the solution to the desired thickness 130 μm in this work except for the section of studying thickness effect afterwards the glass plate with the solution on its top was immersed in water resulting in immediate formation of the support sheet finally the sheets were collected rinsed and stored in di water for at least 24 h at 4 c prior to use three submerging ways of the glass plate into water were examined free drop horizontal and vertical during the preparation of psu support sheets the sem images for the membranes were captured to study the impact of the submerging ways on the membrane morphological characteristics psu sheets were prepared for the sem analysis by drying them at room temperature and storing at 4 c until the examination the sheets were spread on a sticky testing pan and coated with 10 nm platinum layer using an ems 150tes sputter coater for 1 min at 20 milliamps before the specimens were mounted onto an fei quanta 600f environmental sem for the imaging at different resolutions 2 3 tfc membrane preparation tfc membranes were prepared by the interfacial polymerization reaction of mpd and tmc on a psu sheet the psu layer was spread gently on a plate of glass and the excess water from storage was removed by a squeegee roller mpd aqueous solution which consisted of 2 mpd 1 csa tea salt and 0 01 cacl2 was first poured onto the psu sheet mpd solution psu layer contact time varied in order to evaluate its effect on the membrane performance a tmc solution made by dissolving 0 15 tmc in isooctane was poured onto psu sheet that contained mpd active sites on its surface and the reaction time was changed to study its effect the extra tmc solution was removed by an air knife the selection of isooctane as organic solvent was based on the recommendations from our previous work 8 the prepared tfc membrane was dried at 80 c for 6 min in all preparations except for the part studying the temperature effect where the temperature was raised to 110 c the final membrane product was soaked in di water and stored in a refrigerator for at least 20 h at 4 c before the performance assessments were applied 2 4 performance assessments each prepared membrane in this study was placed in a cross flow testing system as shown in our previous work 8 to measure the water flux and salt rejection the tests were conducted using 2000 ppm nacl feed solution and 300 psi cross membrane pressure at room temperature the filtration cell had a surface area of 9 6 cm2 millipore corp stainless steel xx4504700 the water flux was calculated based on the accumulated volume of permeated water as a function of time whereas the salt rejection was determined by measuring the total dissolved solids tds of the in and out water using a conductivity meter hach company the feed tank temperature was maintained at 25 c by an external water bath the water flux and salt rejection were calculated by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 j v a t where j is the water flux l m2hr v the product volume l a the membrane area m2 and t the accumulation time h 2 r 1 cp cf 100 where r is the salt rejection ratio cp the permeate conductivity and cf the feed conductivity it is worth noting that a test under each condition was conducted at least three times and the average result was reported with the standard deviation shown as error bars 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of mpd and tmc exposure times tfc membranes were fabricated by the ip of mpd and tmc in which the exposure time for both chemicals was found to largely impact the membrane performance in this section the study was conducted using 130 μm horizontally immersed psu sheets and curing temperature of 80 c mpd exposure time may affect the density of the active sites on psu sheet surface while tmc exposure time is the ip reaction time in which the membrane is generated at the separation interface here since tmc has a low solubility in water the ip occurred in the organic phase so it is required to maintain mpd tmc ratio high to drive mpd diffusion into tmc isooctane solution 20 24 however if the ratio is too high a reduction in carboxylic acid groups may occur which decrease the hydrophilicity and surface charge resulting in the water flux and salt rejection decreases hence 25 the detailed results are shown in the following 3 1 1 mpd exposing time pouring mpd aqueous solution on the psu layer is the first step in tfc membrane synthesis four mpd psu contact times 10 20 25 and 30 s were investigated to evaluate the influence of changing mpd contact time on the membrane performance at a constant tmc contact time fig 1 as shown in fig 1a when the tmc exposure time was 5 s the salt rejection and water flux didn t change significantly by changing mpd solution exposure time by increasing tmc exposure time it can be noted that mpd contact time started to affect the results from fig 1b e it can be concluded that by increasing mpd exposing time the salt rejection increased this can be explained 19 by considering that as mpd is one of the ip reactants increasing its contact time increased the reaction active sites the water flux also increased by increasing the exposure time up to 25 s but decreased at longer times the results at times shorter than 25 s are in contrary with the general concept which consider the increase in thin film thickness leads to decrease the water flux as was reported in another study 20 this could be attributed to two reasons first when mpd exposure time was increased more mpd molecules would react with the surface some mpd molecules might have one or both amine groups oxidized which increased the hydrophilicity the second is related to the cross linking of the membrane increasing mpd psu contact could produce a well formed membrane since membrane generation depends on many factors including the diffusivity of mpd to tmc organic solution higher mpd contact time generally decreased the total performance which could be attributed to the lack of free carboxylic groups on the membrane surface 26 mpd contact time of 25 s gave the best results as deduced from fig 1 this time could be critical to have well distributed and absorbed mpd molecules over the support layer which gave the best cross linking when reacted with the tmc later 3 1 2 tmc exposing time tmc is the second reactant in the ip reaction to produce the thin film composite membrane after mpd covered the support sheet surface as explained above tmc solution was poured onto it for different reaction times 5 10 15 20 and 25 s at room temperature tmc s acyl chloride group reacted with mpd s amine group and generated the thin film composite membrane 27 fig 2 a d demonstrate tmc contact time effects on both salt rejection and water flux at a constant mpd exposure time from all figures it is clear that a reaction time of 5 s gave the best results at all mpd contact times generally the water flux decreased by increasing reaction time while the salt rejection increased this might be because of the increase in membrane thickness and cross linking it can be noted that the salt rejection was almost maintained the same at all reaction times although longer time gave slightly higher results which can be attributed to the increase of the top dense layer thickness 28 here the flux dropped by increasing the reaction time because of the dense layer growth another explanation could be the physiochemical properties of the reaction mpd tmc reaction is rapid so the formed polyamide layer decreased mpd transfer toward the tmc isooctane solution for this reason no large difference was observed in salt rejection by increasing the reaction time conversely at short reaction times some tmc molecules did not react which allowed the acyl chloride group to hydrolyze and form the cooh group the carboxylic group is hydrophilic which could increase the membrane hydrophilicity and the water flux afterwards 27 3 2 psu sheets casting methods different phase inversion methods were tested for psu support layer synthesis as mentioned before the support layer solution was made by dissolving polysulfone in dmf fig 3 shows three methods of immersing the glass plate that held 130 μm thick casting solution on its top into a water bath the method illustrated in fig 3a was the free drop method where the glass plate was dropped into the water one time this method is not recommended because of the holes that generated inside the sheet in addition to low membrane performance results for the sheet that has no holes this is explained by the water covering the plate roughly and producing these holes the membrane performance results made on these layers were not reported fig 3b shows the second method in which the glass plate was immersed horizontally in the water bath the water this time covered the plate more gently and uniformly this type of submerging is commonly used by researchers the membranes in this paper were synthesized on support layers made by this form of immersion the last method is the vertical method as shown in fig 3c which seemed to work better than others this method produced very flat uniform and homogeneous sheets the morphology by the naked eye was very good and no holes existed in the sheets fig 4 illustrates sem images and performance comparison between the horizontal and vertical immersing methods where a and c are for the horizontal submerging b and d for the vertical one and e and f display the results of salt rejection and water flux respectively by comparing a with b it is clear that the vertical submerging produced high uniformly sheets with no wide pores or change in morphology thickness sheets attained from the horizontal submerging showed less uniformity comparing with the vertical method also different size pores were observed on top of the sheets this difference in morphology may be attributed to the way that water covered the casting solution in which in the vertical way water surrounded psu sheets neatly horizontal immersion has different challenges first the way of submerging the sheet would differ depending on experience of the operator second the submerging angle affected how gently the water covers the casted solution third water level in the bath might also influence how the water becomes in contact finally dipping speed casting speed room temperature and humidity etc may also affect the output fig 4c and d shows the surface pores it appeared that vertical submerging leaded to generate well organized and distributed pores however horizontal dipping produced different sized pores including large ones around 100 nm this influenced tmc s water flux and salt rejection as will be explained later thereby we like to state that the vertical submerging is easier to apply and control and produced higher performance tfc fig 4e and f shows salt rejection and water flux comparisons respectively for sheets made by the horizontal and vertical methods fig 4e shows the salt rejection comparison where the immersion method affected it slightly while fig 4f clearly shows the effect of phase inversion methods on membrane water permeability the comparison was between membranes made by 25 s mpd contact time and different tmc exposure times 5 10 and 15 s on 130 μm thick support sheets and drying temperature of 80 c by immersing the plate horizontally the salt rejection was slightly higher than the membranes on vertically submerged supports but the water flux was lower the vertically submerged sheets were smooth and well shaped which either allowed the membrane to form properly or the sheet porosity was higher than the horizontally immersed sheets as a result higher water flux was achieved another explanation attributes this behavior to the pores size here for the horizontally immersed sheets the pores were larger which allowed mpd solution to diffuse deeper into the support layer and blocked the pores ends a thicker polyamide layer is generated hence as a result salt rejection increased and water flux decreased when compared with the vertical immersed sheets in which pores were smaller 29 3 3 effect of psu layer thickness 15 psu in dmf solution was casted in four different thicknesses by a casting knife 50 80 130 and 150 μm the preparation conditions of the membranes were 25 s mpd contact time 15 s tmc reaction time horizontal immersing for the support layers and 80 c curing temperature increasing the support layer thickness resulted in an increased salt rejection but decreased water flux this could be because of the hydrophobic nature of the psu whenever the sheet thickness increased the water and salt faced higher resistance fig 5 shows support layer thickness effects on the membrane performance 3 4 effect of drying temperature the last aim in this work was to study the effect of increasing the drying temperature after the membranes were prepared they were heated to 80 c to evaporate any remaining isooctane in this section the drying temperature was raised to 110 c and the results were compared to the original samples fig 6 a and b shows the effect of raising the temperature on salt rejection and water flux respectively by increasing the curing temperature both salt rejection and water flux increased the samples were made by exposure to mpd for 25 s and tmc for 5 10 and 15 s on 130 μm thick horizontally immersed support sheets from fig 6a it is clear that by increasing the curing temperature nacl rejection increased this is due to the fast evaporation of the remaining organic solution which might give better cross linking for the polyamide layer in terms of flux the best results were obtained when the reaction time was 5 s when the reaction time was longer the water flux dropped as shown in fig 6b again this could be because when the reaction time was short some of the tmc reacted and the rest left which hydrolyzed and increased the hydrophilicity also the difference in water flux between the two temperatures dropped as the reaction time increased this could be attributed to the deformation of the top dense layer of the membrane as it increased by increasing the reaction time 3 5 why this work is important tfc membranes dominate desalination research and markets since they have been discovered the same manufacturing basics are used with some modifications in this work by manipulating some physical conditions during preparation a big improvement in performance was achieved without the incorporation of other additives complex preparation methods and or post treatment thereby at the optimum conditions of synthesis the produced membranes were highly practical table 1 shows our best result compared with other control samples before they had any additives added or post treatment by applying this paper s recommendations previous and future works could obtain improved results using the same procedures and additives already used 4 conclusions in this work the synthesis conditions of reverse osmosis membranes were investigated mpd and tmc exposure times were studied and the best results were found to be at 25 s and 5 s for mpd and tmc contacting times respectively the best phase inversion method was the vertical immersion method support layer thickness affected membrane performance as well by exploring the trade off relationship between salt rejection and water flux it was found that a thickness of 80 130 μm could be the best choice finally increasing curing temperature positively affected the performance of membranes produced at short reaction times but the effect was diminished by increasing the reaction times the above report describes a technical guide for researchers and workers who can gain higher yield from membranes that they manufacture due to the lack in the literature on the impact of the support layer on tfc membrane performance this work was designed to narrow partially that gap however a wide area is open to study other influencing factors relevant to support layer formation and tfc membrane fabrication acknowledgment we gratefully acknowledge the higher committee for education development in iraq hced

14388,reverse osmosis ro is one of the most globally competitive technologies for desalination and water purification in which thin film composite tfc membrane is the common form of membranes used in this paper we examined changes in membrane performance by studying the effects of 1 m phenylenediamine mpd and trimesoyl chloride tmc exposure times 2 different phase inversion methods to prepare polysulfone psu support sheets 3 the support sheet thickness and 4 the fabricated membrane s drying temperature operational conditions of 300 psi 25 c 2000 ppm nacl and sample run time of at least 8 h were applied optimal performance results were achieved when the interfacial polymerization time was short and a vertical immersion during psu layer preparation was applied increasing psu sheet thickness increased the salt rejection but decreased the water flux while rising the curing temperature led to an enhancement in salt rejection and water flux at short reaction times based on this study a tfc membrane of nacl rejection 98 8 0 5 and water flux 76 1 2 7 l m2 h was fabricated using 25 s mpd contacting time 5 s tmc reaction time and 110 c drying temperature this result is considered high among reported outcomes in the literature for simply prepared tfc membranes keywords reverse osmosis ro thin film composite tfc membranes desalination interfacial polymerization ip phase inversion membranes preparation 1 introduction water shortage is a serious challenge arising from and limiting human growth and development different forms of technologies were developed to treat and use water from different resources 1 since the first recorded membrane was invented in the nineteenth century by traube 2 membrane technology has been increasingly used in different separation systems such as gas separation and water treatment 3 reverse osmosis ro is a relatively mature method of desalination that produces potable water from a saline solution 4 large scale ro plants are of high interest due to the increase in demand for pure water to illustrate the number of large scale plants in operation has doubled within the past decade 5 this trend also indicates the reliability of this technology and its competitiveness in terms of energy and scaling up in operation the membrane is the key part of the ro process its development took place in the late 1950 s when loeb and sourirajan invented the first applicable membrane made of cellulose acetate 6 this membrane dominated research and practical applications till the early 1980s when john caddote invented the polyamide pa thin film composite membrane by the interfacial polymerization ip of mpd in aqueous solution and tmc in organic solvent 7 the tfc membrane has become the state of the art for ro processes including efforts to improve its performance by incorporating additives filling nanoparticles nps such as silica 8 9 clay 10 zeolite 11 and metal organic frameworks 12 13 inside the membrane results in the thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes with enhanced performance also following the preparation by post treatments 14 was another way to improve the membrane product the tfc membrane is normally few hundred nanometer thick that attached to a polymeric supporting sheet such as psu which is manufactured using the phase inversion phenomenon 15 16 desalination through membranes has been explained by different theories including the solution diffusion theory in which water and salts molecules diffuse inside the pa layer and transport from one side to another 17 here high membrane hydrophilicity is an important property since it helps prevent bio fouling and attracts water molecules 18 of course a broader perspective is needed to study the development and optimization of membrane performance among many parameters affecting membrane water desalination wilf et al studied the effect of salt concentrations in feed water on membrane salt rejection 19 results showed that higher amounts of salt passed through the membrane at low and high feed salinity when compared with moderate salt concentration the highly negatively charged membranes imparted strong donnan potential for moderate salinity feed however this potential became weak by using high nacl concentration feed ghosh et al 20 investigated and reported the effects of 1 dissolving tmc in four organic solvents 2 adding tea csa salt to mpd solution 3 the temperature of the tmc solution when the pa layer was synthesized and 4 the curing temperature on the membranes efficiency a more recent study from our group 21 focused on the role of the psu support layer showing that by increasing psu concentration in the casting solution the water flux decreased ho s group has also examined the effects of controlling the membrane synthesis conditions including the tmc exposure time curing time tea csa salt concentration tmc and mpd concentrations and different post treatment approaches 22 23 these studies showed that many factors and conditions may affect membrane efficiency nevertheless mpd exposure time was not studied as much as the reaction time even though it influenced the membrane specifications also many groups are using commercial support layers so the effects of support layer thickness and phase inversion procedures were not commonly reported in this work the effects of mpd aqueous solution and tmc organic solution exposure time were studied also three phase inversion approaches for psu sheet preparation were applied and the best was selected by the scanning electron microscopy sem examination the influence on membrane performance by varying the support sheet thickness and increasing the curing temperature during the membrane manufacturing were reported as well this work produced very high performance membranes by only controlling the synthesis conditions the best among them had a water flux of 76 1 2 7 l m2hr and 98 8 0 5 salt rejection as tested by 2000 ppb nacl and at 300 psi transmembrane pressure 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polysulfone pellets psu mw 35000 and n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 8 were purchased from sigma aldrich and used for psu sheet preparation the membrane synthesis materials m phenylenediamine mpd 99 and trimesoyl chloride tmc 98 5 were purchased from fisher scientific and sigma aldrich respectively 2 2 4 trimethylpentane isooctane 99 and calcium chloride cacl2 were obtained from fisher scientific triethylamine tea 99 1s 10 camphorsulfonic acid csa 99 and sodium chloride nacl were purchased from sigma aldrich a millipore di water synergy185 18 2 mω cm system was employed to prepare mpd aqueous solution and for cleaning purposes 2 2 preparation and characterization of psu support layer sheets psu supporting sheets were prepared by the phase inversion process briefly a solution was made by dissolving polysulfone pellets in dmf solvent in portions of 15 85 wt respectively the mixture was heated to 60 c and stirred for 6 h until a clear solution formed which was left over night for degassing the process involved in taking an aliquot from the solution by a pipette to spread on a glass plate then a casting knife mti corp eq se ktq 150 was used to cast the solution to the desired thickness 130 μm in this work except for the section of studying thickness effect afterwards the glass plate with the solution on its top was immersed in water resulting in immediate formation of the support sheet finally the sheets were collected rinsed and stored in di water for at least 24 h at 4 c prior to use three submerging ways of the glass plate into water were examined free drop horizontal and vertical during the preparation of psu support sheets the sem images for the membranes were captured to study the impact of the submerging ways on the membrane morphological characteristics psu sheets were prepared for the sem analysis by drying them at room temperature and storing at 4 c until the examination the sheets were spread on a sticky testing pan and coated with 10 nm platinum layer using an ems 150tes sputter coater for 1 min at 20 milliamps before the specimens were mounted onto an fei quanta 600f environmental sem for the imaging at different resolutions 2 3 tfc membrane preparation tfc membranes were prepared by the interfacial polymerization reaction of mpd and tmc on a psu sheet the psu layer was spread gently on a plate of glass and the excess water from storage was removed by a squeegee roller mpd aqueous solution which consisted of 2 mpd 1 csa tea salt and 0 01 cacl2 was first poured onto the psu sheet mpd solution psu layer contact time varied in order to evaluate its effect on the membrane performance a tmc solution made by dissolving 0 15 tmc in isooctane was poured onto psu sheet that contained mpd active sites on its surface and the reaction time was changed to study its effect the extra tmc solution was removed by an air knife the selection of isooctane as organic solvent was based on the recommendations from our previous work 8 the prepared tfc membrane was dried at 80 c for 6 min in all preparations except for the part studying the temperature effect where the temperature was raised to 110 c the final membrane product was soaked in di water and stored in a refrigerator for at least 20 h at 4 c before the performance assessments were applied 2 4 performance assessments each prepared membrane in this study was placed in a cross flow testing system as shown in our previous work 8 to measure the water flux and salt rejection the tests were conducted using 2000 ppm nacl feed solution and 300 psi cross membrane pressure at room temperature the filtration cell had a surface area of 9 6 cm2 millipore corp stainless steel xx4504700 the water flux was calculated based on the accumulated volume of permeated water as a function of time whereas the salt rejection was determined by measuring the total dissolved solids tds of the in and out water using a conductivity meter hach company the feed tank temperature was maintained at 25 c by an external water bath the water flux and salt rejection were calculated by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 j v a t where j is the water flux l m2hr v the product volume l a the membrane area m2 and t the accumulation time h 2 r 1 cp cf 100 where r is the salt rejection ratio cp the permeate conductivity and cf the feed conductivity it is worth noting that a test under each condition was conducted at least three times and the average result was reported with the standard deviation shown as error bars 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of mpd and tmc exposure times tfc membranes were fabricated by the ip of mpd and tmc in which the exposure time for both chemicals was found to largely impact the membrane performance in this section the study was conducted using 130 μm horizontally immersed psu sheets and curing temperature of 80 c mpd exposure time may affect the density of the active sites on psu sheet surface while tmc exposure time is the ip reaction time in which the membrane is generated at the separation interface here since tmc has a low solubility in water the ip occurred in the organic phase so it is required to maintain mpd tmc ratio high to drive mpd diffusion into tmc isooctane solution 20 24 however if the ratio is too high a reduction in carboxylic acid groups may occur which decrease the hydrophilicity and surface charge resulting in the water flux and salt rejection decreases hence 25 the detailed results are shown in the following 3 1 1 mpd exposing time pouring mpd aqueous solution on the psu layer is the first step in tfc membrane synthesis four mpd psu contact times 10 20 25 and 30 s were investigated to evaluate the influence of changing mpd contact time on the membrane performance at a constant tmc contact time fig 1 as shown in fig 1a when the tmc exposure time was 5 s the salt rejection and water flux didn t change significantly by changing mpd solution exposure time by increasing tmc exposure time it can be noted that mpd contact time started to affect the results from fig 1b e it can be concluded that by increasing mpd exposing time the salt rejection increased this can be explained 19 by considering that as mpd is one of the ip reactants increasing its contact time increased the reaction active sites the water flux also increased by increasing the exposure time up to 25 s but decreased at longer times the results at times shorter than 25 s are in contrary with the general concept which consider the increase in thin film thickness leads to decrease the water flux as was reported in another study 20 this could be attributed to two reasons first when mpd exposure time was increased more mpd molecules would react with the surface some mpd molecules might have one or both amine groups oxidized which increased the hydrophilicity the second is related to the cross linking of the membrane increasing mpd psu contact could produce a well formed membrane since membrane generation depends on many factors including the diffusivity of mpd to tmc organic solution higher mpd contact time generally decreased the total performance which could be attributed to the lack of free carboxylic groups on the membrane surface 26 mpd contact time of 25 s gave the best results as deduced from fig 1 this time could be critical to have well distributed and absorbed mpd molecules over the support layer which gave the best cross linking when reacted with the tmc later 3 1 2 tmc exposing time tmc is the second reactant in the ip reaction to produce the thin film composite membrane after mpd covered the support sheet surface as explained above tmc solution was poured onto it for different reaction times 5 10 15 20 and 25 s at room temperature tmc s acyl chloride group reacted with mpd s amine group and generated the thin film composite membrane 27 fig 2 a d demonstrate tmc contact time effects on both salt rejection and water flux at a constant mpd exposure time from all figures it is clear that a reaction time of 5 s gave the best results at all mpd contact times generally the water flux decreased by increasing reaction time while the salt rejection increased this might be because of the increase in membrane thickness and cross linking it can be noted that the salt rejection was almost maintained the same at all reaction times although longer time gave slightly higher results which can be attributed to the increase of the top dense layer thickness 28 here the flux dropped by increasing the reaction time because of the dense layer growth another explanation could be the physiochemical properties of the reaction mpd tmc reaction is rapid so the formed polyamide layer decreased mpd transfer toward the tmc isooctane solution for this reason no large difference was observed in salt rejection by increasing the reaction time conversely at short reaction times some tmc molecules did not react which allowed the acyl chloride group to hydrolyze and form the cooh group the carboxylic group is hydrophilic which could increase the membrane hydrophilicity and the water flux afterwards 27 3 2 psu sheets casting methods different phase inversion methods were tested for psu support layer synthesis as mentioned before the support layer solution was made by dissolving polysulfone in dmf fig 3 shows three methods of immersing the glass plate that held 130 μm thick casting solution on its top into a water bath the method illustrated in fig 3a was the free drop method where the glass plate was dropped into the water one time this method is not recommended because of the holes that generated inside the sheet in addition to low membrane performance results for the sheet that has no holes this is explained by the water covering the plate roughly and producing these holes the membrane performance results made on these layers were not reported fig 3b shows the second method in which the glass plate was immersed horizontally in the water bath the water this time covered the plate more gently and uniformly this type of submerging is commonly used by researchers the membranes in this paper were synthesized on support layers made by this form of immersion the last method is the vertical method as shown in fig 3c which seemed to work better than others this method produced very flat uniform and homogeneous sheets the morphology by the naked eye was very good and no holes existed in the sheets fig 4 illustrates sem images and performance comparison between the horizontal and vertical immersing methods where a and c are for the horizontal submerging b and d for the vertical one and e and f display the results of salt rejection and water flux respectively by comparing a with b it is clear that the vertical submerging produced high uniformly sheets with no wide pores or change in morphology thickness sheets attained from the horizontal submerging showed less uniformity comparing with the vertical method also different size pores were observed on top of the sheets this difference in morphology may be attributed to the way that water covered the casting solution in which in the vertical way water surrounded psu sheets neatly horizontal immersion has different challenges first the way of submerging the sheet would differ depending on experience of the operator second the submerging angle affected how gently the water covers the casted solution third water level in the bath might also influence how the water becomes in contact finally dipping speed casting speed room temperature and humidity etc may also affect the output fig 4c and d shows the surface pores it appeared that vertical submerging leaded to generate well organized and distributed pores however horizontal dipping produced different sized pores including large ones around 100 nm this influenced tmc s water flux and salt rejection as will be explained later thereby we like to state that the vertical submerging is easier to apply and control and produced higher performance tfc fig 4e and f shows salt rejection and water flux comparisons respectively for sheets made by the horizontal and vertical methods fig 4e shows the salt rejection comparison where the immersion method affected it slightly while fig 4f clearly shows the effect of phase inversion methods on membrane water permeability the comparison was between membranes made by 25 s mpd contact time and different tmc exposure times 5 10 and 15 s on 130 μm thick support sheets and drying temperature of 80 c by immersing the plate horizontally the salt rejection was slightly higher than the membranes on vertically submerged supports but the water flux was lower the vertically submerged sheets were smooth and well shaped which either allowed the membrane to form properly or the sheet porosity was higher than the horizontally immersed sheets as a result higher water flux was achieved another explanation attributes this behavior to the pores size here for the horizontally immersed sheets the pores were larger which allowed mpd solution to diffuse deeper into the support layer and blocked the pores ends a thicker polyamide layer is generated hence as a result salt rejection increased and water flux decreased when compared with the vertical immersed sheets in which pores were smaller 29 3 3 effect of psu layer thickness 15 psu in dmf solution was casted in four different thicknesses by a casting knife 50 80 130 and 150 μm the preparation conditions of the membranes were 25 s mpd contact time 15 s tmc reaction time horizontal immersing for the support layers and 80 c curing temperature increasing the support layer thickness resulted in an increased salt rejection but decreased water flux this could be because of the hydrophobic nature of the psu whenever the sheet thickness increased the water and salt faced higher resistance fig 5 shows support layer thickness effects on the membrane performance 3 4 effect of drying temperature the last aim in this work was to study the effect of increasing the drying temperature after the membranes were prepared they were heated to 80 c to evaporate any remaining isooctane in this section the drying temperature was raised to 110 c and the results were compared to the original samples fig 6 a and b shows the effect of raising the temperature on salt rejection and water flux respectively by increasing the curing temperature both salt rejection and water flux increased the samples were made by exposure to mpd for 25 s and tmc for 5 10 and 15 s on 130 μm thick horizontally immersed support sheets from fig 6a it is clear that by increasing the curing temperature nacl rejection increased this is due to the fast evaporation of the remaining organic solution which might give better cross linking for the polyamide layer in terms of flux the best results were obtained when the reaction time was 5 s when the reaction time was longer the water flux dropped as shown in fig 6b again this could be because when the reaction time was short some of the tmc reacted and the rest left which hydrolyzed and increased the hydrophilicity also the difference in water flux between the two temperatures dropped as the reaction time increased this could be attributed to the deformation of the top dense layer of the membrane as it increased by increasing the reaction time 3 5 why this work is important tfc membranes dominate desalination research and markets since they have been discovered the same manufacturing basics are used with some modifications in this work by manipulating some physical conditions during preparation a big improvement in performance was achieved without the incorporation of other additives complex preparation methods and or post treatment thereby at the optimum conditions of synthesis the produced membranes were highly practical table 1 shows our best result compared with other control samples before they had any additives added or post treatment by applying this paper s recommendations previous and future works could obtain improved results using the same procedures and additives already used 4 conclusions in this work the synthesis conditions of reverse osmosis membranes were investigated mpd and tmc exposure times were studied and the best results were found to be at 25 s and 5 s for mpd and tmc contacting times respectively the best phase inversion method was the vertical immersion method support layer thickness affected membrane performance as well by exploring the trade off relationship between salt rejection and water flux it was found that a thickness of 80 130 μm could be the best choice finally increasing curing temperature positively affected the performance of membranes produced at short reaction times but the effect was diminished by increasing the reaction times the above report describes a technical guide for researchers and workers who can gain higher yield from membranes that they manufacture due to the lack in the literature on the impact of the support layer on tfc membrane performance this work was designed to narrow partially that gap however a wide area is open to study other influencing factors relevant to support layer formation and tfc membrane fabrication acknowledgment we gratefully acknowledge the higher committee for education development in iraq hced

various process industries such as refineries metallurgical textile leather and steel processing plants the separation of oily wastewater particularly oil water emulsion is a serious problem membrane technology has been considered a prominence technology amongst worldwide for oily wastewater treatment due to high separation efficiency small footprint simple process and low operational cost among all polymers pvdf is a promising candidate to prepare polymeric membrane for oily wastewater separation due to its good chemical property superior thermal stability and excellent mechanical strength 1 2 however hydrophobic nature and low surface energy of pvdf membranes makes it susceptible to fouled by natural organic matter nom protein and oily wastewater results sharp decline in flux and permeability 3 fouling can be overcome by hydrophilic modification of pvdf membranes nowadays preparation of antifouling membrane is an intense research area in separation and purification technology 4 hydrophilic modification of the membranes can be achieved by surface coating surface grafting and blending of additives surface coating with hydrophilic layer provides the temporary hydrophilicity due to instability and could be washed out during filtration and cleaning process because of weak physical interaction between membrane surface and coated layer while surface grafting is effective method to modify the membrane with grafted chains through covalent bonding interaction onto the membrane surface it can be achieved by ultraviolet irradiation electron beam surface induced grafting

one additional step is required to modify the membranes and its applications are limited to modify structure of membrane zhao et al synthesized pvdf membrane by blending of hyperbranched polyglycerol hpg they found that addition of hpg as modifier increases the porosity surface pore size hydrophilicity and pwf and state that hpg act as pore forming agent and also contribute to raise the hydrophilicity of membrane 19 song et al prepared pvdf membrane by blending of tio2 nps and peg in the dope solution they found that addition of peg tio2 increases the ha removal and simultaneously reduces the flux due to small size of pores 20 li et al fabricated styrene alt maleic anhydride sma pvdf blend membrane and immersed in tio2 nps solution for seven days and investigated that the tio2 self assembly membranes indicates the improved antifouling property and permeability as compare to sma pvdf blend membrane 21 moslehyani et al modified pvdf membrane by blending multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt they had observed more than 99 rejection of tio2 pollutant for oxidized mwcnt nanocomposite membranes 22 although nps are excellent hydrophilic additives however agglomeration is one of the major drawbacks in the blending method due to small size and high surface energy of nps agglomeration induces unstable conditions to casting solution which results non uniform membrane due to uneven distribution of nps this behaviour affects the structure and performance of membrane and also reduces the fouling resistant ability of hydrophilic nps additives 23 uniform dispersion of nps can be achieved by sonication or strong mechanical stirring however it is restricted to high concentration of nps various methods such as surface modification of nps formation of nps by sol gel process and addition of third component to enhance the interaction between nps had been used by various researchers to minimize the agglomeration 13 24 recently functionalised nps have become ideal candidates to incorporate into polymeric material for hydrophilic modification of membrane madaeni et al synthesized pvdf membrane with functionalized tio2 nps by acrylic acid monomer and they observed better fouling resistance of modified membranes 25 shen et al prepared antifouling hybrid pvdf membrane with poly n acryloylmorpholine grafted zro2 zro2 g pacmo nps and they observed that modified membranes showed lower adsorption of protein than unmodified pvdf membrane 26 munirasu et al established a new method for fabrication of asymmetric organic inorganic nanoporous polymeric membrane by functionalisation of sio2 nps with pmma they proposed that the new sio2 g pmma hybrid asymmetric nanoporous structure and synthesis process can be applicable in membrane fabrication for specific separation purpose 27 park et al modified the sio2 nps grafted with poly oxyethylene methacrylate poem and ionic poly styrene sulfonic acid pssa they discussed that the modified nps showed better dispersion in alcohol than unmodified nps 28 in reviewing the previous work it is clear that several researchers reported the modification of membrane with unmodified and modified nps but to the best of our knowledge hydrophilic modification of pvdf membrane with functionalized sio2 nps by pegma chains is still lacking therefore in this work pegma was successfully grafted onto sio2 nps and then novel hydrophilic pvdf membranes hybrid were synthesized by direct blending of sio2 g pegma nps in the casting solution via phase inversion method the synthesized membranes were characterized by ftir

sio2 g pegma nps were synthesized via radical polymerization of sio2 nps and pegma in methanol using aibn as initiator the modification steps of sio2 nps are shown in fig 1 the reaction was carried out in two steps first step was tms ba coupling onto sio2 nps and second step was pegma grafting onto sio2 tms ba coupled nps for first step 1 5 g dried sio2 nps were immersed in a mixture of 200 ml of methanol and pure water 1 1 v v and sonicated for 30 min to achieve the uniform dispersion of nps the suspension was purged with nitrogen gas in three neck round bottom flask fitted with reflux condenser which was placed in oil bath at 40 c and stirred for 30 min afterwards 5 ml of tms ba was added into the suspension and reaction was conducted for 5 h after completion of reaction nps were cooled to room temperature separated by the use of centrifuge and washed with methanol to remove residual of tms ba the obtained product was dried at 60 c for 24 h and labelled as sio2 tms ba for second step sio2 tms ba nps were dispersed in methanol and sonicated for 30 min to make homogeneous suspension and then pegma and aibn were added into the suspension the weight ratio of sio2 tms ba and pegma was 1 5 aibn was added to the suspension at 0 2 of the total weight ratio of sio2 tms ba and pegma the mixture was purged with nitrogen gas into three neck round bottom flask fitted with reflux condenser then the reaction was allowed to react for 6 h at 60 c at last the obtained product was washed with methanol centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min and dried at 60 c for 24 h the resultant product was labelled as sio2 g pegma nps modified nps were characterized by ftir analysis and sedimentation test ftir characterization was conducted to verify the functional groups present in modified sio2 g pegma nps using ftir spectrometer supplied by perkin elmer inc germany visual comparison of bare and modified silica nps was performed by sedimentation test to analyse anti accumulation property 0 25 gm of sio2 and sio2 g pegma nps were placed into 15 ml of dmac and ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min the sedimentation of bare and modified nps was observed by digital camera after standing for 12 h 2 3 membrane preparation initially pvdf membrane with peg 6000 and without sio2 g pegma nps was optimized in terms of thickness flux smoothness and homogeneity the optimum percentage of pvdf in casting solution was observed to be 15 wt flat sheet pvdf membranes were prepared using 5 wt of peg 6000 various wt of sio2 g pegma nps and dmac as solvent via phase inversion method the compositions of casting solution used for fabrication of pvdf membranes are shown in table 1 the casting solution was magnetically stirred at room temperature for 24 h to make homogeneous solution and degassed for 6 h to eliminate air bubbles then the casting solution was spread on a glass plate with the help of casting knife with a uniform gap of 300 μm under ambient conditions immediately the cast film together with glass plate was dipped in coagulation bath containing deionised water as nonsolvent at room temperature where solidification of membrane take place by exchange of dmac with deionised water after 10 min of solidification membranes were transferred into fresh deionised water for 24 h in order to leach out the residual of dmac solvent afterwards membranes were air dried at room temperature and stored in air tight packets 2 4 membrane characterization to confirm the functional groups present in surface grafting of sio2 nps with pegma and functional changes in pvdf membranes due to blending of sio2 g pegma nps in the casting solution were observed by ftir spectra recorded by ftir atr spectrometer sem leo 1430vp uk and fesem zeiss lsm 510 meta were used to characterize the morphology and sub layer structure of prepared membranes the membranes were cut into small pieces around 1 cm2 and sputter coated with thin film of gold 2 5 liquid liquid displacement porosimetry study lldp analysis was conducted to determine the pore density pore size pore size distribution and mean pore size this analysis was carried out under the assumptions that the all pores of membrane are cylindrical in shape parallel to each other not interconnected and have length equal to skin layer thickness a mixture of water isobutanol methanol 25 15 7 v v was used with surface tension between water rich and alcohol rich phase of 0 35 mn m and dynamic viscosity of alcohol rich phase of 3 4 mns m2 the mixture was prepared from required amount of alcohols and deionised water in a separating funnel and shaken vigorously and then stands for 4 h water and alcohol rich phases were used as wetting liquid for membrane and as displacing liquid respectively 29 it was also assumed that the contact angle between membrane and liquid liquid interface is zero 30 the correlation data of radius of pores r was obtained from cantor s equation with various applied pressure 1 r 2 σ p where p is the transmembrane pressure and σ is the surface tension between the two liquids for the determination of the pore numbers per unit membrane surface area n i k the following equation was used 2 n i k d η 2 π σ 4 p 3 i k j i k where n i k represent the pore numbers per unit membrane surface area having radii between r i and r k respectively d is the pore length which is assumed equivalent to membrane skin layer thickness and ɳ is the dynamic viscosity of alcohol rich phase the total number of pores n t per unit area of the membrane was obtained by using the equation as follow 3 n t n i k hence the mean pore radius r m was determined by the formula as follow 4 r m n i k r i k n i k 2 6 membrane porosity water uptake and hydrophilicity membrane porosity is one the significant parameter which defines the membrane performance it can be explained as volume of pores to the total volume of membrane to understand the porous nature of membrane initially small piece of about 4 cm2 of membranes were soaked in distilled water and weighed as soon as the superficial water was cleaned with filter paper afterwards wet membranes were dried overnight to a constant weight the porosity was determined by gravimetric method which was calculated by the following equation 5 ε w w w d ρ w a l 100 where w w and w d are the wet membrane and dry membrane weight gm respectively ε is the membrane porosity ais the membrane surface area cm2 l is the thickness of membrane cm and ρ w is the density of water gm cm3 water uptake u w is closely associated with porosity and expressed the water retaining capacity of the membranes water uptake was evaluated from the values of w w and w d used in porosity measurement which can be defined by the following equation 6 u w w w w d w d 100 in these analyses average values of three data were reported for each membrane to minimize the experimental error hydrophilic behaviour of membrane was analyzed by examining the surface hydrophilicity from water ca made by deionised water drop on the membrane surface ca was evaluated at three different positions for all fabricated membranes from an image of water drop on the surface of membrane using goniometer 29 2 7 pure water permeation performance batch filtration cell made of stainless steel and capacity of 350 ml was used to conduct the pure water permeation experiments flat circular membrane of 5 10 2 m diameter with effective area inside the footprint of the o ring of 19 625 10 4 m2 was installed on a base porous support the feed inside the filtration cell was pressurized at the top using inert gas nitrogen and permeate was collected from the bottom the schematic of batch filtration cell used in this study is provided in supporting information fig s 1 initially synthesized membranes were pre compacted for 2 h at 250 kpa using deionised water and throughout the study operating pressure were maintained below 250 kpa these pre compacted membranes were used in subsequent ultrafiltration experiments at 200 kpa the pwf of pre pressurized membranes was measured at every 15 min interval upto the flow stabilization of feed and calculated by eq 7 7 j p w v a δ t where j p w is the pwf l m2 h v is the volume of permeating liquid l at transmembrane pressure a is the effective surface area m2 of membrane δt is the permeation time h after pwf measurement the compaction factor c f for each membrane was calculated by eq 8 8 c f j p w i j p w s s where j p w i and j p w s s are the pure water flux at initial and steady state respectively hydraulic permeability p m l m2 h kpa of membranes was determined from the slope between j p w and applied pressure δp to the filtration cell using the following equation 9 p m j p w δ p 2 8 ultrafiltration experiment using ha bsa and oil in water emulsion o w emulsion was prepared using indian crude oil density 911 2 kg m3 collected from ongc india without any treatment crude oil was used as oil phase in deionised water and concentration in water was kept at the desired value mixture of crude oil and water was sonicated by probe sonicator model vcx 500 ultrasonic processor 500 w 20 khz for 6 8 h at 30 c to prepare the o w emulsion the resultant solution was labelled as o w emulsion and characterized in term of average oil droplet size ph turbidity concentration and density the size of oil droplets was 311 5 nm with a volume average which was determined using particle size analyzer malvern mastersize 2000 model mal1083109 the ph and turbidity of the o w emulsion feed were determined using a digital ph meter model 5010t hach and portable nephlometer turbidity meter model 2100q hach respectively and the values are 7 03 and 259 ntu respectively the concentration of oil in o w emulsion was determined using ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer model dr 6000 hach by observing its maximum absorbance value it is well known that the crude oil is a complex mixture of many different hydrocarbon compounds and its composition varies from place to place accordingly the desired wavelength for the determination of maximum absorbance also varies in this study the maximum absorbance was found at 202 nm for different concentrations of o w emulsion the density of o w emulsion feed was determined using a pyknometer the pyknometer of known volume was filled with o w emulsion and mass of o w emulsion was measured at room temperature the density was calculated from the data of volume and mass of o w emulsion each reading for density measurement was taken three times and the average data was then recorded the density of o w emulsion feed was 954 45 kg m3 ultrafiltration experiments were carried out in batch filtration cell using ha bsa and o w emulsion as feed to evaluate the separation performance and membrane fouling at room temperature pre compacted membranes were used in all ultrafiltration studies initially pwf j p w 1 was measured for 60 min time period with a regular interval at 200 kpa afterward filtration cell was filled with feed and feed flux j f was measured for next 60 min rejection percentage of ha bsa and o w emulsion was measured using uv vis spectroscopy at wavelength of 254 nm 280 nm and 202 nm respectively by eq 10 10 r 1 c p c f 100 where c f and c p are the concentrations of feed and permeate mg l respectively r is the rejection percentage after 120 min of ultrafiltration membrane was cleaned with deionised water again pwf j p w 2 of cleaned membrane was measured for next 60 min in addition the flux recovery ratio flux rr and flux decline f l u x d were determined using the value of pwf at steady state before and after cleaning of membrane using the following equations 11 f l u x r r j p w 2 j p w 1 12 f l u x d 1 j p w 2 j p w 1 the selection parameter s p l m2 h was also determined to compare the performance of different membranes using the following expression 13 s p j p w 2 r f l u x d in order to explain the fouling behaviour during ultrafiltration study some ratios such as irreversible fouling f ir reversible fouling f r and total fouling f t were determined from the following equations 14 f i r j p w 1 j p w 2 j p w 1 15 f r j p w 2 j f j p w 1 16 f t j p w 1 j f j p w 1 during the permeation experiments the reason behind reversible fouling is reversible adsorption of ha bsa oil droplets on the surface of membrane and which can be moved out by simple hydraulic cleaning while in irreversible fouling the irreversible adsorption of ha bsa oil droplets takes place and it is difficult to clear by simple hydraulic cleaning 2 9 protein adsorption experiments in order to understand the antifouling property of the membranes with respect to plain membrane protein adsorption experiment was conducted using bsa solution of 1000 mg l concentration the studied membranes of square shape of 4 cm2 were immersed in 15 ml of bsa solution for 24 h under incubation at 25 c to achieve adsorption equilibrium the adsorbed mass concentration mg cm2 of bsa protein on the membrane surface was found by calculating the difference between the concentration of bsa solution before and after adsorption using eq 17 the concentration of bsa solution was determined from the absorbance intensity at 280 nm recorded on a uv vis spectrophotometer values of bsa adsorbed were averaged from three different samples of the same prepared membrane to minimize the error of the adsorbed concentration measurements 17 c a d c b c a a where c b and c a are the concentrations of bsa before and after adsorption mg l respectively c ad is the mass of bsa adsorbed per unit surface area of membrane mg cm2 a is surface area of membrane cm2 3 results and discussions 3 1 sedimentation test for bare sio2 and sio2 g pegma nps since dmac was used as solvent for preparation of pvdf membranes it was selected for visual comparison between bare sio2 and sio2 g pegma nps as shown in fig 2 sedimentation experiments indicate that the bare sio2 nps rapidly settled down in 15 min whereas the sio2 g pegma nps are still in suspension after 12 h this behaviour is remarkable by contrast with sedimentation experiment that pegma grafting onto sio2 nps can significantly improve the dispersion ability of sio2 in the organic phase 3 2 ftir atr spectroscopy analysis to investigate the success of grafting of pegma onto sio2 nps was studied by ftir spectra fig 3 shows the ftir spectra of bare sio2 sio2 tms ba and sio2 g pegma nps a very intense peak at around 1075 cm 1 is present due to asymmetric stretching vibration of siosi 31 which is overlapped by absorption band of coc group present in pegma chain grafted onto sio2 nps moreover absorption bands in the spectra of nps at around 810 cm 1 and 460 cm 1 are characteristics of the asymmetric stretching vibration and bending vibration of siosi 32 in comparison the spectra of sio2 tms ba and sio2 g pegma nps exhibits some new peaks at 867 cm 1 and 845 cm 1 correspond to sioh bond deformations after sio2 nps modification which are not found in the spectrum of sio2 nps the sio2 g pegma nps spectrum shows ch stretching of the ch3 and ch2 groups present in pegma at 2922 cm 1 and 2849 cm 1 33 the chemical structure of the plain and modified pvdf membranes was examined by ftir atr spectroscopy ftir atr spectra of all samples are shown in fig 4 a strong absorbance at 1182 cm 1 is shown for the pvdf membrane due to the stretching vibration of the cf bond and the typical frequencies of cf2 groups at 1402 1070 880 and 840 cm 1 could clearly be identified 17 β phase vibration at 1278 cm 1 and α phase vibration at 761 cm 1 of pvdf indicating that the chemical structure of pvdf would not damage by addition of sio2 g pegma nps 12 a broad absorption peak at 3600 3200 cm 1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of functional oh groups on the surface of pvdf membranes 34 ch stretching peaks at 2922 cm 1 and 2852 cm 1 confirms the presence of pegma in modified membranes and intensity of these peaks increased with increase in wt of sio2 g pegma nps moreover absorption bands in the spectra of modified pvdf membranes at around 978 cm 1 and 799 cm 1 are the characteristics of the asymmetric stretching of sioh and symmetric stretching of siosi groups respectively 34 3 3 morphological study in order to analyse the effect of various wt of sio2 g pegma nps on the microstructure of the fabricated membranes sem micrographs of both top surface as well as cross section of plain and modified membranes were observed the sem images showed that the blending of sio2 g pegma nps have an influence on membrane formation mechanism and final structure of the membranes fig 5 shows the top surface and cross section images of plain and modified membranes from fig 5 it may be observed that as the wt of sio2 g pegma nps increased from 0 to 0 5 the pore density of membranes was increased but beyond that it was decreased it may also be noticed that membrane m3 has the highest pore density compared to all other membranes so it is clear that when sio2 g pegma nps was added in small quantity upto 0 5 wt they acts as a pore forming agent however the pore density were suppressed with continuous increase of nps wt and results dense membrane structure m4 and m5 membranes this is also supported by the porosity results table 2 discussed in subsequent section this behaviour could be interpreted by the fact that the viscosity of casting solution increases drastically with high nps concentration which might generate slow exchange rate of solvent and nonsolvent and lead to delayed demixing as a result dense structure of membrane was formed similar result was also observed by yin et al 35 they had used sio2 g pdmaema co pdmaps nps as additive in casting solution for preparation of pes membrane and highest porosity was found at 0 15 wt and dense structure was observed at 0 45 wt of nps when bare sio2 nps are used as additive the agglomeration of sio2 nps appears on the surface of membrane and with increase in wt of sio2 nps more agglomeration appears on the membrane surface 36 while in the present work fig 6 shows that the sio2 g pegma nps were well dispersed in the polymer due to high dispersion ability of sio2 g pegma nps in dmac solvent which is already discussed in section 3 1 in this study the existence as well as uniform dispersion of sio2 g pegma nps on the membrane surface was also analyzed by energy dispersive spectroscopy eds from the eds result fig 6c confirms the presence and dispersibility of sio2 g pegma nps in modified m3 membrane eds top surface images of m1 and m2 are provided in supporting material fig s 2 it is clear that the pegma surface grafting minimizes the agglomeration of sio2 nps during casting solution preparation and make uniform membranes with even distribution of modified nps the schematic illustration of immobilization of bare sio2 nps and sio2 g pegma on the membrane surface is shown in fig 6a and b as depicted in fig 5 there were no apparent differences in the cross section images of the plain and modified membranes except m5 all fabricated membranes show the typical asymmetric cross sectional structure consisting of a skin layer as a selective barrier and sponge like sub structure membrane m5 had relatively denser cross section structure compare to other membranes this is due to the formation of a cross linking structure of sio2 g pegma nps with polymeric pvdf chains leads the growth of the sponge like structure similar cross section structure of pvdf membrane was also observed by sinha and purkait 37 3 4 liquid liquid displacement porosimetry observation lldp study was conducted to determine pore size pore number total pore numbers per unit area of the membrane and mean pore size in this study minimum pressure required to start the flux through the membrane m1 m2 and m3 was 25 kpa on the other hand for m4 and m5 this value was 50 kpa and 75 kpa respectively thereafter penetrating liquid starts to substitute the wetting liquid present in biggest pores further smaller pores begin to open with increase in pressure and once all the pores are opened by substituting the wetting liquid the flux increases slightly the lldp flux plot for all membranes synthesized with various wt of sio2 g pegma nps is shown in fig 7 a the nature of lldp flux plot is almost same for membranes m1 m2 m3 and m4 while m5 had much lower lldp flux than other membranes fig 7a it was seen that the lldp flux increase with increase in wt of sio2 g pegma nps upto 0 5 and then decrease thereafter from fig 7a it may also be observed at beginning for membrane m1 m2 m3 and m4 flux increases at slow speed with increase in pressure however the flux increases rapidly from 200 kpa to 350 kpa and after that flux increasingly slowed down but throughout the study lldp flux for membrane m5 increases slowly with pressure the left part of fig 7a illustrate that the pore density is highest for pore size between 2 to 4 nm and decrease thereafter while it is almost negligible for pores having size greater than 6 nm fig 7b shows the percent distribution of pore size the trend is nearly same for all the membranes it was observed that the pore number percentage starts to increase as size of pores decreased from 6 nm to 2 2 nm opposite to this trend pore number percentage decrease when pore size decreases from 2 2 nm the graph between cumulative pore number percentage and pore size is shown in fig 7b inset for all membranes it may be seen that more than 95 pores lies in the range of 0 4 nm which clearly indicates that prepared membranes in this work are appropriate for ultrafiltration process table 2 reports the results obtained from the lldp study it can be seen that total number of pores per unit membrane area increases with increase in sio2 g pegma nps content attained maximum at 0 5 wt of sio2 g pegma nps content and then decreases when sio2 g pegma nps was further added the total number of pores per unit surface area of membrane for m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 are 29 1015 30 1015 34 1015 31 2 1015 and 7 3 1015 respectively these results concluded that the addition of sio2 g pegma nps up to 0 5 wt in casting solution for synthesis of pvdf membrane enhances the pore forming process which is already described in section 3 3 3 5 effect of wt of sio2 g pegma nps on porosity water uptake hydrophilicity and pure water permeation the porosity and water uptake of each membrane were quantitatively calculated and listed in table 2 it shows that the porosity and water uptake of membranes increased at first with the addition of a small quantity of sio2 g pegma nps then they achieved upper limit when the sio2 g pegma nps concentration was 0 5 wt however decreased with further addition of sio2 g pegma nps modified membrane showed increase in porosity and water uptake from 20 and 40 for plain membrane to 40 and 88 9 with 0 5 wt of sio2 g pegma nps respectively but porosity and water uptake for m5 are 7 and 17 1 respectively therefore it is clear that the porosity and water uptake values were highest for membrane m3 and lowest for membrane m5 the increasing trend of porosity and water uptake confirms the presence of increasing number of pores and pore size in the membrane with sio2 g pegma nps up to 0 5 wt this phenomenon was also observed by other researchers 35 39 and may be justified by the following reasons 1 addition of hydrophilic nps increases the thermodynamic instability of the casting solution resulting in the formation of large surface pore size and high porosity 40 2 during membrane synthesis process polymer precipitated readily and hydrophilic nps additive migrated impulsively on the membrane surface to decrease interfacial energy simultaneously a part of hydrophilic nps can leach out from the membrane and act as a pore forming agent which results to the membrane having high porous nature and large pore size 41 3 viscosity of the casting solution increases with nps concentration which results delayed demixing of solvent and nonsolvent as well as inhibited the formation of large pore size 5 the hydrophilicity of membrane is an important parameter which influences the antifouling property of the membrane in this work water contact angle was measured to evaluate the hydrophilic modification of membrane surface with sio2 g pegma nps as shown in fig 8 the plain pvdf membrane m1 has the highest water ca of 68 7 showing poor hydrophilicity and ca decreased as the incorporation of the sio2 g pegma nps increased thus the membrane m5 has lower ca of 50 7 in comparison with m1 which shows the higher hydrophilicity of m5 membrane these results showing that sio2 g pegma nps were capable of significantly improving the membrane surface hydrophilicity ca in current work was comparatively lower than the ca obtained by the previous studies 42 45 where pvdf membranes were modified by sio2 nps incorporation of sio2 g pegma nps into casting solution can influence the pwf in mainly two ways firstly it enhances the hydrophilicity of the pvdf membrane secondly it influences the permeation performance of the membrane by altering the membrane morphology 14 pvdf membranes that have been prepared with peg6000 as pore constructor and dmac as solvent are tested to observe the effect of different concentration of sio2 g pegma nps on their permeation behaviour the permeation properties of the membranes were determined in terms of compaction study which includes pwf and compaction factor pwf at different transmembrane pressure tmp and hydraulic permeability compaction is a densification of the membrane structure at tmp which leads to mechanical distortion of membrane structure resulting decrease in hydraulic permeability it is a common phenomenon in membrane application in this study all membranes were pressurized at a constant pressure of 250 kpa for 2 h until a steady state flux was reached the pwf was determined from the value of experimental permeate volume measured at every 15 min interval fig 9 a shows the plot of the pwf versus time during compaction of all membranes for m1 m2 m3 and m4 membranes it was observed that gradual decrease in flux at initial duration of compaction time and pwf reached a steady state value after around 60 min of compaction this was due to the fact that the all membranes had asymmetric structure high pressure compaction causes compression of the porous support layer leading to a thickening of the skin layer resulting decrease in pore size as well as in flux 46 however no flux was observed for m5 membrane during compaction study so only four membranes m1 m2 m3 and m4 have been considered for the pure water permeation study the steady state fluxes were 10 12 13 and 16 of the initial flux for m1 m2 m3 and m4 respectively interestingly as depicted in fig 9a initially the membrane m4 had slightly lower flux than the m1 but after 15 min duration of compaction it showed higher flux this may be due to presence of large macrovoids in subsurface structure of m1 compare to m4 and which have high tendency to compact resulting reduction in flux fig 9a also clearly shows that there is an increase in steady state pwf with sio2 g pegma nps up to 0 5 wt and decreases thereafter up to 0 75 wt hence the increasing trend of pwf was m1 m4 m2 m3 which was same in case of porosity the value of steady state pwf for m1 m2 m3 and m4 was 39 2 70 9 114 5 and 58 8 l m2h respectively the result of pwf agrees to the findings of the porosity and water uptake analysis table 2 compaction factor cf for all the membranes has been reported in table 2 from the cf data it was observed that the cf decreases from 9 92 to 6 11 with increase in wt of sio2 g pegma nps this behaviour could be interpreted as addition of nps increases the viscosity of the casting solution which results delayed demixing of solvent and non solvent as well as suppresses the macrovoids in the membrane sublayer 35 to see the effect of addition of sio2 g pegma nps on pure water permeation the pwf was calculated at various tmp from 0 to 200 kpa with a difference of 25 kpa fig 9b shows that the increasing trend of pwf with pressure was almost linear for all membranes it was found that at a pressure of 25 kpa the pwf for m1 and m4 was nearly equal but pwf for m4 was higher compared to the m1 at high pressure of 200 kpa in this work the applied pressure was 200 kpa in all ultrafiltration experiment and at this pressure membrane m3 had highest pwf for all membranes the order of pwf at 200 kpa was similar as discussed in compaction study and as the results of porosity hydraulic permeability p m defines the ability of porous membrane to pass fluids through it it was determined from the slope of the plot between flux and applied pressure eq 11 and the values are reported in table 2 it may be observed from table 2 that p m increases with increase of wt of sio2 g pegma nps up to 0 5 wt and beyond that it starts to decrease the permeability value of m3 is almost triple than that of m1 this marginal variation in permeability is also dictated by the sem images of top surfaces fig 5 these results clearly indicate that addition of sio2 g pegma nps in different quantities influences the porosity on the membrane surface findings from above studies noticeably shows that addition of sio2 g pegma nps up to 0 5 wt enhance the pore forming behaviour in pvdf membrane on the contrary at high nps concentration 0 75 wt and 1 wt membranes with less pore density were obtained which was associated to the rheological hindrance due to increased viscosity of casting solution 35 these findings are in agreement with the morphological characterization of the membranes through fesem and lldp studies 3 6 ultrafiltration and fouling studies the ultrafiltration operation and antifouling ability of plain and modified membranes were analyses by filtering 100 ppm ha 1000 ppm bsa and 100 ppm o w emulsion solution at fixed tmp of 200 kpa figs 10 12 show the time dependent flux fouling study and flux recovery ratio of ha bsa and o w emulsion ultrafiltration studies respectively the ultrafiltration experiments were conducted for 3 h time period initially j p w 1 was measure from 0 to 60 min afterwards j f was measured from 60 to 120 min and after simple cleaning of membrane with pure water further j p w 2 was measured from 120 to 180 min during initial time of pure water permeation a slight decline in pwf was observed and after 30 min it was almost remains constant for all membranes in ha bsa and o w emulsion ultrafiltration experiments in all ultrafiltration experiments modified membranes had higher flux than plain membrane m1 and j p w 2 were lower than the initial j p w 1 0 60 min but higher than the j f fig 10a shows a less flux loss in ha permeation during ha ultrafiltration process ha molecules create a porous and mesh gel layer by cross linking with each other these cross linked ha molecules can be easily retained by the membrane on the surface in addition porous and mesh gel layer of ha molecules would result in less flux loss 37 however bsa permeation shows higher flux loss than ha permeation due to surface assimilation or deposition of bsa molecules on the membrane surface or penetration of bsa molecules into the pores fig 11a the o w emulsion flux decreased at the first 15 min of ultrafiltration due to adsorption of oil droplets and blocked the pores after 15 min it was stable due to adsorption and deposition of oil droplets on the membrane surfaces attained stability to analyse the membrane fouling quantitatively during ha bsa and o w emulsion ultrafiltration f ir f r and f t ratios were evaluated and have been reported in supporting information table s 1 as given in figs figure 1010b figure 1111b and figure 1212b irreversible fouling decreased at first and then attained to a minimum when the percentage of sio2 g pegma nps was 0 5 wt and increased on further addition of sio2 g pegma nps lower value of f ir signifies that the lower quantity of irreversible adsorption or deposition of foulants on the membrane surface or inside the pores and vice versa while reversible fouling increased with the content of sio2 g pegma nps upto 0 5 wt and decreased thereafter the increase in f r confirms that the irreversible fouling is changed into reversible fouling of membrane in the ultrafiltration in another word the irreversible fouling on the membrane surface is inhibited due to the assimilation of sio2 g pegma nps these results are attributed to the fact that the formed hydration layer on the membrane surface can reduce the interaction between membrane surface and foulants because of addition of hydrophilic modifiers leading to the prevention of irreversible foulants adhesion the trend of f t was similar with f ir as have been discussed above it was concluded that the plain membrane has highest value of f t and f ir in ultrafiltration experiments with all type of feeds however m3 membrane has lowest value of f t andf ir results less prone to adsorption or deposition of irreversible foulants thus addition of sio2 g pegma nps in the casting solution resisted the adsorption or deposition of foulants inside the pores or on the surface of membrane by increasing the hydrophilicity figs 10 b 11 b and 12 b shows the flux rr of plain and modified membranes as flux rr is directly linked to the irreversible fouling reduction in f ir causes increase in flux rr for the modified membranes from figs 10 b 11 b and 12 b it was observed that the flux rr was increased from 0 86 0 63 and 0 53 for plain membrane to 0 95 0 95 and 0 84 for membrane m3 in ha bsa and o w emulsion ultrafiltration process respectively in this work the value of flux rr was comparatively higher than the results of previous studies in case of bsa 42 44 and o w emulsion ultrafiltration 45 through pvdf membrane the value of flux rr in o w emulsion ultrafiltration was comparatively less than that in ha and bsa ultrafiltration this may be due to the fact that ha and bsa molecules can be easily moved out by simple hydraulic cleaning and achieve high flux rr while after simple hydraulic cleaning oil droplets remains present on the membrane surface or inside the pores due to insolubility of o w emulsion in water and it is difficult to clean the membranes so to remove such type of foulants from membranes chemical cleaning can be used 37 thus the membrane m3 has higher value of flux rr than other membranes with ha bsa and o w emulsion ultrafiltration this behaviour was originated due to hydrophilic effect of grafted pegma chains on the surface of sio2 nps 3 7 protein adsorption experiment observation to analyse the hydrophilic modification of membrane protein adsorption experiment was conducted and amount of protein adsorbed onto the membrane surface was determined hydrophilic nature of membrane forms the water layer on the membrane surface and prevents the protein adsorption in this work bsa was selected to represent the protein for the comparison of antifouling property between plain and modified membranes fig 8 shows the amount of adsorbed bsa as a function of sio2 g pegma nps content in membranes the addition of sio2 g pegma nps reduces the adsorption of bsa from 0 12 mg cm2 for plain membrane to 0 03 mg cm2 for modified membrane m5 these results prove that the addition of sio2 g pegma nps can efficiently reduce the protein adsorption on the membrane surface due to increase in hydrophilicity which was already discussed in section 3 5 3 8 transport and retention property the effect of addition of different wt of sio2 g pegma nps on transport and retention property of membranes were evaluated by measuring feed flux and rejection percentage of ha bsa and o w emulsion fig 13 shows that as the sio2 g pegma nps content increases average flux with all feed increases for membranes m1 to m3 and then decreases it may be clearly seen that the flux through membrane m3 is 3 8 5 and 4 5 times of plain membrane flux with ha bsa and o w emulsion feeds respectively this may be due to increase in pore percent of modified membrane m3 the flux order was ha o w emulsion bsa for plain membrane as well as for modified membranes a slight increment of rejection percentage of ha was observed from plain to modified membrane while significant rejection percentages of bsa and o w emulsion were found in modified membranes compare to plain membrane for plain to modified membrane m4 the rejection percentages of bsa and o w emulsion were increased from 71 to 91 and 69 to 89 respectively therefore retention property of modified membranes was higher than plain membrane due to high surface hydrophilicity and small pore size as discussed earlier retention property of membrane m4 was highest so photographs of oil in water emulsion feed solution and collected permeate before and after separation through modified pvdf membrane m4 is shown in fig 14 bsa rejection in the present work was relatively higher than the bsa rejection found by the previous studies of pvdf membrane modification 18 38 47 48 3 9 selection of membrane the results of flux d and s p in ha bsa and o w emulsion ultrafiltration were shown in fig 15 in the figure flux d ratio decreased with sio2 g pegma nps content from m1 to m3 and then increased for m4 it indicates that m3 membrane has lowest flux d which means that highest flux recovery after cleaning of fouled membrane the values of flux d were lower than the result of the other study 43 which indicates the further improvement in flux recovery of pvdf membranes the s p was also investigated to compare the overall performance of all fabricated membranes it was calculated from the value of feed flux rejection ratio and flux decline ratio by eq 13 and results are shown in fig 15 clearly the s p was highest for m3 membrane using all three feeds the value of s p for m3 was 11 55 and 22 time the value of m1 in ha bsa and o w emulsion ultrafiltration respectively although for m3 the values of ha flux and ha rejection were higher than bsa flux and bsa rejection but overall performance in terms of s p was higher with bsa compare to ha the order of s p for m3 membrane was bsa ha o w emulsion whereas for m1 m2 and m4 membranes was ha bsa o w emulsion 4 conclusion to improve the dispersibility of sio2 nps and to enhance the hydrophilicity of pvdf membrane sio2 nps were successfully modified by grafting pegma ftir spectra data confirms the grafting of pegma onto sio2 nps then the modified nps were used to prepare blend pvdf membranes with different wt of sio2 g pegma nps via phase inversion method the effect of sio2 g pegma nps on the morphology porosity hydrophilicity pwf ha bsa o w emulsion separation performance and antifouling property were investigated from sedimentation experiment it was obtained that the modified sio2 g pegma nps could be homogeneously dispersed in organic solvent dmac these results were proved by eds analysis of modified membranes which shows that the sio2 g pegma nps were uniformly distributed on the membrane surface the porosity pore percent and pwf flux of the membrane were increased by addition of low quantity of sio2 g pegma nps then they attained maximum when the sio2 g pegma nps amount was 0 5 wt and decreased with increase of nps dose which could be ascribed to the synergetic effect of the thermodynamic enrichment with the rheological interference 36 hydrophilicity and antifouling property were found to enhanced with the increase in sio2 g pegma nps wt for plain m1 to modified membrane m4 the rejection percentages of ha bsa and o w emulsion were increased from 90 to 94 71 to 91 and 69 to 89 respectively for m3

various process industries such as refineries metallurgical textile leather and steel processing plants the separation of oily wastewater particularly oil water emulsion is a serious problem membrane technology has been considered a prominence technology amongst worldwide for oily wastewater treatment due to high separation efficiency small footprint simple process and low operational cost among all polymers pvdf is a promising candidate to prepare polymeric membrane for oily wastewater separation due to its good chemical property superior thermal stability and excellent mechanical strength 1 2 however hydrophobic nature and low surface energy of pvdf membranes makes it susceptible to fouled by natural organic matter nom protein and oily wastewater results sharp decline in flux and permeability 3 fouling can be overcome by hydrophilic modification of pvdf membranes nowadays preparation of antifouling membrane is an intense research area in separation and purification technology 4 hydrophilic modification of the membranes can be achieved by surface coating surface grafting and blending of additives surface coating with hydrophilic layer provides the temporary hydrophilicity due to instability and could be washed out during filtration and cleaning process because of weak physical interaction between membrane surface and coated layer while surface grafting is effective method to modify the membrane with grafted chains through covalent bonding interaction onto the membrane surface it can be achieved by ultraviolet irradiation electron beam surface induced grafting polymerization plasma treatment and living controlled radical polymerisation hydrophilic polymers amphiphilic copolymers and inorganic nps 5 such as polyethylene glycol peg 6 polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp

ag 16 zno 17 and carbon nanotubes cnts 18 are used as additive for direct blending in the casting solution among these methods blending of additives is preferable and simple because in other methods one additional step is required to modify the membranes and its applications are limited to modify structure of membrane zhao et al synthesized pvdf membrane by blending of hyperbranched polyglycerol hpg they found that addition of hpg as modifier increases the porosity surface pore size hydrophilicity and pwf and state that hpg act as pore forming agent and also contribute to raise the hydrophilicity of membrane 19 song et al prepared pvdf membrane by blending of tio2 nps and peg in the dope solution they found that addition of peg tio2 increases the ha removal and simultaneously reduces the flux due to small size of pores 20 li et al fabricated styrene alt maleic anhydride sma pvdf blend membrane and immersed in tio2 nps solution for seven days and investigated that the tio2 self assembly membranes indicates the improved antifouling property and permeability as compare to sma pvdf blend membrane 21 moslehyani et al modified pvdf membrane by blending multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt they had observed more than 99 rejection of tio2 pollutant for oxidized mwcnt nanocomposite membranes 22 although nps are excellent hydrophilic additives however agglomeration is one of the major drawbacks in the blending method due to small size and high surface energy of nps agglomeration induces unstable conditions to casting solution which results non uniform membrane due to uneven distribution of nps this behaviour affects the structure and performance of membrane and also reduces the fouling resistant ability of hydrophilic nps additives 23 uniform dispersion of nps can be achieved by sonication or strong mechanical stirring however it is restricted to high concentration of nps various methods such as surface modification of nps formation of nps by sol gel process and addition of third component to enhance the interaction between nps had been used by various researchers to minimize the agglomeration 13 24 recently functionalised nps have become ideal candidates to incorporate into polymeric material for hydrophilic modification of membrane madaeni et al synthesized pvdf membrane with functionalized tio2 nps by acrylic acid monomer and they observed better fouling resistance of modified membranes 25 shen et al prepared antifouling hybrid pvdf membrane with poly n acryloylmorpholine grafted zro2 zro2 g pacmo nps and they observed that modified membranes showed lower adsorption of protein than unmodified pvdf membrane 26 munirasu et al established a new method for fabrication of asymmetric organic inorganic nanoporous polymeric membrane by functionalisation of sio2 nps with pmma they proposed that the new sio2 g pmma hybrid asymmetric nanoporous structure and synthesis process can be applicable in membrane fabrication for specific separation purpose 27 park et al modified the sio2 nps grafted with poly oxyethylene methacrylate poem and ionic poly styrene sulfonic acid pssa they discussed that the modified nps showed better dispersion in alcohol than unmodified nps 28 in reviewing the previous work it is clear that several researchers reported the modification of membrane with unmodified and modified nps but to the best of our knowledge hydrophilic modification of pvdf membrane with functionalized sio2 nps by pegma chains is still lacking therefore in this work pegma was successfully grafted onto sio2 nps and then novel hydrophilic pvdf membranes hybrid were synthesized by direct blending of sio2 g pegma nps in the casting solution via phase inversion method the synthesized membranes were characterized by ftir atr fesem lldp water ca water uptake porosity protein adsorption study pwf and hydraulic permeability in ultrafiltration study ha bsa and o w emulsion were used to represent nom protein and industrial pollutant respectively as model foulants finally flux recovery ratio and selection parameter were investigated to compare the performance membranes 2 experimental 2 1 materials pvdf pellets average mw

crude oil density 911 2 kg m3 collected from oil and natural gas corporation ongc india deionised water treated by water purification system elga purelab uk was used in preparation of feed solutions and as non solvent in precipitation bath all chemicals were used as received without further purification 2 2 synthesis and characterization of pegma grafted sio2 nanoparticles the pegma grafted sio2 sio2 g pegma nps were synthesized via radical polymerization of sio2 nps and pegma in methanol using aibn as initiator the modification steps of sio2 nps are shown in fig 1 the reaction was carried out in two steps first step was tms ba coupling onto sio2 nps and second step was pegma grafting onto sio2 tms ba coupled nps for first step 1 5 g dried sio2 nps were immersed in a mixture of 200 ml of methanol and pure water 1 1 v v and sonicated for 30 min to achieve the uniform dispersion of nps the suspension was purged with nitrogen gas in three neck round bottom flask fitted with reflux condenser which was placed in oil bath at 40 c and stirred for 30 min afterwards 5 ml of tms ba was added into the suspension and reaction was conducted for 5 h after completion of reaction nps were cooled to room temperature separated by the use of centrifuge and washed with methanol to remove residual of tms ba the obtained product was dried at 60 c for 24 h and labelled as sio2 tms ba for second step sio2 tms ba nps were dispersed in methanol and sonicated for 30 min to make homogeneous suspension and then pegma and aibn were added into the suspension the weight ratio of sio2 tms ba and pegma was 1 5 aibn was added to the suspension at 0 2 of the total weight ratio of sio2 tms ba and pegma the mixture was purged with nitrogen gas into three neck round bottom flask fitted with reflux condenser then the reaction was allowed to react for 6 h at 60 c at last the obtained product was washed with methanol centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min and dried at 60 c for 24 h the resultant product was labelled as sio2 g pegma nps modified nps were characterized by ftir analysis and sedimentation test ftir characterization was conducted to verify the functional groups present in modified sio2 g pegma nps using ftir spectrometer supplied by perkin elmer inc germany visual comparison of bare and modified silica nps was performed by sedimentation test to analyse anti accumulation property 0 25 gm of sio2 and sio2 g pegma nps were placed into 15 ml of dmac and ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min the sedimentation of bare and modified nps was observed by digital camera after standing for 12 h 2 3 membrane preparation initially pvdf membrane with peg 6000 and without sio2 g pegma nps was optimized in terms of thickness flux smoothness and homogeneity the optimum percentage of pvdf in casting solution was observed to be 15 wt flat sheet pvdf membranes were prepared using 5 wt of peg 6000 various wt of sio2 g pegma nps and dmac as solvent via phase inversion method the compositions of casting solution used for fabrication of pvdf membranes are shown in table 1 the casting solution was magnetically stirred at room temperature for 24 h to make homogeneous solution and degassed for 6 h to eliminate air bubbles then the casting solution was spread on a glass plate with the help of casting knife with a uniform gap of 300 μm under ambient conditions immediately the cast film together with glass plate was dipped in coagulation bath containing deionised water as nonsolvent at room temperature where solidification of membrane take place by exchange of dmac with deionised water after 10 min of solidification membranes were transferred into fresh deionised water for 24 h in order to leach out the residual of dmac solvent afterwards membranes were air dried at room temperature and stored in air tight packets 2 4 membrane characterization to confirm the functional groups present in surface grafting of sio2 nps with pegma and functional changes in pvdf membranes due to blending of sio2 g pegma nps in the casting solution were observed by ftir spectra recorded by ftir atr spectrometer sem leo 1430vp uk and fesem zeiss lsm 510 meta were used to characterize the morphology and sub layer structure of prepared membranes the membranes were cut into small pieces around 1 cm2 and sputter coated with thin film of gold 2 5 liquid liquid displacement porosimetry study lldp analysis was conducted to determine the pore density pore size pore size distribution and mean pore size this analysis was carried out under the assumptions that the all pores of membrane are cylindrical in shape parallel to each other not interconnected and have length equal to skin layer thickness a mixture of water isobutanol methanol 25 15 7 v v was used with surface tension between water rich and alcohol rich phase of 0 35 mn m and dynamic viscosity of alcohol rich phase of 3 4 mns m2 the mixture was prepared from required amount of alcohols and deionised water in a separating funnel and shaken vigorously and then stands for 4 h water and alcohol rich phases were used as wetting liquid for membrane and as displacing liquid respectively 29 it was also assumed that the contact angle between membrane and liquid liquid interface is zero 30 the correlation data of radius of pores r was obtained from cantor s equation with various applied pressure 1 r 2 σ p where p is the transmembrane pressure and σ is the surface tension between the two liquids for the determination of the pore numbers per unit membrane surface area n i k the following equation was used 2 n i k d η 2 π σ 4 p 3 i k j i k where n i k represent the pore numbers per unit membrane surface area having radii between r i and r k respectively d is the pore length which is assumed equivalent to membrane skin layer thickness and ɳ is the dynamic viscosity of alcohol rich phase the total number of pores n t per unit area of the membrane was obtained by using the equation as follow 3 n t n i k hence the mean pore radius r m was determined by the formula as follow 4 r m n i k r i k n i k 2 6 membrane porosity water uptake and hydrophilicity membrane porosity is one the significant parameter which defines the membrane performance it can be explained as volume of pores to the total volume of membrane to understand the porous nature of membrane initially small piece of about 4 cm2 of membranes were soaked in distilled water and weighed as soon as the superficial water was cleaned with filter paper afterwards wet membranes were dried overnight to a constant weight the porosity was determined by gravimetric method which was calculated by the following equation 5 ε w w w d ρ w a l 100 where w w and w d are the wet membrane and dry membrane weight gm respectively ε is the membrane porosity ais the membrane surface area cm2 l is the thickness of membrane cm and ρ w is the density of water gm cm3 water uptake u w is closely associated with porosity and expressed the water retaining capacity of the membranes water uptake was evaluated from the values of w w and w d used in porosity measurement which can be defined by the following equation 6 u w w w w d w d 100 in these analyses average values of three data were reported for each membrane to minimize the experimental error hydrophilic behaviour of membrane was analyzed by examining the surface hydrophilicity from water ca made by deionised water drop on the membrane surface ca was evaluated at three different positions for all fabricated membranes from an image of water drop on the surface of membrane using goniometer 29 2 7 pure water permeation performance batch filtration cell made of stainless steel and capacity of 350 ml was used to conduct the pure water permeation experiments flat circular membrane of 5 10 2 m diameter with effective area inside the footprint of the o ring of 19 625 10 4 m2 was installed on a base porous support the feed inside the filtration cell was pressurized at the top using inert gas nitrogen and permeate was collected from the bottom the schematic of batch filtration cell used in this study is provided in supporting information fig s 1 initially synthesized membranes were pre compacted for 2 h at 250 kpa using deionised water and throughout the study operating pressure were maintained below 250 kpa these pre compacted membranes were used in subsequent ultrafiltration experiments at 200 kpa the pwf of pre pressurized membranes was measured at every 15 min interval upto the flow stabilization of feed and calculated by eq 7 7 j p w v a δ t where j p w is the pwf l m2 h v is the volume of permeating liquid l at transmembrane pressure a is the effective surface area m2 of membrane δt is the permeation time h after pwf measurement the compaction factor c f for each membrane was calculated by eq 8 8 c f j p w i j p w s s where j p w i and j p w s s are the pure water flux at initial and steady state respectively hydraulic permeability p m l m2 h kpa of membranes was determined from the slope between j p w and applied pressure δp to the filtration cell using the following equation 9 p m j p w δ p 2 8 ultrafiltration experiment using ha bsa and oil in water emulsion o w emulsion was prepared using indian crude oil density 911 2 kg m3 collected from ongc india without any treatment crude oil was used as oil phase in deionised water and concentration in water was kept at the desired value mixture of crude oil and water was sonicated by probe sonicator model vcx 500 ultrasonic processor 500 w 20 khz for 6 8 h at 30 c to prepare the o w emulsion the resultant solution was labelled as o w emulsion and characterized in term of average oil droplet size ph turbidity concentration and density the size of oil droplets was 311 5 nm with a volume average which was determined using particle size analyzer malvern mastersize 2000 model mal1083109 the ph and turbidity of the o w emulsion feed were determined using a digital ph meter model 5010t hach and portable nephlometer turbidity meter model 2100q hach respectively and the values are 7 03 and 259 ntu respectively the concentration of oil in o w emulsion was determined using ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer model dr 6000 hach by observing its maximum absorbance value it is well known that the crude oil is a complex mixture of many different hydrocarbon compounds and its composition varies from place to place accordingly the desired wavelength for the determination of maximum absorbance also varies in this study the maximum absorbance was found at 202 nm for different concentrations of o w emulsion the density of o w emulsion feed was determined using a pyknometer the pyknometer of known volume was filled with o w emulsion and mass of o w emulsion was measured at room temperature the density was calculated from the data of volume and mass of o w emulsion each reading for density measurement was taken three times and the average data was then recorded the density of o w emulsion feed was 954 45 kg m3 ultrafiltration experiments were carried out in batch filtration cell using ha bsa and o w emulsion as feed to evaluate the separation performance and membrane fouling at room temperature pre compacted membranes were used in all ultrafiltration studies initially pwf j p w 1 was measured for 60 min time period with a regular interval at 200 kpa afterward filtration cell was filled with feed and feed flux j f was measured for next 60 min rejection percentage of ha bsa and o w emulsion was measured using uv vis spectroscopy at wavelength of 254 nm 280 nm and 202 nm respectively by eq 10 10 r 1 c p c f 100 where c f and c p are the concentrations of feed and permeate mg l respectively r is the rejection percentage after 120 min of ultrafiltration membrane was cleaned with deionised water again pwf j p w 2 of cleaned membrane was measured for next 60 min in addition the flux recovery ratio flux rr and flux decline f l u x d were determined using the value of pwf at steady state before and after cleaning of membrane using the following equations 11 f l u x r r j p w 2 j p w 1 12 f l u x d 1 j p w 2 j p w 1 the selection parameter s p l m2 h was also determined to compare the performance of different membranes using the following expression 13 s p j p w 2 r f l u x d in order to explain the fouling behaviour during ultrafiltration study some ratios such as irreversible fouling f ir reversible fouling f r and total fouling f t were determined from the following equations 14 f i r j p w 1 j p w 2 j p w 1 15 f r j p w 2 j f j p w 1 16 f t j p w 1 j f j p w 1 during the permeation experiments the reason behind reversible fouling is reversible adsorption of ha bsa oil droplets on the surface of membrane and which can be moved out by simple hydraulic cleaning while in irreversible fouling the irreversible adsorption of ha bsa oil droplets takes place and it is difficult to clear by simple hydraulic cleaning 2 9 protein adsorption experiments in order to understand the antifouling property of the membranes with respect to plain membrane protein adsorption experiment was conducted using bsa solution of 1000 mg l concentration the studied membranes of square shape of 4 cm2 were immersed in 15 ml of bsa solution for 24 h under incubation at 25 c to achieve adsorption equilibrium the adsorbed mass concentration mg cm2 of bsa protein on the membrane surface was found by calculating the difference between the concentration of bsa solution before and after adsorption using eq 17 the concentration of bsa solution was determined from the absorbance intensity at 280 nm recorded on a uv vis spectrophotometer values of bsa adsorbed were averaged from three different samples of the same prepared membrane to minimize the error of the adsorbed concentration measurements 17 c a d c b c a a where c b and c a are the concentrations of bsa before and after adsorption mg l respectively c ad is the mass of bsa adsorbed per unit surface area of membrane mg cm2 a is surface area of membrane cm2 3 results and discussions 3 1 sedimentation test for bare sio2 and sio2 g pegma nps since dmac was used as solvent for preparation of pvdf membranes it was selected for visual comparison between bare sio2 and sio2 g pegma nps as shown in fig 2 sedimentation experiments indicate that the bare sio2 nps rapidly settled down in 15 min whereas the sio2 g pegma nps are still in suspension after 12 h this behaviour is remarkable by contrast with sedimentation experiment that pegma grafting onto sio2 nps can significantly improve the dispersion ability of sio2 in the organic phase 3 2 ftir atr spectroscopy analysis to investigate the success of grafting of pegma onto sio2 nps was studied by ftir spectra fig 3 shows the ftir spectra of bare sio2 sio2 tms ba and sio2 g pegma nps a very intense peak at around 1075 cm 1 is present due to asymmetric stretching vibration of siosi 31 which is overlapped by absorption band of coc group present in pegma chain grafted onto sio2 nps moreover absorption bands in the spectra of nps at around 810 cm 1 and 460 cm 1 are characteristics of the asymmetric stretching vibration and bending vibration of siosi 32 in comparison the spectra of sio2 tms ba and sio2 g pegma nps exhibits some new peaks at 867 cm 1 and 845 cm 1 correspond to sioh bond deformations after sio2 nps modification which are not found in the spectrum of sio2 nps the sio2 g pegma nps spectrum shows ch stretching of the ch3 and ch2 groups present in pegma at 2922 cm 1 and 2849 cm 1 33 the chemical structure of the plain and modified pvdf membranes was examined by ftir atr spectroscopy ftir atr spectra of all samples are shown in fig 4 a strong absorbance at 1182 cm 1 is shown for the pvdf membrane due to the stretching vibration of the cf bond and the typical frequencies of cf2 groups at 1402 1070 880 and 840 cm 1 could clearly be identified 17 β phase vibration at 1278 cm 1 and α phase vibration at 761 cm 1 of pvdf indicating that the chemical structure of pvdf would not damage by addition of sio2 g pegma nps 12 a broad absorption peak at 3600 3200 cm 1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of functional oh groups on the surface of pvdf membranes 34 ch stretching peaks at 2922 cm 1 and 2852 cm 1 confirms the presence of pegma in modified membranes and intensity of these peaks increased with increase in wt of sio2 g pegma nps moreover absorption bands in the spectra of modified pvdf membranes at around 978 cm 1 and 799 cm 1 are the characteristics of the asymmetric stretching of sioh and symmetric stretching of siosi groups respectively 34 3 3 morphological study in order to analyse the effect of various wt of sio2 g pegma nps on the microstructure of the fabricated membranes sem micrographs of both top surface as well as cross section of plain and modified membranes were observed the sem images showed that the blending of sio2 g pegma nps have an influence on membrane formation mechanism and final structure of the membranes fig 5 shows the top surface and cross section images of plain and modified membranes from fig 5 it may be observed that as the wt of sio2 g pegma nps increased from 0 to 0 5 the pore density of membranes was increased but beyond that it was decreased it may also be noticed that membrane m3 has the highest pore density compared to all other membranes so it is clear that when sio2 g pegma nps was added in small quantity upto 0 5 wt they acts as a pore forming agent however the pore density were suppressed with continuous increase of nps wt and results dense membrane structure m4 and m5 membranes this is also supported by the porosity results table 2 discussed in subsequent section this behaviour could be interpreted by the fact that the viscosity of casting solution increases drastically with high nps concentration which might generate slow exchange rate of solvent and nonsolvent and lead to delayed demixing as a result dense structure of membrane was formed similar result was also observed by yin et al 35 they had used sio2 g pdmaema co pdmaps nps as additive in casting solution for preparation of pes membrane and highest porosity was found at 0 15 wt and dense structure was observed at 0 45 wt of nps when bare sio2 nps are used as additive the agglomeration of sio2 nps appears on the surface of membrane and with increase in wt of sio2 nps more agglomeration appears on the membrane surface 36 while in the present work fig 6 shows that the sio2 g pegma nps were well dispersed in the polymer due to high dispersion ability of sio2 g pegma nps in dmac solvent which is already discussed in section 3 1 in this study the existence as well as uniform dispersion of sio2 g pegma nps on the membrane surface was also analyzed by energy dispersive spectroscopy eds from the eds result fig 6c confirms the presence and dispersibility of sio2 g pegma nps in modified m3 membrane eds top surface images of m1 and m2 are provided in supporting material fig s 2 it is clear that the pegma surface grafting minimizes the agglomeration of sio2 nps during casting solution preparation and make uniform membranes with even distribution of modified nps the schematic illustration of immobilization of bare sio2 nps and sio2 g pegma on the membrane surface is shown in fig 6a and b as depicted in fig 5 there were no apparent differences in the cross section images of the plain and modified membranes except m5 all fabricated membranes show the typical asymmetric cross sectional structure consisting of a skin layer as a selective barrier and sponge like sub structure membrane m5 had relatively denser cross section structure compare to other membranes this is due to the formation of a cross linking structure of sio2 g pegma nps with polymeric pvdf chains leads the growth of the sponge like structure similar cross section structure of pvdf membrane was also observed by sinha and purkait 37 3 4 liquid liquid displacement porosimetry observation lldp study was conducted to determine pore size pore number total pore numbers per unit area of the membrane and mean pore size in this study minimum pressure required to start the flux through the membrane m1 m2 and m3 was 25 kpa on the other hand for m4 and m5 this value was 50 kpa and 75 kpa respectively thereafter penetrating liquid starts to substitute the wetting liquid present in biggest pores further smaller pores begin to open with increase in pressure and once all the pores are opened by substituting the wetting liquid the flux increases slightly the lldp flux plot for all membranes synthesized with various wt of sio2 g pegma nps is shown in fig 7 a the nature of lldp flux plot is almost same for membranes m1 m2 m3 and m4 while m5 had much lower lldp flux than other membranes fig 7a it was seen that the lldp flux increase with increase in wt of sio2 g pegma nps upto 0 5 and then decrease thereafter from fig 7a it may also be observed at beginning for membrane m1 m2 m3 and m4 flux increases at slow speed with increase in pressure however the flux increases rapidly from 200 kpa to 350 kpa and after that flux increasingly slowed down but throughout the study lldp flux for membrane m5 increases slowly with pressure the left part of fig 7a illustrate that the pore density is highest for pore size between 2 to 4 nm and decrease thereafter while it is almost negligible for pores having size greater than 6 nm fig 7b shows the percent distribution of pore size the trend is nearly same for all the membranes it was observed that the pore number percentage starts to increase as size of pores decreased from 6 nm to 2 2 nm opposite to this trend pore number percentage decrease when pore size decreases from 2 2 nm the graph between cumulative pore number percentage and pore size is shown in fig 7b inset for all membranes it may be seen that more than 95 pores lies in the range of 0 4 nm which clearly indicates that prepared membranes in this work are appropriate for ultrafiltration process table 2 reports the results obtained from the lldp study it can be seen that total number of pores per unit membrane area increases with increase in sio2 g pegma nps content attained maximum at 0 5 wt of sio2 g pegma nps content and then decreases when sio2 g pegma nps was further added the total number of pores per unit surface area of membrane for m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 are 29 1015 30 1015 34 1015 31 2 1015 and 7 3 1015 respectively these results concluded that the addition of sio2 g pegma nps up to 0 5 wt in casting solution for synthesis of pvdf membrane enhances the pore forming process which is already described in section 3 3 3 5 effect of wt of sio2 g pegma nps on porosity water uptake hydrophilicity and pure water permeation the porosity and water uptake of each membrane were quantitatively calculated and listed in table 2 it shows that the porosity and water uptake of membranes increased at first with the addition of a small quantity of sio2 g pegma nps then they achieved upper limit when the sio2 g pegma nps concentration was 0 5 wt however decreased with further addition of sio2 g pegma nps modified membrane showed increase in porosity and water uptake from 20 and 40 for plain membrane to 40 and 88 9 with 0 5 wt of sio2 g pegma nps respectively but porosity and water uptake for m5 are 7 and 17 1 respectively therefore it is clear that the porosity and water uptake values were highest for membrane m3 and lowest for membrane m5 the increasing trend of porosity and water uptake confirms the presence of increasing number of pores and pore size in the membrane with sio2 g pegma nps up to 0 5 wt this phenomenon was also observed by other researchers 35 39 and may be justified by the following reasons 1 addition of hydrophilic nps increases the thermodynamic instability of the casting solution resulting in the formation of large surface pore size and high porosity 40 2 during membrane synthesis process polymer precipitated readily and hydrophilic nps additive migrated impulsively on the membrane surface to decrease interfacial energy simultaneously a part of hydrophilic nps can leach out from the membrane and act as a pore forming agent which results to the membrane having high porous nature and large pore size 41 3 viscosity of the casting solution increases with nps concentration which results delayed demixing of solvent and nonsolvent as well as inhibited the formation of large pore size 5 the hydrophilicity of membrane is an important parameter which influences the antifouling property of the membrane in this work water contact angle was measured to evaluate the hydrophilic modification of membrane surface with sio2 g pegma nps as shown in fig 8 the plain pvdf membrane m1 has the highest water ca of 68 7 showing poor hydrophilicity and ca decreased as the incorporation of the sio2 g pegma nps increased thus the membrane m5 has lower ca of 50 7 in comparison with m1 which shows the higher hydrophilicity of m5 membrane these results showing that sio2 g pegma nps were capable of significantly improving the membrane surface hydrophilicity ca in current work was comparatively lower than the ca obtained by the previous studies 42 45 where pvdf membranes were modified by sio2 nps incorporation of sio2 g pegma nps into casting solution can influence the pwf in mainly two ways firstly it enhances the hydrophilicity of the pvdf membrane secondly it influences the permeation performance of the membrane by altering the membrane morphology 14 pvdf membranes that have been prepared with peg6000 as pore constructor and dmac as solvent are tested to observe the effect of different concentration of sio2 g pegma nps on their permeation behaviour the permeation properties of the membranes were determined in terms of compaction study which includes pwf and compaction factor pwf at different transmembrane pressure tmp and hydraulic permeability compaction is a densification of the membrane structure at tmp which leads to mechanical distortion of membrane structure resulting decrease in hydraulic permeability it is a common phenomenon in membrane application in this study all membranes were pressurized at a constant pressure of 250 kpa for 2 h until a steady state flux was reached the pwf was determined from the value of experimental permeate volume measured at every 15 min interval fig 9 a shows the plot of the pwf versus time during compaction of all membranes for m1 m2 m3 and m4 membranes it was observed that gradual decrease in flux at initial duration of compaction time and pwf reached a steady state value after around 60 min of compaction this was due to the fact that the all membranes had asymmetric structure high pressure compaction causes compression of the porous support layer leading to a thickening of the skin layer resulting decrease in pore size as well as in flux 46 however no flux was observed for m5 membrane during compaction study so only four membranes m1 m2 m3 and m4 have been considered for the pure water permeation study the steady state fluxes were 10 12 13 and 16 of the initial flux for m1 m2 m3 and m4 respectively interestingly as depicted in fig 9a initially the membrane m4 had slightly lower flux than the m1 but after 15 min duration of compaction it showed higher flux this may be due to presence of large macrovoids in subsurface structure of m1 compare to m4 and which have high tendency to compact resulting reduction in flux fig 9a also clearly shows that there is an increase in steady state pwf with sio2 g pegma nps up to 0 5 wt and decreases thereafter up to 0 75 wt hence the increasing trend of pwf was m1 m4 m2 m3 which was same in case of porosity the value of steady state pwf for m1 m2 m3 and m4 was 39 2 70 9 114 5 and 58 8 l m2h respectively the result of pwf agrees to the findings of the porosity and water uptake analysis table 2 compaction factor cf for all the membranes has been reported in table 2 from the cf data it was observed that the cf decreases from 9 92 to 6 11 with increase in wt of sio2 g pegma nps this behaviour could be interpreted as addition of nps increases the viscosity of the casting solution which results delayed demixing of solvent and non solvent as well as suppresses the macrovoids in the membrane sublayer 35 to see the effect of addition of sio2 g pegma nps on pure water permeation the pwf was calculated at various tmp from 0 to 200 kpa with a difference of 25 kpa fig 9b shows that the increasing trend of pwf with pressure was almost linear for all membranes it was found that at a pressure of 25 kpa the pwf for m1 and m4 was nearly equal but pwf for m4 was higher compared to the m1 at high pressure of 200 kpa in this work the applied pressure was 200 kpa in all ultrafiltration experiment and at this pressure membrane m3 had highest pwf for all membranes the order of pwf at 200 kpa was similar as discussed in compaction study and as the results of porosity hydraulic permeability p m defines the ability of porous membrane to pass fluids through it it was determined from the slope of the plot between flux and applied pressure eq 11 and the values are reported in table 2 it may be observed from table 2 that p m increases with increase of wt of sio2 g pegma nps up to 0 5 wt and beyond that it starts to decrease the permeability value of m3 is almost triple than that of m1 this marginal variation in permeability is also dictated by the sem images of top surfaces fig 5 these results clearly indicate that addition of sio2 g pegma nps in different quantities influences the porosity on the membrane surface findings from above studies noticeably shows that addition of sio2 g pegma nps up to 0 5 wt enhance the pore forming behaviour in pvdf membrane on the contrary at high nps concentration 0 75 wt and 1 wt membranes with less pore density were obtained which was associated to the rheological hindrance due to increased viscosity of casting solution 35 these findings are in agreement with the morphological characterization of the membranes through fesem and lldp studies 3 6 ultrafiltration and fouling studies the ultrafiltration operation and antifouling ability of plain and modified membranes were analyses by filtering 100 ppm ha 1000 ppm bsa and 100 ppm o w emulsion solution at fixed tmp of 200 kpa figs 10 12 show the time dependent flux fouling study and flux recovery ratio of ha bsa and o w emulsion ultrafiltration studies respectively the ultrafiltration experiments were conducted for 3 h time period initially j p w 1 was measure from 0 to 60 min afterwards j f was measured from 60 to 120 min and after simple cleaning of membrane with pure water further j p w 2 was measured from 120 to 180 min during initial time of pure water permeation a slight decline in pwf was observed and after 30 min it was almost remains constant for all membranes in ha bsa and o w emulsion ultrafiltration experiments in all ultrafiltration experiments modified membranes had higher flux than plain membrane m1 and j p w 2 were lower than the initial j p w 1 0 60 min but higher than the j f fig 10a shows a less flux loss in ha permeation during ha ultrafiltration process ha molecules create a porous and mesh gel layer by cross linking with each other these cross linked ha molecules can be easily retained by the membrane on the surface in addition porous and mesh gel layer of ha molecules would result in less flux loss 37 however bsa permeation shows higher flux loss than ha permeation due to surface assimilation or deposition of bsa molecules on the membrane surface or penetration of bsa molecules into the pores fig 11a the o w emulsion flux decreased at the first 15 min of ultrafiltration due to adsorption of oil droplets and blocked the pores after 15 min it was stable due to adsorption and deposition of oil droplets on the membrane surfaces attained stability to analyse the membrane fouling quantitatively during ha bsa and o w emulsion ultrafiltration f ir f r and f t ratios were evaluated and have been reported in supporting information table s 1 as given in figs figure 1010b figure 1111b and figure 1212b irreversible fouling decreased at first and then attained to a minimum when the percentage of sio2 g pegma nps was 0 5 wt and increased on further addition of sio2 g pegma nps lower value of f ir signifies that the lower quantity of irreversible adsorption or deposition of foulants on the membrane surface or inside the pores and vice versa while reversible fouling increased with the content of sio2 g pegma nps upto 0 5 wt and decreased thereafter the increase in f r confirms that the irreversible fouling is changed into reversible fouling of membrane in the ultrafiltration in another word the irreversible fouling on the membrane surface is inhibited due to the assimilation of sio2 g pegma nps these results are attributed to the fact that the formed hydration layer on the membrane surface can reduce the interaction between membrane surface and foulants because of addition of hydrophilic modifiers leading to the prevention of irreversible foulants adhesion the trend of f t was similar with f ir as have been discussed above it was concluded that the plain membrane has highest value of f t and f ir in ultrafiltration experiments with all type of feeds however m3 membrane has lowest value of f t andf ir results less prone to adsorption or deposition of irreversible foulants thus addition of sio2 g pegma nps in the casting solution resisted the adsorption or deposition of foulants inside the pores or on the surface of membrane by increasing the hydrophilicity figs 10 b 11 b and 12 b shows the flux rr of plain and modified membranes as flux rr is directly linked to the irreversible fouling reduction in f ir causes increase in flux rr for the modified membranes from figs 10 b 11 b and 12 b it was observed that the flux rr was increased from 0 86 0 63 and 0 53 for plain membrane to 0 95 0 95 and 0 84 for membrane m3 in ha bsa and o w emulsion ultrafiltration process respectively in this work the value of flux rr was comparatively higher than the results of previous studies in case of bsa 42 44 and o w emulsion ultrafiltration 45 through pvdf membrane the value of flux rr in o w emulsion ultrafiltration was comparatively less than that in ha and bsa ultrafiltration this may be due to the fact that ha and bsa molecules can be easily moved out by simple hydraulic cleaning and achieve high flux rr while after simple hydraulic cleaning oil droplets remains present on the membrane surface or inside the pores due to insolubility of o w emulsion in water and it is difficult to clean the membranes so to remove such type of foulants from membranes chemical cleaning can be used 37 thus the membrane m3 has higher value of flux rr than other membranes with ha bsa and o w emulsion ultrafiltration this behaviour was originated due to hydrophilic effect of grafted pegma chains on the surface of sio2 nps 3 7 protein adsorption experiment observation to analyse the hydrophilic modification of membrane protein adsorption experiment was conducted and amount of protein adsorbed onto the membrane surface was determined hydrophilic nature of membrane forms the water layer on the membrane surface and prevents the protein adsorption in this work bsa was selected to represent the protein for the comparison of antifouling property between plain and modified membranes fig 8 shows the amount of adsorbed bsa as a function of sio2 g pegma nps content in membranes the addition of sio2 g pegma nps reduces the adsorption of bsa from 0 12 mg cm2 for plain membrane to 0 03 mg cm2 for modified membrane m5 these results prove that the addition of sio2 g pegma nps can efficiently reduce the protein adsorption on the membrane surface due to increase in hydrophilicity which was already discussed in section 3 5 3 8 transport and retention property the effect of addition of different wt of sio2 g pegma nps on transport and retention property of membranes were evaluated by measuring feed flux and rejection percentage of ha bsa and o w emulsion fig 13 shows that as the sio2 g pegma nps content increases average flux with all feed increases for membranes m1 to m3 and then decreases it may be clearly seen that the flux through membrane m3 is 3 8 5 and 4 5 times of plain membrane flux with ha bsa and o w emulsion feeds respectively this may be due to increase in pore percent of modified membrane m3 the flux order was ha o w emulsion bsa for plain membrane as well as for modified membranes a slight increment of rejection percentage of ha was observed from plain to modified membrane while significant rejection percentages of bsa and o w emulsion were found in modified membranes compare to plain membrane for plain to modified membrane m4 the rejection percentages of bsa and o w emulsion were increased from 71 to 91 and 69 to 89 respectively therefore retention property of modified membranes was higher than plain membrane due to high surface hydrophilicity and small pore size as discussed earlier retention property of membrane m4 was highest so photographs of oil in water emulsion feed solution and collected permeate before and after separation through modified pvdf membrane m4 is shown in fig 14 bsa rejection in the present work was relatively higher than the bsa rejection found by the previous studies of pvdf membrane modification 18 38 47 48 3 9 selection of membrane the results of flux d and s p in ha bsa and o w emulsion ultrafiltration were shown in fig 15 in the figure flux d ratio decreased with sio2 g pegma nps content from m1 to m3 and then increased for m4 it indicates that m3 membrane has lowest flux d which means that highest flux recovery after cleaning of fouled membrane the values of flux d were lower than the result of the other study 43 which indicates the further improvement in flux recovery of pvdf membranes the s p was also investigated to compare the overall performance of all fabricated membranes it was calculated from the value of feed flux rejection ratio and flux decline ratio by eq 13 and results are shown in fig 15 clearly the s p was highest for m3 membrane using all three feeds the value of s p for m3 was 11 55 and 22 time the value of m1 in ha bsa and o w emulsion ultrafiltration respectively although for m3 the values of ha flux and ha rejection were higher than bsa flux and bsa rejection but overall performance in terms of s p was higher with bsa compare to ha the order of s p for m3 membrane was bsa ha o w emulsion whereas for m1 m2 and m4 membranes was ha bsa o w emulsion 4 conclusion to improve the dispersibility of sio2 nps and to enhance the hydrophilicity of pvdf membrane sio2 nps were successfully modified by grafting pegma ftir spectra data confirms the grafting of pegma onto sio2 nps then the modified nps were used to prepare blend pvdf membranes with different wt of sio2 g pegma nps via phase inversion method the effect of sio2 g pegma nps on the morphology porosity hydrophilicity pwf ha bsa o w emulsion separation performance and antifouling property were investigated from sedimentation experiment it was obtained that the modified sio2 g pegma nps could be homogeneously dispersed in organic solvent dmac these results were proved by eds analysis of modified membranes which shows that the sio2 g pegma nps were uniformly distributed on the membrane surface the porosity pore percent and pwf flux of the membrane were increased by addition of low quantity of sio2 g pegma nps then they attained maximum when the sio2 g pegma nps amount was 0 5 wt and decreased with increase of nps dose which could be ascribed to the synergetic effect of the thermodynamic enrichment with the rheological interference 36 hydrophilicity and antifouling property were found to enhanced with the increase in sio2 g pegma nps wt for plain m1 to modified membrane m4 the rejection percentages of ha bsa and o w emulsion were increased from 90 to 94 71 to 91 and 69 to 89 respectively for m3 membrane the maximum flux rr of 0 95 0 95 and 0 84 was achieved after ultrafiltration of ha bsa and o w emulsion respectively the s p was highest for m3 membrane using all three feeds in summary sio2 g pegma nps were found to be an effective additive to improve the performance of ultrafiltration pvdf membrane pvdf peg6000 sio2 g pegma nps membrane shows enhanced water permeation porosity
