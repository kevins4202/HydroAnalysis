9475,this study presents a credibility based interval multi objective crop area planning model for agricultural and ecological management under uncertainty the model is developed through the integrations of interval multi objective programming and fuzzy credibility constrained programming by considering economic and ecological benefits of the study system and dealing with interval and fuzzy uncertainties it focuses on crop area optimization with the interval objective function of maximizing the system benefits maximizing the watershed area and fractional interval objective function of maximizing the land productivity i e system benefits per unit area additionally the relationship between watershed area and ecological discharge is expressed as interval linear function which is estimated by using interval regression analysis method then the model is applied to a case study in minqin county in the lower reaches of shiyang river basin for crop area optimization in view of the increasing shortage of water resources and the competition between agricultural and ecological water use optimal solutions for different scenarios can be generated based on fuzzy credibility constraints when the predefined credibility levels are set as 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 0 9 respectively the results show that the crop area optimization model can better balance the regional agricultural and ecological benefits while ensuring grain production and promoting water saving moreover a higher level of credibility corresponds to a lower system benefit but a larger watershed area when credibility level is raised from 0 6 to 0 9 the upper bounds of system benefits are decreased from 13 87 10 8 yuan to 13 81 10 8 yuan whereas the watershed area is increased from 41 01 km2 to 42 12 km2 these various optimal results can help decision makers weigh system benefits and constraint violation risks therefore the results of the model can provide decision making basis for the crop area optimization and provide valuable basis for the sustainable development in minqin county and similar study areas keywords interval multi objective programming credibility ecological management crop area planning uncertainty 1 introduction water land resources are the basic natural conditions and indispensable factors to ensure agricultural production food security and human life china is a big agricultural country and the agricultural water consumption is 361 24 billion m3 accounting for 62 1 of the total water consumption china water resources bulletin 2020 of which irrigation water consumption accounts for more than 90 of the total agricultural water consumption irrigation is essential to sustain agricultural production and unreasonable irrigation will have an undesirable effect on crop yield and cause a waste of water resources thereby leading to a decrease in water productivity zhang et al 2022 however the average utilization rate of irrigation water is 0 565 in china china water resources bulletin 2020 the arable land area of china is 130 million hm2 and the per capita arable land area is merely 0 106 hm2 which is less than half of the world average besides the unreasonable utilization patterns of water land resources have led to a series of problems such as low agricultural production efficiency and ecological environment deterioration chebil et al 2022 moreover the booming development of industry has turned water use for agricultural production and ecological conservation into industrial growth which makes the contradiction between agricultural and ecological water use increasingly serious zhang et al 2021 such problems are particularly prominent in the arid regions of northwest china therefore how to solve the problem of water shortage improve agricultural water use efficiency and rationally allocate irrigation water are the core of sustainable development of future water resources management jacobs et al 2016 the optimal allocation of agricultural land resources refers to the rational allocation of arable land resources in a specific area by using scientific technologies and management methods to achieve certain social economic and ecological goals tang et al 2015 the adjustment of agricultural planting structure is the goal of optimal allocation of agricultural land resources especially in arid irrigation districts when water scarcity occurs water managers are required to make decisions about what land has higher priority and how to effectively allocate limited water resources razavitoosi and samani 2016 luo et al 2021 therefore optimal allocation of agricultural land resources in this paper mainly considers the crop area optimization the optimization crop area can promote optimal allocation of water resources and alleviate the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources thus enabling the sustainable development of agriculture for example galán martín et al 2015 presented a decision support tool based on a multi stage linear programming whose objective function is the maximum net present value of the farmer s net return fazlali and shourian 2018 proposed the coupled shuffle frog leaping optimization algorithm network flow programming model the objective function is to maximize the total net benefit gained from crops production where the decision variables are the irrigation depths and the cultivation areas are optimized zhang et al 2018 presented an inexact robust two stage mixed integer linear programming approach for crop area planning under uncertainty whose objective function is the maximum system benefits however the above studies did not consider the multi objective problems in practical problems it is usually required to optimize several conflicting objectives simultaneously for example the objective function with the maximum economic benefits and the maximum ecological benefits thus multi objective programming mop models and corresponding solving methods have been developed to coordinate different objectives in optimization process baky et al 2013 lachhwani 2014 lence et al 2017 ren et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 therefore to avoid the drawbacks that the water resources optimization model simply pursues economic goals many studies have introduced mop method into optimal allocation of water resources li et al 2019 developed a stochastic multi objective model for the allocation of resources toward the sustainable management of agricultural water food and energy nexus under uncertainty lalehzari and kerachian 2021 developed a multi objective optimization model under limited water conditions when water soil atmosphere and crop relationships are simultaneously considered moudi et al 2021 developed a dynamic multi objective model of water supply optimization under different scenarios to improve multisectoral consumer satisfaction saeid et al 2021 used nsga ii multi objective optimization algorithm for allocation of surface water and groundwater between agricultural and environmental sectors considering social standards economic efficiency and environmental sustainability the mop method can coordinate various factors in water resources management and provide optimal solutions furthermore when the input parameters cannot be expressed as deterministic values interval parameter programming ipp is introduced into optimization problems to deal with imprecise parameters expressed as interval numbers with upper and lower bounds but unknown probability distributions or membership functions such as market prices agricultural inputs and crop related parameters zhang et al 2020 for instance zhang et al 2019 developed an interval multi objective model of irrigation water management considering the conditions of canal system and optimized three objectives of economic benefits canal water seepage and water allocation in multiple irrigation districts were to be optimized ren et al 2021 developed an improved interval multi objectives programming method while maximum economic benefit and minimum energy consumption were regarded as desired objectives pan et al 2022 established an interval multi objective nonlinear programming model with the objectives of minimum water loss during irrigation maximum net crop benefits maximum yields of main grain crops maximum ecological vegetation benefits and irrigation water balance of each decision making unit to solve agricultural and ecological water allocation problems in irrigated areas under uncertainty however the above studies cannot deal with violated constraint problems especially under a fuzzy environment a key issue in environmental and agricultural management is to tackle the vague parametric information credibility theory is useful for dealing with fuzzy uncertainty and constraint violation issues due to its self duality and convenient computational process generally fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp was proposed by liu and iwamura 1998 to deal with the fuzzy constraint that was hold at a certain credibility level this approach does not require that all constraints must be strictly satisfied but only be partially satisfied at a given violation probability credibility level for example zhang et al 2015 proposed water management and pollution control schemes based on fuzzy credibility constrained programming to support the allocation of surface water and groundwater li et al 2021 developed an interval fuzzy credibility constrained two level programming model for water resources environment system planning which considers uncertain information through the interval values and fuzzy sets however few studies on the integration of interval multi objective model and fuzzy credibility constrained model have been undertaken to address agricultural and ecological management therefore in response to above concerns this paper presents a credibility based interval multi objective crop area planning model under fuzzy uncertainty it is considered to combine ipp model and fccp model into the mop model to address the problems of constraint violation risk multiple conflicting objectives and system uncertainties the model has the following advantages 1 it solves multi objective problems under interval and fuzzy uncertainty 2 it deals with fuzzy credibility constraints 3 it obtains the relationship between watershed area and ecological discharge flow using interval function through interval regression analysis method 4 it can solve the objectives in the form of interval and fractional interval it will then be applied to minqin county in the lower reaches of the shiyang river basin northwest china to verify the feasibility and practicability of the proposed model the optimal results can help decision makers to weigh the benefits of the system against the risks of violated constraints and thus can provide decision making assistance for the optimization of crop planting of the study area 2 methodology 2 1 interval multi objective programming the mop method can balance various factors and deal with the relationship of multiple objectives in a comprehensive manner however it cannot deal with uncertainties especially the parameter uncertainties due to the existing uncertainty in the real world applications the mop method under uncertainty is a potential way in decision making problems negar et al 2022 the interval multi objective programming imop model is established to effectively coordinate multiple conflicting objectives and resolve interval uncertainties in the study system simultaneously the interval multi objective programming model can usually be expressed as 1a opt f x u f 1 x u f 2 x u f m x u t 1b s t u 1 u a u x u b u x u 0 where m is the number of objective functions u is the number of decision variables represents interval value and is the upper bound and is the lower bound f x is the objective function n is the number of constraints a u b u is the interval coefficient x u is the interval decision variables 2 2 fuzzy credibility constrained programming the fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp is formulated as follows 1c max f j 1 n c j x j c r j 1 n a i j x i j b i τ i i 1 2 n x j 0 j 1 2 n subject to 1d c r j 1 n a i j x i j b i τ i i 1 2 n 1e x j 0 j 1 2 n where x x 1 x n is a vector of non fuzzy decision variables c j a ij are coefficients of objective b i is fuzzy coefficients of constraints i is the number of constraints and j is the number of variables eq 2c is the objective function of the optimization model eq 2d represents that the credibility of constraint should be greater than or equal to credibility level τ i the credibility measure cr is the mean value of the possibility and necessary measures consider one fuzzy variable ξ with membership function μ x where membership function is defined with a triangular fuzzy variable r 1 r 2 r 3 and x is real number the credibility of x ξ is expressed as follows 1f c r x ξ 1 if x r 1 2 r 2 r 1 x 2 r 2 r 1 if r 1 x r 2 x r 3 2 r 2 r 1 if r 2 x r 3 0 if x r 3 in general a meaningful credibility level should be greater than 0 5 therefore according to fuzzy credibility theory for τ k 1g 2 b i b j 1 n a i j x j 2 b i b τ k j 1 n a i j x j b i 1 2 τ k b i b k 1 2 k by substituting this formula into the model the fuzzy credibility constrained programming model is transformed into a linear programming model which can be solved according to the solution method of the linear programming model 2 3 credibility based interval multi objective programming in response to coordinate various factors in water resources management and provide optimal solutions considering the problem of fuzzy violated constraints in the optimization problem under fuzzy conditions a credibility based interval multi objective programming model is developed under uncertainty see fig 1 the model is formulated as follows 1h opt f x u f 1 x u f 2 x u f m x u t c r i 1 i a i x u b i τ i c u x u d u x u 0 where x u is the interval decision variables a i c u d u is the interval coefficient b i is fuzzy coefficients of constraints τ i is a speciﬁed credibility level for fuzzy constraint i 2 4 model solution process to solve the above mentioned optimization model it is necessary to use a reasonable solution to convert it into an interval multi objective model and then convert it into a single objective interval programming model this paper chooses to use the fuzzy solution method based on the zimmermann method to solve the model guo and li 2008 combining solution method of interval linear fractional programming the whole solution process is done by using lingo 14 0 programming the specific steps can be seen in fig 2 3 case study 3 1 study area minqin county is chosen as the study area 101 41 104 16 e 36 29 39 27 n which is located in the northwestern part of gansu province in the northeastern part of the hexi corridor and in the lower reaches of the shiyang river basin fig 3 it is surrounded by the tengger desert and the badain jaran desert in the east west and north it has a temperate continental arid climate with an average annual precipitation of 110 mm and an average annual evaporation of 2646 mm the land is 206 km long from east to west 156 km wide from northwest and has a total area of 15 900 km2 there is no self produced surface runoff in the county and the only surface water source is the shiyang river the grain production in minqin county is mainly based on high quality wheat and maize it is an important commodity grain base county in gansu province there is a total of 3 irrigated areas hongyashan irrigated area changning irrigated area and huanhe irrigated area due to the small rainfall and relatively flat terrain it does not produce normal surface runoff since the constuction of hongyashan reservoir in 1958 most of the surface water from shiyang river into minqin except for a small amount of precipitation supplement is controlled by the reservoir the caiqi hydrological station established in caiqi town is responsible for monitoring the surface water control section of the main stream of shiyang river entering hongyashan reservoir as of december 31 2019 the total runoff of caiqi section passing the station reached 401 million m3 in recent years with the decrease of water supply in the upper reaches of shiyang river and the decline of groundwater level yearly water shortage has gradually become a bottleneck restricting the economic and social development and the contradiction between water supply and demand has become increasingly prominent table 1 presents the amount of groundwater allocation in study area under the serious shortage of water land resources in the study area the phenomena of low agricultural production efficiency and ecological environment deterioration are caused by the unreasonable utilization patterns these problems make the ecological environment of arid region in a state of continuous deterioration which further restricts the development of agriculture therefore it is necessary to carry out both agricultural and ecological management simultaneously qingtu lake is a lake in minqin county which is located in the lower reaches of the shiyang river the water in the lake dried up completely in the 1950 s forming a 13 kilometer long line of sand and wind becoming the largest sand and wind mouth in the northern part of the minqin oasis and the badanjilin desert and tengri desert are surrounded by the lake since the key management of shiyang river basin minqin county has been using sand pressure and afforestation drainage of ecological water and other management measures to increase the ecological restoration and management of the qingtu lake area so that the sanding of the qingtu lake area has been effectively managed effectively blocking the merging of the two deserts of badanjilin and tengri 3 2 data acquisition and calculation in this paper the meteorological and agricultural data of minqin county from 2014 to 2019 were selected and the data required for the study were obtained by referring to kang et al 2009 et max and λ at different developmental stages other data and related parameters are collected from the wuwei city statistical yearbook and related literature table 2 according to the wuwei statistical yearbook 2015 the local surface water price is 0 24 yuan m3 the irrigation water utilization coefficient is 0 55 the groundwater price is 0 26 yuan m3 and the irrigation water utilization coefficient is 0 85 the surface water inflow in hongyashan irrigated area is 6650 7290 10 6 m3 calculated from the inflow volume of caiqi section table 3 presents crop planting and their prices the data of total available surface water and groundwater quantity comes from the allocated water quantity based on the water allocation plan of minqin county and the total available surface water and groundwater are 2 97 10 8 m 3 and 1 16 10 8 m 3 respectively 3 3 modeling formulation due to a series of previously mentioned problems the study area suffers from a series of problems such as suppressed agricultural development and continued ecological damage therefore agricultural and ecological management in the study area is necessary in this study how to balance economic and ecological benefits while planning crop planting for different crops under the condition of interval and fuzzy uncertainties has become a major challenge along with the question of system benefits and risks of constraint violations in addition there are also the contradiction between agricultural and ecological water use the problem of system uncertainty and the problem of interval fractional objective therefore to solve the above problems a credibility based interval multi objective programming model is developed under uncertain conditions as shown below and the objective functions include the maximum of system benefits the maximum land productivity the maximum watershed area of the qingtu lake 3 3 1 objective function 3 3 1 1 objective function 1 maximum of system benefits ecological service value refers to the benefits that humans obtain directly or indirectly from ecosystems which contributes to human well being how to correctly measure the ecological service value as well as benefit from agricultural ecosystem service functions through reasonable agricultural and ecological management challenges both scholars and managers thus the first objective is to maximize system benefits which are composed of economic benefits and ecosystem service values the calculation of ecosystem service value refers to the formula of farmland ecosystem service value proposed by yue et al 2021 the economic benefits are the planting benefits minus the cost of water use when calculating the planting benefits the jensen model water production function is used jensen 1968 as a typical crop water production functions jensen model has advantages of not only reflecting the relationship between crop yields and the water applied during different crop growth stages but also expressing the difference when the same amount of water is supplied following different schedules shangguan et al 2002 guo et al 2014 sadati et al 2014 zhang and guo 2016 yue et al 2018 3a m a x f 1 i i a i b i y m a x j j s w i j g w i j p i j e t m

factor limiting agricultural development thus how to obtain higher land productivity has become a challenge interval linear fractional programming model can handle the above problem reflecting the system efficiency problem of interval form which can be written as follows 3j m a x f 2 f 1 i a i 3 3 1 3 objective function 3 maximum of watershed area of the qingtu lake qingtu lake has important ecological significance blocking the badain jaran desert and the tengger desert from closing in minqin therefore in this study watershed area of the qingtu lake was chosen to represent the ecological benefit interval regression analysis aims to find a mathematical relationship between the dependent and independent variables park and kim 2018 since there is no clear mathematical model to characterize the watershed area of the qingtu lake the interval regression analysis method is used to study the relationship between the ecological discharge in the lower reaches of the shiyang river and the watershed area of the qingtu lake thus an interval linear function between two mutually independent variables i e the watershed area of the qingtu lake and ecological discharge can be estimated the interval linear regression model can be written as 3k y x a o a 1 x 1 a n x n a x where x 1 x 1 x n t is the real input vector a a 0 a n is the interval coefficient vector and y x is the corresponding forecast interval numbers the interval coefficient a i is expressed as a i a i c i where a i is the center value of the interval and c i is the radius of the interval in this study the interval regression analysis method based on quadratic programming was selected it is performed according to the following formula while considering the central trend and possibility of the data

c n t k 1 k 2 are the weights considering the central trend and interval probability respectively when k 1 k 2 the central trend is considered more and the larger the value of k 1 k 2 the more consistent the trend of the obtained regression curve and the deterministic regression curve only considering the trend of the central trend not considering the interval and fuzziness when k 1 k 2 more attention is paid to how to completely include the data points in the obtained interval the larger the value of k 2 k 1 is the more the central trend is ignored when the value of k 2 k 1 increases to a certain value and then increase k 2 k 1 the obtained interval will no longer change in this paper the values of k 1 k 2 are taken as k 1 1 k 2 0 5 and the following regression results are obtained fig 4 table 4 presents annual ecological discharge and corresponding watershed area of the qingtu lake 3n m a x f 3 7 3393 1 0666 0 0092 0 0014 x z w 3o a w x z w i i a i j j s w i j η 1

shown in table 5 4 results analysis and discussion 4 1 optimal solutions of objective function values based on the solution process the parameters were input into the model and the fuzzy coordination method was used to solve the problem table 6 shows the classification of the credibility level zhang et al 2017 the calculation results are shown in table 7 which are the results of the optimal planting area of different crops under different credibility levels in general a meaningful credibility level should be greater than 0 5 the study found that the higher the credibility level the higher the constraint satisfaction of the optimization results an increase in credibility level will result in a greater coefﬁcient of the right hand side constraint thereby generating a relatively increased strictness of constraint in this paper the increase in credibility represents an increase in the availability of surface water within the water availability constraint in addition the higher credibility level means a lower risk level and better reliability therefore the credibility level can be regarded as an evaluation indicator demonstrating how much risk level on optimal results is believable and trustworthy zhang et al 2017 the credibility level of this paper was taken as 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 it can be seen from table 7 that after weighing the three objective functions the priority of crop planting is that sunflower is higher than maize than the other two crops because the upper limit of the planting area of sunflower has always been at the maximum of its planting area constraint 13266 7 hm2 while the planting areas of wheat and seed melon have always been at the minimum of their planting area constraints which are 3720 0 hm2 and 186 7 hm2 respectively in addition the lower limit of the maize planting area is also at the minimum of its planting area constraint 9073 3 hm2 only the upper limit of the maize planting area and the lower limit of the sunflower planting area change with the credibility level a higher level of credibility means an increase in system reliability and a lower risk of constraint violations whereas a lower level of credibility means a higher risk of system violations and lower reliability it can be seen from fig 5 that the upper limit of the total planting area of crops increases with the increase of the credibility level and the lower limit of the total planting area of crops shows a downward trend from the calculation results it can be seen that the changes of the upper and lower limits of the total planting area are caused by the change of the upper limit of the maize planting area and the change of the lower limit of the sunflower planting area respectively 4 2 benefits analysis fig 6 shows the economic benefits under different credibility levels after optimization which are the planting benefits minus the water cost and it can be concluded that the economic benefits show a downward trend as the credibility levels increase fig 7 shows the system benefits which contains economic benefits and ecological service value under different credibility levels after optimization and its changing trend is very similar to the economic benefits it shows a downward trend with the increase of the credibility level which means that the system benefits are mainly affected by the economic benefits fig 8 shows the land productivity under different credibility levels after optimization it can be concluded that the land productivity decreases with the increase of the credibility level the reason for the above results is that a lower credibility level represents a higher risk of system violations and lower reliability and from a constraint point of view represents more surface water availability and therefore higher system benefits and economic benefits can be obtained consequently managers can select an appropriate level of credibility according to their own risk preferences to achieve different emphasis on system benefits and risks 4 3 analysis on the optimal results of watershed area it can be seen from fig 9 that the watershed area of the qingtu lake increases with the increase of the credibility level when the credibility level is 0 9 0 8 0 7 and 0 6 the watershed area of the qingtu lake is 11 92 42 12 km2 11 87 41 74 km2 11 82 41 37 km2 and 11 77 41 01 km2 respectively the reason for this result is that from the interval linear function obtained it can be concluded that there is a positive correlation between ecological discharge and the watershed area and a lower level of credibility level represents a higher amount of available surface water which will lead to a corresponding reduction in the amount of ecological discharge in the qingtu lake resulting in a reduction in the watershed area of the qingtu lake 4 4 comparison with completely satisfied constraint when the credibility level is 1 0 it indicates that the model constraints are fully satisfied and the results are shown in table 8 at this time there is no risk of constraint violations in the model but the benefits obtained are much lower there the decision maker should weigh the system benefits and violation risks according to the actual conditions to choose the credibility level in addition compared with the results of different credibility level a variety of different scenarios are generated for comparison which shows that the fccp model can generate and obtain more feasible solutions and flexible solutions which is convenient for decision analysis support 4 5 comparison with single objective models to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the multi objective programming model two single objective models were established with economic benefit and ecological service value as the objective functions respectively and were solved with the same constraints as the multi objective model the optimal results obtained by the multi objective model with a credibility level of 0 9 are compared with the results obtained by the single objective model and the comparison results are shown in table 9 it can be seen from table 9 that when solving the single objective optimization model with economic benefits as the objective function the obtained results are that the planting areas of maize melon and sunflower are the maximum values of the corresponding planting area constraints which are 10220 0 hm2 1513 3 hm2 and 132667 7 hm2 respectively the results show that maize melon seeds and sunflowers have great economic benefits when solving the single objective optimization model with ecological service value as the objective function the result obtained is that the planting area of wheat is the maximum value of its planting area constraint 5173 3 hm2 while the planting areas of seed melon and sunflower are the minimum value of their planting area constraints 186 7 hm2 and 8773 3 hm2 respectively the results show that the priority of planting should be that wheat is higher than maize than the other two crops from an ecological point of view the result obtained by solving the multi objective optimization model is the result of combining two single objective optimization models the planting priority is that sunflower is higher than maize than the other two crops the reason for obtaining the above results is that one objective function of the multi objective function is the system income which is composed of economic benefits and ecological service value and the magnitude of economic benefits is greater than the ecological service value therefore the results obtained by the multi objective optimization model are more inclined to sunflower with greater economic benefits and maize with good economic benefits and ecological service values besides a single objective optimization model was established with the system benefits and watershed area of the qingtu lake as the objective functions and the same constraints as the multi objective model were used to solve the problem the optimal results obtained by the multi objective model with a credibility level of 0 9 are compared with the results obtained by the single objective model the comparison results are shown in table 10 it can be seen from table 10 that when the objective function is the system benefits all surface water is used for irrigation and the ecological discharge is 0 m3 which means the watershed area of the qingtu lake is 0 km2 when the objective function is the watershed area of the qingtu lake after satisfying different constraints all the remaining surface water will be drained to the qingtu lake to obtain the largest watershed area of the qingtu lake 17 54 66 06 km2 the multi objective optimization model can well balance the weights between the two objective functions so that its results are between the results of the two single objective optimization models therefore compared with the single objective model the multi objective programming model can consider the different objectives of the decision maker thereby providing more comprehensive decision support 5 conclusions in this study a credibility based interval multi objective crop area planning model for agricultural and ecological management under uncertainty was developed which was used for the optimization of crop planting in minqin county in the lower reaches of the shiyang river basin the model extends interval multi objective programming and constraint violation scenarios and considers to use fuzzy credibility constraint programming to solve fuzzy violated risk problems with credibility the results obtained at different credibility levels can help managers gain an in depth understanding of systematic uncertainty and make relevant decisions based on actual conditions a lower credibility level represents a higher risk of system violations and lower reliability as the credibility level increases from 0 6 to 0 9 the system benefits decrease from 9 89 13 87 108 yuan to 9 86 13 81 108 yuan and the watershed area of the qingtu lake also increases from 11 77 41 01 km2 to 11 92 42 12 km2 when the credibility level is 1 0 which indicates that the model constraints are fully satisfied the economic benefit is 8 01 11 69 108 yuan and the ecological benefit is 1 84 2 01 108 yuan the calculation results of the comprehensive model and the actual situation can be concluded that the optimization model of planting area can better balance the regional economic benefits and ecological benefits and can promote regional economic and ecological benefits on the basis of ensuring grain production and water saving the model can be combined with actual operations to optimize the planting area and provide decision support for agricultural and ecological management in arid areas moreover the globally practical implications of application are that the interval regression analysis can be used not only for analyzing the relationship between water discharge and watershed area but also for other management studies nevertheless this study does not consider the spatial variability including the selection of data from meteorological stations with fixed points etc the application of remote sensing can remedy this problem therefore the future work should consider the integration of remote sensing data declaration of competing interest the

fuzzy uncertainties it focuses on crop area optimization with the interval objective function of maximizing the system benefits maximizing the watershed area and fractional interval objective function of maximizing the land productivity i e system benefits per unit area additionally the relationship between watershed area and ecological discharge is expressed as interval linear function which is estimated by using interval regression analysis method then the model is applied to a case study in minqin county in the lower reaches of shiyang river basin for crop area optimization in view of the increasing shortage of water resources and the competition between agricultural and ecological water use optimal solutions for different scenarios can be generated based on fuzzy credibility constraints when the predefined credibility levels are set as 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 0 9 respectively the results show that the crop area optimization model can better balance the regional agricultural and ecological benefits while ensuring grain production and promoting water saving moreover a higher level of credibility corresponds to a lower system benefit but a larger watershed area when credibility level is raised from 0 6 to 0 9 the upper bounds of system benefits are decreased from 13 87 10 8 yuan to 13 81 10 8 yuan whereas the watershed area is increased from 41 01 km2 to 42 12 km2 these various optimal results can help decision makers weigh system benefits and constraint violation risks therefore the results of the model can provide decision making basis for the crop area optimization and provide valuable basis for the sustainable development in minqin county and similar study areas keywords interval multi objective programming credibility ecological management crop area planning uncertainty 1 introduction water land resources are the basic natural conditions and indispensable factors to ensure agricultural production food security and human life china is a big agricultural country and the agricultural water consumption is 361 24 billion m3 accounting for 62 1 of the total water consumption china water resources bulletin 2020 of which irrigation water consumption accounts for more than 90 of the total agricultural water consumption irrigation is essential to sustain agricultural production and unreasonable irrigation will have an undesirable effect on crop yield and cause a waste of water resources thereby leading to a decrease in water productivity zhang et al 2022 however the average utilization rate of irrigation water is 0 565 in china china water resources bulletin 2020 the arable land area of china is 130 million hm2 and the per capita arable land area is merely 0 106 hm2 which is less than half of the world average besides the unreasonable utilization patterns of water land resources have led to a series of problems such as low agricultural production efficiency and ecological environment deterioration chebil et al 2022 moreover the booming development of industry has turned water use for agricultural production and ecological conservation into industrial growth which makes the contradiction between agricultural and ecological water use increasingly serious zhang et al 2021 such problems are particularly prominent in the arid regions of northwest china therefore how to solve the problem of water shortage improve agricultural water use efficiency and rationally allocate irrigation water are the core of sustainable development of future water resources management jacobs et al 2016 the optimal allocation of agricultural land resources refers to the rational allocation of arable land resources in a specific area by using scientific technologies and management methods to achieve certain social economic and ecological goals tang et al 2015 the adjustment of agricultural planting structure is the goal of optimal allocation of agricultural land resources especially in arid irrigation districts when water scarcity occurs water managers are required to make decisions about what land has higher priority and how to effectively allocate limited water resources razavitoosi and samani 2016 luo et al 2021 therefore optimal allocation of agricultural land resources in this paper mainly considers the crop area optimization the optimization crop area can promote optimal allocation of water resources and alleviate the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources thus enabling the sustainable development of agriculture for example galán martín et al 2015 presented a decision support tool based on a multi stage linear programming whose objective function is the maximum net present value of the farmer s net return fazlali and shourian 2018 proposed the coupled shuffle frog leaping optimization algorithm network flow programming model the objective function is to maximize the total net benefit gained from crops production where the decision variables are the irrigation depths and the cultivation areas are optimized zhang et al 2018 presented an inexact robust two stage mixed integer linear programming approach for crop area planning under uncertainty whose objective function is the maximum system benefits however the above studies did not consider the multi objective problems in practical problems it is usually required to optimize several conflicting objectives simultaneously for example the objective function with the maximum economic benefits and the maximum ecological benefits thus multi objective programming mop models and corresponding solving methods have been developed to coordinate different objectives in optimization process baky et al 2013 lachhwani 2014 lence et al 2017 ren et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 therefore to avoid the drawbacks that the water resources optimization model simply pursues economic goals many studies have introduced mop method into optimal allocation of water resources li et al 2019 developed a stochastic multi objective model for the allocation of resources toward the sustainable management of agricultural water food and energy nexus under uncertainty lalehzari and kerachian 2021 developed a multi objective optimization model under limited water conditions when water soil atmosphere and crop relationships are simultaneously considered moudi et al 2021 developed a dynamic multi objective model of water supply optimization under different scenarios to improve multisectoral consumer satisfaction saeid et al 2021 used nsga ii multi objective optimization algorithm for allocation of surface water and groundwater between agricultural and environmental sectors considering social standards economic efficiency and environmental sustainability the mop method can coordinate various factors in water resources management and provide optimal solutions furthermore when the input parameters cannot be expressed as deterministic values interval parameter programming ipp is introduced into optimization problems to deal with imprecise parameters expressed as interval numbers with upper and lower bounds but unknown probability distributions or membership functions such as market prices agricultural inputs and crop related parameters zhang et al 2020 for instance zhang et al 2019 developed an interval multi objective model of irrigation water management considering the conditions of canal system and optimized three objectives of economic benefits canal water seepage and water allocation in multiple irrigation districts were to be optimized ren et al 2021 developed an improved interval multi objectives programming method while maximum economic benefit and minimum energy consumption were regarded as desired objectives pan et al 2022 established an interval multi objective nonlinear programming model with the objectives of minimum water loss during irrigation maximum net crop benefits maximum yields of main grain crops maximum ecological vegetation benefits and irrigation water balance of each decision making unit to solve agricultural and ecological water allocation problems in irrigated areas under uncertainty however the above studies cannot deal with violated constraint problems especially under a fuzzy environment a key issue in environmental and agricultural management is to tackle the vague parametric information credibility theory is useful for dealing with fuzzy uncertainty and constraint violation issues due to its self duality and convenient computational process generally fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp was proposed by liu and iwamura 1998 to deal with the fuzzy constraint that was hold at a certain credibility level this approach does not require that all constraints must be strictly satisfied but only be partially satisfied at a given violation probability credibility level for example zhang et al 2015 proposed water management and pollution control schemes based on fuzzy credibility constrained programming to support the allocation of surface water and groundwater li et al 2021 developed an interval fuzzy credibility constrained two level programming model for water resources environment system planning which considers uncertain information through the interval values and fuzzy sets however few studies on the integration of interval multi objective model and fuzzy credibility constrained model have been undertaken to address agricultural and ecological management therefore in response to above concerns this paper presents a credibility based interval multi objective crop area planning model under fuzzy uncertainty it is considered to combine ipp model and fccp model into the mop model to address the problems of constraint violation risk multiple conflicting objectives and system uncertainties the model has the following advantages 1 it solves multi objective problems under interval and fuzzy uncertainty 2 it deals with fuzzy credibility constraints 3 it obtains the relationship between watershed area and ecological discharge flow using interval function through interval regression analysis method 4 it can solve the objectives in the form of interval and fractional interval it will then be applied to minqin county in the lower reaches of the shiyang river basin northwest china to verify the feasibility and practicability of the proposed model the optimal results can help decision makers to weigh the benefits of the system against the risks of violated constraints and thus can provide decision making assistance for the optimization of crop planting of the study area 2 methodology 2 1 interval multi objective programming the mop method can balance various factors and deal with the relationship of multiple objectives in a comprehensive manner however it cannot deal with uncertainties especially the parameter uncertainties due to the existing uncertainty in the real world applications the mop method under uncertainty is a potential way in decision making problems negar et al 2022 the interval multi objective programming imop model is established to effectively coordinate multiple conflicting objectives and resolve interval uncertainties in the study system simultaneously the interval multi objective programming model can usually be expressed as 1a opt f x u f 1 x u f 2 x u f m x u t 1b s t u 1 u a u x u b u x u 0 where m is the number of objective functions u is the number of decision variables represents interval value and is the upper bound and is the lower bound f x is the objective function n is the number of constraints a u b u is the interval coefficient x u is the interval decision variables 2 2 fuzzy credibility constrained programming the fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp is formulated as follows 1c max f j 1 n c j x j c r j 1 n a i j x i j b i τ i i 1 2 n x j 0 j 1 2 n subject to 1d c r j 1 n a i j x i j b i τ i i 1 2 n 1e x j 0 j 1 2 n where x x 1 x n is a vector of non fuzzy decision variables c j a ij are coefficients of objective b i is fuzzy coefficients of constraints i is the number of constraints and j is the number of variables eq 2c is the objective function of the optimization model eq 2d represents that the credibility of constraint should be greater than or equal to credibility level τ i the credibility measure cr is the mean value of the possibility and necessary measures consider one fuzzy variable ξ with membership function μ x where membership function is defined with a triangular fuzzy variable r 1 r 2 r 3 and x is real number the credibility of x ξ is expressed as follows 1f c r x ξ 1 if x r 1 2 r 2 r 1 x 2 r 2 r 1 if r 1 x r 2 x r 3 2 r 2 r 1 if r 2 x r 3 0 if x r 3 in general a meaningful credibility level should be greater than 0 5 therefore according to fuzzy credibility theory for τ k 1g 2 b i b j 1 n a i j x j 2 b i b τ k j 1 n a i j x j b i 1 2 τ k b i b k 1 2 k by substituting this formula into the model the fuzzy credibility constrained programming model is transformed into a linear programming model which can be solved according to the solution method of the linear programming model 2 3 credibility based interval multi objective programming in response to coordinate various factors in water resources management and provide optimal solutions considering the problem of fuzzy violated constraints in the optimization problem under fuzzy conditions a credibility based interval multi objective programming model is developed under uncertainty see fig 1 the model is formulated as follows 1h opt f x u f 1 x u f 2 x u f m x u t c r i 1 i a i x u b i τ i c u x u d u x u 0 where x u is the interval decision variables a i c u d u is the interval coefficient b i is fuzzy coefficients of constraints τ i is a speciﬁed credibility level for fuzzy constraint i 2 4 model solution process to solve the above mentioned optimization model it is necessary to use a reasonable solution to convert it into an interval multi objective model and then convert it into a single objective interval programming model this paper chooses to use the fuzzy solution method based on the zimmermann method to solve the model guo and li 2008 combining solution method of interval linear fractional programming the whole solution process is done by using lingo 14 0 programming the specific steps can be seen in fig 2 3 case study 3 1 study area minqin county is chosen as the study area 101 41 104 16 e 36 29 39 27 n which is located in the northwestern part of gansu province in the northeastern part of the hexi corridor and in the lower reaches of the shiyang river basin fig 3 it is surrounded by the tengger desert and the badain jaran desert in the east west and north it has a temperate continental arid climate with an average annual precipitation of 110 mm and an average annual evaporation of 2646 mm the land is 206 km long from east to west 156 km wide from northwest and has a total area of 15 900 km2 there is no self produced surface runoff in the county and the only surface water source is the shiyang river the grain production in minqin county is mainly based on high quality wheat and maize it is an important commodity grain base county in gansu province there is a total of 3 irrigated areas hongyashan irrigated area changning irrigated area and huanhe irrigated area due to the small rainfall and relatively flat terrain it does not produce normal surface runoff since the constuction of hongyashan reservoir in 1958 most of the surface water from shiyang river into minqin except for a small amount of precipitation supplement is controlled by the reservoir the caiqi hydrological station established in caiqi town is responsible for monitoring the surface water control section of the main stream of shiyang river entering hongyashan reservoir as of december 31 2019 the total runoff of caiqi section passing the station reached 401 million m3 in recent years with the decrease of water supply in the upper reaches of shiyang river and the decline of groundwater level yearly water shortage has gradually become a bottleneck restricting the economic and social development and the contradiction between water supply and demand has become increasingly prominent table 1 presents the amount of groundwater allocation in study area under the serious shortage of water land resources in the study area the phenomena of low agricultural production efficiency and ecological environment deterioration are caused by the unreasonable utilization patterns these problems make the ecological environment of arid region in a state of continuous deterioration which further restricts the development of agriculture therefore it is necessary to carry out both agricultural and ecological management simultaneously qingtu lake is a lake in minqin county which is located in the lower reaches of the shiyang river the water in the lake dried up completely in the 1950 s forming a 13 kilometer long line of sand and wind becoming the largest sand and wind mouth in the northern part of the minqin oasis and the badanjilin desert and tengri desert are surrounded by the lake since the key management of shiyang river basin minqin county has been using sand pressure and afforestation drainage of ecological water and other management measures to increase the ecological restoration and management of the qingtu lake area so that the sanding of the qingtu lake area has been effectively managed effectively blocking the merging of the two deserts of badanjilin and tengri 3 2 data acquisition and calculation in this paper the meteorological and agricultural data of minqin county from 2014 to 2019 were selected and the data required for the study were obtained by referring to kang et al 2009 et max and λ at different developmental stages other data and related parameters are collected from the wuwei city statistical yearbook and related literature table 2 according to the wuwei statistical yearbook 2015 the local surface water price is 0 24 yuan m3 the irrigation water utilization coefficient is 0 55 the groundwater price is 0 26 yuan m3 and the irrigation water utilization coefficient is 0 85 the surface water inflow in hongyashan irrigated area is 6650 7290 10 6 m3 calculated from the inflow volume of caiqi section table 3 presents crop planting and their prices the data of total available surface water and groundwater quantity comes from the allocated water quantity based on the water allocation plan of minqin county and the total available surface water and groundwater are 2 97 10 8 m 3 and 1 16 10 8 m 3 respectively 3 3 modeling formulation due to a series of previously mentioned problems the study area suffers from a series of problems such as suppressed agricultural development and continued ecological damage therefore agricultural and ecological management in the study area is necessary in this study how to balance economic and ecological benefits while planning crop planting for different crops under the condition of interval and fuzzy uncertainties has become a major challenge along with the question of system benefits and risks of constraint violations in addition there are also the contradiction between agricultural and ecological water use the problem of system uncertainty and the problem of interval fractional objective therefore to solve the above problems a credibility based interval multi objective programming model is developed under uncertain conditions as shown below and the objective functions include the maximum of system benefits the maximum land productivity the maximum watershed area of the qingtu lake 3 3 1 objective function 3 3 1 1 objective function 1 maximum of system benefits ecological service value refers to the benefits that humans obtain directly or indirectly from ecosystems which contributes to human well being how to correctly measure the ecological service value as well as benefit from agricultural ecosystem service functions through reasonable agricultural and ecological management challenges both scholars and managers thus the first objective is to maximize system benefits which are composed of economic benefits and ecosystem service values the calculation of ecosystem service value refers to the formula of farmland ecosystem service value proposed by yue et al 2021 the economic benefits are the planting benefits minus the cost of water use when calculating the planting benefits the jensen model water production function is used jensen 1968 as a typical crop water production functions jensen model has advantages of not only reflecting the relationship between crop yields and the water applied during different crop growth stages but also expressing the difference when the same amount of water is supplied following different schedules shangguan et al 2002 guo et al 2014 sadati et al 2014 zhang and guo 2016 yue et al 2018 3a m a x f 1 i i a i b i y m a x j j s w i j g w i j p i j e t m

factor limiting agricultural development thus how to obtain higher land productivity has become a challenge interval linear fractional programming model can handle the above problem reflecting the system efficiency problem of interval form which can be written as follows 3j m a x f 2 f 1 i a i 3 3 1 3 objective function 3 maximum of watershed area of the qingtu lake qingtu lake has important ecological significance blocking the badain jaran desert and the tengger desert from closing in minqin therefore in this study watershed area of the qingtu lake was chosen to represent the ecological benefit interval regression analysis aims to find a mathematical relationship between the dependent and independent variables park and kim 2018 since there is no clear mathematical model to characterize the watershed area of the qingtu lake the interval regression analysis method is used to study the relationship between the ecological discharge in the lower reaches of the shiyang river and the watershed area of the qingtu lake thus an interval linear function between two mutually independent variables i e the watershed area of the qingtu lake and ecological discharge can be estimated the interval linear regression model can be written as 3k y x a o a 1 x 1 a n x n a x where x 1 x 1 x n t is the real input vector a a 0 a n is the interval coefficient vector and y x is the corresponding forecast interval numbers the interval coefficient a i is expressed as a i a i c i where a i is the center value of the interval and c i is the radius of the interval in this study the interval regression analysis method based on quadratic programming was selected it is performed according to the following formula while considering the central trend and possibility of the data tanaka and lee 1998 3l m i n a c j k 1 j 1 p y j a t x j 2 k 2 j 1 p c t x j x j t c subject to 3m a t x j c t x j y j a t x j c t x j y j j 1 p c i 0 i 1 n where x j 1 x j 1 x j n t a a 0 a n t c c 0 c n t k 1 k 2 are the weights considering the central trend and interval probability respectively when k 1 k 2 the central trend is considered more and the larger the value of k 1 k 2 the more consistent the trend of the obtained regression curve and the deterministic regression curve only considering the trend of the central trend not considering the interval and fuzziness when k 1 k 2 more attention is paid to how to completely include the data points in the obtained interval the larger the value of k 2 k 1 is the more the central trend is ignored when the value of k 2 k 1 increases to a certain value and then increase k 2 k 1 the obtained interval will no longer change in this paper the values of k 1 k 2 are taken as k 1 1 k 2 0 5 and the following regression results are obtained fig 4 table 4 presents annual ecological discharge and corresponding watershed area of the qingtu lake 3n m a x f 3 7 3393 1 0666 0 0092 0 0014 x z w 3o a w x z w i i a i j j s w i j η 1

shown in table 5 4 results analysis and discussion 4 1 optimal solutions of objective function values based on the solution process the parameters were input into the model and the fuzzy coordination method was used to solve the problem table 6 shows the classification of the credibility level zhang et al 2017 the calculation results are shown in table 7 which are the results of the optimal planting area of different crops under different credibility levels in general a meaningful credibility level should be greater than 0 5 the study found that the higher the credibility level the higher the constraint satisfaction of the optimization results an increase in credibility level will result in a greater coefﬁcient of the right hand side constraint thereby generating a relatively increased strictness of constraint in this paper the increase in credibility represents an increase in the availability of surface water within the water availability constraint in addition the higher credibility level means a lower risk level and better reliability therefore the credibility level can be regarded as an evaluation indicator demonstrating how much risk level on optimal results is believable and trustworthy zhang et al 2017 the credibility level of this paper was taken as 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 it can be seen from table 7 that after weighing the three objective functions the priority of crop planting is that sunflower is higher than maize than the other two crops because the upper limit of the planting area of sunflower has always been at the maximum of its planting area constraint 13266 7 hm2 while the planting areas of wheat and seed melon have always been at the minimum of their planting area constraints which are 3720 0 hm2 and 186 7 hm2 respectively in addition the lower limit of the maize planting area is also at the minimum of its planting area constraint 9073 3 hm2 only the upper limit of the maize planting area and the lower limit of the sunflower planting area change with the credibility level a higher level of credibility means an increase in system reliability and a lower risk of constraint violations whereas a lower level of credibility means a higher risk of system violations and lower reliability it can be seen from fig 5 that the upper limit of the total planting area of crops increases with the increase of the credibility level and the lower limit of the total planting area of crops shows a downward trend from the calculation results it can be seen that the changes of the upper and lower limits of the total planting area are caused by the change of the upper limit of the maize planting area and the change of the lower limit of the sunflower planting area respectively 4 2 benefits analysis fig 6 shows the economic benefits under different credibility levels after optimization which are the planting benefits minus the water cost and it can be concluded that the economic benefits show a downward trend as the credibility levels increase fig 7 shows the system benefits which contains economic benefits and ecological service value under different credibility levels after optimization and its changing trend is very similar to the economic benefits it shows a downward trend with the increase of the credibility level which means that the system benefits are mainly affected by the economic benefits fig 8 shows the land productivity under different credibility levels after optimization it can be concluded that the land productivity decreases with the increase of the credibility level the reason for the above results is that a lower credibility level represents a higher risk of system violations and lower reliability and from a constraint point of view represents more surface water availability and therefore higher system benefits and economic benefits can be obtained consequently managers can select an appropriate level of credibility according to their own risk preferences to achieve different emphasis on system benefits and risks 4 3 analysis on the optimal results of watershed area it can be seen from fig 9 that the watershed area of the qingtu lake increases with the increase of the credibility level when the credibility level is 0 9 0 8 0 7 and 0 6 the watershed area of the qingtu lake is 11 92 42 12 km2 11 87 41 74 km2 11 82 41 37 km2 and 11 77 41 01 km2 respectively the reason for this result is that from the interval linear function obtained it can be concluded that there is a positive correlation between ecological discharge and the watershed area and a lower level of credibility level represents a higher amount of available surface water which will lead to a corresponding reduction in the amount of ecological discharge in the qingtu lake resulting in a reduction in the watershed area of the qingtu lake 4 4 comparison with completely satisfied constraint when the credibility level is 1 0 it indicates that the model constraints are fully satisfied and the results are shown in table 8 at this time there is no risk of constraint violations in the model but the benefits obtained are much lower there the decision maker should weigh the system benefits and violation risks according to the actual conditions to choose the credibility level in addition compared with the results of different credibility level a variety of different scenarios are generated for comparison which shows that the fccp model can generate and obtain more feasible solutions and flexible solutions which is convenient for decision analysis support 4 5 comparison with single objective models to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the multi objective programming model two single objective models were established with economic benefit and ecological service value as the objective functions respectively and were solved with the same constraints as the multi objective model the optimal results obtained by the multi objective model with a credibility level of 0 9 are compared with the results obtained by the single objective model and the comparison results are shown in table 9 it can be seen from table 9 that when solving the single objective optimization model with economic benefits as the objective function the obtained results are that the planting areas of maize melon and sunflower are the maximum values of the corresponding planting area constraints which are 10220 0 hm2 1513 3 hm2 and 132667 7 hm2 respectively the results show that maize melon seeds and sunflowers have great economic benefits when solving the single objective optimization model with ecological service value as the objective function the result obtained is that the planting area of wheat is the maximum value of its planting area constraint 5173 3 hm2 while the planting areas of seed melon and sunflower are the minimum value of their planting area constraints 186 7 hm2 and 8773 3 hm2 respectively the results show that the priority of planting should be that wheat is higher than maize than the other two crops from an ecological point of view the result obtained by solving the multi objective optimization model is the result of combining two single objective optimization models the planting priority is that sunflower is higher than maize than the other two crops the reason for obtaining the above results is that one objective function of the multi objective function is the system income which is composed of economic benefits and ecological service value and the magnitude of economic benefits is greater than the ecological service value therefore the results obtained by the multi objective optimization model are more inclined to sunflower with greater economic benefits and maize with good economic benefits and ecological service values besides a single objective optimization model was established with the system benefits and watershed area of the qingtu lake as the objective functions and the same constraints as the multi objective model were used to solve the problem the optimal results obtained by the multi objective model with a credibility level of 0 9 are compared with the results obtained by the single objective model the comparison results are shown in table 10 it can be seen from table 10 that when the objective function is the system benefits all surface water is used for irrigation and the ecological discharge is 0 m3 which means the watershed area of the qingtu lake is 0 km2 when the objective function is the watershed area of the qingtu lake after satisfying different constraints all the remaining surface water will be drained to the qingtu lake to obtain the largest watershed area of the qingtu lake 17 54 66 06 km2 the multi objective optimization model can well balance the weights between the two objective functions so that its results are between the results of the two single objective optimization models therefore compared with the single objective model the multi objective programming model can consider the different objectives of the decision maker thereby providing more comprehensive decision support 5 conclusions in this study a credibility based interval multi objective crop area planning model for agricultural and ecological management under uncertainty was developed which was used for the optimization of crop planting in minqin county in the lower reaches of the shiyang river basin the model extends interval multi objective programming and constraint violation scenarios and considers to use fuzzy credibility constraint programming to solve fuzzy violated risk problems with credibility the results obtained at different credibility levels can help managers gain an in depth understanding of systematic uncertainty and make relevant decisions based on actual conditions a lower credibility level represents a higher risk of system violations and lower reliability as the credibility level increases from 0 6 to 0 9 the system benefits decrease from 9 89 13 87 108 yuan to 9 86 13 81 108 yuan and the watershed area of the qingtu lake also increases from 11 77 41 01 km2 to 11 92 42 12 km2 when the credibility level is 1 0 which indicates that the model constraints are fully satisfied the economic benefit is 8 01 11 69 108 yuan and the ecological benefit is 1 84 2 01 108 yuan the calculation results of the comprehensive model and the actual situation can be concluded that the optimization model of planting area can better balance the regional economic benefits and ecological benefits and can promote regional economic and ecological benefits on the basis of ensuring grain production and water saving the model can be combined with actual operations to optimize the planting area and provide decision support for agricultural and ecological management in arid areas moreover the globally practical implications of application are that the interval regression analysis can be used not only for analyzing the relationship between water discharge and watershed area but also for other management studies nevertheless this study does not consider the spatial variability including the selection of data from meteorological stations with fixed points etc the application of remote sensing can remedy this problem therefore the future work should consider the integration of remote sensing data declaration of competing interest the

that the mean annual gpp et and wue ranged from 1426 61 1896 05 g c m 2 607 05 805 83 mm and 2 22 2 68 g c kg 1 h2o respectively at the daily time scale gpp and et responded significantly and positively to variations in air temperature ta water vapor pressure deficit vpd and net radiation rn in both the pruning season and late growing season but daily wue had a significantly negative response to variations in ta vpd and rn rn was identified as the dominant factor in regulating gpp and et during both the pruning season and late growing season while the dominant factor controlling daily variations in wue was vpd during the pruning season and ta during the late growing season such results were mainly due to the divergent responses of carbon assimilation and water loss to different environmental variations and management strategies these findings highlighted the importance of understanding the coupled processes between carbon assimilation and water loss in tea plantations keywords tea plantation eddy covariance gross primary productivity evapotranspiration water use efficiency 1 introduction carbon and water fluxes are tightly coupled through the stomata in terrestrial ecosystems and are considerably important properties of ecosystem processes and functions liu et al 2017 singh et al 2014 tan et al 2015 wue the ratio of carbon assimilation to water loss has been used as a key integrated ecophysiological indicator in hydrological and ecology studies as it reflects the coupled relationship between carbon and water cycles from leaf to ecosystem levels singh et al 2014 tong et al 2014 yu et al 2008 at the ecosystem level wue is commonly defined as the ratio of gross primary productivity gpp to evapotranspiration et and these two parameters can be estimated simultaneously by the eddy covariance ec method baldocchi 2003 law et al 2002 the ecosystem wue is effective because it indicates the water use strategy and adaptability to climate change of plants in different environments lin et al 2018 xie et al 2016 and can be used to assess the effect of water resources on terrestrial ecosystem carbon sinks tong et al 2014 moreover because wue is an important functional indicator it has become the key parameter of some models for simulating ecosystem production tang et al 2006 zhou et al 2015 understanding the impact of environmental and management factors on wue is critically important for assessing the response of ecosystems to global climatic change and optimizing water and carbon management strategies to suit local climatic conditions theoretically any controlling factors of both gpp and et can affect wue previous studies have shown that at the ecosystem level wue is mainly controlled by both environmental factors and physiological factors such as air temperature ta net radiation rn vapor pressure deficit vpd soil water content swc precipitation stomatal conductance gc and leaf area index lai li et al 2015 liu et al 2017 tong et al 2014 wang et al 2018b unlike the regulatory mechanism at the leaf scale the ecosystem wue combines photosynthesis respiration evaporation and transpiration processes and has a much more complicated regulatory mechanism li et al 2015 moreover management practices such as mulching and fertilization affect the soil water and nutrient supply and hence the gpp et and wue of croplands and plantations ali et al 2018 liu et al 2016 however the magnitude and direction of the response of gpp et and wue to these environmental factors and management practices might be different or even opposite li et al 2018 found that radiation exerted a stronger positive effect on et than gpp resulting in a negative response of wue across biomes the different responses deeply reflect the complexity of gpp et and wue variability and their underlying mechanisms tea is an intensively managed evergreen broadleaved shrub widely planted in hilly areas in tropical and subtropical regions as an important cash crop in china tea plantations covered approximately 3 11 106 ha in 2019 national bureau of statistics of china 2020 and are still rapidly expanding especially in the hilly region of southeast china however the impact of tea plantations on carbon assimilation and water loss has been poorly studied li et al 2011 lv et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 the management practices of tea plantations especially pruning influence carbon and water dynamics gpp was suppressed by pruning while respiration was enhanced resulting in a carbon source during the pruning season pang et al 2019 et was impacted by a low leaf area index through its effect on canopy surface conductance and decreased 36 73 48 32 after pruning practice lv et al 2013 geng et al 2020 however few studies have clarified the seasonal divergence of gpp et and wue of tea plantations and their response to environmental factors and management practices an improved understanding of seasonally different behaviors of ecosystem wue and its key controlling variables is important for optimal tea plantation management and assessing the impact of expanding tea plantations on regional hydrology and ecosystem functioning in this study the co2 and water vapor flux between tea plantations and the atmosphere was measured by the ec technique over a five year period 2014 2018 in the subtropical hilly area of southeast china the specific objectives were as follows 1 to analyze the seasonal and interannual variations in gpp et and wue in a subtropical tea plantation and 2 to reveal the response patterns of tea plantation wue to environmental variables and management practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a tea plantation was studied at tianmuhu station 31 16 14 n 119 27 15 e a field

reichstein et al 2005 5 data gaps were filled using the gap filling procedure of falge et al 2001 short meteorological data gaps less than 2 h were filled by the linear interpolation method and longer meteorological data gaps were filled using the nonlinear regression method and 6 nee was partitioned into gpp and er based on the methods of reichstein et al 2005 additional information on data processing is described in detail in yu et al 2006 after data quality control and the gap filling procedure the full time series flux data were summed to obtain daily monthly and annual scales of gpp and et 2 4 calculation of water use efficiency wue is defined as the amount of carbon assimilation per unit of water loss from transpiration baldocchi 1994 farquhar et al 1982 the direct measurements of carbon and water exchange using ec technology make it possible to examine wue at the ecosystem level beer et al 2009 the ecosystem wue can be calculated as follows w u e g p p e t where et is evapotranspiration kg h2o m 2 which comprise of plant transpiration and soil water evaporation and can be measured directly by the ec system gpp is gross ecosystem primary productivity g c m 2 which can be expressed as g p p n e e r e where nee is the net ecosystem co2 exchange g c m 2 which can be measured directly by the ec system re is the total ecosystem respiration and can be estimated through soil temperature and soil volumetric water content yu et al 2006 2 5 statistical analysis intense pruning will inhibit co2 assimilation and promote respiration pang et al 2019 we defined april through june with monthly re gpp 1 0 as the pruning season and july through october as the late growing season a boosted regression trees brt analysis was conducted to investigate the environmental controls and their relative influence on gpp et and wue during the pruning season and late growing season at daily time scales the main environmental variables we examined were ta vpd swc rn and lai the brt analyses were performed using the brt package in r 3 results 3 1 seasonal variation in environmental factors the seasonal patterns of daily air temperature ta soil temperature ts vapor pressure deficit vpd net radiation rn soil water content swc and precipitation p during 2014 2018 are shown in fig 1 the air temperature and precipitation followed the typical seasonal trends of this area which presents warm humid summers and cold dry winters ta and ts showed a pronounced seasonal pattern with the maximum value occurring in july or august and the minimum value occurring in december the daily ta changed from 4 77 33 18 with a mean value of 16 48 and the ts varied between 0 00 and 35 22 with a mean value of 17 17 compared with ta the variation in vpd exhibited a similar trend ranging from 0 00 kpa to 2 34 kpa with an average of 0 57 kpa at the annual scale the vpd in 2018 was greater than that in other years because of the relatively lower precipitation and higher solar radiation daily rn presented a mean value of 6 74 mj m 2 d 1 with the lowest values in dec 2014 and the highest value in july 2015 the precipitation showed a clear seasonal pattern and was mainly concentrated from may to october which was 1 98 times that in other months of the year during the period from 2014 to 2018 the total values of precipitation showed that 2016 1937 mm was an extremely wet year at the tea plantation the annual precipitation in 2016 exceeded twofold the standard deviation of the mean annual precipitation in the period 1978 2017 1182 281 mm at the nearby liyang meteorological station of the chinese meteorological administration the seasonal variation in swc was closely related to precipitation was generally lowest in autumn and winter and highest in spring and summer ranging between 0 06 m3 m 3 and 0 19 m3 m 3 with an average of 0 13 m3 m 3 3 2 variations in gpp et and wue the mean diurnal variation in gpp et and wue for the tea plantation followed a similar diurnal cycle during both the pruning season and the late growing season fig 2 the gpp and et showed a regular bell shaped curve with the maximum value occurring at midday and the minimum value close to 0 during nighttime in contrast to gpp and et wue had a higher value in the early morning or late afternoon and dropped to the minimum value at midday this was mainly due to increasing radiation and air temperature during the daytime which resulted in a higher augmentation rate of evapotranspiration than photosynthesis and hence led to a gradual decline in wue during the afternoon the asynchronous response of evapotranspiration and photosynthesis to the reduction in radiation and air temperature led to a gradual increase in wue a lower daytime wue in the pruning season was probably due to the pruning practice during that time resulting in a sharper reduction in gpp than in et the seasonal and annual variations in gpp et and ecosystem wue of tea plantation are shown in figs 3 and 4 both gpp and et presented a typical parabolic pattern across all years which was smaller during spring and the increase accompanied the increase in ta and rn achieved their peak value in summer and then decreased across the decrease in ta and rn the monthly gpp ranged between 48 85 g c m 2 month 1 and 229 10 g c m 2 month 1 with a mean value of 136 47 g c m 2 month 1 and the monthly et ranged between 18 24 mm month 1 and 144 55 mm month 1 with a mean value of 55 42 mm month 1 fig 4 the annual gpp was lowest in 2013 1426 61 g c m 2 and highest in 2018 1896 05 g c m 2 with mean annual gpp of 1637 66 g c m 2 the annual et was lowest in 2017 607 05 mm and highest in 2018 805 83 mm with a mean annual et of 665 05 mm the highest annual gpp and et both occurred in 2018 coinciding with the highest ta and rn the variability in wue was distinct from the seasonal dynamics of gpp and et with wue gradually declining during spring and reaching a minimum in summer after that the evapotranspiration rate dropped more than the photosynthesis rate leading to the increase in wue during winter and early spring the monthly mean wue was 2 89 g c kg 1 h2o with the lowest value of 1 57 g c kg 1 h2o and the highest value of 8 36 g c kg 1 h2o fig 4 the annual wue in the tea plantation from 2013 to 2018 ranged from 2 22 g c kg 1 h2o to 2 68 g c kg 1 h2o with an annual average wue of 2 47 g c kg 1 h2o the highest annual wue occurred in 2015 due to the higher gpp and lower et the wue during the pruning season 1 93 0 15 g c kg 1 h2o was significantly lower than that during the late growing season 2 32 0 33 g c kg 1 h2o p 0 05 table 1 which was probably due to the pruning practice having a much larger effect on gpp than on et moreover daily gpp and et were positively correlated over the 5 year period the significant correlation between gpp and et indicated that carbon assimilation and water loss are coupled in the tea plantation the slope of the linear regression equation was 1 76 1 90 1 52 1 77 and 1 37 for 2014 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 5 which is close to the annual wue 3 3 impact of environmental variables on gpp et and wue at the daily time scale gpp and et responded significantly and positively to variations in air temperature ta water vapor pressure deficit vpd and net radiation rn in both the pruning season and the late growing season in the tea plantation fig 6 suggesting that the seasonal variations in gpp and et were driven by environmental variables with similar strengths variations in swc exerted a significantly negative effect on gpp in both seasons comparatively we only found a significant role of swc in regulating et in the pruning season but not in the late growing season variations in lai exerted a significantly positive effect on gpp in the late growing season but not in the pruning season instead lai exerted a significantly positive effect on et in both seasons the results from brt analysis revealed that rn played a dominant role in regulating the daily variations in gpp and et in both seasons and the variations in rn explained approximately 34 92 63 53 of the variance in gpp and 36 56 66 92 of the variance in et during different seasons fig 7 daily wue had a significantly negative response to variations in ta and rn fig 6 when ta and rn increased the response of daily gpp was less significant than et leading to the reduction in wue along with the rising ta and rn the response of gpp was more sensitive than et under vpd values greater than 1 8 kpa which led to a significant and negative correlation between daily wue and vpd in both seasons fig 6 the response of wue to vpd implies a strong impact of vpd on stomatal conductance which had a greater effect on photosynthesis than on evapotranspiration brt analyses identified rn as the most important variable in determining the daily wue variations in rn explained approximately 29 93 of the variance in wue in the growing season but during the pruning season and the late growing season the dominant factors controlling daily variations in wue were vpd and ta respectively the variations in vpd explained 39 12 of the variance in wue in the pruning season and the variations in ta explained 37 80 of the variance in wue in the late growing season fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of wue with other sites wue represents the trade off between the amount of carbon gain and the amount of water loss controlled through stomatal behavior during the process of photosynthesis keenan et al 2013 the ec method provides direct and continuous measurements of carbon and water fluxes simultaneously for evaluating the wue of different vegetation types at the ecosystem level hu et al 2008 niu et al 2011 xiao et al 2013 yu et al 2008 the wue values of reported subtropical and tropical forests are summarized in table 2 the mean ecosystem wue for this tea plantation ranged from 2 22 g c kg 1 h2o to 2 68 g c kg 1 h2o with a mean value of 2 47 g c kg 1 h2o during 2014 2018 which fell within the reported annual ranges of 0 31 3 1 g c kg 1 h2o from 22 sites across china xiao et al 2013 our results indicate that the mean annual wue of tea plantations was higher than the value reported for bamboo forests 2 21 g c kg 1 h2o and evergreen broad leaved forests 1 88 g c kg 1 h2o in subtropical zones wang et al 2016 yu et al 2008 and higher than the value reported for tropical forests 1 13 g c kg 1 h2o zeri et al 2014 but lower than the value reported for tropical rainforests 3 16 g c kg 1 h2o tan et al 2015 and subtropical coniferous plantations 2 53 g c kg 1 h2o yu et al 2008 these differences can often be attributed to vegetation type climate factors and biological characteristics hu et al 2008 xiao et al 2013 when compared with the ecosystem of the same region the relatively higher wue in the tea plantation was probably related to the application of a large amount of fertilizer and other management practices leading to a higher gpp 4 2 response of wue to environmental factors the variation in ecosystem wue was controlled by the process of carbon assimilation and water loss which has divergent sensitivity to variations in environmental and physiological factors across seasons wu et al 2019 yu et al 2008 and the main control factors vary among sites and across different temporal scales wang et al 2018a 2018b yu et al 2008 in this subtropical tea plantation wue decreased with increasing ta rn and vpd indicating that the variation in these environmental factors drove et more strongly than gpp moreover both gpp and et have a stronger correlation with rn than with vpd indicating that this ecosystem is more limited by energy than by water ecosystem wue has been reported to be affected by many environmental factors such as soil moisture atmospheric co2 concentration vpd ta and rn li et al 2015 lin et al 2018 tong et al 2014 yang et al 2010 and by many physiological factors such as stomatal conductance and lai hu et al 2008 lin et al 2018 in this study we found that ta had a negative linear relationship with the daily ecosystem wue with relative contributions of 10 48 and 37 80 during the pruning season and late growing season respectively fig 7 this is in agreement with the result reported in chinese subtropical tropical forests and temperate steppes niu et al 2011 tan et al 2015 zhu et al 2014 but inconsistent with that in temperate forests and lower subtropical old growth forests in china liu et al 2017 zhu et al 2014 increases in ta could promote or inhibit the accumulation of dry matter by affecting the photosynthetic rate at the same time increases in ta could also affect leaf stomatal conductance and soil evaporation subsequently influencing et at the ecosystem level li et al 2015 liu et al 2017 the negative linear relationship between ta and wue in the tea plantation was probably due to the increase in gpp during higher temperature periods being less than that of et which resulted in a lower wue during higher temperature periods rn is an important driving factor for both photosynthesis and transpiration and one of the main controlling factors of wue boese et al 2017 tong et al 2014 our study also found a significant negative correlation between wue and rn with relative contributions of 26 06 and 19 80 during the pruning season and late growing season respectively fig 7 this result is consistent with previous studies li et al 2015 tong et al 2014 wang et al 2018b in this study we found that with increasing radiation conditions the carbon gain by photosynthesis was restrained however et increased significantly under increasing radiation conditions which resulted in a wue decrease with increasing radiation in addition vpd was higher during stronger radiation periods fig 5 and this drought stress may lead to a disproportionate decrease in gpp and et with the decrease rate of gpp being much higher than that of et tong et al 2014 it has long been recognized from previous studies that there is a negative relationship between wue and vpd at leaf or ecosystem scales lin et al 2018 linderson et al 2012 liu et al 2017 ponton et al 2006 in this study we also confirmed that wue was negatively related to vpd with relative contributions of 39 12 and 22 51 during the pruning season and the late growing season respectively the increase in vpd influenced et through both physical and biological effects liu et al 2017 the vapor pressure gradient was larger under a higher vpd which will remarkably increase the plant transpiration and soil evaporation a higher vpd could also lead to a lower stomatal conductance and hence affect evapotranspiration however the photosynthesis rate is only mediated indirectly by vpd through stomatal conductance brummer et al 2012 jiang et al 2019 since stomatal conductance has a greater effect on photosynthesis than on et tong et al 2014 a decrease in stomatal conductance under higher vpd will lead to a greater decrease in the photosynthetic rate than the evapotranspiration rate resulting in a reduction in wue 4 3 management practices impacts on wue canopy pruning is an important practices that is widely used in tea plantation management to regulate canopy structure and budding ability and hence tea yield and quality pruning practices reduced the total leaf area for photosynthesis and evapotranspiration and hence led to 32 32 5 62 lower gpp and 18 64 10 52 lower et during the pruning season than during the late growing season the lower wue in the pruning season p 0 05 compared to the late growing season was attributed to a relatively larger decrease in gpp than et it was indicated that photosynthesis in this tea plantation was more sensitive to variation in pruning practice than evapotranspiration ecosystem et involves water loss from not only the canopy transpiration but also the soil surface evaporation these two processes have inherent differences in response to canopy pruning canopy pruning will influence the microclimatic conditions and physiological response through reduction of the canopy leaf area and change of canopy structure jin et al 2018 medrano et al 2015 which may sharply decrease the transpiration rate however soil evaporation may increase after pruning due to the decrease in plant cover after pruning especially under higher vpd conditions an increase in vpd results in a larger vapor pressure gradient between the atmosphere and plant soil surface which will influence evaporation yue et al 2020 thus photosynthesis was affected by canopy pruning to a much larger degree than et in the tea plantation resulting in a lower wue during the pruning season the strong fertilization usage to maintain high production is another characteristic in tea plantations the nitrogen fertilizer application in tea plantations ranged from 450 to 1200 kg n ha 1 yr 1 yao et al 2015 it has been widely documented that n addition can stimulate plant growth and increase ecosystem carbon uptake and biomass production moinet et al 2016 zeeman et al 2010 tian et al 2016 found that n addition enhanced the ecosystem carbon uptake and productivity of grassland in inner mongolia but did not change water evapotranspiration significantly improving the ecosystem wue a similar response of wue to n addition has been found in a semiarid cropland liu et al 2016 the strong fertilization usage along with the favorable temperature and abundant precipitation influenced by the east asian monsoon in this region contribute to maintaining high gpp in tea plantations even under strong pruning interference a better understanding of the effects of management practices and their interactions on wue will help us to optimize wue by improving agronomic management strategies at regional scales 5 conclusions here the seasonal variations in the ecosystem gpp et and wue of a subtropical hilly tea plantation in southeast china are presented the dominant drivers of these variables were also evaluated the results showed that the mean annual gpp et and wue ranged from 1426 61 1896 05 g c m 2 607 05 805 83 mm and 2 22 2 68 g c kg 1 h2o respectively the relatively high wue was primarily attributed to the application of a large amount of fertilizer and other management practices leading to a relatively higher gpp in the tea plantation our findings revealed that the dominant factor regulating gpp and et during both the pruning season and the late growing season was rn while the dominant factor controlling daily variations in wue was vpd during the pruning season and ta during the late growing season there were divergent responses of carbon assimilation and water loss to environmental variations and management strategies in different seasons these results are important for understanding the interactions between water loss and carbon assimilation over tea plantations and will aid in optimizing the water and carbon management strategies of tea plantations to suit local climatic conditions the response of the wue of tea plantations to future climate change still needs to be investigated declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9476,knowledge of water use efficiency wue at the ecosystem level is imperative as it is a critical ecophysiological index reflecting the coupling processes between carbon sequestration and water consumption however the temporal patterns of wue and their underlying regulating factors during different seasons in tea plantations which are under intense pruning practice remain poorly understood based on carbon and water vapor flux data obtained by the eddy covariance technique in a subtropical hilly tea plantation in southeast china during 2014 2018 this study analyzed the seasonal variations in gross primary productivity gpp evapotranspiration et and ecosystem wue and discussed the response of gpp et and wue to environmental variables during different seasons the results showed that the mean annual gpp et and wue ranged from 1426 61 1896 05 g c m 2 607 05 805 83 mm and 2 22 2 68 g c kg 1 h2o respectively at the daily time scale gpp and et responded significantly and positively to variations in air temperature ta water vapor pressure deficit vpd and net radiation rn in both the pruning season and late growing season but daily wue had a significantly negative response to variations in ta vpd and rn rn was identified as the dominant factor in regulating gpp and et during both the pruning season and late growing season while the dominant factor controlling daily variations in wue was vpd during the pruning season and ta during the late growing season such results were mainly due to the divergent responses of carbon assimilation and water loss to different environmental variations and management strategies these findings highlighted the importance of understanding the coupled processes between carbon assimilation and water loss in tea plantations keywords tea plantation eddy covariance gross primary productivity evapotranspiration water use efficiency 1 introduction carbon and water fluxes are tightly coupled through the stomata in terrestrial ecosystems and are considerably important properties of ecosystem processes and functions liu et al 2017 singh et al 2014 tan et al 2015 wue the ratio of carbon assimilation to water loss has been used as a key integrated ecophysiological indicator in hydrological and ecology studies as it reflects the coupled relationship between carbon and water cycles from leaf to ecosystem levels singh et al 2014 tong et al 2014 yu et al 2008 at the ecosystem level wue is commonly defined as the ratio of gross primary productivity gpp to evapotranspiration et and these two parameters can be estimated simultaneously by the eddy covariance ec method baldocchi 2003 law et al 2002 the ecosystem wue is effective because it indicates the water use strategy and adaptability to climate change of plants in different environments lin et al 2018 xie et al 2016 and can be used to assess the effect of water resources on terrestrial ecosystem carbon sinks tong et al 2014 moreover because wue is an important functional indicator it has become the key parameter of some models for simulating ecosystem production tang et al 2006 zhou et al 2015 understanding the impact of environmental and management factors on wue is critically important for assessing the response of ecosystems to global climatic change and optimizing water and carbon management strategies to suit local climatic conditions theoretically any controlling factors of both gpp and et can affect wue previous studies have shown that at the ecosystem level wue is mainly controlled by both environmental factors and physiological factors such as air temperature ta net radiation rn vapor pressure deficit vpd soil water content swc precipitation stomatal conductance gc and leaf area index lai li et al 2015 liu et al 2017 tong et al 2014 wang et al 2018b unlike the regulatory mechanism at the leaf scale the ecosystem wue combines photosynthesis respiration evaporation and transpiration processes and has a much more complicated regulatory mechanism li et al 2015 moreover management practices such as mulching and fertilization affect the soil water and nutrient supply and hence the gpp et and wue of croplands and plantations ali et al 2018 liu et al 2016 however the magnitude and direction of the response of gpp et and wue to these environmental factors and management practices might be different or even opposite li et al 2018 found that radiation exerted a stronger positive effect on et than gpp resulting in a negative response of wue across biomes the different responses deeply reflect the complexity of gpp et and wue variability and their underlying mechanisms tea is an intensively managed evergreen broadleaved shrub widely planted in hilly areas in tropical and subtropical regions as an important cash crop in china tea plantations covered approximately 3 11 106 ha in 2019 national bureau of statistics of china 2020 and are still rapidly expanding especially in the hilly region of southeast china however the impact of tea plantations on carbon assimilation and water loss has been poorly studied li et al 2011 lv et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 the management practices of tea plantations especially pruning influence carbon and water dynamics gpp was suppressed by pruning while respiration was enhanced resulting in a carbon source during the pruning season pang et al 2019 et was impacted by a low leaf area index through its effect on canopy surface conductance and decreased 36 73 48 32 after pruning practice lv et al 2013 geng et al 2020 however few studies have clarified the seasonal divergence of gpp et and wue of tea plantations and their response to environmental factors and management practices an improved understanding of seasonally different behaviors of ecosystem wue and its key controlling variables is important for optimal tea plantation management and assessing the impact of expanding tea plantations on regional hydrology and ecosystem

meteorological data gaps were filled using the nonlinear regression method and 6 nee was partitioned into gpp and er based on the methods of reichstein et al 2005 additional information on data processing is described in detail in yu et al 2006 after data quality control and the gap filling procedure the full time series flux data were summed to obtain daily monthly and annual scales of gpp and et 2 4 calculation of water use efficiency wue is defined as the amount of carbon assimilation per unit of water loss from transpiration baldocchi 1994 farquhar et al 1982 the direct measurements of carbon and water exchange using ec technology make it possible to examine wue at the ecosystem level beer et al 2009 the ecosystem wue can be calculated as follows w u e g p p e t where et is evapotranspiration kg h2o m 2 which comprise of plant transpiration and soil water evaporation and can be measured directly by the ec system gpp is gross ecosystem primary productivity g c m 2 which can be expressed as g p p n e e r e where nee is the net ecosystem co2 exchange g c m 2 which can be measured directly by the ec system re is the total ecosystem respiration and can be estimated through soil temperature and soil volumetric water content yu et al 2006 2 5 statistical analysis intense pruning will inhibit co2 assimilation and promote respiration pang et al 2019 we defined april through june with monthly re gpp 1 0 as the pruning season and july through october as the late growing season a boosted regression trees brt analysis was conducted to investigate the environmental controls and their relative influence on gpp et and wue during the pruning season and late growing season at daily time scales the main environmental variables we examined were ta vpd swc rn and lai the brt analyses were performed using the brt package in r 3 results 3 1 seasonal variation in environmental factors the seasonal patterns of daily air temperature ta soil temperature ts vapor pressure deficit vpd net radiation rn soil water content swc and precipitation p during 2014 2018 are shown in fig 1 the air temperature and precipitation followed the typical seasonal trends of this area which presents warm humid summers and cold dry winters ta and ts showed a pronounced seasonal pattern with the maximum value occurring in july or august and the minimum value occurring in december the daily ta changed from 4 77 33 18 with a mean value of 16 48 and the ts varied between 0 00 and 35 22 with a mean value of 17 17 compared with ta the variation in vpd exhibited a similar trend ranging from 0 00 kpa to 2 34 kpa with an average of 0 57 kpa at the annual scale the vpd in 2018 was greater than that in other years because of the relatively lower precipitation and higher solar radiation daily rn presented a mean value of 6 74 mj m 2 d 1 with the lowest values in dec 2014 and the highest value in july 2015 the precipitation showed a clear seasonal pattern and was mainly concentrated from may to october which was 1 98 times that in other months of the year during the period from 2014 to 2018 the total values of precipitation showed that 2016 1937 mm was an extremely wet year at the tea plantation the annual precipitation in 2016 exceeded twofold the standard deviation of the mean annual precipitation in the period 1978 2017 1182 281 mm at the nearby liyang meteorological station of the chinese meteorological administration the seasonal variation in swc was closely related to precipitation was generally lowest in autumn and winter and highest in spring and summer ranging between 0 06 m3 m 3 and 0 19 m3 m 3 with an average of 0 13 m3 m 3 3 2 variations in gpp et and wue the mean diurnal variation in gpp et and wue for the tea plantation followed a similar diurnal cycle during both the pruning season and the late growing season fig 2 the gpp and et showed a regular bell shaped curve with the maximum value occurring at midday and the minimum value close to 0 during nighttime in contrast to gpp and et wue had a higher value in the early morning or late afternoon and dropped to the minimum value at midday this was mainly due to increasing radiation and air temperature during the daytime which resulted in a higher augmentation rate of evapotranspiration than photosynthesis and hence led to a gradual decline in wue during the afternoon the asynchronous response of evapotranspiration and photosynthesis to the reduction in radiation and air temperature led to a gradual increase in wue a lower daytime wue in the pruning season was probably due to the pruning practice during that time resulting in a sharper reduction in gpp than in et the seasonal and annual variations in gpp et and ecosystem wue of tea plantation are shown in figs 3 and 4 both gpp and et presented a typical parabolic pattern across all years which was smaller during spring and the increase accompanied the increase in ta and rn achieved their peak value in summer and then decreased across the decrease in ta and rn the monthly gpp ranged between 48 85 g c m 2 month 1 and 229 10 g c m 2 month 1 with a mean value of 136 47 g c m 2 month 1 and the monthly et ranged between 18 24 mm month 1 and 144 55 mm month 1 with a mean value of 55 42 mm month 1 fig 4 the annual gpp was lowest in 2013 1426 61 g c m 2 and highest in 2018 1896 05 g c m 2 with mean annual gpp of 1637 66 g c m 2 the annual et was lowest in 2017 607 05 mm and highest in 2018 805 83 mm with a mean annual et of 665 05 mm the highest annual gpp and et both occurred in 2018 coinciding with the highest ta and rn the variability in wue was distinct from the seasonal dynamics of gpp and et with wue gradually declining during spring and reaching a minimum in summer after that the evapotranspiration rate dropped more than the photosynthesis rate leading to the increase in wue during winter and early spring the monthly mean wue was 2 89 g c kg 1 h2o with the lowest value of 1 57 g c kg 1 h2o and the highest value of 8 36 g c kg 1 h2o fig 4 the annual wue in the tea plantation from 2013 to 2018 ranged from 2 22 g c kg 1 h2o to 2 68 g c kg 1 h2o with an annual average wue of 2 47 g c kg 1 h2o the highest annual wue occurred in 2015 due to the higher gpp and lower et the wue during the pruning season 1 93 0 15 g c kg 1 h2o was significantly lower than that during the late growing season 2 32 0 33 g c kg 1 h2o p 0 05 table 1 which was probably due to the pruning practice having a much larger effect on gpp than on et moreover daily gpp and et were positively correlated over the 5 year period the significant correlation between gpp and et indicated that carbon assimilation and water loss are coupled in the tea plantation the slope of the linear regression equation was 1 76 1 90 1 52 1 77 and 1 37 for 2014 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 5 which is close to the annual wue 3 3 impact of environmental variables on gpp et and wue at the daily time scale gpp and et responded significantly and positively to variations in air temperature ta water vapor pressure deficit vpd and net radiation rn in both the pruning season and the late growing season in the tea plantation fig 6 suggesting that the seasonal variations in gpp and et were driven by environmental variables with similar strengths variations in swc exerted a significantly negative effect on gpp in both seasons comparatively we only found a significant role of swc in regulating et in the pruning season but not in the late growing season variations in lai exerted a significantly positive effect on gpp in the late growing season but not in the pruning season instead lai exerted a significantly positive effect on et in both seasons the results from brt analysis revealed that rn played a dominant role in regulating the daily variations in gpp and et in both seasons and the variations in rn explained approximately 34 92 63 53 of the variance in gpp and 36 56 66 92 of the variance in et during different seasons fig 7 daily wue had a significantly negative response to variations in ta and rn fig 6 when ta and rn increased the response of daily gpp was less significant than et leading to the reduction in wue along with the rising ta and rn the response of gpp was more sensitive than et under vpd values greater than 1 8 kpa which led to a significant and negative correlation between daily wue and vpd in both seasons fig 6 the response of wue to vpd implies a strong impact of vpd on stomatal conductance which had a greater effect on photosynthesis than on evapotranspiration brt analyses identified rn as the most important variable in determining the daily wue variations in rn explained approximately 29 93 of the variance in wue in the growing season but during the pruning season and the late growing season the dominant factors controlling daily variations in wue were vpd and ta respectively the variations in vpd explained 39 12 of the variance in wue in the pruning season and the variations in ta explained 37 80 of the variance in wue in the late growing season fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of wue with other sites wue represents the trade off between the amount of carbon gain and the amount of water loss controlled through stomatal behavior during the process of photosynthesis keenan et al 2013 the ec method provides direct and continuous measurements of carbon and water fluxes simultaneously for evaluating the wue of different vegetation types at the ecosystem level hu et al 2008 niu et al 2011 xiao et al 2013 yu et al 2008 the wue values of reported subtropical and tropical forests are summarized in table 2 the mean ecosystem wue for this tea plantation ranged from 2 22 g c kg 1 h2o to 2 68 g c kg 1 h2o with a mean value of 2 47 g c kg 1 h2o during 2014 2018 which fell within the reported annual ranges of 0 31 3 1 g c kg 1 h2o from 22 sites across china xiao et al 2013 our results indicate that the mean annual wue of tea plantations was higher than the value reported for bamboo forests 2 21 g c kg 1 h2o and evergreen broad leaved forests 1 88 g c kg 1 h2o in subtropical zones wang et al 2016 yu et al 2008 and higher than the value reported for tropical forests 1 13 g c kg 1 h2o zeri et al 2014 but lower than the value reported for tropical rainforests 3 16 g c kg 1 h2o tan et al 2015 and subtropical coniferous plantations 2 53 g c kg 1 h2o yu et al 2008 these differences can often be attributed to vegetation type climate factors and biological characteristics hu et al 2008 xiao et al 2013 when compared with the ecosystem of the same region the relatively higher wue in the tea plantation was probably related to the application of a large amount of fertilizer and other management practices leading to a higher gpp 4 2 response of wue to environmental factors the variation in ecosystem wue was controlled by the process of carbon assimilation and water loss which has divergent sensitivity to variations in environmental and physiological factors across seasons wu et al 2019 yu et al 2008 and the main control factors vary among sites and across different temporal scales wang et al 2018a 2018b yu et al 2008 in this subtropical tea plantation wue decreased with increasing ta rn and vpd indicating that the variation in these environmental factors drove et more strongly than gpp moreover both gpp and et have a stronger correlation with rn than with vpd indicating that this ecosystem is more limited by energy than by water ecosystem wue has been reported to be affected by many environmental factors such as soil moisture atmospheric co2 concentration vpd ta and rn li et al 2015 lin et al 2018 tong et al 2014 yang et al 2010 and by many physiological factors such as stomatal conductance and lai hu et al 2008 lin et al 2018 in this study we found that ta had a negative linear relationship with the daily ecosystem wue with relative contributions of 10 48 and 37 80 during the pruning season and late growing season respectively fig 7 this is in agreement with the result reported in chinese subtropical tropical forests and temperate steppes niu et al 2011 tan et al 2015 zhu et al 2014 but inconsistent with that in temperate forests and lower subtropical old growth forests in china liu et al 2017 zhu et al 2014 increases in ta could promote or inhibit the accumulation of dry matter by affecting the photosynthetic rate at the same time increases in ta could also affect leaf stomatal conductance and soil evaporation subsequently influencing et at the ecosystem level li et al 2015 liu et al 2017 the negative linear relationship between ta and wue in the tea plantation was probably due to the increase in gpp during higher temperature periods being less than that of et which resulted in a lower wue during higher temperature periods rn is an important driving factor for both photosynthesis and transpiration and one of the main controlling factors of wue boese et al 2017 tong et al 2014 our study also found a significant negative correlation between wue and rn with relative contributions of 26 06 and 19 80 during the pruning season and late growing season respectively fig 7 this result is consistent with previous studies li et al 2015 tong et al 2014 wang et al 2018b in this study we found that with increasing radiation conditions the carbon gain by photosynthesis was restrained however et increased significantly under increasing radiation conditions which resulted in a wue decrease with increasing radiation in addition vpd was higher during stronger radiation periods fig 5 and this drought stress may lead to a disproportionate decrease in gpp and et with the decrease rate of gpp being much higher than that of et tong et al 2014 it has long been recognized from previous studies that there is a negative relationship between wue and vpd at leaf or ecosystem scales lin et al 2018 linderson et al 2012 liu et al 2017 ponton et al 2006 in this study we also confirmed that wue was negatively related to vpd with relative contributions of 39 12 and 22 51 during the pruning season and the late growing season respectively the increase in vpd influenced et through both physical and biological effects liu et al 2017 the vapor pressure gradient was larger under a higher vpd which will remarkably increase the plant transpiration and soil evaporation a higher vpd could also lead to a lower stomatal conductance and hence affect evapotranspiration however the photosynthesis rate is only mediated indirectly by vpd through stomatal conductance brummer et al 2012 jiang et al 2019 since stomatal conductance has a greater effect on photosynthesis than on et tong et al 2014 a decrease in stomatal conductance under higher vpd will lead to a greater decrease in the photosynthetic rate than the evapotranspiration rate resulting in a reduction in wue 4 3 management practices impacts on wue canopy pruning is an important practices that is widely used in tea plantation management to regulate canopy structure and budding ability and hence tea yield and quality pruning practices reduced the total leaf area for photosynthesis and evapotranspiration and hence led to 32 32 5 62 lower gpp and 18 64 10 52 lower et during the pruning season than during the late growing season the lower wue in the pruning season p 0 05 compared to the late growing season was attributed to a relatively larger decrease in gpp than et it was indicated that photosynthesis in this tea plantation was more sensitive to variation in pruning practice than evapotranspiration ecosystem et involves water loss from not only the canopy transpiration but also the soil surface evaporation these two processes have inherent differences in response to canopy pruning canopy pruning will influence the microclimatic conditions and physiological response through reduction of the canopy leaf area and change of canopy structure jin et al 2018 medrano et al 2015 which may sharply decrease the transpiration rate however soil evaporation may increase after pruning due to the decrease in plant cover after pruning especially under higher vpd conditions an increase in vpd results in a larger vapor pressure gradient between the atmosphere and plant soil surface which will influence evaporation yue et al 2020 thus photosynthesis was affected by canopy pruning to a much larger degree than et in the tea plantation resulting in a lower wue during the pruning season the strong fertilization usage to maintain high production is another characteristic in tea plantations the nitrogen fertilizer application in tea plantations ranged from 450 to 1200 kg n ha 1 yr 1 yao et al 2015 it has been widely documented that n addition can stimulate plant growth and increase ecosystem carbon uptake and biomass production moinet et al 2016 zeeman et al 2010 tian et al 2016 found that n addition enhanced the ecosystem carbon uptake and productivity of grassland in inner mongolia but did not change water evapotranspiration significantly improving the ecosystem wue a similar response of wue to n addition has been found in a semiarid cropland liu et al 2016 the strong fertilization usage along with the favorable temperature and abundant precipitation influenced by the east asian monsoon in this region contribute to maintaining high gpp in tea plantations even under strong pruning interference a better understanding of the effects of management practices and their interactions on wue will help us to optimize wue by improving agronomic management strategies at regional scales 5 conclusions here the seasonal variations in the ecosystem gpp et and wue of a subtropical hilly tea plantation in southeast china are presented the dominant drivers of these variables were also evaluated the results showed that the mean annual gpp et and wue ranged from 1426 61 1896 05 g c m 2 607 05 805 83 mm and 2 22 2 68 g c kg 1 h2o respectively the relatively high wue was primarily attributed to the application of a large amount of fertilizer and other management practices leading to a relatively higher gpp in the tea plantation our findings revealed that the dominant factor regulating gpp and et during both the pruning season and the late growing season was rn while the dominant factor controlling daily variations in wue was vpd during the pruning season and ta during the late growing season there were divergent responses of carbon assimilation and water loss to environmental variations and management strategies in different seasons these results are important for understanding the interactions between water loss and carbon assimilation over tea plantations and will aid in optimizing the water and carbon management strategies of tea plantations to suit local climatic conditions the response of the wue of tea plantations to future climate change still needs to be investigated declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9477,management of water resources is essential to maintain sustainable agricultural productivity and preserve groundwater and surface ecosystems the long term sustainability of these systems depends on the understanding of complex surface groundwater flow interactions at different temporal and spatial scales and the impacts of agricultural practices on water use to support these efforts an integrated annagnps modflow modeling technology is proposed and evaluated it combines the capability of the annagnps model to detailed characterization of farming practices with groundwater flow estimation tools of the modflow model the annagnps modflow model was evaluated in upper sunflower river watershed at the lower mississippi river alluvial plain the integrated modeling technology in conjunction with observed values of streamflow at the outlet and well water levels were used to estimate irrigation strategies with application rates varying in time and space at field scale utilization of improved irrigation characterization have provided evidence of the sensitivity of streamflow and groundwater levels to irrigation strategies simulation results indicate that a reduction of irrigation application rates by 20 40 can impact aquifer long term water levels this finding supports the need to investigate more efficient irrigation strategies to promote the aquifer sustainable use the proposed technology provides a management tool critical to understanding and evaluating the impact of agricultural practices irrigation and aquifer recharge strategies that are important to sustaining water resources in irrigated agricultural watersheds keywords annagnps modflow irrigation groundwater sustainable agriculture 1 introduction the management of water resources is of paramount importance to maintaining and increasing agricultural productivity while preserving groundwater natural reserves and surface ecosystems this equilibrium is of special significance in locations dominated by agricultural activities reliant on irrigation from groundwater because the long term sustainability of these systems is vulnerable when irrigation demand overcomes the aquifer recharge capacity in order to attain long term sustainability of utilization of groundwater resources in these conditions it is necessary to develop alternative irrigation strategies that are more efficient and do not rely exclusively on groundwater sources the challenge resides in the characterization and representation of complex hydrologic and hydraulic dynamics that are the result of several interrelated natural and anthropogenic drivers acting at different temporal and spatial scales this complexity requires the development of long term integrated hydrological models capable of characterizing surface groundwater flow interactions in response to these drivers kim et al 2008 development and application of hydrologic models allow for the characterization of existing conditions by depicting spatial temporal changes and for subsequent implementation of decision support systems for improved natural resource management the recognition of this need has prompted to an increase in the number of studies devoted to the development of integrated surface water and groundwater modeling technologies markstrom et al 2008 kim et al 2008 refsgaard et al 2010 gusman et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 2017 chunn et al 2019 most developments have focused on integrating existing watershed and or basin scale surface hydrologic models with models simulating flow of groundwater through aquifers this approach has advantages as it builds upon well established and tested technologies in each domain the integration of the u s geological survey precipitation runoff modeling system prms model leavesley et al 1983 with the u s geological survey modular ground water flow model modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1983 led to the development of the ground water and surface water flow gflow model markstrom et al 2008 several studies were conducted to develop technology for the integration of the modflow model mcdonald et al 1983 with the soil and water assessment tool swat model arnold et al 1998 for application in a wide range of conditions sophocleous and perkins 2000 kim et al 2008 gusman et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 the internal swat calculations of soil deep percolation representing aquifer recharge are integrated with modflow groundwater flow calculations representing contribution of groundwater to streams therefore creating technology with flow exchange capabilities between surface water and groundwater and as result improving characterization of irrigated watersheds this integrated approach has been employed to study surface water and groundwater interaction and their potential impacts interconnection to stream flow sophocleous et al 1999 kim et al 2008 bailey et al 2016 sediment and nutrients sith et al 2019 crop irrigation gao et al 2019 wei and bailey 2019 and future climatic estimates chunn et al 2019 the challenge of the swat modflow integration resides on basic modeling unit differences between these models in the modflow model the most common basic modeling unit representation is a three dimensional grid system in the swat model the basic modeling unit consists of sub watersheds which are further sub divided into hydrologic response units hrus based on unique combinations of land use farming management and soil type the hrus are not identified spatially by the model and their information is aggregated per sub watershed unit gassman et al 2007 additionally in agricultural watersheds with small fields and highly dynamic farming practices the scale differences between surface basic modeling units sub watersheds and individual fields may increase uncertainty by failing to capture spatial temporal variations of farming practices including irrigation strategies the level of watershed discretization can affect daily calculations of water balance infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration because multiple flow processes are calculated based on parameters describing soil type land use cover farming management topography and others tripathi et al 2006 improved databases capable of describing a large number of unique farming management schedules and associated operations including irrigation at field scale have the potential to quantify water balance at higher spatial and temporal resolutions providing a better representation of existing conditions these detailed estimates could support the quantification of farming practices contribution to aquifer water levels over time in this study the annualized agricultural non point source annagnps watershed pollution model bingner et al 2018 was integrated with the modflow model to quantify the effect of farming practices to aquifer levels at the upper sunflower river watershed specifically the objectives were the following 1 development of technology to allow for exchange of daily surface water groundwater flow information between annagnps and modflow models 2 assess the annagnps model capabilities of describing daily farming practices for individual sub catchments and their potential contribution of aquifer recharge withdraw and 3 evaluation of the integrated technology at a dynamic agricultural watershed with farming practices reliant on irrigation primarily from groundwater findings are sought to serve as basis for future development of decision support systems designed to improve irrigation efficiency to continue support production while reducing long term stress to surface and groundwater resources 2 methods 2 1 upper sunflower river watershed the upper sunflower river watershed is located in the midsouth region of the usa within the lower mississippi river basin fig 1a the watershed is within the mississippi river alluvial plain floodplain and is considered one of the most productive regions in the u s using the u s geological survey station 7288500 at sunflower county in the state of mississippi as the outlet the watershed drainage area is 188549 ha fig 1b the topography is flat with elevation ranging from 26 m to 65 m above mean sea level for the entire watershed additionally a common practice in this region is mechanically level fields to aid furrow or flood irrigation average precipitation between 1970 and 2016 in the watershed is 1321 mm with higher precipitation intensities and amounts in the spring and winter months during the growing season minimum and maximum annual average temperatures for the same time period are 17 c and 29 c respectively the land cover is primarily agricultural 94 with main row crops as corn soybeans and cotton over the years corn and soybean production has increased in detriment of traditional crops such as cotton usda 2021 wallander et al 2011 as percentage of the watershed total area cotton changed from 19 in 2000 to 5 in 2015 while combined soybean and corn changed from 61 in 2000 to 73 in 2015 fig 6 in momm et al 2019a the combination of warm temperatures with high humidity and lack of regular precipitation during the growing season has led to adoption of groundwater based irrigation from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer earlier studies estimated approximately 96 of the aquifer withdraw of the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer is used to support agriculture practices through irrigation usgs 2009 specifically in the mississippi river alluvial plain region it is estimated that in 2013 irrigation was applied in 100 of rice 67 of corn 61 of soybean and 56 of cotton massey et al 2017 an upward trend in the number of well permits between 2001 and 2016 indicates a continued adoption of irrigation practice from groundwater ymd 2021 rising concerns of reduction of baseflow in the sunflower river kebede et al 2014 and to aquifer levels dropping clark and hart 2009 clark et al 2013 detailed description of the watershed physical soil topography climate weather and anthropogenic characteristics yearly land cover yearly yield yearly spatially varying irrigation adoption rates and typical farming management practices are provided in momm and others 2019a similarly regional aquifer and geology characteristics are described in previous studies conducted by the u s geological survey clark and hart 2009 clark et al 2013 2 2 the annagnps pollution and watershed management model 2 2 1 model description the development of the annagnps model by the u s department of agriculture was driven by the need to manage mitigate nonpoint source pollutants specifically in agricultural ungauged watersheds the annagnps model contains modules to identify different sources of pollutants to evaluate multiple conservation practices and their integrated effect in space and time the model operates at a continuous daily time step solving water balance at field scale to estimate infiltration surface runoff evapotranspiration sediment erosion transport and deposition nutrient nitrogen phosphorus and organic carbon and pesticide loads bingner et al 2018 further detailed description of the annagnps model s modules and calculations has been provided in previous studies upadhyay et al 2018 momm et al 2019a 2019b bisantino et al 2015 yuan et al 2008 chahor et al 2014 and therefore only a brief description of the annagnps model framework is provided in the annagnps modeling structure the watershed is subdivided into two basic modeling units a sub catchment referred to as annagnps cell and concentrated flow referred to as annagnps reach annagnps cells are sought to represent agricultural fields annagnps cells and reaches are hierarchically connected to capture surface water flow to a single outlet one key characteristic of the annagnps model is the capability of describing farming practices on a daily basis and at a field scale this requires the development of databases describing each annagnps cell in terms of farming management schedules incorporating crop growth soil disturbance by farming equipment irrigation strategy pesticides application and others additionally the model includes tools to estimate loads from ephemeral gully sources momm et al 2012 bingner et al 2016 and sediment load reduction from riparian vegetation strips momm et al 2014 and sedimentation ponds yasarer et al 2018 watersheds are commonly subdivided into hundreds to thousands of annagnps cells allowing for detailed characterization of farming and irrigation practices in time and space 2 2 2 development of the annagnps simulation the annagnps simulation developed and described in momm et al 2019a was used as the starting point for this study in this annagnps simulation the watershed was subdivided into 3992 annagnps cells figs 2a and 1602 annagnps reaches fig 2b representing sub catchments at field scale and concentrated flow paths respectively databases containing the typical one year farming practice schedule and list of operations for the dominant crops representing 90 of the watershed yearly sequence of land cover land use from 2000 to 2015 temporally variable crop yield and spatial temporal irrigation information were combined to develop the annagnps management input database a total of 3143 unique 16 year crop rotations were generated describing farming activities schedule operations irrigation strategy and crop yield in time and space this simulation was calibrated and validated using observed monthly streamflow at the outlet momm et al 2019a the only change was the introduction of new irrigation strategies in the initial annagnps simulation automated irrigation strategies were adopted in this approach a single application rate for each crop was used for all months during the growing season and all locations in the watershed one application rate per crop additionally irrigation would only occur if soil moisture conditions were indicative of a water deficit based on daily water balance calculations this was considered a conservative estimate of irrigation amounts and frequency a manual irrigation strategy was used instead and was based on 12 years monthly averages from april to september for corn maize soybean rice and cotton fig 5 in massey et al 2017 the addition of new irrigation strategies required updating of the annagnps management input database to reflect the new irrigation strategies containing different application rates per crop and per month during the growing season the increased irrigation rates and frequency of the new strategy affected runoff and therefore a re calibration was performed by increasing reducing curve numbers for all crop non crop curves step 1 in fig 3 this resulted in a new calibrated annagnps simulation that based on comparisons with observed streamflow yielded infiltration beyond the vadose zone assumed to be representative of surface processes box 7 in fig 3 2 3 the modflow groundwater model 2 3 1 description the modflow model was developed by the u s geological survey to solve differential equations depicting flow in confined unconfined aquifers using finite difference method mcdonald et al 1983 it has been designed with modular capabilities to allow users to select from multiple optional packages to better represent groundwater flow in a wide range of aquifer conditions in both steady state and transient conditions recent versions of the modflow model have capabilities to support multiple basic modeling unit representations with the most common one being regular three dimensional grids the modflow model does not have the capabilities to estimate processes affecting water balance at the surface and therefore this information is often estimated externally to the model or generated during the calibration process guzman et al 2015 key packages relevant for this study are the following the well package to simulate groundwater withdraw streamflow package to simulate flow between streams and aquifers the constant head package to aid in defining boundary conditions 2 3 2 development of the modflow simulation the modflow simulation developed by u s geological survey for the mississippi embayment regional aquifer was used as the basis for the development of a new modflow simulation tailored for this study the original modflow simulation referred to as meras 1 0 and described in clark and hart 2009 was developed to estimate the long term effect of water withdraw to the aquifer at a regional scale fig 1a this simulation was implemented using the modflow 2005 version with spatial resolution of 1 6 km cell size 13 geological layers temporal resolution of six months and total simulation period of 137 years clark and hart 2009 mckee and clark 2003 this simulation was updated with enhanced water usage estimates and localized aquifer properties in 2013 and it is referred to as meras 2 0 clark et al 2013 another revision was performed 2020 meras 2 1 for a study specific to the mississippi river alluvial plain in which the simulation period was extended and irrigation amounts were updated haugh et al 2020 the meras 2 1 simulation was used as the basis for the development of the modflow simulation used in this study the meras 2 1 simulation originally developed using modflow 2005 was ported to the latest version of the modflow model modflow 6 the raster grids were resampled to 984 m spatial resolution and only the top five layers were considered fig 2c the simulation period was set from 2000 to 2015 with daily temporal resolution to match simulation period and temporal resolution of the annagnps simulation the packages used for a transient state simulation include the following rectilinear discretization initial conditions node property flow observation storage package output control streamflow routing recharge package well package time variant specified head the recharge and well packages require time series generated by the annagnps model the streamflow routing package was included to estimate flow between the main channel of the sunflower river stream order 4 6 blue line in fig 2c and the aquifer the flowlines were downloaded from the u s national hydrography dataset plus epa 2020 minimally edited to match flowlines generated by topographic analysis of lidar based dem and processed using the sfrmaker computer program to generate the necessary inputs for the modflow streamflow routing package leaf et al 2021 the aquifer immediate underneath the upper sunflower river watershed being simulated represents only a subset of a large system and therefore the definition of appropriate boundaries conditions is of vital importance in this modeling effort three head dependent boundary conditions were included to aid in the characterization of initial heads and the capture of hydrologic conditions located outside of the study area but influencing flow within the study area such as rivers and adjacent geologic units these boundaries conditions were defined based on conceptual interpretation of the regional flow system first the contribution from the mississippi river to the aquifer was represented by using the constant head package to simulate modflow cells located in the northwest of the study site green raster grid cells in fig 2c these modflow cells were defined to have flow that varied in time daily based on average gage height observations between two stream gage stations located in memphis tn and helena ar missing stream gage observations were generated by averaging the previous and following day to obtain a continuous dataset second a large cone of depression located outside of the study area southeast of it was represented by using the constant head package to represent modflow cells red raster grid cells in fig 2c defined to have heads varying in space the gradient for the depression cone was obtained from the usgs potentiometric surface for the spring of 2016 mcguire et al 2019 the third boundary condition adopted was the definition initial heads several aquifer level values were evaluated as potential initial conditions initial heads in first day of the modflow simulation and the potentiometric surface generated from observed well heads for the spring of 2000 was selected due to improved overall model convergence and its capture of seasonal variations 2 4 annagnps modflow integration 2 4 1 enhancements to the annagnps model the annagnps model was enhanced with changes to the model s irrigation component and with the addition of a new modflow component in the irrigation component a new irrigation source tracking capability was added this new feature allows for the development of irrigation strategies specifying the irrigation water source two options are available within the model to designate the source of irrigation water either from groundwater or from surface water the development of the capability to designate irrigation water sources allows individual annagnps cells to be characterized by multiple irrigation strategies containing mixed water sources varying in time therefore simulations of combined groundwater and surface water irrigation strategies can be simulated and evaluated within the annagnps model the implemented annagnps modflow component generates input files for utilization with the modflow 6 model during execution time two timeseries for use with the modflow model components recharge and well these input files are formatted as modflow time series for direct ingestion by the modflow model s recharge and well components annagnps daily infiltration beyond the vadose zone represents a source of aquifer recharge similarly annagnps daily irrigation application rate represents aquifer withdraw via irrigation wells both infiltration beyond the vadose zone and irrigation application rates are reported per annagnps cell per day given that there are changes in land cover yearly and therefore farming management changes in irrigation application rates over time increased adoption of irrigation practices this leads to complex fluxes exchanges between surface and subsurface systems the annagnps irrigation component was integrated with the annagnps modflow component allowing the user to define the irrigation source from either surface water or groundwater source and this is reflected in the modflow time series generated another new output generated depicts the surface groundwater flow by reporting irrigation rate irrigation source and percolation into vadose zone for all annagnps cells at daily time step this output database was created to provide an improved assessment describing the irrigation strategy s impact on the daily water balance for each annagnps cell the assignment of annagnps cells to modflow cells was based on gis analysis and was used to inform the one to one association between annagnps cells and modflow cells 2 4 2 calibration of the integrated annagnps modflow modeling system the calibration of the integrated annagnps modflow system was performed in incremental steps the objective is to represent existing conditions of farming practices and climatic weather factors effect to the surface water and groundwater flows in the first step the annagnps simulation was re calibrated using observed streamflow at the watershed s outlet to estimate amounts of surface runoff evapotranspiration and infiltration based on a new irrigation strategy fig 3 step 1 the new irrigation strategy from values reported in massey et al 2017 represented an increase in irrigation frequency and application rates this re calibration was performed through small adjustments to curve numbers from the re calibrated annagnps simulation the infiltration beyond the vadose zone referred to as recharge and noted as inf 1 in fig 3 step 1 represents the condition in which surface flow and infiltration were adjusted to match the observed streamflow at the watershed infiltration inf 1 and irrigation irr 1 where entered as input into the modflow simulation to estimate aquifer levels preliminary evaluation by comparing observed with simulated indicated overestimation in some locations and under estimation in others this was expected as the irrigation application rates entered represent regional average values over multiple years for individual crops in step 2 fig 3 a custom optimization algorithm was employed to calibrate irrigation application rates in time and space the optimization algorithm was developed to run the modflow simulation iteratively and perform adjustments to irrigation application rates inf 1 was fixed despite the large number of wells in the watershed fig 4a only a small number contained observations fig 4b therefore the wells with observed water levels were used to determine zones of influence fig 4c individual well with observation was used as the basis to create voronoi polygons which were used to select group of modflow wells the pbias between individual well observed and simulated heads was used as the objective function in the optimization algorithm additionally although the observed well heads were measured twice a year the specific date of observations varied per year and per well this was accounted for by matching individual observed value to the same date in the simulation results since the simulation period was continuous after each modflow simulation the irrigation application rates were increased decreased by a set percentage based on pbias values the delta increase decrease between iterations was determined based on the magnitude of the different in pbias values 10 5 and 2 only wells with more than 5 observations during the simulation period were considered the percentage of increase decrease was assigned equally to all modflow cells within the zone of influence and with irrigation values based on information from the annagnps simulation this approach allowed to keep the recharge based on surface processes re calibrated annagnps simulation inf 1 constant and adjust aquifer withdraw based on observed well heads to improve the computational efficiency of the optimization algorithm only the top 5 layers out of the originally 13 were considered from the meras 2 1 modflow simulation improving the individual simulation execution time from 3 h to 40 m the new irrigation strategy generated in step2 irr 2 was entered back into the annagnps model fig 3 step 3 a custom program was developed to map the modflow generated observation files into the annagnps management and irrigation files this process yielded 183 different application rates initially a specific crop would have one value per month but in this step the same crop could have multiple application rates for the same month the new irrigation strategy yielded higher irrigation application rate values than the initial irrigation strategy causing an increase in infiltration and surface runoff during the growing season the difference in infiltration between the step 1 and step3 was assumed to be irrigation losses given that the main practice adopted in this region is furrow or flood irrigation and this practice often has on average 10 35 of the irrigation applied converted into runoff all irrigation strategies entered into annagnps assumed no irrigation loss in step4 multiple runs of the annagnps model were performed using irr 2 strategy but varying percentages of irrigation loss by 20 40 and 60 3 results and discussion 3 1 annagnps simulation describing surface water conditions comparison of monthly streamflow at the watershed s outlet when using the regional average irrigation rates indicated a good agreement during the calibration and validation periods october 2002 beginning of observed streamflow data to december 2008 and january 2009 to december 2015 respectively table 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias values were used as metrics for the selection of the simulation best representing surface flows increasing and decreasing crop growing season and non crop curve numbers affected overland flow differently the option s4 with reduced crop curve numbers by 6 from the initial calibrated validated simulation was selected fig 5a simulation results indicate that irrigation amounts and frequency can effect streamflow in this watershed the relationship between irrigation and stream flow has been shown in previous regional studies analyzing long term streamflow records which has revealed hydrologic alteration coincided with locations with irrigated cropland yasarer et al 2020 relative difference between streamflow estimated by annagnps simulations s1 and s4 occurred in months during the growing season which also coincide with irrigation activities as expected fig 5b an important note to consider is that the annagnps model does not simulate baseflow and specifically in this watershed there is a possibility to have both losing and gaining streams depending on the irrigation intensity locations with intensive irrigation have shown to have declining baseflows yasarer et al 2020 while locations close to recharge sources mississippi river present baseflow additionally irrigation application rates adopted consist of values that vary monthly per crop therefore the same application rate is used for a specific crop and a specific month regardless of the location in the watershed and year being simulated this characterization of irrigation frequency and application rate is an improvement over the original automated irrigation strategy but still contains uncertainty of individual irrigation practices in time and space despite the inherent uncertainties by the lack of detailed field based information describing irrigation frequency and application rates and the potential baseflow variations due to groundwater level changes the generated annagnps simulation represents a good characterization of the farming activities impacting streamflow at the outlet this simulation captures increased crop yield over time annual changes in land use land cover and respective crop type representative schedule of farming operations per crop and typical irrigation strategies resulting agreement between simulated and observed streamflow indicates a proper balance between surface flow and infiltration amounts an important step in characterizing surface water and groundwater flow exchange 3 2 modflow simulation describing groundwater conditions infiltration rates and irrigation strategies outputted from the re calibrated annagnps simulation were entered into the modflow simulation an automated calibration of irrigation application rates was used to iteratively adjust irrigation rates by comparing individual simulated well heads with observed values at the end of the modflow simulation the cost function selected was pbias metric calculated for individual well inspection of optimization results revealed that most of the evaluated wells converged to the optimal solution the adjustment was made to withdraw amounts while keeping the aquifer recharge from surface processes constant inf 1 this approach improved the individual well characterization in which both the seasonal variation representing rotations of growing season and regular season and the overall trend are represented fig 6a agreement between simulated and observed indicates proper characterization of irrigation amounts and frequency a total of 25 iterations were carried out and the selection of the iteration containing the optimal solution was determined based on manual analysis of the results this was necessary because this is a complex system in which linear changes in the aquifer withdraw flow from an individual well and respective zone of influence affects the well water s head in a non linear manner in addition to individual well withdraw there are other factors controlling aquifer flow dynamics which can cause change in a well head changes in withdraw in surrounding wells can lead to decreased in groundwater levels even if the well in question does not have withdrawn for example for well observation 44 it can be observed a significant convergence towards the optimal solution until iteration 12 which afterwards the nse leveled off not used in the objective function of the optimization algorithm but used in the visual inspection of results and the pbias declined fig 6b an important note to reiterate is that the instability of the system can be attributed to their non linearity response to multiple uncoordinated changes of individual well flow balance and their impact to the overall system because objective functions were defined per individual wells another global metric was used in conjunction with visual inspection of local fitness metrics to determine the overall optimal solution optimal iteration irrigation application rates from values determined in iteration 12 was selected as the optimal solution fig 6c this iteration maximized global nse minimized global pbias and after inspection of individual well results revealed that this solution did not yield any well dry in some later iterations a few wells were estimated to dry out given the continued increase in withdraw to match observed comparison of simulated and observed values for all well heads and for all time periods during the simulation indicated a significant improvement from the simulation prior to the optimization methods fig 7 additionally the simulated aquifer potentiometric surface at the end of the simulation was compared with observed potentiometric surface generated from well observations and showed good agreement fig 8 the overall trends north south and west east were represented properly and the largest discrepancies were found at the edges of the watershed uncertainties at the watershed edges represented in the potentiometric profiles can be attributed to significant sources sinks of groundwater located outside the study site to the west the contribution of the mississippi river to the aquifer was represented by constant heads which vary in time but are constant in space it is possible that this recharge could be localized or at least spatially variable in the southeastern portion of the study area there is a depression cone caused by significant zones of irrigation this was described as head dependent boundaries using the modflow constant head module with values that varied in space but not time due lack of available information this could be a potential source of uncertainty additionally given the limited number of modflow cells containing wells with water level observations irrigation application rates were adjusted by blocks containing multiple modflow cells voronoi polygons in fig 4c this was needed to assure all the modflow cells with irrigation were adjusted but could also be a source of uncertainty albeit the potential uncertainties quantitative and visual comparisons between observed and simulated water levels indicated that the initial recharge represented by deep percolation calculated using calibrated annagnps simulation in step1 inf 1 and the final withdraw amounts represented by the final irrigation application rate calculated using the calibrated modflow simulation in step2 irr 2 described adequately the surface flows affecting the aquifer water levels during the simulation period 3 2 1 integrated annagnps modflow solution in step 1 anthropogenic and natural drivers impacting surface flow and by consequence infiltration rates were described calibrated based on existing conditions however increased irrigation application rates determined in step 2 required re evaluation of surface processes surface flow and infiltration to assure a closed system resulting aquifer withdraw rates from the optimized modflow calibration step were entered back into the annagnps simulation this required a spatial and temporal mapping between modflow cells and annagnps cells in order to revise farming management schedule due to more complex irrigation strategies fig 9 in the prior irrigation strategy for a given month the application rate value was considered static ie a single value was used per crop and per month throughout the simulation period and independent of the location in the watershed adjustments to match aquifer potentiometric values yielded temporal and spatial varying application rates in addition to the increase in the number of fields being irrigated see changes from 2000 to 2013 in fig 9 an increase in application rates can be observed additionally the same crop type at a specific month can receive different application rates in different locations of the watershed see changes between irrigation strategy 1 and 2 for july 2013 in fig 9 the revised irrigation strategy is considered dynamic as application rates vary per crop per month and per location in the watershed this improved characterization of irrigation practices in time and space assures a more realistic representation of existing conditions and surface water groundwater flows entering the irr 2 into the annagnps simulation resulted in higher infiltration fig 10 and higher streamflow amounts table 2 as expected the increased streamflow at the watershed s outlet yielded acceptable accuracy statistics with slightly improved values when compared to the simulation calibrated in step1 for both the calibration and validation periods however the infiltration rates obtained were significantly higher red circles and blue triangles in fig 10 the difference between the two infiltration rates is assumed to be due to irrigation losses given that the dominant practices in this watershed is furrow flood irrigation which have potential application efficiencies of approximately 45 80 irmak et al 2011 calibrated values obtained for inf 1 and irr 2 were held constant and three new scenarios were developed by varying irrigation losses by 20 40 and 60 the closest alternative to the base inf 1 is the one with lowest efficiency of 60 loss red circles and dark green diamonds in fig 10 however when a significant conversion of irrigation into surface runoff yielded over estimation of streamflow indicating the irrigation loss to be smaller than 60 table 2 this analysis considered a constant irrigation efficiency rate for the entire watershed and throughout the simulation period what could be a source of uncertainty the integrated annagnps modflow modeling approach was necessary to describe and simulate the complex processes affecting surface water and groundwater flows over time and space and therefore to assure this watershed is evaluated as a closed system 3 3 impact of irrigation strategies to surface water and groundwater levels irrigation efficiency has a direct effect on groundwater levels in this region estimates of the mean water level at the end of the 16 year modflow simulation period for all wells with observations indicated changes of 2 m 3 m and 3 8 m when compared to the observed values for irrigation reductions of 20 40 and 60 respectively results obtained when evaluating the potential reduction of 28 in irrigation for rice and soybean 40 for corn irrigation and no reduction for cotton estimated a 6 m mean water level reduction at the end of a 50 year modflow simulation for the entire 17 870 km2 mississippi river alluvial plain region haugh et al 2020 despite the differences in irrigation efficiencies considered and temporal and spatial scales between the two studies they both estimate meaningful ground water level gains by reduction in irrigation application rates additionally reduction of irrigation practices has different effect in different locations in the region profiles generated from potentiometric water level surfaces generated from modflow simulations with varying irrigation rates demonstrate how the effect to water levels of reducing irrigation rates varies in space fig 11 in the northern portion of the watershed the different in water levels is less than 1 3 m while in the southern portion greater than 3 m this was also observed in the study by haugh 2020 when considering only the central area of the mississippi river alluvial plain region in which yielded an estimated mean water level reduction of 7 3 m similarly baseflow in many streams in the mississippi river alluvial plain region are also impacted by irrigation practices primarily during the growing season barlow and clark 2011 assessment of accuracy statistics of monthly streamflow with different irrigation efficiencies have yielded different results of nse and pbias table 2 the scenario using irrigation strategy derived from the optimized calibration using modflow has slightely improved the agreement from previous results of different irrigation amounts first row in table 1 and first row in table 2 it is noteworthy the most improvement to be in the january 2009 to december 2015 period signifying increased streamflow from increased irrigation adoption and higher rates reduction in pbias from 14 to 4 5 4 conclusions in agricultural systems where crop yields are supported by intense irrigation practices primarily from groundwater sources an important aspect is to develop an understanding of the different surface processes driving surface water groundwater and their integrated fluxes in this study the annagnps watershed pollution and management model was integrated with the modflow groundwater flow model for characterization and quantification of such fluxes the integrated and closed modeling technology in conjunction with observed values of streamflow at the outlet and water levels in selected wells provide an enhanced approach to estimate irrigation strategies with application rates varying in time and space at field scale these estimates represent a more realistic characterization of irrigation practices given the limited availability of information describing irrigation strategies by individual agricultural producers this is an important step in describing existing conditions and improving understanding of agricultural systems with high intensity irrigation practices such as occurring in the upper sunflower river watershed the spatial variation supports the identification of critical locations for the selection and targeted placement of tailored conservation practices thus quantifying their local and watershed wide impacts the integrated modeling technology also illustrates the sensitivity of streamflow and groundwater levels to irrigation practices reduction of irrigation application rates by 20 40 yielded higher simulated groundwater heads at the end of the simulation period and therefore indicate the potential to positively impact the long term sustainability of the aquifer with the adoption of more efficient irrigation strategies the proposed technology can serve as the foundation for future studies to quantify the potential impact of fully or partially replacing groundwater with surface water sources these technologies can promote the adoption of more efficient irrigation practices that supports the long term sustainability of groundwater resources while assuring high levels of crop production

relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors would like to thank c j haugh for the support and technical advice on the development

9477,management of water resources is essential to maintain sustainable agricultural productivity and preserve groundwater and surface ecosystems the long term sustainability of these systems depends on the understanding of complex surface groundwater flow interactions at different temporal and spatial scales and the impacts of agricultural practices on water use to support these efforts an integrated annagnps modflow modeling technology is proposed and evaluated it combines the capability of the annagnps model to detailed characterization of farming practices with groundwater flow estimation tools of the modflow model the annagnps modflow model was evaluated in upper sunflower river watershed at the lower mississippi river alluvial plain the integrated modeling technology in conjunction with observed values of streamflow at the outlet and well water levels were used to estimate irrigation strategies with application rates varying in time and space at field scale utilization of improved irrigation characterization have provided evidence of the sensitivity of streamflow and groundwater levels to irrigation strategies simulation results indicate that a reduction of irrigation application rates by 20 40 can impact aquifer long term water levels this finding supports the need to investigate more efficient irrigation strategies to promote the aquifer sustainable use the proposed technology provides a management tool critical to understanding and evaluating the impact of agricultural practices irrigation and aquifer recharge strategies that are important to sustaining water resources in irrigated agricultural watersheds keywords annagnps modflow irrigation groundwater sustainable agriculture 1 introduction the management of water resources is of paramount importance to maintaining and increasing agricultural productivity while preserving groundwater natural reserves and surface ecosystems this equilibrium is of special significance in locations dominated by agricultural activities reliant on irrigation from groundwater because the long term sustainability of these systems is vulnerable when irrigation demand overcomes the aquifer recharge capacity in order to attain long term sustainability of utilization of groundwater resources in these conditions it is necessary to develop alternative irrigation strategies that are more efficient and do not rely exclusively on groundwater sources the challenge resides in the characterization and representation of complex hydrologic and hydraulic dynamics that are the result of several interrelated natural and anthropogenic drivers acting at different temporal and spatial scales this complexity requires the development of long term integrated hydrological models capable of characterizing surface groundwater flow interactions in response to these drivers kim et al 2008 development and application of hydrologic models allow for the characterization of existing conditions by depicting spatial temporal changes and for subsequent implementation of decision support systems for improved natural resource management the recognition of this need has prompted to an increase in the number of studies devoted to the development of integrated surface water and groundwater modeling technologies markstrom et al 2008 kim et al 2008 refsgaard et al 2010 gusman et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 2017 chunn et al 2019 most developments have focused on integrating existing watershed and or basin scale surface hydrologic models with models simulating flow of groundwater through aquifers this approach has advantages as it builds upon well established and tested technologies in each domain the integration of the u s geological survey precipitation runoff modeling system prms model leavesley et al 1983 with the u s geological survey modular ground water flow model modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1983 led to the development of the ground water and surface water flow gflow model markstrom et al 2008 several studies were conducted to develop technology for the integration of the modflow model mcdonald et al 1983 with the soil and water assessment tool swat model arnold et al 1998 for application in a wide range of conditions sophocleous and perkins 2000 kim et al 2008 gusman et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 the internal swat calculations of soil deep percolation representing aquifer recharge are integrated with modflow groundwater flow calculations representing contribution of groundwater to streams therefore creating technology with flow exchange capabilities between surface water and groundwater and as result improving characterization of irrigated watersheds this integrated approach has been employed to study surface water and groundwater interaction and their potential impacts interconnection to stream flow sophocleous et al 1999 kim et al 2008 bailey et al 2016 sediment and nutrients sith et al 2019 crop irrigation gao et al 2019 wei and bailey 2019 and future climatic estimates chunn et al 2019 the challenge of the swat modflow integration resides on basic modeling unit differences between these models in the modflow model the most common basic modeling unit representation is a three dimensional grid system in the swat model the basic modeling unit consists of sub watersheds which are further sub divided into hydrologic response units hrus based on unique combinations of land use farming management and soil type the hrus are not identified spatially by the model and their information is aggregated per sub watershed unit gassman et al 2007 additionally in agricultural watersheds with small fields and highly dynamic farming practices the scale differences between surface basic modeling units sub watersheds and individual fields may increase uncertainty by failing to capture spatial temporal variations of farming practices including irrigation strategies the level of watershed discretization can affect daily calculations of water balance infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration because multiple flow processes are calculated based on parameters describing soil type land use cover farming management topography and others tripathi et al 2006 improved databases capable of describing a large number of unique farming management schedules and associated operations including irrigation at field scale have the potential to quantify water balance at higher spatial and temporal resolutions providing a better representation of existing conditions these detailed estimates could support the quantification of farming practices contribution to aquifer water levels over time in this study the annualized agricultural non point source annagnps watershed pollution model bingner et al 2018 was integrated with the modflow model to quantify the effect of farming practices to aquifer levels at the upper sunflower river watershed specifically the objectives were the following 1 development of technology to allow for exchange of daily surface water groundwater flow information between annagnps and modflow models 2 assess the annagnps model capabilities of describing daily farming practices for individual sub catchments and their potential contribution of aquifer recharge withdraw and 3 evaluation of the integrated technology at a dynamic agricultural watershed with farming practices reliant on irrigation primarily from groundwater findings are sought to serve as basis for future development of decision support systems designed to improve irrigation efficiency to continue support production while reducing long term stress to surface and groundwater resources 2 methods 2 1 upper sunflower river watershed the upper sunflower river watershed is located in the midsouth region of the usa within the lower mississippi river basin fig 1a the watershed is within the mississippi river alluvial plain floodplain and is considered one of the most productive regions in the u s using the u s geological survey station 7288500 at sunflower county in the state of mississippi as the outlet the watershed drainage area is 188549 ha fig 1b the topography is flat with elevation ranging from 26 m to 65 m above mean sea level for the entire watershed additionally a common practice in this region is mechanically level fields to aid furrow or flood irrigation average precipitation between 1970 and 2016 in the watershed is 1321 mm with higher precipitation intensities and amounts in the spring and winter months during the growing season minimum and maximum annual average temperatures for the same time period are 17 c and 29 c respectively the land cover is primarily agricultural 94 with main row crops as corn soybeans and cotton over the years corn and soybean production has increased in detriment of traditional crops such as cotton usda 2021 wallander et al 2011 as percentage of the watershed total area cotton changed from 19 in 2000 to 5 in 2015 while combined soybean and corn changed from 61 in 2000 to 73 in 2015 fig 6 in momm et al 2019a the combination of warm temperatures with high humidity and lack of regular precipitation during the growing season has led to adoption of groundwater based irrigation from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer earlier studies estimated approximately 96 of the aquifer withdraw of the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer is used to support agriculture practices through irrigation usgs 2009 specifically in the mississippi river alluvial plain region it is estimated that in 2013 irrigation was applied in 100 of rice 67 of corn 61 of soybean and 56 of cotton massey et al 2017 an upward trend in the number of well permits between 2001 and 2016 indicates a continued adoption of irrigation practice from groundwater ymd 2021 rising concerns of reduction of baseflow in the sunflower river kebede et al 2014 and to aquifer levels dropping clark and hart 2009 clark et al 2013 detailed description of the watershed physical soil topography climate weather and anthropogenic characteristics yearly land cover yearly yield yearly spatially varying irrigation adoption rates and typical farming management practices are provided in momm and others 2019a similarly regional aquifer and geology characteristics are described in previous studies conducted by the u s geological survey clark and hart 2009 clark et al 2013 2 2 the annagnps pollution and watershed management model 2 2 1 model description the development of the annagnps model by the u s department of agriculture was driven by the need to manage mitigate nonpoint source pollutants specifically in agricultural ungauged watersheds the annagnps model contains modules to identify different sources of pollutants to evaluate multiple conservation practices and their integrated effect in space and time the model operates at a continuous daily time step solving water balance at field scale to estimate infiltration surface runoff evapotranspiration sediment erosion transport and deposition nutrient nitrogen phosphorus and organic carbon and pesticide loads bingner et al 2018 further detailed description of the annagnps model s modules and calculations has been provided in previous studies upadhyay et al 2018 momm et al 2019a 2019b bisantino et al 2015 yuan et al 2008 chahor et al 2014 and therefore only a brief description of the annagnps model framework is provided in the annagnps modeling structure the watershed is subdivided into two basic modeling units a sub catchment referred to as annagnps cell and concentrated flow referred to as annagnps reach annagnps cells are sought to represent agricultural fields annagnps cells and reaches are hierarchically connected to capture surface water flow to a single outlet one key characteristic of the annagnps model is the capability of describing farming practices on a daily basis and at a field scale this requires the development of databases describing each annagnps cell in terms of farming management schedules incorporating crop growth soil disturbance by farming equipment irrigation strategy pesticides application and others additionally the model includes tools to estimate loads from ephemeral gully sources momm et al 2012 bingner et al 2016 and sediment load reduction from riparian vegetation strips momm et al 2014 and sedimentation ponds yasarer et al 2018 watersheds are commonly subdivided into hundreds to thousands of annagnps cells allowing for detailed characterization of farming and irrigation practices in time and space 2 2 2 development of the annagnps simulation the annagnps simulation developed and described in momm et al 2019a was used as the starting point for this study in this annagnps simulation the watershed was subdivided into 3992 annagnps cells figs 2a and 1602 annagnps reaches fig 2b representing sub catchments at field scale and concentrated flow paths respectively databases containing the typical one year farming practice schedule and list of operations for the dominant crops representing 90 of the watershed yearly sequence of land cover land use from 2000 to 2015 temporally variable crop yield and spatial temporal irrigation information were combined to develop the annagnps management input database a total of 3143 unique 16 year crop rotations were generated describing farming activities schedule operations irrigation strategy and crop yield in time and space this simulation was calibrated and validated using observed monthly streamflow at the outlet momm et al 2019a the only change was the introduction of new irrigation strategies in the initial annagnps simulation automated irrigation strategies were adopted in this approach a single application rate for each crop was used for all months during the growing season and all locations in the watershed one application rate per crop additionally irrigation would only occur if soil moisture conditions were indicative of a water deficit based on daily water balance calculations this was considered a conservative estimate of irrigation amounts and frequency a manual irrigation strategy was used instead and was based on 12 years monthly averages from april to september for corn maize soybean rice and cotton fig 5 in massey et al 2017 the addition of new irrigation strategies required updating of the annagnps management input database to reflect the new irrigation strategies containing different application rates per crop and per month during the growing season the increased irrigation rates and frequency of the new strategy affected runoff and therefore a re calibration was performed by increasing reducing curve numbers for all crop non crop curves step 1 in fig 3 this resulted in a new calibrated annagnps simulation that based on comparisons with observed streamflow yielded infiltration beyond the vadose zone assumed to be representative of surface processes box 7 in fig 3 2 3 the modflow groundwater model 2 3 1 description the modflow model was developed by the u s geological survey to solve differential equations depicting flow in confined unconfined aquifers using finite difference method mcdonald et al 1983 it has been designed with modular capabilities to allow users to select from multiple optional packages to better represent groundwater flow in a wide range of aquifer conditions in both steady state and transient conditions recent versions of the modflow model have capabilities to support multiple basic modeling unit representations with the most common one being regular three dimensional grids the modflow model does not have the capabilities to estimate processes affecting water balance at the surface and therefore this information is often estimated externally to the model or generated during the calibration process guzman et al 2015 key packages relevant for this study are the following the well package to simulate groundwater withdraw streamflow package to simulate flow between streams and aquifers the constant head package to aid in defining boundary conditions 2 3 2 development of the modflow simulation the modflow simulation developed by u s geological survey for the mississippi embayment regional aquifer was used as the basis for the development of a new modflow simulation tailored for this study the original modflow simulation referred to as meras 1 0 and described in clark and hart 2009 was developed to estimate the long term effect of water withdraw to the aquifer at a regional scale fig 1a this simulation was implemented using the modflow 2005 version with spatial resolution of 1 6 km cell size 13 geological layers temporal resolution of six months and total simulation period of 137 years clark and hart 2009 mckee and clark 2003 this simulation was updated with enhanced water usage estimates and localized aquifer properties in 2013 and it is referred to as meras 2 0 clark et al 2013 another revision was performed 2020 meras 2 1 for a study specific to the mississippi river alluvial plain in which the simulation period was extended and irrigation amounts were updated haugh et al 2020 the meras 2 1 simulation was used as the basis for the development of the modflow simulation used in this study the meras 2 1 simulation originally developed using modflow 2005 was ported to the latest version of the modflow model modflow 6 the raster grids were resampled to 984 m spatial resolution and only the top five layers were considered fig 2c the simulation period was set from 2000 to 2015 with daily temporal resolution to match simulation period and temporal resolution of the annagnps simulation the packages used for a transient state simulation include the following rectilinear discretization initial conditions node property flow observation storage package output control streamflow routing recharge package well package time variant specified head the recharge and well packages require time series generated by the annagnps model the streamflow routing package was included to estimate flow between the main channel of the sunflower river stream order 4 6 blue line in fig 2c and the aquifer the flowlines were downloaded from the u s national hydrography dataset plus epa 2020 minimally edited to match flowlines generated by topographic analysis of lidar based dem and processed using the sfrmaker computer program to generate the necessary inputs for the modflow streamflow routing package leaf et al 2021 the aquifer immediate underneath the upper sunflower river watershed being simulated represents only a subset of a large system and therefore the definition of appropriate boundaries conditions is of vital importance in this modeling effort three head dependent boundary conditions were included to aid in the characterization of initial heads and the capture of hydrologic conditions located outside of the study area but influencing flow within the study area such as rivers and adjacent geologic units these boundaries conditions were defined based on conceptual interpretation of the regional flow system first the contribution from the mississippi river to the aquifer was represented by using the constant head package to simulate modflow cells located in the northwest of the study site green raster grid cells in fig 2c these modflow cells were defined to have flow that varied in time daily based on average gage height observations between two stream gage stations located in memphis tn and helena ar missing stream gage observations were generated by averaging the previous and following day to obtain a continuous dataset second a large cone of depression located outside of the study area southeast of it was represented by using the constant head package to represent modflow cells red raster grid cells in fig 2c defined to have heads varying in space the gradient for the depression cone was obtained from the usgs potentiometric surface for the spring of 2016 mcguire et al 2019 the third boundary condition adopted was the definition initial heads several aquifer level values were evaluated as potential initial conditions initial heads in first day of the modflow simulation and the potentiometric surface generated from observed well heads for the spring of 2000 was selected due to improved overall model convergence and its capture of seasonal variations 2 4 annagnps modflow integration 2 4 1 enhancements to the annagnps model the annagnps model was enhanced with changes to the model s irrigation component and with the addition of a new modflow component in the irrigation component a new irrigation source tracking capability was added this new feature allows for the development of irrigation strategies specifying the irrigation water source two options are available within the model to designate the source of irrigation water either from groundwater or from surface water the development of the capability to designate irrigation water sources allows individual annagnps cells to be characterized by multiple irrigation strategies containing mixed water sources varying in time therefore simulations of combined groundwater and surface water irrigation strategies can be simulated and evaluated within the annagnps model the implemented annagnps modflow component generates input files for utilization with the modflow 6 model during execution time two timeseries for use with the modflow model components recharge and well these input files are formatted as modflow time series for direct ingestion by the modflow model s recharge and well components annagnps daily infiltration beyond the vadose zone represents a source of aquifer recharge similarly annagnps daily irrigation application rate represents aquifer withdraw via irrigation wells both infiltration beyond the vadose zone and irrigation application rates are reported per annagnps cell per day given that there are changes in land cover yearly and therefore farming management changes in irrigation application rates over time increased adoption of irrigation practices this leads to complex fluxes exchanges between surface and subsurface systems the annagnps irrigation component was integrated with the annagnps modflow component allowing the user to define the irrigation source from either surface water or groundwater source and this is reflected in the modflow time series generated another new output generated depicts the surface groundwater flow by reporting irrigation rate irrigation source and percolation into vadose zone for all annagnps cells at daily time step this output database was created to provide an improved assessment describing the irrigation strategy s impact on the daily water balance for each annagnps cell the assignment of annagnps cells to modflow cells was based on gis analysis and was used to inform the one to one association between annagnps cells and modflow cells 2 4 2 calibration of the integrated annagnps modflow modeling system the calibration of the integrated annagnps modflow system was performed in incremental steps the objective is to represent existing conditions of farming practices and climatic weather factors effect to the surface water and groundwater flows in the first step the annagnps simulation was re calibrated using observed streamflow at the watershed s outlet to estimate amounts of surface runoff evapotranspiration and infiltration based on a new irrigation strategy fig 3 step 1 the new irrigation strategy from values reported in massey et al 2017 represented an increase in irrigation frequency and application rates this re calibration was performed through small adjustments to curve numbers from the re calibrated annagnps simulation the infiltration beyond the vadose zone referred to as recharge and noted as inf 1 in fig 3 step 1 represents the condition in which surface flow and infiltration were adjusted to match the observed streamflow at the watershed infiltration inf 1 and irrigation irr 1 where entered as input into the modflow simulation to estimate aquifer levels preliminary evaluation by comparing observed with simulated indicated overestimation in some locations and under estimation in others this was expected as the irrigation application rates entered represent regional average values over multiple years for individual crops in step 2 fig 3 a custom optimization algorithm was employed to calibrate irrigation application rates in time and space the optimization algorithm was developed to run the modflow simulation iteratively and perform adjustments to irrigation application rates inf 1 was fixed despite the large number of wells in the watershed fig 4a only a small number contained observations fig 4b therefore the wells with observed water levels were used to determine zones of influence fig 4c individual well with observation was used as the basis to create voronoi polygons which were used to select group of modflow wells the pbias between individual well observed and simulated heads was used as the objective function in the optimization algorithm additionally although the observed well heads were measured twice a year the specific date of observations varied per year and per well this was accounted for by matching individual observed value to the same date in the simulation results since the simulation period was continuous after each modflow simulation the irrigation application rates were increased decreased by a set percentage based on pbias values the delta increase decrease between iterations was determined based on the magnitude of the different in pbias values 10 5 and 2 only wells with more than 5 observations during the simulation period were considered the percentage of increase decrease was assigned equally to all modflow cells within the zone of influence and with irrigation values based on information from the annagnps simulation this approach allowed to keep the recharge based on surface processes re calibrated annagnps simulation inf 1 constant and adjust aquifer withdraw based on observed well heads to improve the computational efficiency of the optimization algorithm only the top 5 layers out of the originally 13 were considered from the meras 2 1 modflow simulation improving the individual simulation execution time from 3 h to 40 m the new irrigation strategy generated in step2 irr 2 was entered back into the annagnps model fig 3 step 3 a custom program was developed to map the modflow generated observation files into the annagnps management and irrigation files this process yielded 183 different application rates initially a specific crop would have one value per month but in this step the same crop could have multiple application rates for the same month the new irrigation strategy yielded higher irrigation application rate values than the initial irrigation strategy causing an increase in infiltration and surface runoff during the growing season the difference in infiltration between the step 1 and step3 was assumed to be irrigation losses given that the main practice adopted in this region is furrow or flood irrigation and this practice often has on average 10 35 of the irrigation applied converted into runoff all irrigation strategies entered into annagnps assumed no irrigation loss in step4 multiple runs of the annagnps model were performed using irr 2 strategy but varying percentages of irrigation loss by 20 40 and 60 3 results and discussion 3 1 annagnps simulation describing surface water conditions comparison of monthly streamflow at the watershed s outlet when using the regional average irrigation rates indicated a good agreement during the calibration and validation periods october 2002 beginning of observed streamflow data to december 2008 and january 2009 to december 2015 respectively table 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias values were used as metrics for the selection of the simulation best representing surface flows increasing and decreasing crop growing season and non crop curve numbers affected overland flow differently the option s4 with reduced crop curve numbers by 6 from the initial calibrated validated simulation was selected fig 5a simulation results indicate that irrigation amounts and frequency can effect streamflow in this watershed the relationship between irrigation and stream flow has been shown in previous regional studies analyzing long term streamflow records which has revealed hydrologic alteration coincided with locations with irrigated cropland yasarer et al 2020 relative difference between streamflow estimated by annagnps simulations s1 and s4 occurred in months during the growing season which also coincide with irrigation activities as expected fig 5b an important note to consider is that the annagnps model does not simulate baseflow and specifically in this watershed there is a possibility to have both losing and gaining streams depending on the irrigation intensity locations with intensive irrigation have shown to have declining baseflows yasarer et al 2020 while locations close to recharge sources mississippi river present baseflow additionally irrigation application rates adopted consist of values that vary monthly per crop therefore the same application rate is used for a specific crop and a specific month regardless of the location in the watershed and year being simulated this characterization of irrigation frequency and application rate is an improvement over the original automated irrigation strategy but still contains uncertainty of individual irrigation practices in time and space despite the inherent uncertainties by the lack of detailed field based information describing irrigation frequency and application rates and the potential baseflow variations due to groundwater level changes the generated annagnps simulation represents a good characterization of the farming activities impacting streamflow at the outlet this simulation captures increased crop yield over time annual changes in land use land cover and respective crop type representative schedule of farming operations per crop and typical irrigation strategies resulting agreement between simulated and observed streamflow indicates a proper balance between surface flow and infiltration amounts an important step in characterizing surface water and groundwater flow exchange 3 2 modflow simulation describing groundwater conditions infiltration rates and irrigation strategies outputted from the re calibrated annagnps simulation were entered into the modflow simulation an automated calibration of irrigation application rates was used to iteratively adjust irrigation rates by comparing individual simulated well heads with observed values at the end of the modflow simulation the cost function selected was pbias metric calculated for individual well inspection of optimization results revealed that most of the evaluated wells converged to the optimal solution the adjustment was made to withdraw amounts while keeping the aquifer recharge from surface processes constant inf 1 this approach improved the individual well characterization in which both the seasonal variation representing rotations of growing season and regular season and the overall trend are represented fig 6a agreement between simulated and observed indicates proper characterization of irrigation amounts and frequency a total of 25 iterations were carried out and the selection of the iteration containing the optimal solution was determined based on manual analysis of the results this was necessary because this is a complex system in which linear changes in the aquifer withdraw flow from an individual well and respective zone of influence affects the well water s head in a non linear manner in addition to individual well withdraw there are other factors controlling aquifer flow dynamics which can cause change in a well head changes in withdraw in surrounding wells can lead to decreased in groundwater levels even if the well in question does not have withdrawn for example for well observation 44 it can be observed a significant convergence towards the optimal solution until iteration 12 which afterwards the nse leveled off not used in the objective function of the optimization algorithm but used in the visual inspection of results and the pbias declined fig 6b an important note to reiterate is that the instability of the system can be attributed to their non linearity response to multiple uncoordinated changes of individual well flow balance and their impact to the overall system because objective functions were defined per individual wells another global metric was used in conjunction with visual inspection of local fitness metrics to determine the overall optimal solution optimal iteration irrigation application rates from values determined in iteration 12 was selected as the optimal solution fig 6c this iteration maximized global nse minimized global pbias and after inspection of individual well results revealed that this solution did not yield any well dry in some later iterations a few wells were estimated to dry out given the continued increase in withdraw to match observed comparison of simulated and observed values for all well heads and for all time periods during the simulation indicated a significant improvement from the simulation prior to the optimization methods fig 7 additionally the simulated aquifer potentiometric surface at the end of the simulation was compared with observed potentiometric surface generated from well observations and showed good agreement fig 8 the overall trends north south and west east were represented properly and the largest discrepancies were found at the edges of the watershed uncertainties at the watershed edges represented in the potentiometric profiles can be attributed to significant sources sinks of groundwater located outside the study site to the west the contribution of the mississippi river to the aquifer was represented by constant heads which vary in time but are constant in space it is possible that this recharge could be localized or at least spatially variable in the southeastern portion of the study area there is a depression cone caused by significant zones of irrigation this was described as head dependent boundaries using the modflow constant head module with values that varied in space but not time due lack of available information this could be a potential source of uncertainty additionally given the limited number of modflow cells containing wells with water level observations irrigation application rates were adjusted by blocks containing multiple modflow cells voronoi polygons in fig 4c this was needed to assure all the modflow cells with irrigation were adjusted but could also be a source of uncertainty albeit the potential uncertainties quantitative and visual comparisons between observed and simulated water levels indicated that the initial recharge represented by deep percolation calculated using calibrated annagnps simulation in step1 inf 1 and the final withdraw amounts represented by the final irrigation application rate calculated using the calibrated modflow simulation in step2 irr 2 described adequately the surface flows affecting the aquifer water levels during the simulation period 3 2 1 integrated annagnps modflow solution in step 1 anthropogenic and natural drivers impacting surface flow and by consequence infiltration rates were described calibrated based on existing conditions however increased irrigation application rates determined in step 2 required re evaluation of surface processes surface flow and infiltration to assure a closed system resulting aquifer withdraw rates from the optimized modflow calibration step were entered back into the annagnps simulation this required a spatial and temporal mapping between modflow cells and annagnps cells in order to revise farming management schedule due to more complex irrigation strategies fig 9 in the prior irrigation strategy for a given month the application rate value was considered static ie a single value was used per crop and per month throughout the simulation period and independent of the location in the watershed adjustments to match aquifer potentiometric values yielded temporal and spatial varying application rates in addition to the increase in the number of fields being irrigated see changes from 2000 to 2013 in fig 9 an increase in application rates can be observed additionally the same crop type at a specific month can receive different application rates in different locations of the watershed see changes between irrigation strategy 1 and 2 for july 2013 in fig 9 the revised irrigation strategy is considered dynamic as application rates vary per crop per month and per location in the watershed this improved characterization of irrigation practices in time and space assures a more realistic representation of existing conditions and surface water groundwater flows entering the irr 2 into the annagnps simulation resulted in higher infiltration fig 10 and higher streamflow amounts table 2 as expected the increased streamflow at the watershed s outlet yielded acceptable accuracy statistics with slightly improved values when compared to the simulation calibrated in step1 for both the calibration and validation periods however the infiltration rates obtained were significantly higher red circles and blue triangles in fig 10 the difference between the two infiltration rates is assumed to be due to irrigation losses given that the dominant practices in this watershed is furrow flood irrigation which have potential application efficiencies of approximately 45 80 irmak et al 2011 calibrated values obtained for inf 1 and irr 2 were held constant and three new scenarios were developed by varying irrigation losses by 20 40 and 60 the closest alternative to the base inf 1 is the one with lowest efficiency of 60 loss red circles and dark green diamonds in fig 10 however when a significant conversion of irrigation into surface runoff yielded over estimation of streamflow indicating the irrigation loss to be smaller than 60 table 2 this analysis considered a constant irrigation efficiency rate for the entire watershed and throughout the simulation period what could be a source of uncertainty the integrated annagnps modflow modeling approach was necessary to describe and simulate the complex processes affecting surface water and groundwater flows over time and space and therefore to assure this watershed is evaluated as a closed system 3 3 impact of irrigation strategies to surface water and groundwater levels irrigation efficiency has a direct effect on groundwater levels in this region estimates of the mean water level at the end of the 16 year modflow simulation period for all wells with observations indicated changes of 2 m 3 m and 3 8 m when compared to the observed values for irrigation reductions of 20 40 and 60 respectively results obtained when evaluating the potential reduction of 28 in irrigation for rice and soybean 40 for corn irrigation and no reduction for cotton estimated a 6 m mean water level reduction at the end of a 50 year modflow simulation for the entire 17 870 km2 mississippi river alluvial plain region haugh et al 2020 despite the differences in irrigation efficiencies considered and temporal and spatial scales between the two studies they both estimate meaningful ground water level gains by reduction in irrigation application rates additionally reduction of irrigation practices has different effect in different locations in the region profiles generated from potentiometric water level surfaces generated from modflow simulations with varying irrigation rates demonstrate how the effect to water levels of reducing irrigation rates varies in space fig 11 in the northern portion of the watershed the different in water levels is less than 1 3 m while in the southern portion greater than 3 m this was also observed in the study by haugh 2020 when considering only the central area of the mississippi river alluvial plain region in which yielded an estimated mean water level reduction of 7 3 m similarly baseflow in many streams in the mississippi river alluvial plain region are also impacted by irrigation practices primarily during the growing season barlow and clark 2011 assessment of accuracy statistics of monthly streamflow with different irrigation efficiencies have yielded different results of nse and pbias table 2 the scenario using irrigation strategy derived from the optimized calibration using modflow has slightely improved the agreement from previous results of different irrigation amounts first row in table 1 and first row in table 2 it is noteworthy the most improvement to be in the january 2009 to december 2015 period signifying increased streamflow from increased irrigation adoption and higher rates reduction in pbias from 14 to 4 5 4 conclusions in agricultural systems where crop yields are supported by intense irrigation practices primarily from groundwater sources an important aspect is to develop an understanding of the different surface processes driving surface water groundwater and their integrated fluxes in this study the annagnps watershed pollution and management model was integrated with the modflow groundwater flow model for characterization and quantification of such fluxes the integrated and closed modeling technology in conjunction with observed values of streamflow at the outlet and water levels in selected wells provide an enhanced approach to estimate irrigation strategies with application rates varying in time and space at field scale these estimates represent a more realistic characterization of irrigation practices given the limited availability of information describing irrigation strategies by individual agricultural producers this is an important step in describing existing conditions and improving understanding of agricultural systems with high intensity irrigation practices such as occurring in the upper sunflower river watershed the spatial variation supports the identification of critical locations for the selection and targeted placement of tailored conservation practices thus quantifying their local and watershed wide impacts the integrated modeling technology also illustrates the sensitivity of streamflow and groundwater levels to irrigation practices reduction of irrigation application rates by 20 40 yielded higher simulated groundwater heads at the end of the simulation period and therefore indicate the potential to positively impact the long term sustainability of the aquifer with the adoption of more efficient irrigation strategies the proposed technology can serve as the foundation for future studies to quantify the potential impact of fully or partially replacing groundwater with surface water sources these technologies can promote the adoption of more efficient irrigation practices that supports the long term sustainability of groundwater resources while assuring high levels of crop production

9478,the digitalization of the agricultural sector through the implementation of cutting edge technologies allows for the optimization of the use of water whose scarcity has become one of the most relevant and complex environmental global problems water consumption data collected on site using different technologies is key to achieving optimal irrigation scheduling technology is also a useful tool that provides a real and transparent inventory of water use in irrigated crops the water footprint obtained in accordance with iso standard 14046 using the life cycle analysis methodology and jointly with irrigation management information allows determining water use efficiency with great accuracy this work presents a decision support system developed for precision irrigation management at farm scale called dsspim the system provides a verifiable inventory of water use and an analysis diagnosis of the adequacy of the irrigation performed using information and communication technologies icts as well as real time knowledge of water inputs and outputs during crop development based on data received from water meters and soil moisture sensors installed in the field additionally to achieve both purposes a methodology is proposed to more accurately estimate rainwater use green water based on real measurements and the use of icts the proposed methodology was applied during one season in two organic crops greenhouse tomatoes and orange trees located in southern spain the model allowed detecting inefficiencies in irrigation water use a comparison between the actual management practices and the practices recommended by the dsspim underlines the importance of irrigation management in improving water use in the case of orange trees different irrigation system management

the main drivers of water resources pressures unesco 2009 irrigated agriculture is the largest human activity using water resources agricultural production accounts for 70 of the world s freshwater withdrawals fao 2017 the demand for freshwater in the agricultural sector is driven by increasing food demand which is directly linked to population growth due to exponential demographic growth the new production systems are characterized by a greater use of inputs sanz 1990 the growing use of inputs along with climate change has intensified the negative effects on both the quantity and quality of water resources fao 2017 to address this problem global agriculture must increase food production without compromising environmental preservation monaghan et al 2013 through strategies for more efficient water use in this context the implementation of precision irrigation systems using cutting edge technologies is among the proposed strategies to use water more efficiently information gathered from the field through remote sensors and sent to be analyzed using information and communication technologies icts is key to accurately determine crop water needs and apply the optimal amount of water at the right time fernández garcía et al 2020 several authors have developed ict tools to support irrigation water management gonzález perea et al 2017 developed a mobile and desktop application that uses ict tools to determine the daily irrigation time for strawberry crops in southwestern spain using agroclimatic and soil information as well as the hydraulic characteristics of the irrigation network alcaide et al 2019 used climate forecasting to determine the optimal fertigation schedule for olive groves in real time based on the theoretical soil water balance the quality of the irrigation water and the crop and soil characteristics in both works soil moisture sensors were used to control scheduled irrigation goldstein et al 2018 applied machine learning techniques to meteorological data soil moisture sensor readings and historical irrigation schedules to capture the unstructured decision making process of the irrigation manager and automatically provide irrigation scheduling similar works casadesús et al 2012 millán et al 2019 have also performed a water balance readjusted with sensor information to determine irrigation scheduling but only for woody crops although rainfall is an essential parameter in optimal irrigation scheduling some works do not take it into account goldstein et al 2018 irrigation programming models usually include rainfall in a simplistic way through general formulations to estimate the effective rainfall and to account for the rainwater water used by the crop alcaide et al 2019 smith and fao 1992 the water footprint wf indicator is a useful tool for analyzing potential water scarcity scenarios because it quantifies the volume of direct and indirect crop water use to produce a unit of output hoekstra 2003 since it was first introduced in 2002 the wf concept has been in constant evolution and some authors have addressed it in the context of life cycle analysis lca in terms of potential impacts on the environment bayart et al 2010 berger and finkbeiner 2010 boulay et al 2016 chapagain and orr 2009 jefferies et al 2012 pfister et al 2009 for this reason iso standard 14046 iso 2014 aims to unify the multiple definitions and methodologies of wf assessment in the methodological context of lca iso standard 14040 iso 2006 the accuracy and interpretation of wf results depend on the spatial temporal scale and quality of the wf inventory phase gonzález perea et al 2016 montesinos et al 2011 in this phase the water input and outputs of the system being assessed are recorded and quantified in irrigated crops water footprint accounting can be applied to evaluate water use efficiency through the relationship between water use and crop yield garcía morillo et al 2015 however wf does not provide information about the adequacy of applied irrigation for this reason it is essential to obtain verifiable quality data on farm water use to identify problems in irrigation facilities and or their operation irrigation management indicators such as relative irrigation supply ris levine 1982 are used to diagnose such situations and make decisions to improve water use efficiency some authors have used icts to acquire the data needed to accurately account for crop wf and linked this information with additional indicators to provide details of how irrigation has been carried out garcía morillo et al 2015 gonzález perea et al 2016 however recorded data have not yet been used to perform optimal irrigation scheduling that takes into account crop water needs in real time this study aims to develop an irrigation management tool that takes full advantage of the utilities of the available field technology sensors and telecommunication systems by jointly analyzing wf ris and irrigation scheduling to maximize water use efficiency to this end a decision support system dss has been developed to determine the real time scheduling of a precision irrigation system for outdoor woody crops and greenhouse horticultural crops with a drip irrigation system the methodological approach involves the use of weather forecasts and real time data recorded by soil water sensors and water meters combined with icts to update irrigation scheduling in real time the information is also analyzed to obtain verifiable wf inventories and irrigation performance indicators and evaluate the efficiency of the precision irrigation system at farm scale in accordance with the iso standard 14046 in addition the proposed decision support system includes a procedure to estimate the amount of green water used by the crops from real soil water data the methodology was applied during the 2019 2020 irrigation season on two commercial farms that produce greenhouse tomato and orange crops in southern spain 2 methodology 2 1 decision support system for precision irrigation management the decision support system developed for precision irrigation management dsspim uses data recorded by sensors installed in the field as well as data on the crop characteristics soil type hydraulic characteristics of the irrigation network climate historical and predicted data and information on water availability and crop yield to provide an optimal weekly irrigation schedule additionally dsspim measures the amount of water the crops use in real time throughout the growing season to obtain an accurate and verifiable wf and uses several irrigation management indicators to assess the irrigation water efficiency thus dsspim is composed of four modules farm characteristics climate and irrigation monitoring data irrigation scheduling and water use analysis diagnosis each of the modules is described below and their interrelations are shown in fig 1 2 1 1 farm characteristics this module collects and manages information about the cultivation of drip irrigated crops on a given farm as well as the data needed to estimate the wf of the crops for woody crops the required data are plantation frame m m and average diameter of the tree canopy m in the case of greenhouse crops the required data include planting dates the spacing between crop lines the slope of the greenhouse roof the start and end dates of roof whitening and the whitening dose kg lime 100 l of water the irrigation network is characterized by the number of pipes per crop line the distance between emitters m the nominal flow rate of the emitters l h and the sector area ha farm water management and use depend on the contracted electricity rate power supply rates differ according to the number duration and distribution of tariff periods the daily number of hours available for irrigation are usually limited due to the farm s electricity rate low cost period or operational conditions to keep the recommended irrigation time within the limits of the available irrigation hours the user must select the tariff type and the irrigation period or manually enter the maximum number of hours available for irrigation from monday to friday and weekends finally the water allowance m3 ha year electrical conductivity of irrigation water ds m soil texture the yield of the previous season and the first day of the growing season and the last day of harvest t ha must be known 2 1 2 climate and irrigation monitoring data collection this module collects climate and water use monitoring data by means of icts the information is then used to calculate the theoretical crop irrigation needs historical climate date and weather forecasts are obtained from public weather services using web scraping techniques real precipitation p and historical potential evapotranspiration eto records are obtained from the nearest public agroclimatic station nas of the regional agroclimatic information network ria 1999 the complete eto time series is used to determine the historical crop requirements daily crop evapotranspiration under optimal and well watered conditions etc pereira et al 2021 is estimated based on eto forecasts calculated from open weather data maximum and minimum daily relative humidity information and data obtained from online weather forecasts maximum and minimum temperature c cloud index wind speed km h the open weather data were taken from the aemet open data system which is the api rest application programming interface representational state transfer of the spanish meteorological agency aemet 2015 the online weather forecast data were obtained from the eltiempo es website pelmorex corp 2017 by web scraping techniques these data are used to calculate the eto of outdoor crops for the next 7 days by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the eto for greenhouse crops is estimated using the equation of a locally calibrated radiation method proposed by fernández et al 2010 weather precipitation forecasts are also obtained from eltiempo es and used in the irrigation scheduling of outdoor crops soil moisture sensors and water meters are used to monitor crop water use although several types of commercial sensors are available for this purpose frequency domain reflectrometry fdr capacitance moisture sensors are the most widely used to monitor and measure changes in soil volumetric water content vwc due to their reliability and ease of use vera et al 2017 for each crop a measurement device with three echo20 10hs capacitive sensors meter group usa was placed at different soil depths to record variations in soil moisture due to crop absorption during the growing season the three sensors were installed in different soil layers one in the upper soil layer at a depth of 10 15 cm one at the depth with the highest root density 20 35 cm and one in the bottom soil layer with few roots a high moisture content in the deepest layer indicates water losses by percolation and hence an inefficient use of irrigation water since irrigation scheduling is done for homogeneous sectors it is necessary to install at least one soil moisture monitoring device in a representative location of each irrigation sector the level of sectorization of each farm will depend on the variability of several factors soil topography and crop variety among others inadequate sectorization would compromise the accuracy of dsspim the amount of water used is recorded by water meters installed at the inlet of each irrigation sector these water meters have an electronic sensor that emits a signal once a volume unit has flowed through the meter soil moisture sensors and water meters are connected to dataloggers with general packet radio service gprs communication that records and transmits measured data in real time to a cloud platform accessible via an api 2 1 3 irrigation scheduling the aim of this module is to determine daily irrigation time for outdoor and greenhouse crops for outdoor crops soil water content is an essential variable in irrigation scheduling when the amount of water stored in the soil can satisfy crop irrigation needs then irrigation is not necessary to determine whether irrigation is needed or not a daily soil water balance is performed for greenhouse crops that do not receive rainwater and are watered with high frequency irrigation the soil s function as a water store is negligible and it can be assumed that soil water content does not change over time fernández et al 2001 the soil water balance is updated daily using the information gathered in the data collection modules the irrigation scheduling module is described in what follows and the module flowchart is shown in fig 2 the total water available in the soil taw mm for a crop is a function of the crop s depth of roots zr m and the soil water contents at field capacity θfc m3 m3 and at the permanent wilting point θpwp m3 m3 the last two parameters depend on the hydrophilic characteristics of the soil they were estimated using the soil water retention curves resulting from the application of the rosetta model which bases its estimations on the soil texture characteristics schaap et al 2001 soil textures were determined in the laboratory from soil samples taken on each farm only a fraction of taw is available for the crop what is known as the readily available water raw mm allen et al 1998 when the soil moisture deficit dr mm or level of moisture depletion reaches raw in the root zone water extraction is more difficult for the plant and its etc is reduced the raw for the orange grove was 50 of taw allen et al 1998 therefore to avoid a decrease in etc 20 of taw was set as the threshold of the allowable depletion level adl mm in the soil to start irrigation to determine drn mm in the soil at the end of day n soil water balance drtheoretical n mm and drreal n mm must be previously calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively adapted from allen et al 1998 eq 1 estimates the soil water deficit without considering runoff and percolation losses 1 dr theoretical n dr n 1 er n i n et c n k s n where drn 1 is the soil moisture depletion of the previous day mm ern is the effective rainfall on day n mm whose calculation is described below for outdoor crops section 2 1 3 1 and for greenhouse crops ern is zero in is the real applied irrigation depth measured by the water meter mm and et c n is the crop evapotranspiration mm calculated as the product of eto on day n and the crop coefficient kc et c n can be calculated from historical eto values recorded by the nearest agroclimatic station or eto predictions calculated using the methodology described in section 2 1 2 when the objective is to determine the dr value of the current day the eto value recorded the previous day by the nas is used however if the purpose is to estimate the dr of the next 7 days eto predictions are used kc at day n allen et al 1998 which depends on the crop type and stage of development in woody crops kc is related to the ground area shaded by trees castel sánchez 2001 while for greenhouse crops it is a function of the accumulated thermal time att since emergence fernández et al 2001 ks is a non dimensional coefficient of water stress allen et al 1998 that quantifies the reduction in transpiration when the soil water deficit exceeds the raw if the water depletion in the root zone is less than the raw the value of this coefficient is equal to 1 eq 2 calculates actual soil moisture depletion from the vwc at field capacity and the vwc recorded on site θreal m3 m3 the latter value is the average of soil moisture records taken at sunset by sensors located in the top and middle soil layers 2 dr real n 1000 θ fc θ real n 1 after irrigation the soil water content exceeds θfc for a while after which the soil drains and the water content is stabilized at sunset the sensors provide information about the remaining water content in the soil after the daily evapotranspiration period when θreal exceeds a certain percentage of the θfc value x the moisture deficit at the end of the day drn is considered 0 and the soil at field capacity conversely if θreal is lower than the set threshold the value assigned to drn will be the highest between drreal n and drtheorical n so the most limiting value was considered to determine the irrigation timing 3 3 d r n 0 θ r e a l x θ f c max d r t h e o r i c a l d r r e a l θ r e a l x θ f c once the irrigation timing is determined using drn daily crop irrigation requirements are calculated according to equation 4 4 cir n et c n k s n er n f ce f pte f rs where etc is the crop evapotranspiration under optimal and well watered conditions and is calculated using the forecast eto values the coefficients fce fpte and frs are correction factors that depend on the electrical conductivity of irrigation water the slope of the greenhouse roof and whitening respectively fernández et al 2001 for outdoor crops the value of the fpte and frs factors is 1 in water scarce regions deficit irrigation strategies are usually applied in woody crops when the water irrigation requirements exceed water rights therefore the theoretical daily irrigation dose inn is calculated according to eq 5 where idcn is the irrigation deficit coefficient and ranges from 0 to 1 depending on the selected irrigation strategy 5 in n c ir n idc n when the crop irrigation needs are fully satisfied fir strategy idcn is equal to 1 for the entire irrigation season in a sustained deficit irrigation sdi strategy idcn is a fraction of the crop irrigation needs and its value remains constant throughout the irrigation season on the other hand in a regulated deficit irrigation strategy rdi a variable fraction of crop irrigation requirements is applied throughout the irrigation season this fraction of the crop irrigation needs depends on the crop cycle and aims to prevent or reduce to the greatest possible extent water stress in the most sensitive crop stages such as flowering or fruit set gonzalez altozano and castel 1999 therefore idc varies during the irrigation season the total amount of irrigation water to be applied in the irrigation season cannot exceed the irrigation water allowance iwa regardless of the irrigation strategy chosen for this reason idc is combined with the average fortnightly etc historical data to distribute the water allowance according to the crop irrigation needs and a fortnightly iwa iwaf is set any deviation from the established limit is recorded by the irrigation meter and at the end of each fortnight the remaining allocation is redistributed proportionally to the irrigation needs of the remaining months of the irrigation season readjusting the established limits every 15 days to avoid exceeding the iwa value at the end of the irrigation season a daily limit of water availability iln is established iln is the quotient between iwaf and the number of days in each half month between 13 and 16 days therefore the actual crop irrigation requirement irn i e the volume of water to be applied in each irrigation event will be equal to the minimum of inn and iln eq 6 6 i r n i n n i n n i l n i l n i n n i l n the theoretical irrigation time tt n hours is calculated by eq 7 considering the efficiency of the irrigation system ie the area of the irrigation sector a ha the nominal emitters flow qe l h and the number of emitters of the irrigation sector ne 7 t t n ir n a 10 4 ie q e n e the programmed watering time cannot exceed the number of available irrigation hours established in the electric supply contract te n thus the recommended irrigation time tr n is the minimum of tt n and te n fig 2 shows the flowchart of the irrigation scheduling procedure using data collected by the sensors via icts the boxes with rounded edges and thick lines in the figure indicate that the data are from the farm characteristics module in the boxes with dashed lines the data have been recorded by sensors on site or remotely and sent via icts to the climate and irrigation monitoring data module the precipitation and eto records at the nas as well as the soil moisture content readings at sunset are updated according to the weather forecasts the aim of this dsspim module is to provide daily optimal irrigation programming for a week so predictions of the soil moisture depletion for the next 7 days are needed to do this the last drn that was calculated is used as a starting value in is the recommended irrigation depth in irn and the effective precipitation ern is obtained with eq 8 using precipitation predictions for the value of pn the accuracy of the irrigation programming affects the values of blue and green water uses by the crops and hence the irrigation water use efficiency 2 1 3 1 efficient rainfall estimation for outdoor crops the water needs of outdoor crops are partially satisfied with rainwater effective rainfall ern in eq 1 is the rainwater fraction stored in the soil that can be used by the plant most existing methodologies estimate er based on monthly rainwater volume ali and mubarak 2017 allen et al 1998 smith and fao 1992 villalobos et al 2009 which reduces the accuracy of daily irrigation scheduling to overcome this problem dsspim includes a procedure to calculate daily er that considers the water storage capacity of the soil which depends on the soil type and the soil moisture content at the onset of the rainfall event eq 8 estimates the effective rainfall using information from the previous day s soil moisture deficit drn 1 eq 3 and the gross rainfall at day n p n mm this equation uses rainfall forecasts and rainfall data recorded by the nas nas rainfall data are used to calculate the effective rainfall of the last day when the purpose is to predict the effective rainfall of the next 7 days precipitation forecasts are used 8 e r n min d r n 1 e t c n k s n p n θ p w p θ n θ f c 0 θ n θ f c if pn is lower than dr n 1 the total gross precipitation can be stored so ern equals pn otherwise er is 0 because soil moisture content is at field capacity the 7 day forward irrigation scheduling requires the ern and etc n forecasts thus eq 8 is calculated using eto and rainfall forecasts 2 1 4 water use analysis diagnosis this module determines the adequacy of the amount of water used according to the crop irrigation needs by means of a joint analysis of the wf and ris indicators the module performs a wf inventory according to iso standard 14046 iso 2014 which provides information on the volume of water used to produce a unit of product the wf inventory estimates the crop water footprint wfc as the sum of the blue wfblue and green wfgreen water footprint components grey water has not been considered in the wf inventory because it is not a real volume of water used by crops this water represents the amount of fresh water that would theoretically be needed to restore the quality of irrigation water returns that have been contaminated during the production process for this reason iso 14046 does not include grey water in the calculation of wf of products and or services lovarelli et al 2016 wfc is normally expressed in m3 t or in l kg and is the sum of the green crop water footprint wfcgreen and the blue crop water footprint wfcblue wfcgreen can be calculated as green crop water use cwugreen m3 ha divided by the crop yield y t ha 9 wf c green cwu green y cwugreen is calculated by eq 10 for outdoor crops and is null for greenhouse crops 10 cwu green 10 n 1 lds er n where the term 10 is a unit conversion factor to change mm into m3 ha lds is the duration of the crop growing season in days and ern is calculated by eq 8 for permanent crops the first day of the growing season is the last harvest day of the previous season to estimate wfcblue the following equation is applied 11 wf c blue cw a blue y where cwablue m3 ha is the total volume of blue water applied to the crop as recorded by the water meters installed on the farm the approach to calculate wfblue presented here differs from other works where wfblue is estimated with the cwublue indicator which is calculated using theoretical irrigation requirements chapagain and orr 2009 hoekstra et al 2009 these methodologies do not take into account indirect water uses or water losses water that does not return to the environment due to inefficiencies in the irrigation system furthermore it ignores situations of over or under irrigation due to the irrigation strategies applied thus cwablue includes all water applications during the crop season including water applied to satisfy crop irrigation needs and water used in different crop management practices e g soil preparation salt washing pipe cleaning etc and water leaks in the irrigation system unless crop management practices involving water use are performed during non irrigation periods or via a separate water network it is difficult to identify the fraction of the water volumes recorded in the meter that correspond to irrigation or other uses required to obtain the product therefore the amount of blue water used during the cropping season is obtained by eq 12 12 cwa blue i 1 wm n 1 lds i n i a i 10 i 1 wm a where in is the daily applied blue water depth mm recorded by the water meter i wm represents the total number of water meters installed on the farm and ai is the area ha associated to each water meter i installed in the different irrigation sectors the denominator of this equation represents the total surface area of the farm monitored with irrigation meters since cwablue is used to calculate wfblue it provides information about the amount of blue water used directly and indirectly to produce a crop production unit in short the crop water footprint is determined by eq 13 13 wf c cwu green cwa blue y when used alone the wf only reports information about how much water was used to obtain a unit of product but it does not provide information about whether the amount of water applied was correct or not therefore to check irrigation water use suitability irrigation adequacy indicators should be used in combination with the wf to evaluate the suitability of the actual applied irrigation the ris indicator was used levine 1982 ris eq 14 relates the amount of water applied recorded in the water meters and the theoretical crop irrigation requirements during crop growing garcía morillo et al 2015 gonzález perea et al 2016 14 ris n 1 lds cwa blue n 1 lds 10 cir ris values around 1 2 indicate that irrigation has been adequately performed considering the inefficiencies of the soil and the irrigation system values below and above 1 2 indicate deficit and excess irrigation respectively 2 2 case studies the methodology was tested on two organic farms in southern spain one with orange tree crops 37 44 9 39 n 5 6 58 69 w and the other with greenhouse tomato crops 36 51 23 32 n 2 24 37 54 w the citrus fruit plantation navelina variety is located in the guadalquivir valley an area that receives about 600 mm of average annual rainfall and where a high percentage of the cultivated land area is dedicated to irrigated crops 28 92 of total national irrigation mapa 2019 the high demand for irrigation water in the guadalquivir basin means that water rights are usually lower than the crop water requirements consequently deficit irrigation strategies are a common practice in the region the planting frame of the trial orange grove was 5 5 m x 4 m and was drip irrigated by an irrigation network organized in 2 ha sectors where irrigation water is distributed through two irrigation laterals per tree line the nominal flow rate of the emitters was 2 8 l h 1 m separation between emitters with a pressure compensation range of 10 40 m the farm receives water from the fuente palmera irrigation association from 00 00 8 00 a m monday to friday and 24 h a day on weekends during the 2019 irrigation season the water allocation assigned to this farm was 5000 m3 ha with a daily eto in the range 0 5 7 8 mm the soil texture of the farm was analyzed in the laboratory and identified as sandy loam with a moisture content at field capacity of 0 28 m3 m3 and a permanent wilting point of 0 1 m3 m3 the average annual yield of the orange grove was 15 t ha considering the growing season as the natural year from the time the harvest finishes in january the trial tomato greenhouse is located in almería southeast spain the water resources in this area are very scarce and under severe pressure from intensive agriculture which aggravates problems of overexploitation pollution and the salinization of aquifers gallardo et al 2013 these circumstances require the optimal use of irrigation water so greenhouse tomatoes are particularly interesting for testing the methodology developed the greenhouse tomato cycle extends from mid august to the end of may without rainfall inputs the greenhouse roof whitening technique was applied from planting to mid september at a dose of 0 25 kg lime l this technique is used to reduce the temperature inside the greenhouse but it also reduces solar radiation inside the greenhouse leading to a reduction in eto fernández et al 2010 during the 2019 2020 season the eto values inside the greenhouse ranged from 0 1 to 4 5 mm the water source for the greenhouse is an irrigation pond fed by a groundwater intake the irrigation network is composed of four irrigation sectors 0 7 ha in which each drip pipe irrigates a line of plants spaced 2 05 m apart the nominal flow rate of the drippers was 4 l h non pressure compensating placed every 0 4 m the average electrical conductivity of the irrigation water was 2 ds m the greenhouse soil was of loamy texture and 27 cm in depth bounded by a hardened profile the moisture content at field capacity was 0 34 m3 m3 and the permanent wilting point was 0 08 m3 m3 under these conditions the average yield of the tomato greenhouse was 109 t ha 10 9 kg m2 for a planting density of 1 5 plants m2 branch and cocktail varieties 3 results and discussion 3 1 application of dsspim to the case studies to test the effectiveness of the methodology described in this work dsspim was implemented during the 2019 crop season to manage the precision irrigation systems of two commercial organic farms that produce oranges and greenhouse tomatoes in both case studies weather forecasts from the aemet open data system aemet 2015 and the eltiempo es website pelmorex corp 2017 were used historical climate data were obtained from the public agroclimatic stations closest to each farm palma del río for the orange trees and almería for the greenhouse tomatoes likewise the evolution of soil water content was monitored using capacitive sensors installed at depths of 15 40 and 55 cm in the orange tree test plot and at depths of 10 17 and 25 cm in the tomato greenhouse 3 1 1 irrigation management of the orange grove dsspim was applied to analyze various irrigation scheduling strategies fir and rdi in an orange grove farm during the growing season the results of dsspim have been compared with the actual irrigation scheduling three scenarios defined for different irrigation strategies were studied in scenario 1 the fir strategy was applied fig 3 while the rdi strategy was applied in scenario 2 fig 4 fig 5 shows the actual irrigation management on the farm scenario 3 during the study season to calculate the daily soil moisture deficit in scenarios 1 and 2 eq 1 was used in scenario 3 eq 3 was used to determine drn taking 0 2 as the value of parameter x fig 3a shows the daily rainfall distribution recorded at the nas and the effective rainfall er which were calculated from january 1 to december 31 2019 365 days of the year doy using eq 8 the irrigation scheduling proposed by dsspim for the fir strategy is presented in fig 3b and fig 3c which show the evolution of the soil moisture depletion level throughout the crop season with respect to the adl raw and taw thresholds of soil water deficit section 2 1 3 although the objective of this irrigation strategy was to satisfy crop irrigation needs the irrigation schedule was conditioned by the iwa 500 mm since the water needs of the orange trees exceeded this value by 42 the total irrigation applied following this strategy was 495 mm the soil water content decreased rapidly during the first months of the year due to low rainfall fig 3c so the irrigation season started in mid march several precipitation events in spring fig 3a from doy 90 to doy 120 increased the soil water content above the adl level so irrigation was not necessary later in the summer months crop water demand was higher than the applied irrigation limited by iwa so the plants took water from the soil until the soil moisture deficit dr reached the raw value fig 3c from this threshold water extraction was more difficult for the plants and etc was reduced ks 1 so the rate of increase of the moisture deficit decreased in the autumn months from doy 300 dr decreased due to new rainfall events and the amount of water stored in the soil increased in 2019 the gross precipitation recorded on the farm by the nas was 318 mm and the total effective precipitation estimated for 2019 using the fir strategy was 247 mm for the same precipitation value the lower the soil moisture deficit which depends on the irrigation strategy the lower the er value thus for example on doy 31 fig 3a when the gross precipitation was 22 mm only 5 mm were useful for the plants and the rest of the gross precipitation was lost by percolation runoff or evaporation in contrast from doy 91 121 er was equal to p because the value of dr was high and the soil had the capacity to store all the precipitation fig 4 shows the irrigation management in the second scenario in which the rdi strategy was applied using idc values adapted to the local conditions garcía tejero et al 2010 unlike the first scenario daily irrigation scheduling was not as constrained by the daily iwa value the theoretical irrigation requirements at the critical phenological stages of the crop were more restrictive than the daily iwa values this situation caused the moisture deficit to exceed the raw for a longer time and the plants were subjected to a reduction in etc in the first scenario fig 3c this situation occurred between doy 198 and 323 while in the second scenario fig 4c it started 28 days earlier doy 170 however both strategies prevented the reduction of etc during flowering the most sensitive period for the crop at this phenological stage water stress can lead to yield losses in the rdi strategy 403 mm of irrigation water were applied 20 less than that applied with the fir strategy this irrigation strategy which led to higher values of the moisture deficit at the end of summer achieved higher er values 266 mm for the whole season than scenario 1 and scenario 3 the actual irrigation management is shown in fig 5 in the 2019 irrigation season the total irrigation water use recorded in the water meter was 497 mm fig 5b the total volume of water applied was equal to the recommended volume obtained by the fir strategy however because the irrigation management performed by the farmer was not the same as the schedule obtained with dsspim the evolution of the soil moisture differed significantly from that shown in fig 3c due to the longer duration and frequency of irrigations the soil moisture content was maintained at values close to θfc thus indicating non optimal water use in this situation the soil moisture content is sufficient to meet the etc requirements of the plants and no further irrigations would be necessary until dr reaches adl even so the farmer applied irrigations between doy 150 and 197 moreover unlike the first two scenarios the dr in the actual irrigation management was kept close to the raw between doy 143 and 150 end of may a situation that should have been avoided since reductions in etc during flowering can affect yield as a result the calculated er for this scenario was 238 mm which represents 75 of the gross annual precipitation 318 4 mm when using er calculation procedures based on empirical equations smith and fao 1992 the er is higher between 7 and 20 than that obtained with dsspim as the other procedures do not consider the soil moisture content before rainfall events the moisture deficit in winter is very low fig 5c so the soil can only store a small portion of the rainwater 3 1 2 irrigation management of the tomato greenhouse in the case study of greenhouse tomato there is no limit for water allocation and the soil s water storage capacity is not considered in the irrigation scheduling of this type of crops fernández et al 2001 consequently irrigation programming is only conditioned by crop evapotranspiration and since it is a horticultural crop the fir irrigation strategy is used to manage irrigation the crop growing season started on august 20 2019 and ended on may 25 2020 because water meters were installed after the crops were planted only water inputs were monitored during the growing period without considering previous watering for soil preparation in this case the soil moisture sensors were used only to monitor the applied irrigation fig 6 shows both the actual water application during the irrigation season and the irrigation scheduling computed by dsspim the actual amount of irrigation water applied by the farmer during the season was 558 mm according to the water meter records while the volume recommended by dsspim was 654 mm from doy 352 2019 significant deviations were observed between the proposed and actual schedule in contrast to the recommended irrigation schedule in the actual schedule there were days when no irrigation occurred this is because certain environmental conditions inside the greenhouse relative humidity and ventilation were not included in dsspim the main difference occurred in the last month of the crop season may from doy 122 146 when the farmer decided to apply 65 of the water needs in the first fortnight and reduced irrigation to 33 of the crop needs on the last 10 days this decision was related to yield decline at the end of the crop cycle 3 2 water use analysis in the organic orange grove and greenhouse tomatoes the aim of dsspim is to analyze current irrigation management practices with a view to future decisions the analysis diagnostic module described in section 2 1 4 was performed using the wf and ris indicators the results of the main indicators of the water use analysis for the orange and greenhouse tomato crops are presented in table 1 the amount of blue water used cwublue for both crops was obtained from the records of the water meters installed on each farm for the crops grown outdoors cwugreen is the total amount of rainwater available for the crops and is estimated from the measurements of the soil moisture sensors the crop yield data of the studied season were provided by the farm managers under the actual irrigation management the crop yield values for oranges and greenhouse tomatoes were 16 50 t ha and 109 5 t ha respectively both farms are classified as organic farms so quality is given priority over quantity consequently when these crops are produced under conventional agricultural conditions they can reach higher yield values around 20 higher than on organic production farms for the orange groves 7348 m3 ha of water were used to obtain a crop yield of 16 50 t ha of the total amount of water used 2382 m3 ha corresponded to green water and 4966 m3 ha corresponded to blue water for irrigation and other cultivation practices the total applied irrigation water was lower than the iwa 5000 m3 ha and considerably lower than the theoretical crop irrigation needs 7112 m3 ha the ris value was 0 7 thus indicating the application of a deficit irrigation strategy the total wforange value was 445 m3 t of which 68 was wfblue the production of tomatoes was not affected by rainwater so cwugreen was zero the cwubllue value in this crop was 5576 m3 ha and lower than cwr 6536 m3 ha the ris value for the entire irrigation season was 0 85 due to the deficit irrigation performed by the farm manager at the end of the season given the high production of greenhouse crops the resulting wftomato was 51 m3 t which is much lower than the wf of the orange crop although the methodology has been tested on orange and tomato greenhouse crops the methodology is applicable to outdoor woody crops and greenhouse horticultural crops with similar characteristics and management e g olive trees outdoor or greenhouses crops like cucumber pepper and eggplant the information obtained from the water use analysis and the results of the dsspim simulations enable detecting moments when the irrigator s management differs from the recommended irrigation schedule identifying the causes and consequence of this difference allows the irrigator to take corrective measures and improve irrigation management in the following season dsspim uses ict tools and weather forecasts and records to estimate effective precipitation from daily soil moisture content measurements and obtain more accurate daily irrigation schedules than other dsss that use only historical weather records and general formulations to estimate effective rainfall alcaide et al 2019 gonzález perea et al 2017 mérida garcía et al 2018 moreover the increase in water use efficiency through precision irrigation scheduled by dsspim in which various irrigation strategies such as controlled deficit irrigation can be considered are evaluated by the joint use of wf and ris indicators garcía morillo et al 2015 gonzález perea et al 2016 together with the irrigation schedules finally dsspim permits comparing water use total volume and timing based on schedules to a farm s usual irrigation programming to identify irrigation inefficiencies which if corrected can lead to water savings of up to 20 while maintaining the same level of production and reducing costs for the farmer however dsspim has certain limitations the accuracy of the results could be conditioned by the quality of the information used weather forecasts soil water content measured by soil sensors water consumption recorded by water meters etc failures in the coverage of the communication system of the sensors as well as the inadequate maintenance of the control devices the suitability of the network sectorization depending on the spatial variability of soils topography etc determines the minimum number of soil moisture sensors one per sector needed to obtain accurate results precise sectorization may be unaffordable for some farms to obtain quality results with dssipm other disadvantages include constraints related to crop development personnel management market prices or environmental conditions inside the greenhouse which affect irrigation management and are known by the farmer but not addressed in the current version of dsspim 4 conclusions a precision irrigation management decision support model dsspim has been developed to perform and evaluate optimal irrigation management for outdoor crops as well as for greenhouse horticultural crops the procedure performs an optimal weekly irrigation scheduling adapted to the characteristics of each farm using icts and real data are collected on site by remote sensors and from open data weather forecasts the on site remote sensors are used to send information in real time to the calculation platform via icts which is then stored in the cloud for subsequent analysis real time information on the applied crop water and the evolution of soil moisture content is used to determine the optimal irrigation timing as well as the amount of water to be applied accurate data on daily crop water use green and blue water are evaluated in the water use analysis module the use of soil water content information in outdoor crops allows the determination of daily effective rainfall green water on a more precise and appropriate time scale for optimal irrigation which in turn improves the management of water resources and allows for more accurate green water accounting dsspim was developed and applied to two organic farms orange grove and greenhouse tomatoes during an agricultural season in southern spain optimal irrigation schedules were obtained for each crop at the end of the crop season crop water use was accounted for and analyzed in the water use analysis module the comparison between scenarios of different irrigation management systems fir and rdi in orange trees shows that the application of regulated deficit irrigation strategies in tree crops can reduce irrigation water use by 20 moreover the model maintains the irrigation water recommendation below the water allocation in all the simulated scenarios additionally the results show that for the same irrigation water consumption the differences in irrigation management frequency and duration result in a lower use of rainwater stored in the soil in the tomato crop the management recommended by dsspim and the actual irrigator s management closely matched the crop needs with the exception of the end of the cycle when the farmer made a decision related to factors not considered in dsspim the joint analysis of wfc ris and dsspim irrigation schedules provide useful information about both the amount of water needed to obtain a unit of product and the level of adequacy of the applied irrigation this information is essential to detect inefficiencies in irrigation management and deviations in the actual

9478,the digitalization of the agricultural sector through the implementation of cutting edge technologies allows for the optimization of the use of water whose scarcity has become one of the most relevant and complex environmental global problems water consumption data collected on site using different technologies is key to achieving optimal irrigation scheduling technology is also a useful tool that provides a real and transparent inventory of water use in irrigated crops the water footprint obtained in accordance with iso standard 14046 using the life cycle analysis methodology and jointly with irrigation management information allows determining water use efficiency with great accuracy this work presents a decision support system developed for precision irrigation management at farm scale called dsspim the system provides a verifiable inventory of water use and an analysis diagnosis of the adequacy of the irrigation performed using information and communication technologies icts as well as real time knowledge of water inputs and outputs during crop development based on data received from water meters and soil moisture sensors installed in the field additionally to achieve both purposes a methodology is proposed to more accurately estimate rainwater use green water based on real measurements and the use of icts the proposed methodology was applied during one season in two organic crops greenhouse tomatoes and orange trees located in southern spain the model allowed detecting inefficiencies in irrigation water use a comparison between the actual management practices and the practices recommended by the dsspim underlines the importance of irrigation management in improving water use in the case of orange trees different irrigation system management

the main drivers of water resources pressures unesco 2009 irrigated agriculture is the largest human activity using water resources agricultural production accounts for 70 of the world s freshwater withdrawals fao 2017 the demand for freshwater in the agricultural sector is driven by increasing food demand which is directly linked to population growth due to exponential demographic growth the new production systems are characterized by a greater use of inputs sanz 1990 the growing use of inputs along with climate change has intensified the negative effects on both the quantity and quality of water resources fao 2017 to address this problem global agriculture must increase food production without compromising environmental preservation monaghan et al 2013 through strategies for more efficient water use in this context the implementation of precision irrigation systems using cutting edge technologies is among the proposed strategies to use water more efficiently information gathered from the field through remote sensors and sent to be analyzed using information and communication technologies icts is key to accurately determine crop water needs and apply the optimal amount of water at the right time fernández garcía et al 2020 several authors have developed ict tools to support irrigation water management gonzález perea et al 2017 developed a mobile and desktop application that uses ict tools to determine the daily irrigation time for strawberry crops in southwestern spain using agroclimatic and soil information as well as the hydraulic characteristics of the irrigation network alcaide et al 2019 used climate forecasting to determine the optimal fertigation schedule for olive groves in real time based on the theoretical soil water balance the quality of the irrigation water and the crop and soil characteristics in both works soil moisture sensors were used to control scheduled irrigation goldstein et al 2018 applied machine learning techniques to meteorological data soil moisture sensor readings and historical irrigation schedules to capture the unstructured decision making process of the irrigation manager and automatically provide irrigation scheduling similar works casadesús et al 2012 millán et al 2019 have also performed a water balance readjusted with sensor information to determine irrigation scheduling but only for woody crops although rainfall is an essential parameter in optimal irrigation scheduling some works do not take it into account goldstein et al 2018 irrigation programming models usually include rainfall in a simplistic way through general formulations to estimate the effective rainfall and to account for the rainwater water used by the crop alcaide et al 2019 smith and fao 1992 the water footprint wf indicator is a useful tool for analyzing potential water scarcity scenarios because it quantifies the volume of direct and indirect crop water use to produce a unit of output hoekstra 2003 since it was first introduced in 2002 the wf concept has been in constant evolution and some authors have addressed it in the context of life cycle analysis lca in terms of potential impacts on the environment bayart et al 2010 berger and finkbeiner 2010 boulay et al 2016 chapagain and orr 2009 jefferies et al 2012 pfister et al 2009 for this reason iso standard 14046 iso 2014 aims to unify the multiple definitions and methodologies of wf assessment in the methodological context of lca iso standard 14040 iso 2006 the accuracy and interpretation of wf results depend on the spatial temporal scale and quality of the wf inventory phase gonzález perea et al 2016 montesinos et al 2011 in this phase the water input and outputs of the system being assessed are recorded and quantified in irrigated crops water footprint accounting can be applied to evaluate water use efficiency through the relationship between water use and crop yield garcía morillo et al 2015 however wf does not provide information about the adequacy of applied irrigation for this reason it is essential to obtain verifiable quality data on farm water use to identify problems in irrigation facilities and or their operation irrigation management indicators such as relative irrigation supply ris levine 1982 are used to diagnose such situations and make decisions to improve water use efficiency some authors have used icts to acquire the data needed to accurately account for crop wf and linked this information with additional indicators to provide details of how irrigation has been carried out garcía morillo et al 2015 gonzález perea et al 2016 however recorded data have not yet been used to perform optimal irrigation scheduling that takes into account crop water needs in real time this study aims to develop an irrigation management tool that takes full advantage of the utilities of the available field technology sensors and telecommunication systems by jointly analyzing wf ris and irrigation scheduling to maximize water use efficiency to this end a decision support system dss has been developed to determine the real time scheduling of a precision irrigation system for outdoor woody crops and greenhouse horticultural crops with a drip irrigation system the methodological approach involves the use of weather forecasts and real time data recorded by soil water sensors and water meters combined with icts to update irrigation scheduling in real time the information is also analyzed to obtain verifiable wf inventories and irrigation performance indicators and evaluate the efficiency of the precision irrigation system at farm scale in accordance with the iso standard 14046 in addition the proposed decision support system includes a procedure to estimate the amount of green water used by the crops from real soil water data the methodology was applied during the 2019 2020 irrigation season on two commercial farms that produce greenhouse tomato and orange crops in southern spain 2 methodology 2 1 decision support system for precision irrigation management the decision support system developed for precision irrigation management dsspim uses data recorded by sensors installed in the field as well as data on the crop characteristics soil type hydraulic characteristics of the irrigation network climate historical and predicted data and information on water availability and crop yield to provide an optimal weekly irrigation schedule additionally dsspim measures the amount of water the crops use in real time throughout the growing season to obtain an accurate and verifiable wf and uses several irrigation management indicators to assess the irrigation water efficiency thus dsspim is composed of four modules farm characteristics climate and irrigation monitoring data irrigation scheduling and water use analysis diagnosis each of the modules is described below and their interrelations are shown in fig 1 2 1 1 farm characteristics this module collects and manages information about the cultivation of drip irrigated crops on a given farm as well as the data needed to estimate the wf of the crops for woody crops the required data are plantation frame m m and average diameter of the tree canopy m in the case of greenhouse crops the required data include planting dates the spacing between crop lines the slope of the greenhouse roof the start and end dates of roof whitening and the whitening dose kg lime 100 l of water the irrigation network is characterized by the number of pipes per crop line the distance between emitters m the nominal flow rate of the emitters l h and the sector area ha farm water management and use depend on the contracted electricity rate power supply rates differ according to the number duration and distribution of tariff periods the daily number of hours available for irrigation are usually limited due to the farm s electricity rate low cost period or operational conditions to keep the recommended irrigation time within the limits of the available irrigation hours the user must select the tariff type and the irrigation period or manually enter the maximum number of hours available for irrigation from monday to friday and weekends finally the water allowance m3 ha year electrical conductivity of irrigation water ds m soil texture the yield of the previous season and the first day of the growing season and the last day of harvest t ha must be known 2 1 2 climate and irrigation monitoring data collection this module collects climate and water use monitoring data by means of icts the information is then used to calculate the theoretical crop irrigation needs historical climate date and weather forecasts are obtained from public weather services using web scraping techniques real precipitation p and historical potential evapotranspiration eto records are obtained from the nearest public agroclimatic station nas of the regional agroclimatic information network ria 1999 the complete eto time series is used to determine the historical crop requirements daily crop evapotranspiration under optimal and well watered conditions etc pereira et al 2021 is estimated based on eto forecasts calculated from open weather data maximum and minimum daily relative humidity information and data obtained from online weather forecasts maximum and minimum temperature c cloud index wind speed km h the open weather data were taken from the aemet open data system which is the api rest application programming interface representational state transfer of the spanish meteorological agency aemet 2015 the online weather forecast data were obtained from the eltiempo es website pelmorex corp 2017 by web scraping techniques these data are used to calculate the eto of outdoor crops for the next 7 days by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the eto for greenhouse crops is estimated using the equation of a locally calibrated radiation method proposed by fernández et al 2010 weather precipitation forecasts are also obtained from eltiempo es and used in the irrigation scheduling of outdoor crops soil moisture sensors and water meters are used to monitor crop water use although several types of commercial sensors are available for this purpose frequency domain reflectrometry fdr capacitance moisture sensors are the most widely used to monitor and measure changes in soil volumetric water content vwc due to their reliability and ease of use vera et al 2017 for each crop a measurement device with three echo20 10hs capacitive sensors meter group usa was placed at different soil depths to record variations in soil moisture due to crop absorption during the growing season the three sensors were installed in different soil layers one in the upper soil layer at a depth of 10 15 cm one at the depth with the highest root density 20 35 cm and one in the bottom soil layer with few roots a high moisture content in the deepest layer indicates water losses by percolation and hence an inefficient use of irrigation water since irrigation scheduling is done for homogeneous sectors it is necessary to install at least one soil moisture monitoring device in a representative location of each irrigation sector the level of sectorization of each farm will depend on the variability of several factors soil topography and crop variety among others inadequate sectorization would compromise the accuracy of dsspim the amount of water used is recorded by water meters installed at the inlet of each irrigation sector these water meters have an electronic sensor that emits a signal once a volume unit has flowed through the meter soil moisture sensors and water meters are connected to dataloggers with general packet radio service gprs communication that records and transmits measured data in real time to a cloud platform accessible via an api 2 1 3 irrigation scheduling the aim of this module is to determine daily irrigation time for outdoor and greenhouse crops for outdoor crops soil water content is an essential variable in irrigation scheduling when the amount of water stored in the soil can satisfy crop irrigation needs then irrigation is not necessary to determine whether irrigation is needed or not a daily soil water balance is performed for greenhouse crops that do not receive rainwater and are watered with high frequency irrigation the soil s function as a water store is negligible and it can be assumed that soil water content does not change over time fernández et al 2001 the soil water balance is updated daily using the information gathered in the data collection modules the irrigation scheduling module is described in what follows and the module flowchart is shown in fig 2 the total water available in the soil taw mm for a crop is a function of the crop s depth of roots zr m and the soil water contents at field capacity θfc m3 m3 and at the permanent wilting point θpwp m3 m3 the last two parameters depend on the hydrophilic characteristics of the soil they were estimated using the soil water retention curves resulting from the application of the rosetta model which bases its estimations on the soil texture characteristics schaap et al 2001 soil textures were determined in the laboratory from soil samples taken on each farm only a fraction of taw is available for the crop what is known as the readily available water raw mm allen et al 1998 when the soil moisture deficit dr mm or level of moisture depletion reaches raw in the root zone water extraction is more difficult for the plant and its etc is reduced the raw for the orange grove was 50 of taw allen et al 1998 therefore to avoid a decrease in etc 20 of taw was set as the threshold of the allowable depletion level adl mm in the soil to start irrigation to determine drn mm in the soil at the end of day n soil water balance drtheoretical n mm and drreal n mm must be previously calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively adapted from allen et al 1998 eq 1 estimates the soil water deficit without considering runoff and percolation losses 1 dr theoretical n dr n 1 er n i n et c n k s n where drn 1 is the soil moisture depletion of the previous day mm ern is the effective rainfall on day n mm whose calculation is described below for outdoor crops section 2 1 3 1 and for greenhouse crops ern is zero in is the real applied irrigation depth measured by the water meter mm and et c n is the crop evapotranspiration mm calculated as the product of eto on day n and the crop coefficient kc et c n can be calculated from historical eto values recorded by the nearest agroclimatic station or eto predictions calculated using the methodology described in section 2 1 2 when the objective is to determine the dr value of the current day the eto value recorded the previous day by the nas is used however if the purpose is to estimate the dr of the next 7 days eto predictions are used kc at day n allen et al 1998 which depends on the crop type and stage of development in woody crops kc is related to the ground area shaded by trees castel sánchez 2001 while for greenhouse crops it is a function of the accumulated thermal time att since emergence fernández et al 2001 ks is a non dimensional coefficient of water stress allen et al 1998 that quantifies the reduction in transpiration when the soil water deficit exceeds the raw if the water depletion in the root zone is less than the raw the value of this coefficient is equal to 1 eq 2 calculates actual soil moisture depletion from the vwc at field capacity and the vwc recorded on site θreal m3 m3 the latter value is the average of soil moisture records taken at sunset by sensors located in the top and middle soil layers 2 dr real n 1000 θ fc θ real n 1 after irrigation the soil water content exceeds θfc for a while after which the soil drains and the water content is stabilized at sunset the sensors provide information about the remaining water content in the soil after the daily evapotranspiration period when θreal exceeds a certain percentage of the θfc value x the moisture deficit at the end of the day drn is considered 0 and the soil at field capacity conversely if θreal is lower than the set threshold the value assigned to drn will be the highest between drreal n and drtheorical n so the most limiting value was considered to determine the irrigation timing 3 3 d r n 0 θ r e a l x θ f c max d r t h e o r i c a l d r r e a l θ r e a l x θ f c once the irrigation timing is determined using drn daily crop irrigation requirements are calculated according to equation 4 4 cir n et c n k s n er n f ce f pte f rs where etc is the crop evapotranspiration under optimal and well watered conditions and is calculated using the forecast eto values the coefficients fce fpte and frs are correction factors that depend on the electrical conductivity of irrigation water the slope of the greenhouse roof and whitening respectively fernández et al 2001 for outdoor crops the value of the fpte and frs factors is 1 in water scarce regions deficit irrigation strategies are usually applied in woody crops when the water irrigation requirements exceed water rights therefore the theoretical daily irrigation dose inn is calculated according to eq 5 where idcn is the irrigation deficit coefficient and ranges from 0 to 1 depending on the selected irrigation strategy 5 in n c ir n idc n when the crop irrigation needs are fully satisfied fir strategy idcn is equal to 1 for the entire irrigation season in a sustained deficit irrigation sdi strategy idcn is a fraction of the crop irrigation needs and its value remains constant throughout the irrigation season on the other hand in a regulated deficit irrigation strategy rdi a variable fraction of crop irrigation requirements is applied throughout the irrigation season this fraction of the crop irrigation needs depends on the crop cycle and aims to prevent or reduce to the greatest possible extent water stress in the most sensitive crop stages such as flowering or fruit set gonzalez altozano and castel 1999 therefore idc varies during the irrigation season the total amount of irrigation water to be applied in the irrigation season cannot exceed the irrigation water allowance iwa regardless of the irrigation strategy chosen for this reason idc is combined with the average fortnightly etc historical data to distribute the water allowance according to the crop irrigation needs and a fortnightly iwa iwaf is set any deviation from the established limit is recorded by the irrigation meter and at the end of each fortnight the remaining allocation is redistributed proportionally to the irrigation needs of the remaining months of the irrigation season readjusting the established limits every 15 days to avoid exceeding the iwa value at the end of the irrigation season a daily limit of water availability iln is established iln is the quotient between iwaf and the number of days in each half month between 13 and 16 days therefore the actual crop irrigation requirement irn i e the volume of water to be applied in each irrigation event will be equal to the minimum of inn and iln eq 6 6 i r n i n n i n n i l n i l n i n n i l n the theoretical irrigation time tt n hours is calculated by eq 7 considering the efficiency of the irrigation system ie the area of the irrigation sector a ha the nominal emitters flow qe l h and the number of emitters of the irrigation sector ne 7 t t n ir n a 10 4 ie q e n e the programmed watering time cannot exceed the number of available irrigation hours established in the electric supply contract te n thus the recommended irrigation time tr n is the minimum of tt n and te n fig 2 shows the flowchart of the irrigation scheduling procedure using data collected by the sensors via icts the boxes with rounded edges and thick lines in the figure indicate that the data are from the farm characteristics module in the boxes with dashed lines the data have been recorded by sensors on site or remotely and sent via icts to the climate and irrigation monitoring data module the precipitation and eto records at the nas as well as the soil moisture content readings at sunset are updated according to the weather forecasts the aim of this dsspim module is to provide daily optimal irrigation programming for a week so predictions of the soil moisture depletion for the next 7 days are needed to do this the last drn that was calculated is used as a starting value in is the recommended irrigation depth in irn and the effective precipitation ern is obtained with eq 8 using precipitation predictions for the value of pn the accuracy of the irrigation programming affects the values of blue and green water uses by the crops and hence the irrigation water use efficiency 2 1 3 1 efficient rainfall estimation for outdoor crops the water needs of outdoor crops are partially satisfied with rainwater effective rainfall ern in eq 1 is the rainwater fraction stored in the soil that can be used by the plant most existing methodologies estimate er based on monthly rainwater volume ali and mubarak 2017 allen et al 1998 smith and fao 1992 villalobos et al 2009 which reduces the accuracy of daily irrigation scheduling to overcome this problem dsspim includes a procedure to calculate daily er that considers the water storage capacity of the soil which depends on the soil type and the soil moisture content at the onset of the rainfall event eq 8 estimates the effective rainfall using information from the previous day s soil moisture deficit drn 1 eq 3 and the gross rainfall at day n p n mm this equation uses rainfall forecasts and rainfall data recorded by the nas nas rainfall data are used to calculate the effective rainfall of the last day when the purpose is to predict the effective rainfall of the next 7 days precipitation forecasts are used 8 e r n min d r n 1 e t c n k s n p n θ p w p θ n θ f c 0 θ n θ f c if pn is lower than dr n 1 the total gross precipitation can be stored so ern equals pn otherwise er is 0 because soil moisture content is at field capacity the 7 day forward irrigation scheduling requires the ern and etc n forecasts thus eq 8 is calculated using eto and rainfall forecasts 2 1 4 water use analysis diagnosis this module determines the adequacy of the amount of water used according to the crop irrigation needs by means of a joint analysis of the wf and ris indicators the module performs a wf inventory according to iso standard 14046 iso 2014 which provides information on the volume of water used to produce a unit of product the wf inventory estimates the crop water footprint wfc as the sum of the blue wfblue and green wfgreen water footprint components grey water has not been considered in the wf inventory because it is not a real volume of water used by crops this water represents the amount of fresh water that would theoretically be needed to restore the quality of irrigation water returns that have been contaminated during the production process for this reason iso 14046 does not include grey water in the calculation of wf of products and or services lovarelli et al 2016 wfc is normally expressed in m3 t or in l kg and is the sum of the green crop water footprint wfcgreen and the blue crop water footprint wfcblue wfcgreen can be calculated as green crop water use cwugreen m3 ha divided by the crop yield y t ha 9 wf c green cwu green y cwugreen is calculated by eq 10 for outdoor crops and is null for greenhouse crops 10 cwu green 10 n 1 lds er n where the term 10 is a unit conversion factor to change mm into m3 ha lds is the duration of the crop growing season in days and ern is calculated by eq 8 for permanent crops the first day of the growing season is the last harvest day of the previous season to estimate wfcblue the following equation is applied 11 wf c blue cw a blue y where cwablue m3 ha is the total volume of blue water applied to the crop as recorded by the water meters installed on the farm the approach to calculate wfblue presented here differs from other works where wfblue is estimated with the cwublue indicator which is calculated using theoretical irrigation requirements chapagain and orr 2009 hoekstra et al 2009 these methodologies do not take into account indirect water uses or water losses water that does not return to the environment due to inefficiencies in the irrigation system furthermore it ignores situations of over or under irrigation due to the irrigation strategies applied thus cwablue includes all water applications during the crop season including water applied to satisfy crop irrigation needs and water used in different crop management practices e g soil preparation salt washing pipe cleaning etc and water leaks in the irrigation system unless crop management practices involving water use are performed during non irrigation periods or via a separate water network it is difficult to identify the fraction of the water volumes recorded in the meter that correspond to irrigation or other uses required to obtain the product therefore the amount of blue water used during the cropping season is obtained by eq 12 12 cwa blue i 1 wm n 1 lds i n i a i 10 i 1 wm a where in is the daily applied blue water depth mm recorded by the water meter i wm represents the total number of water meters installed on the farm and ai is the area ha associated to each water meter i installed in the different irrigation sectors the denominator of this equation represents the total surface area of the farm monitored with irrigation meters since cwablue is used to calculate wfblue it provides information about the amount of blue water used directly and indirectly to produce a crop production unit in short the crop water footprint is determined by eq 13 13 wf c cwu green cwa blue y when used alone the wf only reports information about how much water was used to obtain a unit of product but it does not provide information about whether the amount of water applied was correct or not therefore to check irrigation water use suitability irrigation adequacy indicators should be used in combination with the wf to evaluate the suitability of the actual applied irrigation the ris indicator was used levine 1982 ris eq 14 relates the amount of water applied recorded in the water meters and the theoretical crop irrigation requirements during crop growing garcía morillo et al 2015 gonzález perea et al 2016 14 ris n 1 lds cwa blue n 1 lds 10 cir ris values around 1 2 indicate that irrigation has been adequately performed considering the inefficiencies of the soil and the irrigation system values below and above 1 2 indicate deficit and excess irrigation respectively 2 2 case studies the methodology was tested on two organic farms in southern spain one with orange tree crops 37 44 9 39 n 5 6 58 69 w and the other with greenhouse tomato crops 36 51 23 32 n 2 24 37 54 w the citrus fruit plantation navelina variety is located in the guadalquivir valley an area that receives about 600 mm of average annual rainfall and where a high percentage of the cultivated land area is dedicated to irrigated crops 28 92 of total national irrigation mapa 2019 the high demand for irrigation water in the guadalquivir basin means that water rights are usually lower than the crop water requirements consequently deficit irrigation strategies are a common practice in the region the planting frame of the trial orange grove was 5 5 m x 4 m and was drip irrigated by an irrigation network organized in 2 ha sectors where irrigation water is distributed through two irrigation laterals per tree line the nominal flow rate of the emitters was 2 8 l h 1 m separation between emitters with a pressure compensation range of 10 40 m the farm receives water from the fuente palmera irrigation association from 00 00 8 00 a m monday to friday and 24 h a day on weekends during the 2019 irrigation season the water allocation assigned to this farm was 5000 m3 ha with a daily eto in the range 0 5 7 8 mm the soil texture of the farm was analyzed in the laboratory and identified as sandy loam with a moisture content at field capacity of 0 28 m3 m3 and a permanent wilting point of 0 1 m3 m3 the average annual yield of the orange grove was 15 t ha considering the growing season as the natural year from the time the harvest finishes in january the trial tomato greenhouse is located in almería southeast spain the water resources in this area are very scarce and under severe pressure from intensive agriculture which aggravates problems of overexploitation pollution and the salinization of aquifers gallardo et al 2013 these circumstances require the optimal use of irrigation water so greenhouse tomatoes are particularly interesting for testing the methodology developed the greenhouse tomato cycle extends from mid august to the end of may without rainfall inputs the greenhouse roof whitening technique was applied from planting to mid september at a dose of 0 25 kg lime l this technique is used to reduce the temperature inside the greenhouse but it also reduces solar radiation inside the greenhouse leading to a reduction in eto fernández et al 2010 during the 2019 2020 season the eto values inside the greenhouse ranged from 0 1 to 4 5 mm the water source for the greenhouse is an irrigation pond fed by a groundwater intake the irrigation network is composed of four irrigation sectors 0 7 ha in which each drip pipe irrigates a line of plants spaced 2 05 m apart the nominal flow rate of the drippers was 4 l h non pressure compensating placed every 0 4 m the average electrical conductivity of the irrigation water was 2 ds m the greenhouse soil was of loamy texture and 27 cm in depth bounded by a hardened profile the moisture content at field capacity was 0 34 m3 m3 and the permanent wilting point was 0 08 m3 m3 under these conditions the average yield of the tomato greenhouse was 109 t ha 10 9 kg m2 for a planting density of 1 5 plants m2 branch and cocktail varieties 3 results and discussion 3 1 application of dsspim to the case studies to test the effectiveness of the methodology described in this work dsspim was implemented during the 2019 crop season to manage the precision irrigation systems of two commercial organic farms that produce oranges and greenhouse tomatoes in both case studies weather forecasts from the aemet open data system aemet 2015 and the eltiempo es website pelmorex corp 2017 were used historical climate data were obtained from the public agroclimatic stations closest to each farm palma del río for the orange trees and almería for the greenhouse tomatoes likewise the evolution of soil water content was monitored using capacitive sensors installed at depths of 15 40 and 55 cm in the orange tree test plot and at depths of 10 17 and 25 cm in the tomato greenhouse 3 1 1 irrigation management of the orange grove dsspim was applied to analyze various irrigation scheduling strategies fir and rdi in an orange grove farm during the growing season the results of dsspim have been compared with the actual irrigation scheduling three scenarios defined for different irrigation strategies were studied in scenario 1 the fir strategy was applied fig 3 while the rdi strategy was applied in scenario 2 fig 4 fig 5 shows the actual irrigation management on the farm scenario 3 during the study season to calculate the daily soil moisture deficit in scenarios 1 and 2 eq 1 was used in scenario 3 eq 3 was used to determine drn taking 0 2 as the value of parameter x fig 3a shows the daily rainfall distribution recorded at the nas and the effective rainfall er which were calculated from january 1 to december 31 2019 365 days of the year doy using eq 8 the irrigation scheduling proposed by dsspim for the fir strategy is presented in fig 3b and fig 3c which show the evolution of the soil moisture depletion level throughout the crop season with respect to the adl raw and taw thresholds of soil water deficit section 2 1 3 although the objective of this irrigation strategy was to satisfy crop irrigation needs the irrigation schedule was conditioned by the iwa 500 mm since the water needs of the orange trees exceeded this value by 42 the total irrigation applied following this strategy was 495 mm the soil water content decreased rapidly during the first months of the year due to low rainfall fig 3c so the irrigation season started in mid march several precipitation events in spring fig 3a from doy 90 to doy 120 increased the soil water content above the adl level so irrigation was not necessary later in the summer months crop water demand was higher than the applied irrigation limited by iwa so the plants took water from the soil until the soil moisture deficit dr reached the raw value fig 3c from this threshold water extraction was more difficult for the plants and etc was reduced ks 1 so the rate of increase of the moisture deficit decreased in the autumn months from doy 300 dr decreased due to new rainfall events and the amount of water stored in the soil increased in 2019 the gross precipitation recorded on the farm by the nas was 318 mm and the total effective precipitation estimated for 2019 using the fir strategy was 247 mm for the same precipitation value the lower the soil moisture deficit which depends on the irrigation strategy the lower the er value thus for example on doy 31 fig 3a when the gross precipitation was 22 mm only 5 mm were useful for the plants and the rest of the gross precipitation was lost by percolation runoff or evaporation in contrast from doy 91 121 er was equal to p because the value of dr was high and the soil had the capacity to store all the precipitation fig 4 shows the irrigation management in the second scenario in which the rdi strategy was applied using idc values adapted to the local conditions garcía tejero et al 2010 unlike the first scenario daily irrigation scheduling was not as constrained by the daily iwa value the theoretical irrigation requirements at the critical phenological stages of the crop were more restrictive than the daily iwa values this situation caused the moisture deficit to exceed the raw for a longer time and the plants were subjected to a reduction in etc in the first scenario fig 3c this situation occurred between doy 198 and 323 while in the second scenario fig 4c it started 28 days earlier doy 170 however both strategies prevented the reduction of etc during flowering the most sensitive period for the crop at this phenological stage water stress can lead to yield losses in the rdi strategy 403 mm of irrigation water were applied 20 less than that applied with the fir strategy this irrigation strategy which led to higher values of the moisture deficit at the end of summer achieved higher er values 266 mm for the whole season than scenario 1 and scenario 3 the actual irrigation management is shown in fig 5 in the 2019 irrigation season the total irrigation water use recorded in the water meter was 497 mm fig 5b the total volume of water applied was equal to the recommended volume obtained by the fir strategy however because the irrigation management performed by the farmer was not the same as the schedule obtained with dsspim the evolution of the soil moisture differed significantly from that shown in fig 3c due to the longer duration and frequency of irrigations the soil moisture content was maintained at values close to θfc thus indicating non optimal water use in this situation the soil moisture content is sufficient to meet the etc requirements of the plants and no further irrigations would be necessary until dr reaches adl even so the farmer applied irrigations between doy 150 and 197 moreover unlike the first two scenarios the dr in the actual irrigation management was kept close to the raw between doy 143 and 150 end of may a situation that should have been avoided since reductions in etc during flowering can affect yield as a result the calculated er for this scenario was 238 mm which represents 75 of the gross annual precipitation 318 4 mm when using er calculation procedures based on empirical equations smith and fao 1992 the er is higher between 7 and 20 than that obtained with dsspim as the other procedures do not consider the soil moisture content before rainfall events the moisture deficit in winter is very low fig 5c so the soil can only store a small portion of the rainwater 3 1 2 irrigation management of the tomato greenhouse in the case study of greenhouse tomato there is no limit for water allocation and the soil s water storage capacity is not considered in the irrigation scheduling of this type of crops fernández et al 2001 consequently irrigation programming is only conditioned by crop evapotranspiration and since it is a horticultural crop the fir irrigation strategy is used to manage irrigation the crop growing season started on august 20 2019 and ended on may 25 2020 because water meters were installed after the crops were planted only water inputs were monitored during the growing period without considering previous watering for soil preparation in this case the soil moisture sensors were used only to monitor the applied irrigation fig 6 shows both the actual water application during the irrigation season and the irrigation scheduling computed by dsspim the actual amount of irrigation water applied by the farmer during the season was 558 mm according to the water meter records while the volume recommended by dsspim was 654 mm from doy 352 2019 significant deviations were observed between the proposed and actual schedule in contrast to the recommended irrigation schedule in the actual schedule there were days when no irrigation occurred this is because certain environmental conditions inside the greenhouse relative humidity and ventilation were not included in dsspim the main difference occurred in the last month of the crop season may from doy 122 146 when the farmer decided to apply 65 of the water needs in the first fortnight and reduced irrigation to 33 of the crop needs on the last 10 days this decision was related to yield decline at the end of the crop cycle 3 2 water use analysis in the organic orange grove and greenhouse tomatoes the aim of dsspim is to analyze current irrigation management practices with a view to future decisions the analysis diagnostic module described in section 2 1 4 was performed using the wf and ris indicators the results of the main indicators of the water use analysis for the orange and greenhouse tomato crops are presented in table 1 the amount of blue water used cwublue for both crops was obtained from the records of the water meters installed on each farm for the crops grown outdoors cwugreen is the total amount of rainwater available for the crops and is estimated from the measurements of the soil moisture sensors the crop yield data of the studied season were provided by the farm managers under the actual irrigation management the crop yield values for oranges and greenhouse tomatoes were 16 50 t ha and 109 5 t ha respectively both farms are classified as organic farms so quality is given priority over quantity consequently when these crops are produced under conventional agricultural conditions they can reach higher yield values around 20 higher than on organic production farms for the orange groves 7348 m3 ha of water were used to obtain a crop yield of 16 50 t ha of the total amount of water used 2382 m3 ha corresponded to green water and 4966 m3 ha corresponded to blue water for irrigation and other cultivation practices the total applied irrigation water was lower than the iwa 5000 m3 ha and considerably lower than the theoretical crop irrigation needs 7112 m3 ha the ris value was 0 7 thus indicating the application of a deficit irrigation strategy the total wforange value was 445 m3 t of which 68 was wfblue the production of tomatoes was not affected by rainwater so cwugreen was zero the cwubllue value in this crop was 5576 m3 ha and lower than cwr 6536 m3 ha the ris value for the entire irrigation season was 0 85 due to the deficit irrigation performed by the farm manager at the end of the season given the high production of greenhouse crops the resulting wftomato was 51 m3 t which is much lower than the wf of the orange crop although the methodology has been tested on orange and tomato greenhouse crops the methodology is applicable to outdoor woody crops and greenhouse horticultural crops with similar characteristics and management e g olive trees outdoor or greenhouses crops like cucumber pepper and eggplant the information obtained from the water use analysis and the results of the dsspim simulations enable detecting moments when the irrigator s management differs from the recommended irrigation schedule identifying the causes and consequence of this difference allows the irrigator to take corrective measures and improve irrigation management in the following season dsspim uses ict tools and weather forecasts and records to estimate effective precipitation from daily soil moisture content measurements and obtain more accurate daily irrigation schedules than other dsss that use only historical weather records and general formulations to estimate effective rainfall alcaide et al 2019 gonzález perea et al 2017 mérida garcía et al 2018 moreover the increase in water use efficiency through precision irrigation scheduled by dsspim in which various irrigation strategies such as controlled deficit irrigation can be considered are evaluated by the joint use of wf and ris indicators garcía morillo et al 2015 gonzález perea et al 2016 together with the irrigation schedules finally dsspim permits comparing water use total volume and timing based on schedules to a farm s usual irrigation programming to identify irrigation inefficiencies which if corrected can lead to water savings of up to 20 while maintaining the same level of production and reducing costs for the farmer however dsspim has certain limitations the accuracy of the results could be conditioned by the quality of the information used weather forecasts soil water content measured by soil sensors water consumption recorded by water meters etc failures in the coverage of the communication system of the sensors as well as the inadequate maintenance of the control devices the suitability of the network sectorization depending on the spatial variability of soils topography etc determines the minimum number of soil moisture sensors one per sector needed to obtain accurate results precise sectorization may be unaffordable for some farms to obtain quality results with dssipm other disadvantages include constraints related to crop development personnel management market prices or environmental conditions inside the greenhouse which affect irrigation management and are known by the farmer but not addressed in the current version of dsspim 4 conclusions a precision irrigation management decision support model dsspim has been developed to perform and evaluate optimal irrigation management for outdoor crops as well as for greenhouse horticultural crops the procedure performs an optimal weekly irrigation scheduling adapted to the characteristics of each farm using icts and real data are collected on site by remote sensors and from open data weather forecasts the on site remote sensors are used to send information in real time to the calculation platform via icts which is then stored in the cloud for subsequent analysis real time information on the applied crop water and the evolution of soil moisture content is used to determine the optimal irrigation timing as well as the amount of water to be applied accurate data on daily crop water use green and blue water are evaluated in the water use analysis module the use of soil water content information in outdoor crops allows the determination of daily effective rainfall green water on a more precise and appropriate time scale for optimal irrigation which in turn improves the management of water resources and allows for more accurate green water accounting dsspim was developed and applied to two organic farms orange grove and greenhouse tomatoes during an agricultural season in southern spain optimal irrigation schedules were obtained for each crop at the end of the crop season crop water use was accounted for and analyzed in the water use analysis module the comparison between scenarios of different irrigation management systems fir and rdi in orange trees shows that the application of regulated deficit irrigation strategies in tree crops can reduce irrigation water use by 20 moreover the model maintains the irrigation water recommendation below the water allocation in all the simulated scenarios additionally the results show that for the same irrigation water consumption the differences in irrigation management frequency and duration result in a lower use of rainwater stored in the soil in the tomato crop the management recommended by dsspim and the actual irrigator s management closely matched the crop needs with the exception of the end of the cycle when the farmer made a decision related to factors not considered in dsspim the joint analysis of wfc ris and dsspim irrigation schedules provide useful information about both the amount of water needed to obtain a unit of product and the level of adequacy of the applied irrigation this information is essential to detect inefficiencies in irrigation management and deviations in the actual irrigation schedule compared to the recommended dsspim schedule and undertake improvement actions aimed at increasing water use efficiency the automation of irrigation scheduling using dsspim data as well as the incorporation of other factors that affect irrigation scheduling crop management production status prices etc and improved irrigation network sectorization increasing the number of sensors to better monitor crop and environmental conditions on farms or in greenhouses could contribute to irrigation scheduling that is more in line with the reality of each farm a key aspect for irrigators

9479,nitrogen loss from tea orchards in the three gorges reservoir area tgra will increase the risk of eutrophication in reservoir surrounding bodies of water however runoff and nitrogen loss from tea orchard slopes in response to rainstorm patterns have been rarely reported especially on the interflow process the study was conducted using simulated slopes containing soil collected from the slopes of tea orchards in the lanlingxi watershed of the tgra rainfall runoff processes were then monitored and recorded for three typical rainstorms similar total rainfall volumes in 2019 rainy season rainfall concentrated towards the middle stage mr latter stage lr and early stage er of the rainstorm results revealed that 1 runoff and soil nitrogen loss characteristics differed significantly among these three rainstorm patterns among which the er rainstorm had the greatest runoff amount 58 45 l 83 06 and 54 38 higher than mr and lr respectively the greatest nitrogen loss load 623 99 kg km 2 92 92 and 95 71 higher than mr and lr respectively and the greatest interflow proportion to total runoff 76 00 2 interflow is the primary process governing nitrogen loss in tea orchard slopes during rainstorms more than 90 of the total nitrogen tn was lost with the interflow and the nitrate nitrogen loss in the interflow accounted for more than 50 of the tn 3 the nitrogen loss process differed significantly among the three rainfall patterns under rainstorm events but the nitrogen loss load was mainly concentrated in the first half of the interflow as such reducing or delaying interflow generation or intercepting and collecting it during the interflow generation stage may better cope with the loss of soil nutrients under rainstorm or even extreme rainstorm events lowering the risk of eutrophication for surrounding bodies of water keywords three gorges reservoir area rainstorm pattern nitrogen interflow tea orchard 1 introduction under increasingly severe climate change it is significant that exploring the dynamics of soil nitrogen loss from slopes by rainfall events and the contributions of different runoff processes to soil nitrogen loss which can perform in the identification of effective approaches for mitigating and maintaining nitrogen loss within a tolerable range thereby controlling agricultural non point source pollution zhu et al 2012a 2012b yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 scherger et al 2022 the runoff processes which control soil nitrogen loss are mainly recognized surface flow and interflow jia et al 2007 rainfall is the main driving force of runoff loss li et al 2017 hua and zhu 2020 with the overall duration intensity and pattern shaping the runoff nitrogen loss process angulo martínez and barros 2015 previous studies have found rainfall intensity as the primary factor governing runoff processes and associated nitrogen loss zhang et al 2003a 2003b rainfall intensity displayed a significant negative correlation with the starting timing of slope runoff katebikord et al 2017 while positive correlation with peak runoff flow alavinia et al 2018 gan et al 2021 deng et al 2019 and liu et al 2020 have found that high intensity rainfall could sharply increase nitrogen concentrations in the resultant runoff given fixed rainfall duration chen et al 2017a 2017b demonstrated that rainfall duration is positively related with runoff volume and soil nitrogen loss under a constant rainfall intensity wang and zhu 2011 revealed that nitrogen loss in surface flow and interflow differed significantly with differences in rainfall volume while differences in rainfall intensity or duration could conceal the impact of rainfall patterns on runoff and associated nitrogen loss nonetheless rainfall patterns were important regulators of the resultant loss and associated eutrophication risk during rainstorms many features could be easily detected such as substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity associated with complex relationships between rainfall and runoff the effects of rainfall patterns on runoff development the degree of nitrogen loss in runoff and differences in the types of existing nitrogen within such runoff dunkerley 2012 performed a series of field experiments that demonstrated rainfall patterns impact the degree of stormwater infiltration and possible runoff distributions alavinia et al 2018 assessed four simulated rainfall patterns with the same total kinetic energy and found that rainfall patterns significantly impact runoff process distributions at different points in time liu and huang 2013 also confirmed that runoff distributions can alter the loss of nutrients from the soil however further research is still required to clarify the influence mode and degree of rainfall pattern on soil nitrogen loss the three gorges reservoir area tgra resides in the continental subtropical monsoon climate zone rainfall is plentiful and concentrated with rainstorm events during the rainy season in this region topographically the tgra is primarily hilly and mountainous with a thin and shallow soil layer in addition the soil in the tgra possesses weak fertilizer and water fixation ability which makes this region particularly prone to soil erosion and nutrient loss and the eutrophication of surrounding bodies of water consequently a significant ecological risk zeng et al 2014 cao et al 2019 studies of soil erosion and nutrient loss in the tgra have primarily focused on farmland or barren lands leaving such analysis of tea orchards in this region absence by 2016 he tea farming area has expanded rapidly with a 57 64 increase in the tea orchard area compared to 2008 in this region zhang et al 2018a 2018b owing to a lack of scientific oversight or systematically theoretical guidelines excessive fertilizer application was conducted in the context of tea orchard land reclamation and plantation to maximize profits the majority of the applied fertilizer was not absorbed by the tea plants rather reserved in the soil and ultimately removed with the runoff the average total nitrogen tn concentrations in the surface flow of tea orchards in the tgra is 15 09 mg l 1 far exceeding the national surface water quality standard limit zeng et al 2012 wang et al 2018 previous studies have shown that a large amount of soil and soil nitrogen were lost along with the surface flow and eroded sediment during the reclamation and planting of tea gardens however there are few studies on soil nitrogen loss in the slope scale interflow of tea orchards in the tgra especially the effect of the spatial and temporal distribution of interflow and surface flow on the process and mechanism of soil nitrogen loss compared with general rainfall events rainstorm events have more complex rainfall characteristics even with similar rainfall nitrogen loss load major pathways and process distributions could vary under different rainfall patterns it is not thoroughly addressed that the pathway differentiation and process distribution of soil nitrogen loss under different rainfall patterns in this study a simulated runoff plot test approach was utilized to monitor the rainfall runoff process under natural rainfall by taking the tea orchard soils collected from the lanlingxi watershed in 2019 the process and characteristics of soil nitrogen loss under three different rainstorm patterns were analyzed and the contribution of surface flow and interflow to soil nitrogen loss was evaluated to provide new insight into the primary mechanisms and stages governing soil nitrogen loss these results have the potential to guide the formulation of effective prevention and control measures aimed at reducing agriculture non point source pollution and water body eutrophication in the tgra 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experimental plots were located at the forest ecological observation and research station in the tgra in the lanlingxi watershed 30 51 21 30 51 34 n 110 53 27 110 54 50 e this144 ha area is hilly as higher in the west and lower in the east with altitudes from 200 to 1400 m above sea level this watershed belongs to the continental subtropical monsoon climate zone with an annual mean temperature of 14 c rainfall in the langlingxi watershed is abundant with an average annual rainfall of 990 mm over the past 50 years and substantial interannual variations and uneven seasonal distributions in rainfall with roughly 70 of precipitation occurring in the rainy season between may and october 2 2 experiment design two simulated field runoff plots were set for experimental observation based upon local hillslope hydrology characteristics these plots were constructed using a movable steel framed plastic soil tank with an area of 3 m length 1 5 m width 0 6 m height a 5 cm high baffle was placed at the bottom of each tank to divide runoff plots into soil and drainage layers with the drainage layer being filled with clean arenaceous quartz and pebbles two conflux troughs were built in the topsoil and the bottom of the tank drainage layer to enable analyses of both surface flow and interflow with buckets being placed under each of these troughs to collect water samples for further quantification fig 1 simulated plot method has higher real time and more accurate runoff collection than other monitoring methods such as lysimeters or leaching collection tray method it was employed to study the runoff and nutrient loss load carried by the runoff within a period of time at a fixed depth of soil which was difficult to analyze the transformation law of nutrients along with the soil profile tea orchards in the lanlingxi watershed are mainly distributed on slopes composed of yellow soil at angles from 11 5 to 27 2 with an area weighted average of 21 12 hence the angle gradient of the simulated study plot was set to 21 soil samples from the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depths in tea orchards were collected and transported to the research station the original soil layer order was used to fill the study plots without grinding or sieving to ensure consistent soil bulk density the actual height of soil in the tank was 40 cm with this depth corresponding to the core range of tea tree root distributions after soil filling these simulated plots were placed into an open test field following settlement for one year soil conditions in this plot are largely consistent with natural conditions after which natural rainfall monitoring was conducted the physical and chemical properties of the test soil are listed in table 1 tea was planted in the simulated plot in 2018 at a planting density of 15 cm 15 cm with fertilization being conducted in march of each year manual tea management practices in this study were reflective of common management practices employed in this watershed 2 3 sampling and analysis climate data were obtained from the research station during the rainy season with rainfall being measured with a rain gauge and the times at which surface flow and interflow being recorded the rain gauge utilized a tipping bucket mechanism to produce a contact closure every time it receives a predetermined amount of rainfall 0 2 mm with average rain intensity being calculated based on the maximum rainfall intensity over 30 min and the rainfall duration being measured from the beginning of effective rainfall to the end of rain gauge measurements runoff water samples were collected every 30 min with surface flow on the test slopes extending from the beginning of the surface flow until 90 min following the termination of surface flow while interflow collection extended from the beginning of the interflow runoff until 240 min followed by the termination of interflow rainwater was collected as a blank sample during periods of runoff sampling a ruler was used to measure the water levels in collection buckets after each runoff event in 2019 as a means of calculating runoff flux with runoff water samples then being collected and stored in clean polyethylene bottles after each runoff event samples were transported to the laboratory within 2 h of collection stored at 4 c and analyzed within 48 h tn concentrations were determined via alkaline potassium persulfate digestion spectrophotometry gb t 11894 89 nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n concentrations were measured with an automated chemical analyzer smartchem 200 2 4 data analysis nitrogen loss load was calculated using eq 1 based upon synchronous flow and concentrations 1 m i 1 i n 1 c i q i t i where m is the

results 3 1 rainstorm runoff characteristics three rainstorms were monitored during the 2019 rainy season with a rainfall volume of 50 mm within 24 h while all three rainstorms exhibited a similar total rainfall volume the patterns of rainfall differed substantially table 2 these rainstorms were classified into three patterns according to their dimension cumulative rainfall volume dimension cumulative rainfall duration dcv dcd curves fig 2 yin et al 2014 specifically rainfall was concentrated at either the early stage er middle stage mr or late stage lr of the rainstorm the mr storm exhibited the greatest total rainfall volume with the smallest average rainfall intensity and the longest rainfall duration table 2 rainfall intensity durations during the mr storm were relatively concentrated but varied in a complex manner with multiple visible peaks the mr storm was also associated with a longer period of elevated temperature without precipitation prior to the storm such that the soil moisture content was lowest prior to the mr storm the er storm exhibited the highest rainfall intensity peak whereas the lr storm exhibited the latest rainfall intensity peak the tea orchard soil in the present study is yellow soil with a silty loam consistency owing to its bulk density thickness and porosity rainwater can rapidly penetrate this soil however tea orchards also exhibit extensive vegetation coverage and tea trees have dense roots with a strong ability to fix soil water making it easier to observe surface flow and interflow generation under rainstorm conditions significant differences in the surface flow and interflow dynamics were observed under the three evaluated rainstorm patterns table 2 and fig 3 hua et al 2013 the interflow and surface flow curves for both the er and lr storms were all unimodal as was the mr interflow curve whereas the mr surface flow curve was multimodal surface flow exhibited a more pronounced response to rainfall processes with both surface flow and interflow processes lagging the time to runoff initiation was the shortest for the er storm which also exhibited the shortest interval between surface flow and interflow peak surface flow and interflow velocities reached at 90 min of er runoff with peak respective values of 2 26 and 6 19 ml s 1 at this time point cumulative rainfall volume had reached 37 6 mm accounting for 64 16 of the total volume throughout the entirety of the rainstorm runoff process both surface flow and interflow exhibited trends of sharp variability the mr storm characteristics and soil moisture content were associated with prolonged residence time and rainwater interception in the soil resulting in the mr storm exhibiting the longest time to runoff initiation for this storm surface flow and interflow lagged behind the start of rainfall by 27 and 350 min respectively the surface flow velocity peak volume was 0 75 ml s 1 appearing at 150 min following surface flow onset whereas the interflow velocity peak volume was 3 58 ml s 1 appearing at 90 min following interflow onset after the end of mr rainfall the interflow velocity gradually decreased with the extension of the interflow duration owing to the absence of further rainwater input the interval between the lr and mr storms was relatively short such that the surface soil moisture content was higher during this storm while rainfall intensity during the early stages of the lr storm was relatively limited surface flow nonetheless began at 20 min after the start of rainfall yellow soil exhibits a relatively limited water fixing capacity as well as the low soil moisture content in the deep layer early rainwater is thus primarily absorbed by the soil resulting in the substantially later onset of interflow at 315 min following the onset of surface flow peak rainfall occurred late during the lr storm with the overall rainfall process ending quickly such that less rainfall was available for subsequent runoff as such while the onset of interflow during this storm was delayed the overall duration of interflow was just 245 min the respective runoff rates during the mr lr and er rainstorm runoff events were 11 75 14 36 and 22 24 the er runoff volume was 58 45 l which was 1 54 times and 1 83 times greater than the volume observed during the lr and mr rainstorm runoff events the measured interflow volume was additionally significantly higher than the surface flow for all three measured storms with the er interflow accounting for the highest fraction of total runoff 76 00 whereas the lr interflow accounted for the lowest fraction of total runoff 68 30 3 2 nitrogen loss characteristics runoff is the primary mode of nitrogen transport in the soil marked differences in nitrogen loss patterns and loss characteristics were observed with the surface flow and interflow dynamics under the three studied rainstorm patterns liu 2018 the characteristics and dynamics of tn no3 n and nh4 n loss through surface flow and interflow under these three rainstorm patterns are summarized in fig 4 3 2 1 total nitrogen concentrations tn loss in the mr lr and er storms ranged from 5 39 to 13 97 mg l 1 7 31 18 30 mg l 1 and 7 01 23 40 mg l 1 in surface flow respectively and 40 50 65 72 mg l 1 38 30 57 62 mg l 1 and 37 07 60 88 mg l 1 in interflow with significantly higher tn concentrations in the interflow relative to the surface flow the average tn concentrations in interflow were 3 37 4 93 and 5 56 fold higher than those in the surface flow during the er lr and mr rainstorm runoff events respectively these results thus indicated that the difference in tn concentrations between the interflow and surface flow rises with increasing rainfall duration and total runoff duration despite the above trends the average concentration of tn in the surface flow of the er was the highest which was 1 63 and 1 88 fold of that in the surface flow of the mr and lr respectively the average concentration of tn in the interflow of the mr was the highest which was 1 08 and 1 02 fold of that in the interflow of the lr and er respectively these results were consistent with data from ma et al 2002 who found rainfall intensity to have little impact on runoff nitrogen concentrations 3 2 2 no3 n and nh4 n concentrations the overall rank order of no3 n concentration peaks in the surface flow and interflow fractions was er 13 60 mg l 1 lr 9 25 mg l 1 mr 8 57 mg l 1 and mr 42 28 mg l 1 er 39 83 mg l 1 lr 36 66 mg l 1 respectively fig 4 the rank ordering of no3 n concentrations in the surface flow was identical to that of surface flow velocity while the rank order of no3 n concentrations in the interflow was identical to that of interflow duration while a complex array of factors influence runoff no3 n concentrations the peak no3 n concentration rank ordering was the same as that observed for tn concentrations and the measured interflow no3 n concentrations were significantly higher than those in the collected surface flow in the surface flow no3 n concentrations were significantly higher for the er storm relative to the lr and mr storms with the no3 n concentration in this fraction from the mr storm being higher than that for the lr storm p 0 05 these results pertaining to the concentrations of tn and no3 n associated with these three types of rainstorm events are consistent with the results published by zhang et al overall the chemical properties of no3 n in runoff loss are not stable as those for tn as they are more susceptible to changes in rainfall pattern overall the observed tn and no3 n concentrations in analyzed runoff were consistent whereas the nh4 n runoff concentration distribution differed markedly from that observed for tn and no3 n zhang et al 2018a 2018b overall nh4 n loss concentrations associated with the mr lr and er rainstorm runoff events respectively ranged from 0 86 to 1 64 mg l 1 0 72 2 38 mg l 1 and 0 82 3 02 mg l 1 in the surface flow and 0 37 1 27 mg l 1 0 89 1 20 mg l 1 and 0 76 1 37 mg l 1 in the interflow respectively fig 4 with an overall rank order for average nh4 n concentrations in both the surface flow and the interflow of er lr mr heavy rainfall enhanced the destructive ability of the topsoil and accelerated the dissolution of nh4 n in the soil and into the runoff wang et al 2019 there was no significant difference in the nh4 n concentration in the surface flow during the three rainstorm events and the same phenomenon was also observed in the interflow however the nh4 n concentration in surface flow was significantly higher than that in interflow however the chemical form of nh4 n is the most unstable and easily affected by external factors zhang et al 2016 nh4 n in runoff was easily converted to no3 n through nitrification pan et al 2016 therefore the shorter the runoff duration the higher the nh4 n concentration in the runoff 3 3 nitrogen loss loads and distributions concentrations and runoff volume are the two primary factors that govern nitrogen loss in a rainstorm runoff system further calculations revealed significant differences in tn no3 n and nh4 n output as a function of rainstorm pattern with tn loss load being significantly higher in the er storm relative to the lr and mr storms over 90 of tn was lost through interflow irrespective of the rainstorm pattern with no3 n loss load through the interflow accounting for over half of tn lost via this mechanism these results thus suggest that roughly half of all nitrogen loss associated with these different rainstorm systems is attributable to no3 n in the interflow moreover nh4 n loss load through the surface flow and interflow fractions respectively accounted for 10 82 14 72 and 2 04 2 48 of the tn loss despite the high nh4 n loss to tn loss ratio in the surface flow and the relatively high nh4 n concentrations in this runoff fraction the amount of nh4 n lost with interflow is nonetheless relatively high table 3 with the interflow serving as the primary mechanism governing nh4 n loss 3 4 dcl dcd curve analyses by constructing dimensionless dcl dcd curves for the runoff nitrogen loss process under three rainstorm patterns this study revealed that the significant differences in the contributions of surface flow and interflow to nitrogen loss under these different conditions fig 5 compared with the commonly used dimensionless cumulative m v curve method and mff index method the dcl dcd curve had shown the temporal variation of runoff and nitrogen loss more intuitively and reflected the significant relation between nitrogen loss and runoff in real time the tn loss via the surface flow was most responsive to rainfall patterns with a curve that was similar to the dimensional curve for rainfall the cumulative tn loss with the surface flow during the first half of the surface flow duration for the lr mr and er storms was 7 52 49 98 and 91 79 of the total tn loss respectively the variation trends of dcl dcd curves of the interflow pathway under the three rainfall patterns were relatively consistent indicating that the tn loss of the interflow was less affected by the rainfall pattern the cumulative tn loss with the interflow during the first half of the interflow duration for the mr lr and er storms was 99 01 83 45 and 87 62 of the total tn loss respectively especially for the mr storm 76 54 of the tn loss occurred during the initial 10 of the interflow duration under the three rainfall patterns the dcl dcd curves of surface flow interflow and total runoff under er rainstorm have the similar trend the variation trend of the dcl dcd curve of the mr total runoff process is closer to that of the interflow pathway the variation trend of the dcl dcd curve of the lr total runoff process is closer to that of the surface flow pathway combining with fig 3 it can be seen that the difference in beginning time and duration of runoff under different rainfall patterns has a direct impact on the distribution of soil nitrogen loss load 4 discussion the experiments conducted in this research confirmed that relative to rainfall characteristics such as rainfall amount intensity or duration rainfall pattern is also one of main influencing factors for slope runoff of yellow soil tea orchards prior studies have confirmed that greater rainfall volumes corresponded to a greater total runoff volume and the proportion of interflow to total runoff volume decreases with increasing rainfall amount chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 in this research the order of rainfall amount under the three rainstorm events was completely opposite to the order of total slope runoff in the er the rainfall amount was the smallest the runoff was the largest and the proportion of interflow was the highest for mr and lr the rainfall amount in mr was higher while the interflow volume and total runoff in lr were higher than in mr but the proportion of interflow in lr to total runoff was smaller than in mr jia et al 2007 and lin et al 2011 have posited that lower intensity rainfall over a longer duration was conducive to increased interflow generation while higher rainfall intensity could benefit the generation of surface flow from the results obtained in this research the sequence of surface flow under the three rainstorm events was indeed consistent with the rainfall intensity but the results were completely different for the interflow mr rainfall duration was the longest the average and peak rainfall intensity was the smallest among the three rainstorm events and the interflow was also the smallest the influence of rainfall patterns was confirmed not only by slope runoff but also by the temporal distribution of soil nitrogen loss during runoff in this study the high rainfall intensity in the early stage of rainfall increased the rainfall kinetic energy and the rainfall velocity between the surface layer and deep soil increased the runoff occurred before soil saturation therefore the runoff generation of surface flow and interflow was advanced wu et al 2018 and the difference in runoff generation time between surface flow and interflow was reduced however due to the rapid flow rate of runoff the concentration of dissolved nitrogen carried by runoff also decreased accordingly drewry et al 2009 the high intensity rainfall in the early stage of er rainfall had a scouring effect on the surface soil and the nitrogen in the surface soil entered the surface runoff which made the concentration of various forms of nitrogen in the surface runoff of er higher than other rainfall yang et al 2016 by the end of er rainfall rainfall decreased rapidly and runoff did not follow up rainwater supplement meanwhile the early interflow velocity was rather fast and soil moisture interception was less which could not supplement the later interflow surface flow and interflow both terminated at the end of rainfall the difference between surface flow and interflow duration under er rainfall was far less than other rainfall patterns figs 3 c and 5 and displayed that the duration time and variation trend of the surface flow and interflow process curves of er rainfall were basically identical while the transport capacity of surface flow and interflow for nitrogen was consistent with the runoff velocity therefore the variation trend of dcl dcd curves of different pathways under er rainfall was consequently identical lr and mr rainfall events had low rainfall intensity in the early stage so after the beginning of rainfall the rainwater mainly infiltrate into the soil however the variation of rainfall intensity during mr rainfall is small and the rainfall is mainly concentrated in the middle of rainfall there is a long period of high temperature and no rain in the early stage of mr rainfall which makes the soil moisture content extremely low and the soil water infiltration capacity is much higher than the rainfall intensity therefore the runoff begins until the soil is saturated after the mr rainfall stopped soil moisture continued to supplement the interflow so the mr interflow lasted longer than other rainfall patterns at the same time soil water fully absorbed nitrogen before interflow when mr interflow began to produce a large amount of nitrogen was lost with runoff therefore i the loss of nitrogen with interflow mainly concentrated in the early interflow loss because the interflow and duration are much higher than the surface runoff tn loss with the soil flow accounted for 94 63 of the total so the dcl dcd curve of the total runoff process is consistent with the dcl dcd curve of the interflow process these results are based on the rainstorms observed in the 2019 rainy season and therefore have certain limitations and errors considering that the relationship between rainfall amount and runoff is extremely complex gomi et al 2008 it is recommended to continue to monitor the natural rainfall runoff process in the tgra in subsequent studies to confirm the validity of these results meanwhile through the artificial rainfall method according to the classification of rainfall patterns in this study simulation experiments under different rainfall characteristics are carried out to repeatedly verify the experimental results or the climate change model is used to predict the runoff of rainfall events under the same rainfall pattern so that the experiment results are more believable the analysis of different rainstorm patterns revealed that the interflow was the primary mediator of nitrogen loss under storm conditions suggesting that the adaptability of tea orchard soil to rainstorm events can be improved by enhancing soil structure increasing soil water retention and reducing or slowing interflow generation within the deep soil alternatively intercepting and collecting runoff during the early stage of soil midstream generation can effectively reduce the potential for nitrogen loss in the soil and the pollution of surrounding bodies of water by prioritizing and mitigating the management of interflow and its associated nutrient loss it can cope with soil nutrient loss under rainstorm or even extreme rainstorm events making the prevention and control mechanism of agricultural non point source pollution in the tgra more effective 5 conclusion this study monitored the rainfall runoff process of the yellow soil tea orchard slope in the tgra under natural rainfall and analyzed the effects of different rainfall patterns on soil nitrogen loss process distribution and pathway differentiation the results showed that the runoff and soil nitrogen loss of er rainfall were higher than those of other rainfall patterns under rainstorm conditions with similar rainfall interflow was the main pathway of soil nitrogen loss and interflow pattern governs the soil nitrogen loss pattern understanding the contribution of surface flow and interflow to soil nitrogen loss under different rainfall patterns is helpful for analyzing and predicting the main pathways of soil erosion and soil nutrient loss under extreme rainfall events and for formulating targeted prevention and control strategies to reduce the tgra agricultural non point source pollution and water eutrophication and related environmental hazards in the future it is recommended to extend the time scale under natural rainfall conditions or conduct further studies through climate change models to confirm the validity of these results declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

9479,nitrogen loss from tea orchards in the three gorges reservoir area tgra will increase the risk of eutrophication in reservoir surrounding bodies of water however runoff and nitrogen loss from tea orchard slopes in response to rainstorm patterns have been rarely reported especially on the interflow process the study was conducted using simulated slopes containing soil collected from the slopes of tea orchards in the lanlingxi watershed of the tgra rainfall runoff processes were then monitored and recorded for three typical rainstorms similar total rainfall volumes in 2019 rainy season rainfall concentrated towards the middle stage mr latter stage lr and early stage er of the rainstorm results revealed that 1 runoff and soil nitrogen loss characteristics differed significantly among these three rainstorm patterns among which the er rainstorm had the greatest runoff amount 58 45 l 83 06 and 54 38 higher than mr and lr respectively the greatest nitrogen loss load 623 99 kg km 2 92 92 and 95 71 higher than mr and lr respectively and the greatest interflow proportion to total runoff 76 00 2 interflow is the primary process governing nitrogen loss in tea orchard slopes during rainstorms more than 90 of the total nitrogen tn was lost with the interflow and the nitrate nitrogen loss in the interflow accounted for more than 50 of the tn 3 the nitrogen loss process differed significantly among the three rainfall patterns under rainstorm events but the nitrogen loss load was mainly concentrated in the first half of the interflow as such reducing or delaying interflow generation or intercepting and collecting it during the interflow generation stage may better cope with the loss of soil nutrients under rainstorm or even extreme rainstorm events lowering the risk of eutrophication for surrounding bodies of water keywords three gorges reservoir area rainstorm pattern nitrogen interflow tea orchard 1 introduction under increasingly severe climate change it is significant that exploring the dynamics of soil nitrogen loss from slopes by rainfall events and the contributions of different runoff processes to soil nitrogen loss which can perform in the identification of effective approaches for mitigating and maintaining nitrogen loss within a tolerable range thereby controlling agricultural non point source pollution zhu et al 2012a 2012b yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 scherger et al 2022 the runoff processes which control soil nitrogen loss are mainly recognized surface flow and interflow jia et al 2007 rainfall is the main driving force of runoff loss li et al 2017 hua and zhu 2020 with the overall duration intensity and pattern shaping the runoff nitrogen loss process angulo martínez and barros 2015 previous studies have found rainfall intensity as the primary factor governing runoff processes and associated nitrogen loss zhang et al 2003a 2003b rainfall intensity displayed a significant negative correlation with the starting timing of slope runoff katebikord et al 2017 while positive correlation with peak runoff flow alavinia et al 2018 gan et al 2021 deng et al 2019 and liu et al 2020 have found that high intensity rainfall could sharply increase nitrogen concentrations in the resultant runoff given fixed rainfall duration chen et al 2017a 2017b demonstrated that rainfall duration is positively related with runoff volume and soil nitrogen loss under a constant rainfall intensity wang and zhu 2011 revealed that nitrogen loss in surface flow and interflow differed significantly with differences in rainfall volume while differences in rainfall intensity or duration could conceal the impact of rainfall patterns on runoff and associated nitrogen loss nonetheless rainfall patterns were important regulators of the resultant loss and associated eutrophication risk during rainstorms many features could be easily detected such as substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity associated with complex relationships between rainfall and runoff the effects of rainfall patterns on runoff development the degree of nitrogen loss in runoff and differences in the types of existing nitrogen within such runoff dunkerley 2012 performed a series of field experiments that demonstrated rainfall patterns impact the degree of stormwater infiltration and possible runoff distributions alavinia et al 2018 assessed four simulated rainfall patterns with the same total kinetic energy and found that rainfall patterns significantly impact runoff process distributions at different points in time liu and huang 2013 also confirmed that runoff distributions can alter the loss of nutrients from the soil however further research is still required to clarify the influence mode and degree of rainfall pattern on soil nitrogen loss the three gorges reservoir area tgra resides in the continental subtropical monsoon climate zone rainfall is plentiful and concentrated with rainstorm events during the rainy season in this region topographically the tgra is primarily hilly and mountainous with a thin and shallow soil layer in addition the soil in the tgra possesses weak fertilizer and water fixation ability which makes this region particularly prone to soil erosion and nutrient loss and the eutrophication of surrounding bodies of water consequently a significant ecological risk zeng et al 2014 cao et al 2019 studies of soil erosion and nutrient loss in the tgra have primarily focused on farmland or barren lands leaving such analysis of tea orchards in this region absence by 2016 he tea farming area has expanded rapidly with a 57 64 increase in the tea orchard area compared to 2008 in this region zhang et al 2018a 2018b owing to a lack of scientific oversight or systematically theoretical guidelines excessive fertilizer application was conducted in the context of tea orchard land reclamation and plantation to maximize profits the majority of the applied fertilizer was not absorbed by the tea plants rather reserved in the soil and ultimately removed with the runoff the average total nitrogen tn concentrations in the surface flow of tea orchards in the tgra is 15 09 mg l 1 far exceeding the national surface water quality standard limit zeng et al 2012 wang et al 2018 previous studies have shown that a large amount of soil and soil nitrogen were lost along with the surface flow and eroded sediment during the reclamation and planting of tea gardens however there are few studies on soil nitrogen loss in the slope scale interflow of tea orchards in the tgra especially the effect of the spatial and temporal distribution of interflow and surface flow on the process and mechanism of soil nitrogen loss compared with general rainfall events rainstorm events have more complex rainfall characteristics even with similar rainfall nitrogen loss load major pathways and process distributions could vary under different rainfall patterns it is not thoroughly addressed that the pathway differentiation and process distribution of soil nitrogen loss under different rainfall patterns in this study a simulated runoff plot test approach was utilized to monitor the rainfall runoff process under natural rainfall by taking the tea orchard soils collected from the lanlingxi watershed in 2019 the process and characteristics of soil nitrogen loss under three different rainstorm patterns were analyzed and the contribution of surface flow and interflow to soil nitrogen loss was evaluated to provide new insight into the primary mechanisms and stages governing soil nitrogen loss these results have the potential to guide the formulation of effective prevention and control measures aimed at reducing agriculture non point source pollution and water body eutrophication in the tgra 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experimental plots were located at the forest ecological observation and research station in the tgra in the lanlingxi watershed 30 51 21 30 51 34 n 110 53 27 110 54 50 e this144 ha area is hilly as higher in the west and lower in the east with altitudes from 200 to 1400 m above sea level this watershed belongs to the continental subtropical monsoon climate zone with an annual mean temperature of 14 c rainfall in the langlingxi watershed is abundant with an average annual rainfall of 990 mm over the past 50 years and substantial interannual variations and uneven seasonal distributions in rainfall with roughly 70 of precipitation occurring in the rainy season between may and october 2 2 experiment design two simulated field runoff plots were set for experimental observation based upon local hillslope hydrology characteristics these plots were constructed using a movable steel framed plastic soil tank with an area of 3 m length 1 5 m width 0 6 m height a 5 cm high baffle was placed at the bottom of each tank to divide runoff plots into soil and drainage layers with the drainage layer being filled with clean arenaceous quartz and pebbles two conflux troughs were built in the topsoil and the bottom of the tank drainage layer to enable analyses of both surface flow and interflow with buckets being placed under each of these troughs to collect water samples for further quantification fig 1 simulated plot method has higher real time and more accurate runoff collection than other monitoring methods such as lysimeters or leaching collection tray method it was employed to study the runoff and nutrient loss load carried by the runoff within a period of time at a fixed depth of soil which was difficult to analyze the transformation law of nutrients along with the soil profile tea orchards in the lanlingxi watershed are mainly distributed on slopes composed of yellow soil at angles from 11 5 to 27 2 with an area weighted average of 21 12 hence the angle gradient of the simulated study plot was set to 21 soil samples from the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depths in tea orchards were collected and transported to the research station the original soil layer order was used to fill the study plots without grinding or sieving to ensure consistent soil bulk density the actual height of soil in the tank was 40 cm with this depth corresponding to the core range of tea tree root distributions after soil filling these simulated plots were placed into an open test field following settlement for one year soil conditions in this plot are largely consistent with natural conditions after which natural rainfall monitoring was conducted the physical and chemical properties of the test soil are listed in table 1 tea was planted in the simulated plot in 2018 at a planting density of 15 cm 15 cm with fertilization being conducted in march of each year manual tea management practices in this study were reflective of common management practices employed in this watershed 2 3 sampling and analysis climate data were obtained from the research station during the rainy season with rainfall being measured with a rain gauge and the times at which surface flow and interflow being recorded the rain gauge utilized a tipping bucket mechanism to produce a contact closure every time it receives a predetermined amount of rainfall 0 2 mm with average rain intensity being calculated based on the maximum rainfall intensity over 30 min and the rainfall duration being measured from the beginning of effective rainfall to the end of rain gauge measurements runoff water samples were collected every 30 min with surface flow on the test slopes extending from the beginning of the surface flow until 90 min following the termination of surface flow while interflow collection extended from the beginning of the interflow runoff until 240 min followed by the termination of interflow rainwater was collected as a blank sample during periods of runoff sampling a ruler was used to measure the water levels in collection buckets after each runoff event in 2019 as a means of calculating runoff flux with runoff water samples then being collected and stored in clean polyethylene bottles after each runoff event samples were transported to the laboratory within 2 h of collection stored at 4 c and analyzed within 48 h tn concentrations were determined via alkaline potassium persulfate digestion spectrophotometry gb t 11894 89 nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n concentrations were measured with an automated chemical analyzer smartchem 200 2 4 data analysis nitrogen loss load was calculated using eq 1 based upon synchronous flow and concentrations 1 m i 1 i n 1 c i q i t i where m is the

results 3 1 rainstorm runoff characteristics three rainstorms were monitored during the 2019 rainy season with a rainfall volume of 50 mm within 24 h while all three rainstorms exhibited a similar total rainfall volume the patterns of rainfall differed substantially table 2 these rainstorms were classified into three patterns according to their dimension cumulative rainfall volume dimension cumulative rainfall duration dcv dcd curves fig 2 yin et al 2014 specifically rainfall was concentrated at either the early stage er middle stage mr or late stage lr of the rainstorm the mr storm exhibited the greatest total rainfall volume with the smallest average rainfall intensity and the longest rainfall duration table 2 rainfall intensity durations during the mr storm were relatively concentrated but varied in a complex manner with multiple visible peaks the mr storm was also associated with a longer period of elevated temperature without precipitation prior to the storm such that the soil moisture content was lowest prior to the mr storm the er storm exhibited the highest rainfall intensity peak whereas the lr storm exhibited the latest rainfall intensity peak the tea orchard soil in the present study is yellow soil with a silty loam consistency owing to its bulk density thickness and porosity rainwater can rapidly penetrate this soil however tea orchards also exhibit extensive vegetation coverage and tea trees have dense roots with a strong ability to fix soil water making it easier to observe surface flow and interflow generation under rainstorm conditions significant differences in the surface flow and interflow dynamics were observed under the three evaluated rainstorm patterns table 2 and fig 3 hua et al 2013 the interflow and surface flow curves for both the er and lr storms were all unimodal as was the mr interflow curve whereas the mr surface flow curve was multimodal surface flow exhibited a more pronounced response to rainfall processes with both surface flow and interflow processes lagging the time to runoff initiation was the shortest for the er storm which also exhibited the shortest interval between surface flow and interflow peak surface flow and interflow velocities reached at 90 min of er runoff with peak respective values of 2 26 and 6 19 ml s 1 at this time point cumulative rainfall volume had reached 37 6 mm accounting for 64 16 of the total volume throughout the entirety of the rainstorm runoff process both surface flow and interflow exhibited trends of sharp variability the mr storm characteristics and soil moisture content were associated with prolonged residence time and rainwater interception in the soil resulting in the mr storm exhibiting the longest time to runoff initiation for this storm surface flow and interflow lagged behind the start of rainfall by 27 and 350 min respectively the surface flow velocity peak volume was 0 75 ml s 1 appearing at 150 min following surface flow onset whereas the interflow velocity peak volume was 3 58 ml s 1 appearing at 90 min following interflow onset after the end of mr rainfall the interflow velocity gradually decreased with the extension of the interflow duration owing to the absence of further rainwater input the interval between the lr and mr storms was relatively short such that the surface soil moisture content was higher during this storm while rainfall intensity during the early stages of the lr storm was relatively limited surface flow nonetheless began at 20 min after the start of rainfall yellow soil exhibits a relatively limited water fixing capacity as well as the low soil moisture content in the deep layer early rainwater is thus primarily absorbed by the soil resulting in the substantially later onset of interflow at 315 min following the onset of surface flow peak rainfall occurred late during the lr storm with the overall rainfall process ending quickly such that less rainfall was available for subsequent runoff as such while the onset of interflow during this storm was delayed the overall duration of interflow was just 245 min the respective runoff rates during the mr lr and er rainstorm runoff events were 11 75 14 36 and 22 24 the er runoff volume was 58 45 l which was 1 54 times and 1 83 times greater than the volume observed during the lr and mr rainstorm runoff events the measured interflow volume was additionally significantly higher than the surface flow for all three measured storms with the er interflow accounting for the highest fraction of total runoff 76 00 whereas the lr interflow accounted for the lowest fraction of total runoff 68 30 3 2 nitrogen loss characteristics runoff is the primary mode of nitrogen transport in the soil marked differences in nitrogen loss patterns and loss characteristics were observed with the surface flow and interflow dynamics under the three studied rainstorm patterns liu 2018 the characteristics and dynamics of tn no3 n and nh4 n loss through surface flow and interflow under these three rainstorm patterns are summarized in fig 4 3 2 1 total nitrogen concentrations tn loss in the mr lr and er storms ranged from 5 39 to 13 97 mg l 1 7 31 18 30 mg l 1 and 7 01 23 40 mg l 1 in surface flow respectively and 40 50 65 72 mg l 1 38 30 57 62 mg l 1 and 37 07 60 88 mg l 1 in interflow with significantly higher tn concentrations in the interflow relative to the surface flow the average tn concentrations in interflow were 3 37 4 93 and 5 56 fold higher than those in the surface flow during the er lr and mr rainstorm runoff events respectively these results thus indicated that the difference in tn concentrations between the interflow and surface flow rises with increasing rainfall duration and total runoff duration despite the above trends the average concentration of tn in the surface flow of the er was the highest which was 1 63 and 1 88 fold of that in the surface flow of the mr and lr respectively the average concentration of tn in the interflow of the mr was the highest which was 1 08 and 1 02 fold of that in the interflow of the lr and er respectively these results were consistent with data from ma et al 2002 who found rainfall intensity to have little impact on runoff nitrogen concentrations 3 2 2 no3 n and nh4 n concentrations the overall rank order of no3 n concentration peaks in the surface flow and interflow fractions was er 13 60 mg l 1 lr 9 25 mg l 1 mr 8 57 mg l 1 and mr 42 28 mg l 1 er 39 83 mg l 1 lr 36 66 mg l 1 respectively fig 4 the rank ordering of no3 n concentrations in the surface flow was identical to that of surface flow velocity while the rank order of no3 n concentrations in the interflow was identical to that of interflow duration while a complex array of factors influence runoff no3 n concentrations the peak no3 n concentration rank ordering was the same as that observed for tn concentrations and the measured interflow no3 n concentrations were significantly higher than those in the collected surface flow in the surface flow no3 n concentrations were significantly higher for the er storm relative to the lr and mr storms with the no3 n concentration in this fraction from the mr storm being higher than that for the lr storm p 0 05 these results pertaining to the concentrations of tn and no3 n associated with these three types of rainstorm events are consistent with the results published by zhang et al overall the chemical properties of no3 n in runoff loss are not stable as those for tn as they are more susceptible to changes in rainfall pattern overall the observed tn and no3 n concentrations in analyzed runoff were consistent whereas the nh4 n runoff concentration distribution differed markedly from that observed for tn and no3 n zhang et al 2018a 2018b overall nh4 n loss concentrations associated with the mr lr and er rainstorm runoff events respectively ranged from 0 86 to 1 64 mg l 1 0 72 2 38 mg l 1 and 0 82 3 02 mg l 1 in the surface flow and 0 37 1 27 mg l 1 0 89 1 20 mg l 1 and 0 76 1 37 mg l 1 in the interflow respectively fig 4 with an overall rank order for average nh4 n concentrations in both the surface flow and the interflow of er lr mr heavy rainfall enhanced the destructive ability of the topsoil and accelerated the dissolution of nh4 n in the soil and into the runoff wang et al 2019 there was no significant difference in the nh4 n concentration in the surface flow during the three rainstorm events and the same phenomenon was also observed in the interflow however the nh4 n concentration in surface flow was significantly higher than that in interflow however the chemical form of nh4 n is the most unstable and easily affected by external factors zhang et al 2016 nh4 n in runoff was easily converted to no3 n through nitrification pan et al 2016 therefore the shorter the runoff duration the higher the nh4 n concentration in the runoff 3 3 nitrogen loss loads and distributions concentrations and runoff volume are the two primary factors that govern nitrogen loss in a rainstorm runoff system further calculations revealed significant differences in tn no3 n and nh4 n output as a function of rainstorm pattern with tn loss load being significantly higher in the er storm relative to the lr and mr storms over 90 of tn was lost through interflow irrespective of the rainstorm pattern with no3 n loss load through the interflow accounting for over half of tn lost via this mechanism these results thus suggest that roughly half of all nitrogen loss associated with these different rainstorm systems is attributable to no3 n in the interflow moreover nh4 n loss load through the surface flow and interflow fractions respectively accounted for 10 82 14 72 and 2 04 2 48 of the tn loss despite the high nh4 n loss to tn loss ratio in the surface flow and the relatively high nh4 n concentrations in this runoff fraction the amount of nh4 n lost with interflow is nonetheless relatively high table 3 with the interflow serving as the primary mechanism governing nh4 n loss 3 4 dcl dcd curve analyses by constructing dimensionless dcl dcd curves for the runoff nitrogen loss process under three rainstorm patterns this study revealed that the significant differences in the contributions of surface flow and interflow to nitrogen loss under these different conditions fig 5 compared with the commonly used dimensionless cumulative m v curve method and mff index method the dcl dcd curve had shown the temporal variation of runoff and nitrogen loss more intuitively and reflected the significant relation between nitrogen loss and runoff in real time the tn loss via the surface flow was most responsive to rainfall patterns with a curve that was similar to the dimensional curve for rainfall the cumulative tn loss with the surface flow during the first half of the surface flow duration for the lr mr and er storms was 7 52 49 98 and 91 79 of the total tn loss respectively the variation trends of dcl dcd curves of the interflow pathway under the three rainfall patterns were relatively consistent indicating that the tn loss of the interflow was less affected by the rainfall pattern the cumulative tn loss with the interflow during the first half of the interflow duration for the mr lr and er storms was 99 01 83 45 and 87 62 of the total tn loss respectively especially for the mr storm 76 54 of the tn loss occurred during the initial 10 of the interflow duration under the three rainfall patterns the dcl dcd curves of surface flow interflow and total runoff under er rainstorm have the similar trend the variation trend of the dcl dcd curve of the mr total runoff process is closer to that of the interflow pathway the variation trend of the dcl dcd curve of the lr total runoff process is closer to that of the surface flow pathway combining with fig 3 it can be seen that the difference in beginning time and duration of runoff under different rainfall patterns has a direct impact on the distribution of soil nitrogen loss load 4 discussion the experiments conducted in this research confirmed that relative to rainfall characteristics such as rainfall amount intensity or duration rainfall pattern is also one of main influencing factors for slope runoff of yellow soil tea orchards prior studies have confirmed that greater rainfall volumes corresponded to a greater total runoff volume and the proportion of interflow to total runoff volume decreases with increasing rainfall amount chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 in this research the order of rainfall amount under the three rainstorm events was completely opposite to the order of total slope runoff in the er the rainfall amount was the smallest the runoff was the largest and the proportion of interflow was the highest for mr and lr the rainfall amount in mr was higher while the interflow volume and total runoff in lr were higher than in mr but the proportion of interflow in lr to total runoff was smaller than in mr jia et al 2007 and lin et al 2011 have posited that lower intensity rainfall over a longer duration was conducive to increased interflow generation while higher rainfall intensity could benefit the generation of surface flow from the results obtained in this research the sequence of surface flow under the three rainstorm events was indeed consistent with the rainfall intensity but the results were completely different for the interflow mr rainfall duration was the longest the average and peak rainfall intensity was the smallest among the three rainstorm events and the interflow was also the smallest the influence of rainfall patterns was confirmed not only by slope runoff but also by the temporal distribution of soil nitrogen loss during runoff in this study the high rainfall intensity in the early stage of rainfall increased the rainfall kinetic energy and the rainfall velocity between the surface layer and deep soil increased the runoff occurred before soil saturation therefore the runoff generation of surface flow and interflow was advanced wu et al 2018 and the difference in runoff generation time between surface flow and interflow was reduced however due to the rapid flow rate of runoff the concentration of dissolved nitrogen carried by runoff also decreased accordingly drewry et al 2009 the high intensity rainfall in the early stage of er rainfall had a scouring effect on the surface soil and the nitrogen in the surface soil entered the surface runoff which made the concentration of various forms of nitrogen in the surface runoff of er higher than other rainfall yang et al 2016 by the end of er rainfall rainfall decreased rapidly and runoff did not follow up rainwater supplement meanwhile the early interflow velocity was rather fast and soil moisture interception was less which could not supplement the later interflow surface flow and interflow both terminated at the end of rainfall the difference between surface flow and interflow duration under er rainfall was far less than other rainfall patterns figs 3 c and 5 and displayed that the duration time and variation trend of the surface flow and interflow process curves of er rainfall were basically identical while the transport capacity of surface flow and interflow for nitrogen was consistent with the runoff velocity therefore the variation trend of dcl dcd curves of different pathways under er rainfall was consequently identical lr and mr rainfall events had low rainfall intensity in the early stage so after the beginning of rainfall the rainwater mainly infiltrate into the soil however the variation of rainfall intensity during mr rainfall is small and the rainfall is mainly concentrated in the middle of rainfall there is a long period of high temperature and no rain in the early stage of mr rainfall which makes the soil moisture content extremely low and the soil water infiltration capacity is much higher than the rainfall intensity therefore the runoff begins until the soil is saturated after the mr rainfall stopped soil moisture continued to supplement the interflow so the mr interflow lasted longer than other rainfall patterns at the same time soil water fully absorbed nitrogen before interflow when mr interflow began to produce a large amount of nitrogen was lost with runoff therefore i the loss of nitrogen with interflow mainly concentrated in the early interflow loss because the interflow and duration are much higher than the surface runoff tn loss with the soil flow accounted for 94 63 of the total so the dcl dcd curve of the total runoff process is consistent with the dcl dcd curve of the interflow process these results are based on the rainstorms observed in the 2019 rainy season and therefore have certain limitations and errors considering that the relationship between rainfall amount and runoff is extremely complex gomi et al 2008 it is recommended to continue to monitor the natural rainfall runoff process in the tgra in subsequent studies to confirm the validity of these results meanwhile through the artificial rainfall method according to the classification of rainfall patterns in this study simulation experiments under different rainfall characteristics are carried out to repeatedly verify the experimental results or the climate change model is used to predict the runoff of rainfall events under the same rainfall pattern so that the experiment results are more believable the analysis of different rainstorm patterns revealed that the interflow was the primary mediator of nitrogen loss under storm conditions suggesting that the adaptability of tea orchard soil to rainstorm events can be improved by enhancing soil structure increasing soil water retention and reducing or slowing interflow generation within the deep soil alternatively intercepting and collecting runoff during the early stage of soil midstream generation can effectively reduce the potential for nitrogen loss in the soil and the pollution of surrounding bodies of water by prioritizing and mitigating the management of interflow and its associated nutrient loss it can cope with soil nutrient loss under rainstorm or even extreme rainstorm events making the prevention and control mechanism of agricultural non point source pollution in the tgra more effective 5 conclusion this study monitored the rainfall runoff process of the yellow soil tea orchard slope in the tgra under natural rainfall and analyzed the effects of different rainfall patterns on soil nitrogen loss process distribution and pathway differentiation the results showed that the runoff and soil nitrogen loss of er rainfall were higher than those of other rainfall patterns under rainstorm conditions with similar rainfall interflow was the main pathway of soil nitrogen loss and interflow pattern governs the soil nitrogen loss pattern understanding the contribution of surface flow and interflow to soil nitrogen loss under different rainfall patterns is helpful for analyzing and predicting the main pathways of soil erosion and soil nutrient loss under extreme rainfall events and for formulating targeted prevention and control strategies to reduce the tgra agricultural non point source pollution and water eutrophication and related environmental hazards in the future it is recommended to extend the time scale under natural rainfall conditions or conduct further studies through climate change models to confirm the validity of these results declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have
