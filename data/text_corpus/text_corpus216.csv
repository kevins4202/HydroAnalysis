harbor in the usa and detected teta tetx and tetw genes in treated effluents in the present study the prevalence of teta tetb tetc tetd and tete genes was analyzed in treated effluents the most prevalent genes encoding resistance to tetracyclines were teta tetb and tetc which were detected in 57 44 and 42 of all samples respectively fig 3 these genes were most frequently noted in samples from class i wwtps table 3 small treatment plants find it most difficult to observe the maximum biogenic pollution limits in treated wastewater where nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are exceeded several times kiedrzyńska et al 2014b in the present study less frequent prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes was noted in the summer fig 4 the tetd gene was detected in only 8 of the samples and the tete gene in 27 of all samples fig 3 but more than 75 of tete detections were made in spring samples fig 4 in the effluent samples evaluated by yang et al 2014 the removal rates of teta and tetc reached 99 and 97 respectively however high removal efficiency in wwtps does not completely prevent args from reaching the environment where they spread to other microorganisms through horizontal gene transfer summers 2006 genes of resistance to mls group antibiotics were detected in effluent samples collected in all seasons of the year fig 5 and in every class of wwtps table 3 the ermf gene encodes resistance to clindamycin a popular antibiotic targeting anaerobic bacteria whereas lina confers resistance to lincomycin and erythromycin niestępski et al 2017 the ermf gene was identified in 95 and the lina gene in 66 of all studied samples fig 3 the ermf gene was as prevalent as the bla tem gene in all categories of wwtps table 3 in a study by yang et al 2014 the concentration of mls resistance genes in treated wastewater was reduced by nearly 95 relative to raw sewage despite the above mls resistance genes were detected at a concentration of 3 34ppm in wastewater released from the wwtp the sul1 gene encodes dihydropteroate synthase which confers resistance to sulfonamides and is usually present in class 1 integrons antunes et al 2005 the sul1 gene was detected in 90 of the analyzed samples in all seasons of the year fig 5 li et al 2017 detected the sul1 gene at a concentration of 104 copies ml in treated effluents mao et al 2015 analyzed the prevalence of 23 args and reported on the predominance of sulfonamide resistance genes in all stages of wastewater treatment and in treated effluents in a study by yang et al 2014 the prevalence of sulfonamide resistance genes was 47 higher in treated wastewater which could be attributed to the proliferation of arb in different stages of treatment the aac 6 ib cr gene encoding resistance to fluoroquinolones was detected in 22 of all samples nearly 75 of all detections were made in the summer but the gene was never identified in spring samples fig 5 amos et al 2014 found fluoroquinolone resistance genes in river sediments in the vicinity of a wwtp with pe 500 000 korzeniewska and harnisz 2018 observed that genes encoding resistance to quinolones precursors of fluoroquinolones were the most abundant args in treated effluents in a study by yang et al 2014 the concentration of quinolone resistance genes in treated wastewater was reduced by more than 50 relative to raw sewage in the present study the intl1 gene was detected in 90 of the analyzed samples fig 5 the intl1 gene encodes integrase which catalyzes the activation or deletion of gene cassettes antunes et al 2005 in the work of lapara et al 2011 the concentration of intl1 in treated effluents was up to 20 times higher than in samples collected from surface water bodies in the vicinity of the wwtp the relative concentration of the integrase encoding gene intl1 in treated wastewater was determined at 4 09logcopies ml by mcconnell et al 2018 ben et al 2017 analyzed the distribution of antibiotic resistance in the effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants and reported a significant correlation between the occurrence of args and the intl1 gene which may contribute to the spread of args in the environment through horizontal gene transfer in the current study bla tem ermf lina sul1 genes and the integrase encoding gene intl1 were abundant in environmental samples and the frequency of their occurrence in treated wastewater was not related to the size of the analyzed wwtps pe table 3 6 conclusions all of the evaluated args excluding bla shv and the intl1 gene which participates in horizontal gene transfer between microorganisms were detected in samples of treated wastewater collected from 17 wwtps some args were highly prevalent bla tem ermf lina sul1 intl1 whereas others were detected on a seasonal basis only bla oxa bla ctx m teta tetb tetc tetd tete aac 6 lb cr antibiotic resistance genes were most prevalent in treated sewage from wwtps with pe 2000 the above could indicate that arb and args are not effectively removed by small wwtps which are characterized by a high failure rate limited throughput and short treatment times in particular during torrential rain events which lead to massive inflow of precipitation water small wwtps are often unable to achieve the required removal rates for phosphorus and nitrogen compounds whose concentrations in treated wastewater often exceed the limit several fold kiedrzyńska et al 2014b the analyzed wwtps in particular facilities with pe 2000 are unable to completely remove arb and args which flow out into the environment and spread with river water rivers are the main surface water bodies and contamination with arb and args can pose a significant health risk for humans and animals further molecular and ecohydrological research in catchment scale is required to determine the effect of treated wastewater on the presence of arb and args in the environment and horizontal gene transfer between environmental microorganisms conflict of interest none declared ethical statement the research was done according to ethical standards funding body national science centre poland acknowledgements this

environment through horizontal gene transfer in the current study bla tem ermf lina sul1 genes and the integrase encoding gene intl1 were abundant in environmental samples and the frequency of their occurrence in treated wastewater was not related to the size of the analyzed wwtps pe table 3 6 conclusions all of the evaluated args excluding bla shv and the intl1 gene which participates in horizontal gene transfer between microorganisms were detected in samples of treated wastewater collected from 17 wwtps some args were highly prevalent bla tem ermf lina sul1 intl1 whereas others were detected on a seasonal basis only bla oxa bla ctx m teta tetb tetc tetd tete aac 6 lb cr antibiotic resistance genes were most prevalent in treated sewage from wwtps with pe 2000 the above could indicate that arb and args are not effectively removed by small wwtps which are characterized by a high failure rate limited throughput and short treatment times in particular during torrential rain events which lead to massive inflow of precipitation water small wwtps are often unable to achieve the required removal rates for phosphorus and nitrogen compounds whose concentrations in treated wastewater often exceed the limit several fold kiedrzyńska et al 2014b the analyzed wwtps in particular facilities with pe 2000 are unable to completely remove arb and args which flow out into the environment and spread with river water rivers are the main surface water bodies and contamination with arb and args can pose a significant health risk for humans and animals further molecular and ecohydrological research in catchment scale is required to determine the effect of treated wastewater on the presence of arb and args in the environment and horizontal gene transfer between environmental microorganisms conflict of interest none declared ethical statement the research was done according to ethical standards funding body national science centre poland acknowledgements this

normal university no 105 west third ring north road haidian district beijing 100048 china water accessibility assessment waa is very important to the ecological restoration of freshwater wetlands and water resources management due to an intensive human disturbance this paper develops a quantitative methodology for waa in the yellow river delta national nature reserve yrdnnr from which an assessment of water accessibility is made on the freshwater wetlands the assessment uses a water accessibility index wai model by employing gis network analysis and spatial statistical analysis five indicators for the model cover both natural and anthropogenic factors including distance from freshwater resources average elevation road density ditch density and number of culverts at the grid scale the values of the wai model are between 0 26 and 0 82 the wai has a significant and positive spatial autocorrelation there are totally 12 freshwater marsh patches exist in the yrdnnr the highest wai value in the freshwater marsh patch occurs near the estuary area of the yellow river while the lowest wai value lies farthest from the yellow river there are two freshwater restored wetlands that have lower wai values from which a scientific restoration strategy is presented to remove the paddy field roads and other facilities between two wetlands and the yellow river course the results of the wai model have been validated by matching the ratio of water body area within patches and consulting with local administrators which indicates a satisfied wai assessment effectiveness the proposed wai can help administrators to guide wetland ecological restoration and to plan for freshwater resources management keywords water accessibility assessment freshwater marshes yellow river delta national nature reserve wai model 1 introduction the wetland ecosystem of the yellow river delta including inland freshwater wetland and coastal wetland provides a significant environment for maintaining the regional water balance adjusting climate protecting biodiversity and maintaining the river system s integrity zhang 2013 human activities e g agricultural reclamation oil industry and water conservancy engineering construction have become the main driving forces of wetland landscape evolution due to the rapid development of the social economy in the yellow river delta national nature reserve yrdnnr china wang et al 2008 according to ordinance on yellow river water volume regulation the freshwater resources in the yellow river are in short supply because so much activities relies on freshwater such as transportation of sediment into the sea lifestyles of residents industrial and agricultural production and the regional ecological environment ordinance on yellow river water volume regulation 2006 furthermore surface runoff is changed by dense ditches roads and culverts in the yrdnnr consequently the freshwater supply for agricultural and wetland irrigation is delivered through ditches from the yellow river in addition since the 1990s runoff in the river has decreased and estuarine freshwater wetlands have seriously shrunk therefore suitable wetland habitats for wildlife and plants have gradually disappeared zhang 2013 wetlands that require freshwater maintenance include natural wetlands i e rivers freshwater marshes and artificial wetlands i e paddy fields and some aquaculture ponds lehner and döll 2004 according to the wetland classification scheme of the yrdnnr addressed by mou et al 2015 and zhang et al 2018 freshwater marsh wetlands e g reed swamps play an important role in the maintenance of ecological functions conservation of biodiversity purification of pollutant and ecological restoration of wetland liu 2015 as freshwater resources are the primary factors preventing degradation of freshwater marsh wetlands their replenishment is recognized as a significant driving force of freshwater ecosystem restoration in the yellow river delta wetland yrdw ding et al 2017 liu 2017 wang 2017 the yrdw obtains more freshwater from the yellow river through the water sediment regulation scheme implemented by the yellow river conservancy committee yrcc therefore the ecological and hydrological conditions of the yrdw are vastly improved water accessibility assessment waa of freshwater in the yrdw will play an important guiding role in rational utilization of freshwater resources and restoration of wetlands wurbs 2015 accessibility is the primary application of land traffic networks such as railway and highway networks zhang and lu 2007 hansen 1959 defined accessibility as the opportunity of interaction between nodes in a traffic network distance is a general metric of accessibility jiang et al 2016 when accessibility is applied to aquatic habitats a similar concept of water availability as defined by the economic and social commission for asia and the pacific 2011 expresses the available amount of water however water accessibility is different from water availability yu et al 2017 defined water accessibility as the degree of difficulty in accessing water at any point in a region or basin from a natural river network without considering the hydrologic cycle and the water utilization purpose and developed the slope s height difference h runoff r distance d shrd model by considering height difference slope and runoff based on euclidean distance smiley 2013 the shrd model is subsequently cited by yu et al 2018 as an indicator to evaluate crop water satisfaction in the hanjiang river basin however indicators used in the shrd model are all from natural factors rather than anthropogenic factors as many roads ditches and culverts are built to develop oil and agriculture water flow paths runoff and accessibility are changed by these anthropogenic factors dan and dan 2003 levavasseur et al 2012 lepeška 2013 the euclidean distance and other natural factors in the shrd model cannot accurately assess water accessibility due to a flat terrain within the yrdw where transportation of freshwater resources is basically through ditches considering the characteristics of freshwater resources in the study area authors attempt to develop a new model by using geographic information system gis network analysis and combining both anthropogenic and natural factors at the grid scale this model integrated with the definition and method of water accessibility by yu et al 2017 the anthropogenic factors include ditches roads and culverts which mainly result from agricultural reclamation and oil industry the natural factor is elevation in addition the wai model calculates the distance factor by the ditch length from the yellow river and considers some barriers e g roads according to the actual characteristics of freshwater diversion in the study area the scientific problem of this study is to assess the degree of difficulty of freshwater accessibility from the yellow river to each freshwater wetland habitat spatially which are challenged due to intensive human disturbances therefore the specific objectives of the study were to 1 determine the indicators of water accessibility and construct a new water accessibility model water accessibility index wai 2 assess the spatial distribution of wai and 3 provide guides of wetland management for decision makers 2 study area and data source the yellow river delta national nature reserve china can be divided into two parts of the current yellow river estuary yellow river estuary station and dawenliu station and the old yellow river estuary before 1976 yiqianer station yellow river estuary station and dawenliu station are located in the north of kenli county dongying city shandong province the annual average precipitation of the yrdnnr is 592 2mm which is less than the annual evaporation administration of the yellow river delta national nature reserve 2016 furthermore precipitation has great interannual variation and is distributed unevenly in different seasons resulting in climatic characteristics of spring drought summer flood and late autumn drought freshwater resources for living production and irrigation in kenli county are mainly supplied by the yellow river most of the groundwater is saline and brackish and cannot be used for irrigation and living precipitation provides some freshwater resources however the spatial distribution difference of precipitation is not obvious as the study area is small the study area is selected from the inland area with an area of 435 23km2 excluding the tide zone of yellow river estuary management station and dawenliu management station fig 1 in fact there are plenty of agricultural reclamation and aquaculture areas that depend on the freshwater resources of the yellow river in the yrdnnr correspondingly most of the original marsh wetlands have been artificially created as lotus root ponds and fish ponds the meadow wetlands have been converted into paddy fields and dry lands the data used in this paper include remote sensing images from sentinel 2a on 11 july 2017 with a resolution of 10m google earth remote sensing images the 30 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem data and administrative boundaries as well as the yrdnnr boundary these remote sensing images are used to delineate roads ditches culverts and the study area boundary 3 method the indicators of the wai model are identified according to the basic principles of index construction li 2014 and field investigation and then the weight of each indicator is determined by the expert scoring method xue et al 2019 the wai model is then constructed and the results are analyzed from the perspective of wai distribution characteristics and guide for freshwater wetland restoration the results of the wai model are verified finally based on the consultation with local administrators and comparing the ratio of water body area within patches the technical flowchart is shown in fig 2 3 1 wai indicators the indicators of freshwater accessibility can be divided into 2 categories outer indicators and inner indicators by considering both natural factors and anthropogenic factors the outer indicators include distance from freshwater resources d and average elevation of each grid e the inner indicators include road density in a grid rd ditch density in a grid dd and number of culverts in a grid n the definitions and calculations of these parameters are as follows 1 distance from freshwater resources d water accessibility reflects the degree of difficulty of water availability from the spatial perspective distance from freshwater resources is a key factor of water accessibility and the yellow river is the freshwater resource of the yrdnnr therefore the distance from freshwater resources can be referred to the distance from the yellow river it should be noted that the distance is the ditch distance rather than the euclidean distance because of freshwater transportation based on the ditches there are 29 intersection points between ditches and the yellow river as determined by field investigation and remote sensing image interpretation the distance of each grid from the yellow river is calculated by the network analyst tools on the arcgis 10 1 platform the shorter the distance the higher the degree of water accessibility the d values of grids within 1km distance from the yellow river are set to 0 because freshwater in these grids is exchanged through groundwater 2 average elevation of each grid e the lower the elevation the easier it is to collect water especially when it rains and drains naturally the higher the possibility of water available the higher the water accessibility to a certain extent elevation determines runoff availability thus affecting water accessibility although the existing ditches and roads have changed the surface runoff elevation still has a fundamental impact on water accessibility the average elevation of each gird is calculated based on dem data 3 road density in a grid rd there are many roads due to the development of the shengli oil field in the yrdnnr roads are recognized as key barriers to freshwater accessibility the higher road density the more difficult the availability of freshwater and the worse the water accessibility road length is used to calculate road density and each grid cell is set as 1km for the calculating unit 4 ditch density in a grid dd there are many ditches and culverts because of agriculture aquaculture and oil pump development in the yrdnnr ditch density is a key variable referring to water accessibility the denser ditch in each grid the better the water exchange and the higher the water accessibility ditch length is used to calculate ditch density 5 number of culverts in a grid n although roads are recognized as barriers to water connectivity the existence of culverts will weaken the obstructive effect of roads on water accessibility therefore the number of culverts is an indicator of water accessibility the greater number of culverts the higher the water accessibility 3 2 normalization of indicators different dimensions of indicators need to be changed to dimensionless in order to calculate the wai the effect of some indicators d e and rd on the wai is negative i e the greater the indicator value the lower the water accessibility the effect of some indicators dd and n on wai is positive i e the greater the indicator value the higher the water accessibility the above 5 indicators are normalized as follows 1 x i x max x i x max x min 2 x i x i x min x max x min x i is the normalized variable x i is the original variable xmaxand xmin are the maximum and minimum values of x i respectively transformation for negative indicators is according to eq 1 and for positive indicators eq 2 3 3 weight for indicators the weight of each indicator is determined by using the expert scoring method the wai value is obtained according to eq 3 the range of wai values is from 0 to 1 and the higher the value the better the water accessibility 3 w a i w d d w e e w d d d d w r d r d w n n where w d is the weight of distance from freshwater resources w e is the weight of average elevation of each grid w dd is the weight of ditch density in a grid w rd is the weight of road density in a grid and w n is the weight of the number of culverts in a grid twenty experts took part in the assignment these experts are all familiar with the study area and can be divided into 4 groups 2 are administrators of the yrdnnr 9 are doctors and masters in the research team of the national key r d program of china 6 are professors who have taken part in research of the yellow river delta for several years and 3 are local farmers in the study area all of them have significant experience in scoring the weights of these indicators the experts scores are assigned based on the importance of each indicator which refers to the degree of difficulty of freshwater availability to each grid the scores are between 0 and 1 and the indicator becomes increasingly important when its score is close to 1 the sum of the weights of the 5 indicators is 1 as the freshwater is mainly delivered from the yellow river the outer indicators control the volume of freshwater to each grid while the inner indicators control the interchange of existing water in each grid thus the outer ones have a weight of 0 6 and the inner ones 0 4 in the 2 outer indicators d is recognized as the primary factor for water accessibility by experts thus having a weight of 0 7 however e has a weight of 0 3 due to the flat topography of the study area in the 3 inner indicators dd is the most important thus the weights for dd rd and n are 0 4 0 3 and 0 3 respectively the final weights for d e dd rd and n are 0 42 0 18 0 16 0 12 and 0 12 respectively 4 results and analysis 4 1 wai distribution characteristics the vector data including roads ditches and culverts are extracted by visual interpretation of remote sensing images fig 3 the total length of roads is 763 74km and the density is 1 75km km2 the total length of ditches is 891 17km and the density is 2 05km km2 it can be concluded that roads and ditches have fragmented wetlands in the yrdw the farthest wetland patch to yellow river course is located in the northern yrdnnr fig 4 that is to say this region has difficulty to receive water because of the long ditch path of freshwater transported from the yellow river the elevation of each grid gradually decreases from west to east fig 5 the wai values are calculated by eq 3 with a range from 0 26 to 0 82 and an average value of 0 57 authors measure distance from freshwater resources average elevation road density ditch density and number of culverts at the grid scale which has been validated by the field investigation based on all the above indicators we divide wai values into three categories of high medium and low with intervals of 0 67 0 82 0 51 0 67 and 0 26 0 51 respectively fig 6 the wais in the west and north are low because the girds in the north are far from the yellow river channel and there are too many roads in the west while wais are high near the yellow river especially in the estuary area according to the assessment result in fig 6 the major driving forces to water accessibility have been changed from natural factors of elevation and slope to anthropogenic factors of roads and ditches the spatial distribution characteristics of the wai are presented by spatial autocorrelation analysis with geoda software the results are shown in the moran plot and lisa local indicators of spatial association cluster map in figs 7 and 8 respectively the global moran siindex of the wai is 0 84 and significant at a 0 05 level which indicates that the wai has a significant positive spatial autocorrelation there are 76 grids with a high aggregation distribution which mainly concentrated downstream of the yellow river according to fig 8 these grids are located near the yellow river course with low elevation and low road density the number of grids is 71 showing a low low aggregation the grids are mainly distributed in the north and west of the study area with a feature of far distance from the yellow river and featured with high road density low ditch density and high elevation 4 2 water accessibility assessment indicated by wai there are total 12 freshwater marsh wetland patches in the study area according to the field investigation and interpretation results from sentinel 2a remote sensing images on 11 july 2017 by zhang et al 2018 the wai values of two patches are lower than the average value of the whole region according to assessment results from fig 6 and table 1 patch 1 has the lowest water accessibility among the 12 patches due to its longest ditch from the yellow river lower water accessibility is caused by a sparse ditch density in the patch 2 especially in its western part although patch 2 is relatively close to the yellow river the patches 3 4 5 6 10 and 11 have medium wais patches 10 and 11 are the wuwanmu and shiwanmu freshwater restored wetlands the water accessibility of the two patches is at a medium level the reason is the sparse ditch density for water accessibility in the two patches and some grids in patch 11 are far from the yellow river furthermore some high wais are distributed between the yellow river and patch 10 the land use of these grids is paddy field and freshwater aquaculture pools according to the field investigation these play an important role in the interception of freshwater resources from the yellow river to patches 10 and 11 the patches 7 8 9 and 12 have higher wais which are distributed in the high wais zone patch 7 is located downstream of the yellow river with sparse road density therefore it has the highest wai value 4 3 verification of wai assessment results the wai assessment results are verified from quantitative view and qualitative view the quantitative verification method is based on pearson correlation analysis in general the higher water accessibility the greater the water volume and the larger the water body area specifically the wai model is verified by the correlation analysis between the average wai value in each freshwater marsh patch and the ratio of water body area within a patch to this patch area the water body areas are delineated by zhang et al 2018 from both field investigation and google earth remote sensing images on arcgis 10 1 platform as shown in table 2 spss 19 0 is conducted to do pearson correlation analysis between the average wai value of each freshwater marsh patch and the water body area the results show that the two indices are moderately correlated pearson correlation r 0 574 p 0 05 which indicates a certain positive correlation besides the wai assessment results are verified from qualitative perspective on the one hand the wais decrease gradually with the decreasing area of water body within the wetland patches correspondingly the rule can be observed from patch 8 to patch 6 and then to patch 2 according to field investigation table 3 on the other hand the assessment results are also checked by yrdw administrators they are satisfied with the quantitative assessment results which coincide well with their observation of local wetlands 5 discussion 5 1 innovation and wide application of wai model the major driving forces to water accessibility have been changed from natural factors of elevation and slope to anthropogenic factors of roads and ditches water accessibility studies are reported more for natural watersheds without considering human factors e g roads and culverts smiley 2013 assessed water accessibility by using the euclidean distance from water resources based on the euclidean distance yu et al 2017 fully considered three other natural factors of height difference slope and runoff to calculate water accessibility however there is a significant impact of agriculture and water conservancy facilities on the allocation of water resources to wetlands in many countries such as china zhou et al 2008 2016 hence it is necessary to consider human factors to evaluate the difficulty of supplying water resources the proposed wai model takes natural and human factors into consideration based on the variables of distance and elevation authors take full consideration of the factors e g ditches culverts and roads that affect the runoff path which promotes the waa methodology considering the characteristics of freshwater diversion by using ditch in the study area it is more objective and accurate to use ditch network connectivity distance instead of euclidean distance in the model therefore wai model is established from comprehensive objective and accessible indicators the yellow river delta national nature reserve is a representative natural ecosystem that is disturbed by human activities and this is not unique case from china and other developing countries these human activities mainly include agricultural reclamation and oil industry and they generate infrastructures such as ditches roads and culverts which play an important role in water accessibility to wetlands the distance to river channel and wetland habitat elevation are the fundamental factors that affect water accessibility to wetlands by dealing with a very common situation the proposed wai model will have a wide applicability in wetland ecohydrological management 5 2 effectiveness analysis of wai model the proposed wai refers to the degree of difficulty of transporting freshwater to each grid in a region it is not equal to water volume in each grid the higher water accessibility the greater the water volume in general if without considering the existing water volume in each wetland patches in other words water volume represents the difficulty degree of freshwater arriving from water resources to grids patch 1 has the lowest water accessibility according to assessment results though its water body area is not the smallest patch 2 has no water body at all but its water accessibility is higher than that of patch 1 from field investigation we find that the land cover has degenerated into meadow and wasteland without any water body at all in the patch 2 however there is a grit chamber supplying water for the gudong reservoir in the south of the patch 1 although the grit chamber does not supply water for patch 1 water can be exchanged between groundwater furthermore there are fish ponds in patch 1 which changes the water volume since farmers replenish freshwater for production these situations are not taken into consideration in this study because they are relatively random and hard to count which affect the accuracy of verification to a certain extent in fact ground water does not play a key role to wetlands within the yrdnnr according to authors investigation and checked by local experts however lateral seepage from the yellow river can give a role like groundwater to wetlands nearby the river channel authors did not make it into the wai model due to the lack of experimental data for example patch 7 belongs to a freshwater wetland with dense vegetation and is distributed in a narrow strip along the north bank of the yellow river the vegetation roots may receive water supply through groundwater from the yellow river the water body does not exist in patch 7 hence validation on patch 7 could not be carried out during the verification process actually the existed model factor of d has presented the impact from such a lateral seepage to the water accessibility we focus on the quantitative impacts to wetland water accessibility from surface water and human disturbances within the freshwater wetlands in this manuscript we will study the role of complicated groundwater or the integrated impact from both groundwater and surface water in the intertidal zone in the future 5 3 significance of the wai model in practice the wai model presents quantitative assessment results for administrators on water accessibility to freshwater wetlands in the yrdnnr the clear assessment information of freshwater accessibility provides optimal allocation of freshwater resources to wetlands planners can list the restoration priority categories for ecological restoration purpose according to the difficulty degree of water accessibility according to section 4 1 the wai values along the downstream of the yellow river are high where freshwater wetland patches 7 8 9 and 12 are located therefore it is reasonable that the four freshwater wetland patches can be listed as the freshwater wetland restoration areas the wai can also judge where low or high water accessibility is located and why it is low or high to a specific wetland thus it promotes scientific strategies to achieve a better restoration effect the patches 10 and 11 do not have the high water accessibility as the freshwater restored wetland according to wais as has been analyzed in section 4 2 the reason for medium water accessibility of the two patches can be grouped into two aspects one is the sparse ditch density and the other one is the interception of freshwater resources that are affected by paddy fields and aquaculture pools in order to achieve better restoration of the two areas effective measures could be adopted when irrigating the two freshwater marsh patches such as returning these farmland and pools to wetland and constructing more ditches reducing both the interception of freshwater resources and the degree of difficulty of water accessibility freshwater resources are also determinants of industrial and agricultural production and therefore quantitative analysis of the relationship between freshwater accessibility and economic development can also provide support and guidance for local economic development qin 2017 stigter et al 2017 6 conclusions the yellow river delta national nature reserve is a representative natural ecosystem that is severely disturbed by human activities the main driving forces that affect water accessibility to wetland ecosystems include distance elevation roads ditches and culverts the wai model takes into account the above mentioned factors by calculating ditch network connectivity distance rather than euclidean distance therefore the new wai method is more objective and reasonable for evaluating water accessibility and it can be widely applied to those freshwater wetlands under serious disturbances from human beings this work presents the following conclusions 1 with a value range from 0 26 to 0 82 wai has a significant and positive spatial autocorrelation there are 71 grids with an aggregation distribution of low values mainly concentrated in the north and west of the study area and the lowest wai is in the north there are 76 grids showing an aggregation distribution of higher values mainly concentrated downstream of the yellow river 2 there are 12 freshwater marsh patches in the yrdnnr containing the sanwanmu wuwanmu and shiwanmu freshwater restored wetlands the wai values of these freshwater marshes range from 0 46 to 0 72 the best water accessibility is in patch 7 in contrast to the worst water accessibility of patch 1 four of the 12 patches are located in the high wais zone while two patches have medium level wais in order to achieve better restoration of the two patches the paddy fields roads and pools should be removed 3 the results of pearson correlation analysis between wai values and the ratio of water body area within patches show that the two indices are moderately correlated pearson correlation r 0 574 p 0 05 which verifies the reliability of the proposed model from the quantitative analysis furthermore consultation with local administrators also verifies the reliability of the proposed model the wai model provides precise assessment on water accessibility to wetlands within the yrdnnr it can help administrators to guide wetland ecological restoration and

normal university no 105 west third ring north road haidian district beijing 100048 china water accessibility assessment waa is very important to the ecological restoration of freshwater wetlands and water resources management due to an intensive human disturbance this paper develops a quantitative methodology for waa in the yellow river delta national nature reserve yrdnnr from which an assessment of water accessibility is made on the freshwater wetlands the assessment uses a water accessibility index wai model by employing gis network analysis and spatial statistical analysis five indicators for the model cover both natural and anthropogenic factors including distance from freshwater resources average elevation road density ditch density and number of culverts at the grid scale the values of the wai model are between 0 26 and 0 82 the wai has a significant and positive spatial autocorrelation there are totally 12 freshwater marsh patches exist in the yrdnnr the highest wai value in the freshwater marsh patch occurs near the estuary area of the yellow river while the lowest wai value lies farthest from the yellow river there are two freshwater restored wetlands that have lower wai values from which a scientific restoration strategy is presented to remove the paddy field roads and other facilities between two wetlands and the yellow river course the results of the wai model have been validated by matching the ratio of water body area within patches and consulting with local administrators which indicates a satisfied wai assessment effectiveness the proposed wai can help administrators to guide wetland ecological restoration and to plan for freshwater resources management keywords water accessibility assessment freshwater marshes yellow river delta national nature reserve wai model 1 introduction the wetland ecosystem of the yellow river delta including inland freshwater wetland and coastal wetland provides a significant environment for maintaining the regional water balance adjusting climate protecting biodiversity and maintaining the river system s integrity zhang 2013 human activities e g agricultural reclamation oil industry and water conservancy engineering construction have become the main driving forces of wetland landscape evolution due to the rapid development of the social economy in the yellow river delta national nature reserve yrdnnr china wang et al 2008 according to ordinance on yellow river water volume regulation the freshwater resources in the yellow river are in short supply because so much activities relies on freshwater such as transportation of sediment into the sea lifestyles of residents industrial and agricultural production and the regional ecological environment ordinance on yellow river water volume regulation 2006 furthermore surface runoff is changed by dense ditches roads and culverts in the yrdnnr consequently the freshwater supply for agricultural and wetland irrigation is delivered through ditches from the yellow river in addition since the 1990s runoff in the river has decreased and estuarine freshwater wetlands have seriously shrunk therefore suitable wetland habitats for wildlife and plants have gradually disappeared zhang 2013 wetlands that require freshwater maintenance include natural wetlands i e rivers freshwater marshes and artificial wetlands i e paddy fields and some aquaculture ponds lehner and döll 2004 according to the wetland classification scheme of the yrdnnr addressed by mou et al 2015 and zhang et al 2018 freshwater marsh wetlands e g reed swamps play an important role in the maintenance of ecological functions conservation of biodiversity purification of pollutant and ecological restoration of wetland liu 2015 as freshwater resources are the primary factors preventing degradation of freshwater marsh wetlands their replenishment is recognized as a significant driving force of freshwater ecosystem restoration in the yellow river delta wetland yrdw ding et al 2017 liu 2017 wang 2017 the yrdw obtains more freshwater from the yellow river through the water sediment regulation scheme implemented by the yellow river conservancy committee yrcc therefore the ecological and hydrological conditions of the yrdw are vastly improved water accessibility assessment waa of freshwater in the yrdw will play an important guiding role in rational utilization of freshwater resources and restoration of wetlands wurbs 2015 accessibility is the primary application of land traffic networks such as railway and highway networks zhang and lu 2007 hansen 1959 defined accessibility as the opportunity of interaction between nodes in a traffic network distance is a general metric of accessibility jiang et al 2016 when accessibility is applied to aquatic habitats a similar concept of water availability as defined by the economic and social commission for asia and the pacific 2011 expresses the available amount of water however water accessibility is different from water availability yu et al 2017 defined water accessibility as the degree of difficulty in accessing water at any point in a region or basin from a natural river network without considering the hydrologic cycle and the water utilization purpose and developed the slope s height difference h runoff r distance d shrd model by considering height difference slope and runoff based on euclidean distance smiley 2013 the shrd model is subsequently cited by yu et al 2018 as an indicator to evaluate crop water satisfaction in the hanjiang river basin however indicators used in the shrd model are all from natural factors rather than anthropogenic factors as many roads ditches and culverts are built to develop oil and agriculture water flow paths runoff and accessibility are changed by these anthropogenic factors dan and dan 2003 levavasseur et al 2012 lepeška 2013 the euclidean distance and other natural factors in the shrd model cannot accurately assess water accessibility due to a flat terrain within the yrdw where transportation of freshwater resources is basically through ditches considering the characteristics of freshwater resources in the study area authors attempt to develop a new model by using geographic information system gis network analysis and combining both anthropogenic and natural factors at the grid scale this model integrated with the definition and method of water accessibility by yu et al 2017 the anthropogenic factors include ditches roads and culverts which mainly result from agricultural reclamation and oil industry the natural factor is elevation in addition the wai model calculates the distance factor by the ditch length from the yellow river and considers some barriers e g roads according to the actual characteristics of freshwater diversion in the study area the scientific problem of this study is to assess the degree of difficulty of freshwater accessibility from the yellow river to each freshwater wetland habitat spatially which are challenged due to intensive human disturbances therefore the specific objectives of the study were to 1 determine the indicators of water accessibility and construct a new water accessibility model water accessibility index wai 2 assess the spatial distribution of wai and 3 provide guides of wetland management for decision makers 2 study area and data source the yellow river delta national nature reserve china can be divided into two parts of the current yellow river estuary yellow river estuary station and dawenliu station and the old yellow river estuary before 1976 yiqianer station yellow river estuary station and dawenliu station are located in the north of kenli county dongying city shandong province the annual average precipitation of the yrdnnr is 592 2mm which is less than the annual evaporation administration of the yellow river delta national nature reserve 2016 furthermore precipitation has great interannual variation and is distributed unevenly in different seasons resulting in climatic characteristics of spring drought summer flood and late autumn drought freshwater resources for living production and irrigation in kenli county are mainly supplied by the yellow river most of the groundwater is saline and brackish and cannot be used for irrigation and living precipitation provides some freshwater resources however the spatial distribution difference of precipitation is not obvious as the study area is small the study area is selected from the inland area with an area of 435 23km2 excluding the tide zone of yellow river estuary management station and dawenliu management station fig 1 in fact there are plenty of agricultural reclamation and aquaculture areas that depend on the freshwater resources of the yellow river in the yrdnnr correspondingly most of the original marsh wetlands have been artificially created as lotus root ponds and fish ponds the meadow wetlands have been converted into paddy fields and dry lands the data used in this paper include remote sensing images from sentinel 2a on 11 july 2017 with a resolution of 10m google earth remote sensing images the 30 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem data and administrative boundaries as well as the yrdnnr boundary these remote sensing images are used to delineate roads ditches culverts and the study area boundary 3 method the indicators of the wai model are identified according to the basic principles of index construction li 2014 and field investigation and then the weight of each indicator is determined by the expert scoring method xue et al 2019 the wai model is then constructed and the results are analyzed from the perspective of wai distribution characteristics and guide for freshwater wetland restoration the results of the wai model are verified finally based on the consultation with local administrators and comparing the ratio of water body area within patches the technical flowchart is shown in fig 2 3 1 wai indicators the indicators of freshwater accessibility can be divided into 2 categories outer indicators and inner indicators by considering both natural factors and anthropogenic factors the outer indicators include distance from freshwater resources d and average elevation of each grid e the inner indicators include road density in a grid rd ditch density in a grid dd and number of culverts in a grid n the definitions and calculations of these parameters are as follows 1 distance from freshwater resources d water accessibility reflects the degree of difficulty of water availability from the spatial perspective distance from freshwater resources is a key factor of water accessibility and the yellow river is the freshwater resource of the yrdnnr therefore the distance from freshwater resources can be referred to the distance from the yellow river it should be noted that the distance is the ditch distance rather than the euclidean distance because of freshwater transportation based on the ditches there are 29 intersection points between ditches and the yellow river as determined by field investigation and remote sensing image interpretation the distance of each grid from the yellow river is calculated by the network analyst tools on the arcgis 10 1 platform the shorter the distance the higher the degree of water accessibility the d values of grids within 1km distance from the yellow river are set to 0 because freshwater in these grids is exchanged through groundwater 2 average elevation of each grid e the lower the elevation the easier it is to collect water especially when it rains and drains naturally the higher the possibility of water available the higher the water accessibility to a certain extent elevation determines runoff availability thus affecting water accessibility although the existing ditches and roads have changed the surface runoff elevation still has a fundamental impact on water accessibility the average elevation of each gird is calculated based on dem data 3 road density in a grid rd there are many roads due to the development of the shengli oil field in the yrdnnr roads are recognized as key barriers to freshwater accessibility the higher road density the more difficult the availability of freshwater and the worse the water accessibility road length is used to calculate road density and each grid cell is set as 1km for the calculating unit 4 ditch density in a grid dd there are many ditches and culverts because of agriculture aquaculture and oil pump development in the yrdnnr ditch density is a key variable referring to water accessibility the denser ditch in each grid the better the water exchange and the higher the water accessibility ditch length is used to calculate ditch density 5 number of culverts in a grid n although roads are recognized as barriers to water connectivity the existence of culverts will weaken the obstructive effect of roads on water accessibility therefore the number of culverts is an indicator of water accessibility the greater number of culverts the higher the water accessibility 3 2 normalization of indicators different dimensions of indicators need to be changed to dimensionless in order to calculate the wai the effect of some indicators d e and rd on the wai is negative i e the greater the indicator value the lower the water accessibility the effect of some indicators dd and n on wai is positive i e the greater the indicator value the higher the water accessibility the above 5 indicators are normalized as follows 1 x i x max x i x max x min 2 x i x i x min x max x min x i is the normalized variable x i is the original variable xmaxand xmin are the maximum and minimum values of x i respectively transformation for negative indicators is according to eq 1 and for positive indicators eq 2 3 3 weight for indicators the weight of each indicator is determined by using the expert scoring method the wai value is obtained according to eq 3 the range of wai values is from 0 to 1 and the higher the value the better the water accessibility 3 w a i w d d w e e w d d d d w r d r d w n n where w d is the weight of distance from freshwater resources w e is the weight of average elevation of each grid w dd is the weight of ditch density in a grid w rd is the weight of road density in a grid and w n is the weight of the number of culverts in a grid twenty experts took part in the assignment these experts are all familiar with the study area and can be divided into 4 groups 2 are administrators of the yrdnnr 9 are doctors and masters in the research team of the national key r d program of china 6 are professors who have taken part in research of the yellow river delta for several years and 3 are local farmers in the study area all of them have significant experience in scoring the weights of these indicators the experts scores are assigned based on the importance of each indicator which refers to the degree of difficulty of freshwater availability to each grid the scores are between 0 and 1 and the indicator becomes increasingly important when its score is close to 1 the sum of the weights of the 5 indicators is 1 as the freshwater is mainly delivered from the yellow river the outer indicators control the volume of freshwater to each grid while the inner indicators control the interchange of existing water in each grid thus the outer ones have a weight of 0 6 and the inner ones 0 4 in the 2 outer indicators d is recognized as the primary factor for water accessibility by experts thus having a weight of 0 7 however e has a weight of 0 3 due to the flat topography of the study area in the 3 inner indicators dd is the most important thus the weights for dd rd and n are 0 4 0 3 and 0 3 respectively the final weights for d e dd rd and n are 0 42 0 18 0 16 0 12 and 0 12 respectively 4 results and analysis 4 1 wai distribution characteristics the vector data including roads ditches and culverts are extracted by visual interpretation of remote sensing images fig 3 the total length of roads is 763 74km and the density is 1 75km km2 the total length of ditches is 891 17km and the density is 2 05km km2 it can be concluded that roads and ditches have fragmented wetlands in the yrdw the farthest wetland patch to yellow river course is located in the northern yrdnnr fig 4 that is to say this region has difficulty to receive water because of the long ditch path of freshwater transported from the yellow river the elevation of each grid gradually decreases from west to east fig 5 the wai values are calculated by eq 3 with a range from 0 26 to 0 82 and an average value of 0 57 authors measure distance from freshwater resources average elevation road density ditch density and number of culverts at the grid scale which has been validated by the field investigation based on all the above indicators we divide wai values into three categories of high medium and low with intervals of 0 67 0 82 0 51 0 67 and 0 26 0 51 respectively fig 6 the wais in the west and north are low because the girds in the north are far from the yellow river channel and there are too many roads in the west while wais are high near the yellow river especially in the estuary area according to the assessment result in fig 6 the major driving forces to water accessibility have been changed from natural factors of elevation and slope to anthropogenic factors of roads and ditches the spatial distribution characteristics of the wai are presented by spatial autocorrelation analysis with geoda software the results are shown in the moran plot and lisa local indicators of spatial association cluster map in figs 7 and 8 respectively the global moran siindex of the wai is 0 84 and significant at a 0 05 level which indicates that the wai has a significant positive spatial autocorrelation there are 76 grids with a high aggregation distribution which mainly concentrated downstream of the yellow river according to fig 8 these grids are located near the yellow river course with low elevation and low road density the number of grids is 71 showing a low low aggregation the grids are mainly distributed in the north and west of the study area with a feature of far distance from the yellow river and featured with high road density low ditch density and high elevation 4 2 water accessibility assessment indicated by wai there are total 12 freshwater marsh wetland patches in the study area according to the field investigation and interpretation results from sentinel 2a remote sensing images on 11 july 2017 by zhang et al 2018 the wai values of two patches are lower than the average value of the whole region according to assessment results from fig 6 and table 1 patch 1 has the lowest water accessibility among the 12 patches due to its longest ditch from the yellow river lower water accessibility is caused by a sparse ditch density in the patch 2 especially in its western part although patch 2 is relatively close to the yellow river the patches 3 4 5 6 10 and 11 have medium wais patches 10 and 11 are the wuwanmu and shiwanmu freshwater restored wetlands the water accessibility of the two patches is at a medium level the reason is the sparse ditch density for water accessibility in the two patches and some grids in patch 11 are far from the yellow river furthermore some high wais are distributed between the yellow river and patch 10 the land use of these grids is paddy field and freshwater aquaculture pools according to the field investigation these play an important role in the interception of freshwater resources from the yellow river to patches 10 and 11 the patches 7 8 9 and 12 have higher wais which are distributed in the high wais zone patch 7 is located downstream of the yellow river with sparse road density therefore it has the highest wai value 4 3 verification of wai assessment results the wai assessment results are verified from quantitative view and qualitative view the quantitative verification method is based on pearson correlation analysis in general the higher water accessibility the greater the water volume and the larger the water body area specifically the wai model is verified by the correlation analysis between the average wai value in each freshwater marsh patch and the ratio of water body area within a patch to this patch area the water body areas are delineated by zhang et al 2018 from both field investigation and google earth remote sensing images on arcgis 10 1 platform as shown in table 2 spss 19 0 is conducted to do pearson correlation analysis between the average wai value of each freshwater marsh patch and the water body area the results show that the two indices are moderately correlated pearson correlation r 0 574 p 0 05 which indicates a certain positive correlation besides the wai assessment results are verified from qualitative perspective on the one hand the wais decrease gradually with the decreasing area of water body within the wetland patches correspondingly the rule can be observed from patch 8 to patch 6 and then to patch 2 according to field investigation table 3 on the other hand the assessment results are also checked by yrdw administrators they are satisfied with the quantitative assessment results which coincide well with their observation of local wetlands 5 discussion 5 1 innovation and wide application of wai model the major driving forces to water accessibility have been changed from natural factors of elevation and slope to anthropogenic factors of roads and ditches water accessibility studies are reported more for natural watersheds without considering human factors e g roads and culverts smiley 2013 assessed water accessibility by using the euclidean distance from water resources based on the euclidean distance yu et al 2017 fully considered three other natural factors of height difference slope and runoff to calculate water accessibility however there is a significant impact of agriculture and water conservancy facilities on the allocation of water resources to wetlands in many countries such as china zhou et al 2008 2016 hence it is necessary to consider human factors to evaluate the difficulty of supplying water resources the proposed wai model takes natural and human factors into consideration based on the variables of distance and elevation authors take full consideration of the factors e g ditches culverts and roads that affect the runoff path which promotes the waa methodology considering the characteristics of freshwater diversion by using ditch in the study area it is more objective and accurate to use ditch network connectivity distance instead of euclidean distance in the model therefore wai model is established from comprehensive objective and accessible indicators the yellow river delta national nature reserve is a representative natural ecosystem that is disturbed by human activities and this is not unique case from china and other developing countries these human activities mainly include agricultural reclamation and oil industry and they generate infrastructures such as ditches roads and culverts which play an important role in water accessibility to wetlands the distance to river channel and wetland habitat elevation are the fundamental factors that affect water accessibility to wetlands by dealing with a very common situation the proposed wai model will have a wide applicability in wetland ecohydrological management 5 2 effectiveness analysis of wai model the proposed wai refers to the degree of difficulty of transporting freshwater to each grid in a region it is not equal to water volume in each grid the higher water accessibility the greater the water volume in general if without considering the existing water volume in each wetland patches in other words water volume represents the difficulty degree of freshwater arriving from water resources to grids patch 1 has the lowest water accessibility according to assessment results though its water body area is not the smallest patch 2 has no water body at all but its water accessibility is higher than that of patch 1 from field investigation we find that the land cover has degenerated into meadow and wasteland without any water body at all in the patch 2 however there is a grit chamber supplying water for the gudong reservoir in the south of the patch 1 although the grit chamber does not supply water for patch 1 water can be exchanged between groundwater furthermore there are fish ponds in patch 1 which changes the water volume since farmers replenish freshwater for production these situations are not taken into consideration in this study because they are relatively random and hard to count which affect the accuracy of verification to a certain extent in fact ground water does not play a key role to wetlands within the yrdnnr according to authors investigation and checked by local experts however lateral seepage from the yellow river can give a role like groundwater to wetlands nearby the river channel authors did not make it into the wai model due to the lack of experimental data for example patch 7 belongs to a freshwater wetland with dense vegetation and is distributed in a narrow strip along the north bank of the yellow river the vegetation roots may receive water supply through groundwater from the yellow river the water body does not exist in patch 7 hence validation on patch 7 could not be carried out during the verification process actually the existed model factor of d has presented the impact from such a lateral seepage to the water accessibility we focus on the quantitative impacts to wetland water accessibility from surface water and human disturbances within the freshwater wetlands in this manuscript we will study the role of complicated groundwater or the integrated impact from both groundwater and surface water in the intertidal zone in the future 5 3 significance of the wai model in practice the wai model presents quantitative assessment results for administrators on water accessibility to freshwater wetlands in the yrdnnr the clear assessment information of freshwater accessibility provides optimal allocation of freshwater resources to wetlands planners can list the restoration priority categories for ecological restoration purpose according to the difficulty degree of water accessibility according to section 4 1 the wai values along the downstream of the yellow river are high where freshwater wetland patches 7 8 9 and 12 are located therefore it is reasonable that the four freshwater wetland patches can be listed as the freshwater wetland restoration areas the wai can also judge where low or high water accessibility is located and why it is low or high to a specific wetland thus it promotes scientific strategies to achieve a better restoration effect the patches 10 and 11 do not have the high water accessibility as the freshwater restored wetland according to wais as has been analyzed in section 4 2 the reason for medium water accessibility of the two patches can be grouped into two aspects one is the sparse ditch density and the other one is the interception of freshwater resources that are affected by paddy fields and aquaculture pools in order to achieve better restoration of the two areas effective measures could be adopted when irrigating the two freshwater marsh patches such as returning these farmland and pools to wetland and constructing more ditches reducing both the interception of freshwater resources and the degree of difficulty of water accessibility freshwater resources are also determinants of industrial and agricultural production and therefore quantitative analysis of the relationship between freshwater accessibility and economic development can also provide support and guidance for local economic development qin 2017 stigter et al 2017 6 conclusions the yellow river delta national nature reserve is a representative natural ecosystem that is severely disturbed by human activities the main driving forces that affect water accessibility to wetland ecosystems include distance elevation roads ditches and culverts the wai model takes into account the above mentioned factors by calculating ditch network connectivity distance rather than euclidean distance therefore the new wai method is more objective and reasonable for evaluating water accessibility and it can be widely applied to those freshwater wetlands under serious disturbances from human beings this work presents the following conclusions 1 with a value range from 0 26 to 0 82 wai has a significant and positive spatial autocorrelation there are 71 grids with an aggregation distribution of low values mainly concentrated in the north and west of the study area and the lowest wai is in the north there are 76 grids showing an aggregation distribution of higher values mainly concentrated downstream of the yellow river 2 there are 12 freshwater marsh patches in the yrdnnr containing the sanwanmu wuwanmu and shiwanmu freshwater restored wetlands the wai values of these freshwater marshes range from 0 46 to 0 72 the best water accessibility is in patch 7 in contrast to the worst water accessibility of patch 1 four of the 12 patches are located in the high wais zone while two patches have medium level wais in order to achieve better restoration of the two patches the paddy fields roads and pools should be removed 3 the results of pearson correlation analysis between wai values and the ratio of water body area within patches show that the two indices are moderately correlated pearson correlation r 0 574 p 0 05 which verifies the reliability of the proposed model from the quantitative analysis furthermore consultation with local administrators also verifies the reliability of the proposed model the wai model provides precise assessment on water accessibility to wetlands within the yrdnnr it can help administrators to guide wetland ecological restoration and to plan future freshwater resources management conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical

1082,previous studies showed there is insufficient information available about public perceptions of high quality rivers does the public translates correctly the health of a river in ecosystem services the main aims of this study were to analyze the public perception of local residents in romania on the river related ecosystem services based on a closed ended items survey and to compare these responses to the scientific knowledge by a canonical correspondence analysis in secondary as the survey was applied on students in geography and environmental sciences we aimed to evaluate their knowledge on the subject of river related ecosystem services our respondents identified a low variety of river related ecosystem services and didn t discriminate between natural versus modified river sites and good versus moderate ecological quality as examples the water supply and biodiversity production were top responses for all categories of river sites it appeared that ecosystem services were poorly known and understood when compared to the scientific comprehension we concluded on a lack of knowledge on ecohydrological and hydroclimatic processes of the surveyed students improve environmental education could be the key to better translate the river health in ecosystem services therefore to value the good ecological status keywords river ecological quality river ecosystem services environmental education romania 1 introduction perception relies among other factors on prior knowledge samaha et al 2018 therefore knowledge and understanding of a river s ecological status is an important indeed critical element of the sustainability pitman et al 2017 in our study the knowledge refers to the definition of a healthy river by minimal anthropogenic impact namely a good ecological status of natural rivers acreman and ferguson 2010 which could ensure the panoply of the vital ecosystem services and benefits grizzetti et al 2017 2019 ecosystem services provided by the freshwater are provisioning or tangible outputs such as food water and other resources cultural or nonmaterial including esthetic spiritual and psychological aspects supporting the life of plants and animals therefore assuring nutrient cycling and floodplain fertility regulating the water quality by natural filtration and water treatment acting as buffer for flow and floods regulating the local climate air quality carbon sequestration etc grizetti et al 2016a böck et al 2018 grizzetti et al 2019 indicated a higher delivery of the regulating and cultural ecosystem services in better conditions of aquatic ecosystems conversely the use of provisioning services can result in pressures on the ecosystem there is a negative feedback because alterations induced by human pressures including hydromorphological ones and a moderate bad poor river status are apparent through the absence of ecosystem services vlachopoulou et al 2014 jakubínský and cudlín 2018 a healthy river with related ecosystem services and benefits may have different meanings for lay people and stakeholders depending on education motivations emotions knowledge practices urban communities e g cottet et al 2013 vlachopoulou et al 2014 grizetti et al 2016b roebeling et al 2016 brummer et al 2017 suárez alonso and vidal abarca gutiérrez 2017 boyer et al 2019 some studies proved that aspects of the water quality were properly perceived by lay people e g dogaru et al 2009 barbat et al 2012 cottet et al 2013 a study in poland showed that students clearly distinguished river modification or naturalness regardless of their academic discipline zawiejska and wróbel 2018 a study in several european union eu member states showed that practitioners are in need of deeply understanding the concept of ecosystem services therefore of all the hidden benefits of a water body of good quality grizetti et al 2016a we conclude that a large variety of water related ecosystem services are perceived differently by interviewed persons hartel et al 2014 2018 beery et al 2016 horcea milcu et al 2016 mcnally et al 2016 affek and kowalska 2017 hossu et al 2019 existing studies have demonstrated a lack of consensus on the relationships between what the public sees when viewing a river and the actual ecological quality of that river there is insufficient information available about public perceptions of high quality rivers cockerill 2015 does the public translates correctly the health of a river in ecosystem services in all management actions there is a very thin line between understanding the opinions about ecological value of lay people and finding a way that adequately describes ecological function while also being consistent with lay perception cottet et al 2013 therefore this kind of study on the perception of aquatic ecosystems could further help to formulate the eu water framework directive targeted goals in terms of ecosystem services outcomes i e ecosystem services related to a good ecological status of a water body everard 2012 vlachopoulou et al 2014 milano et al 2018 the general aim of this study was to contribute at understanding public perception with regards to river related ecosystem services based on a survey conducted in romania more precisely the objectives of our study were i to identify the main types of ecosystem services related to a river according to the perception of local residents to refine the analysis we segregated river sites based on human related indicators and ii to compare the answers given by respondents to the scientific knowledge finally a discussion was developed aiming to highlight results versus expectations to translate correctly the health of a river in ecosystem services 2 methodology the study is based on a survey aiming to find examples of river related ecosystem services chosen by respondents the proposed examples of services derived from previous studies on freshwater ecosystems e g harrison et al 2010 grizzetti et al 2016a mouchet et al 2017 in our survey 22 examples of river related ecosystem services were listed which are considered to be easily comprehensible by all respondents table 1 for provisioning services six items i1 i6 concerned water and fish supply sediment wood and reed exploitation hydropower and navigation for cultural services nine examples i7 i15 referred mainly to the educational recreational and spiritual role of a water body for regulating and supporting services seven items i16 i22 reflected flood mitigation water purification climate regulation carbon sequestration biodiversity production and refuge and soil formation the respondents had to choose those examples of ecosystem services of the list in table 1 which they considered appropriate for the river crossing or neighboring their residence towns the respondents not living near a surface water body did not continue to fill the questionnaire several or even all examples could have been selected by a single respondent the survey has targeted local residents of romania living river side and was applied face to face the survey was administered to undergraduate students first year in geography and environmental sciences university of bucharest due to their lack of experience students participating in the survey were considered demonstrative for the perception of lay people similar to the study of cottet et al 2013 very few studies have used university students as a target group to analyze their preferences of the services delivered by ecosystems suárez alonso and vidal abarca gutiérrez 2017 as educational background in relation to water our students followed courses in hydrology limnology meteorology climatology physical geography and geography of resources these students had no prior formation in ecology and knowledge on ecosystem services we applied the questionnaire during classes to 366 students and we obtained 327 answers 89 3 rate of response among which only 280 were relevant for water sites fig s1 in supplementary material due to the lack of data on the ecological status of some rivers and lakes only 254 responses were took into account fig s1 in supplementary material these 254 valid questionnaires corresponded to 105 river sites in the southern and eastern parts of the country fig s2 and s3 in supplementary material of which 80 2 responses in urban areas the survey is demonstrative mostly for young people 99 with ages between 18 years and 23 years and females 67 therefore we anticipate that some responses are based on the experience and preferences of our young respondents to characterize the river site s environmental quality the human related indicators used were natural water body versus heavily modified water body and good ecological quality i e high good ecological status or potential versus moderate ecological quality i e moderate poor bad ecological status or potential based on data from romanian river basin management plans for the statistical significance of comparisons we used the mann whitney non parametric test to find patterns of river related ecosystem services as perceived by our respondents we used a canonical correspondence analysis cca first we separated natural water bodies from heavily modified water bodies then we used as explanatory variables some characteristics of the river site one category of explanatory variables included hydromorphological features visually perceived by the public such as reservoir channelization levees riparian vegetation and discharge the other category of explanatory variables referred to the ecological quality both ecological status and ecological potential the methodology employed to determine these variables is found in table 2 for the cca we coded survey s responses as dummy variables 1 for an example of ecosystem service which was selected and 0 for a non selection 1 for rivers in good quality without engineering works with riparian vegetation preferably large rivers with hypothetical more ecosystem services etc table 2 3 results our respondents gave an overall low rate of responses mean 32 5 standard deviation 19 9 median 28 5 fig 1 a they selected mostly examples of provisioning services followed by cultural services and finally regulating and supporting services fig 1b 1c statistically only the cultural services of heavily modified river sites were more frequently chosen when compared to those of natural river sites more precisely our respondents recognized a low variety of river related ecosystem services respondents interpreted the natural rivers through water supply biodiversity production and sediment supply items with 50 of responses fig 2 a no other examples of supporting and regulating services were found in the first half top of choices responses had a high variability mean 27 2 median 16 9 standard deviation 20 9 of the number of responses corresponding to natural rivers no statistical difference was identified when compared to ecosystem services of heavily modified rivers according to the mann whitney test similarly a river s good ecological quality was defined by water supply in stream exploitation of sediments biodiversity formation and landscape esthetics items with 50 of responses fig 2b by contrary respondents generally dissociated the good ecological quality from water purification items with 5 of responses in the first half top of responses our young respondents appeared to perceive mostly items as cultural services and gave a good score to leisure activities such as swimming and boating local branding and social bonding no statistical difference was identified when compared to ecosystem services of rivers with a moderate ecological quality according to the mann whitney test based on the cca fig 3 we confirmed that ecosystem services were poorly known and understood when compared to the scientific comprehension axis 1 explained 50 93 p 0 001 of the variation while axis 2 explained 33 12 p 0 001 fig 3a among the explanatory variables none correlates with axis 1 while channelization correlates with axis 2 p 0 011 and the riparian vegetation correlates negatively with axis 2 p 0 029 fig 3b among the examples of ecosystem services none correlates with axis 1 and recreational fishing correlates with axis 2 p 0 002 surprisingly the hydromorphological definition of modified water bodies was not perceived by the respondents nor the hypothetical correlation between the good ecological quality and the regulating and supporting ecosystem services 4 discussion did we foresee this kind of translation of a river s health in ecosystem services we expected to find supportive responses for modified rivers and a prevalence of provisioning ecosystem services in our case study in romania a previous eurobarometer on water see gallup organisation 2009 showed that less than one fifth of interviewees in romania identified dams canals and others physical pressures as well as altered aquatic ecosystems as main threats to the water environment a study conducted on rural residents in romania rated a number of provisioning ecosystem services i e water as being very important for everyday life to the detriment of cultural and supporting ones hartel et al 2014 these comparisons suggest that residents in romania strongly rely upon the natural capital which appears to be a social demand of ecosystem services castro et al 2015 and typical for poor people horcea milcu et al 2016 mcnally et al 2016 with low financial capital production oriented aspiration hartel et al 2018 a recent study on ecosystem services of urban lakes in romania showed the prevalence of cultural services followed by provisioning services in the perception of residents visitors and experts hossu et al 2019 these findings for romania are rather discrepant compared to other perception based conclusions from eu member states overall the perception of ecosystem services in our study isn t associated to the sentiment that efforts to consider nature s values were getting necessary attention which is contradictory to other studies e g in sweden by beery et al 2016 moreover a study conducted on fish ponds in the eastern france blayac et al 2014 and a study on rivers and lakes in a national park in the north eastern poland affek and kowalska 2017 identified that residents related mostly regulating supporting and cultural services to such freshwater ecosystems we found obvious prevalence of certain river related ecosystem services in our survey despite the segregation of river sites in human related categories this pattern is probably due to previous knowledge e g on the role of water for climate regulation field based reality e g undergoing unhealthy activities of sediment extraction from riverbeds as well as usual concerns of young people e g social bonding despite our expectations to find more ecosystem services examples for ecohydrologic and hydroclimatic regulation the predominance of certain responses in perception based studies on ecosystem services is understandable being determined by numerous geographical factors moss 2012 environmental awareness cultural background zoderer et al 2016 prior individual experience and emotional attachment maestre andrés et al 2016 boyer et al 2019 in our study students choose a lower number of river related ecosystem services than we expected when concerned the group of students characterized by similar ages and education this finding confirms the results of suárez alonso and vidal abarca gutiérrez 2017 which estimated that students in spain allocated a lower importance to aquatic ecosystem services than international experts another study confirmed that students have low ecological literacy also due to growing up in large urban communities and spending little time outdoors or in natural settings but that education and in particular science based education could further ameliorate their level of ecological literacy pitman et al 2017 improve environmental education is a common conclusion of perception based studies on students with regard to ecosystem services suárez alonso and vidal abarca gutiérrez 2017 torkar and krašovec 2019 also by outdoor experience during field classes mocior and kruse 2016 torkar and krašovec 2019 more precisely the ecosystem based paradigm didn t appear to be transmitted from river science to education and then further to the global economy sensu vugteveen et al 2014 zalewski 2015 in order to improve the environmental education of the students we recommend the revision of curricula and syllabuses in geography and environmental sciences in our university studying individual classic disciplines such as hydrology climatology and physical geography is generally well perceived by our students niţă et al 2018 but didn t appear to provide to them knowledge to become familiarized with indirect ecological services such as those referring to regulation and support further during their undergraduate and graduate studies depending on their university pathway the students could attend courses in environment ecology hydrobiology biogeography or water quality however the syllabus of these courses should focus more on processes between the components of aquatic ecosystems and even include knowledge on the variety of ecosystem services provided by hydrosystems for all students which prepare to become professionals in geographical environmental analysis and reliable members of the society we also encourage the introduction into curriculums in geography and environmental sciences of more bridging disciplines more visionary extending beyond the classic disciplines of ecology and hydrology to ecohydrology timchenko 2016 or into other fields such as civil engineering economics and social sciences vugteveen et al 2014 university teaching should consider the management of ecosystems and natural resources toward sustainability and recognize the complexity and non linearity of nature society relations martín lópez et al 2013 5 conclusions our respondents recognized a lower variety of river related ecosystem services than expected the ecosystem services were also poorly understood in relation to river site characteristics such as the presence of a reservoir in the perception of our respondents the provisioning and cultural river related services were prevalent in their neighboring river sites the regulating and supporting river related services were ignored due probably to the lack of knowledge on the ecohydrological and hydroclimatic processes moreover our respondents didn t discriminate between ecosystem services of natural versus modified river sites and ecosystem services of good versus moderate ecological quality the hydromorphological definition of modified water bodies was not perceived by the respondents nor the hypothetical correlation between the good ecological quality and the regulating and supporting ecosystem services our public translated insufficiently the river s health in ecosystem services which suggests that the good ecological status is insufficiently valued environmental education focused on relationships between the components of the aquatic ecosystem could help to better understand the benefits of the good ecological status therefore further implement the environmental goal in water management moreover maintaining good ecological condition of aquatic ecosystems could ensure the delivery of ecosystem services in

variables referred to the ecological quality both ecological status and ecological potential the methodology employed to determine these variables is found in table 2 for the cca we coded survey s responses as dummy variables 1 for an example of ecosystem service which was selected and 0 for a non selection 1 for rivers in good quality without engineering works with riparian vegetation preferably large rivers with hypothetical more ecosystem services etc table 2 3 results our respondents gave an overall low rate of responses mean 32 5 standard deviation 19 9 median 28 5 fig 1 a they selected mostly examples of provisioning services followed by cultural services and finally regulating and supporting services fig 1b 1c statistically only the cultural services of heavily modified river sites were more frequently chosen when compared to those of natural river sites more precisely our respondents recognized a low variety of river related ecosystem services respondents interpreted the natural rivers through water supply biodiversity production and sediment supply items with 50 of responses fig 2 a no other examples of supporting and regulating services were found in the first half top of choices responses had a high variability mean 27 2 median 16 9 standard deviation 20 9 of the number of responses corresponding to natural rivers no statistical difference was identified when compared to ecosystem services of heavily modified rivers according to the mann whitney test similarly a river s good ecological quality was defined by water supply in stream exploitation of sediments biodiversity formation and landscape esthetics items with 50 of responses fig 2b by contrary respondents generally dissociated the good ecological quality from water purification items with 5 of responses in the first half top of responses our young respondents appeared to perceive mostly items as cultural services and gave a good score to leisure activities such as swimming and boating local branding and social bonding no statistical difference was identified when compared to ecosystem services of rivers with a moderate ecological quality according to the mann whitney test based on the cca fig 3 we confirmed that ecosystem services were poorly known and understood when compared to the scientific comprehension axis 1 explained 50 93 p 0 001 of the variation while axis 2 explained 33 12 p 0 001 fig 3a among the explanatory variables none correlates with axis 1 while channelization correlates with axis 2 p 0 011 and the riparian vegetation correlates negatively with axis 2 p 0 029 fig 3b among the examples of ecosystem services none correlates with axis 1 and recreational fishing correlates with axis 2 p 0 002 surprisingly the hydromorphological definition of modified water bodies was not perceived by the respondents nor the hypothetical correlation between the good ecological quality and the regulating and supporting ecosystem services 4 discussion did we foresee this kind of translation of a river s health in ecosystem services we expected to find supportive responses for modified rivers and a prevalence of provisioning ecosystem services in our case study in romania a previous eurobarometer on water see gallup organisation 2009 showed that less than one fifth of interviewees in romania identified dams canals and others physical pressures as well as altered aquatic ecosystems as main threats to the water environment a study conducted on rural residents in romania rated a number of provisioning ecosystem services i e water as being very important for everyday life to the detriment of cultural and supporting ones hartel et al 2014 these comparisons suggest that residents in romania strongly rely upon the natural capital which appears to be a social demand of ecosystem services castro et al 2015 and typical for poor people horcea milcu et al 2016 mcnally et al 2016 with low financial capital production oriented aspiration hartel et al 2018 a recent study on ecosystem services of urban lakes in romania showed the prevalence of cultural services followed by provisioning services in the perception of residents visitors and experts hossu et al 2019 these findings for romania are rather discrepant compared to other perception based conclusions from eu member states overall the perception of ecosystem services in our study isn t associated to the sentiment that efforts to consider nature s values were getting necessary attention which is contradictory to other studies e g in sweden by beery et al 2016 moreover a study conducted on fish ponds in the eastern france blayac et al 2014 and a study on rivers and lakes in a national park in the north eastern poland affek and kowalska 2017 identified that residents related mostly regulating supporting and cultural services to such freshwater ecosystems we found obvious prevalence of certain river related ecosystem services in our survey despite the segregation of river sites in human related categories this pattern is probably due to previous knowledge e g on the role of water for climate regulation field based reality e g undergoing unhealthy activities of sediment extraction from riverbeds as well as usual concerns of young people e g social bonding despite our expectations to find more ecosystem services examples for ecohydrologic and hydroclimatic regulation the predominance of certain responses in perception based studies on ecosystem services is understandable being determined by numerous geographical factors moss 2012 environmental awareness cultural background zoderer et al 2016 prior individual experience and emotional attachment maestre andrés et al 2016 boyer et al 2019 in our study students choose a lower number of river related ecosystem services than we expected when concerned the group of students characterized by similar ages and education this finding confirms the results of suárez alonso and vidal abarca gutiérrez 2017 which estimated that students in spain allocated a lower importance to aquatic ecosystem services than international experts another study confirmed that students have low ecological literacy also due to growing up in large urban communities and spending little time outdoors or in natural settings but that education and in particular science based education could further ameliorate their level of ecological literacy pitman et al 2017 improve environmental education is a common conclusion of perception based studies on students with regard to ecosystem services suárez alonso and vidal abarca gutiérrez 2017 torkar and krašovec 2019 also by outdoor experience during field classes mocior and kruse 2016 torkar and krašovec 2019 more precisely the ecosystem based paradigm didn t appear to be transmitted from river science to education and then further to the global economy sensu vugteveen et al 2014 zalewski 2015 in order to improve the environmental education of the students we recommend the revision of curricula and syllabuses in geography and environmental sciences in our university studying individual classic disciplines such as hydrology climatology and physical geography is generally well perceived by our students niţă et al 2018 but didn t appear to provide to them knowledge to become familiarized with indirect ecological services such as those referring to regulation and support further during their undergraduate and graduate studies depending on their university pathway the students could attend courses in environment ecology hydrobiology biogeography or water quality however the syllabus of these courses should focus more on processes between the components of aquatic ecosystems and even include knowledge on the variety of ecosystem services provided by hydrosystems for all students which prepare to become professionals in geographical environmental analysis and reliable members of the society we also encourage the introduction into curriculums in geography and environmental sciences of more bridging disciplines more visionary extending beyond the classic disciplines of ecology and hydrology to ecohydrology timchenko 2016 or into other fields such as civil engineering economics and social sciences vugteveen et al 2014 university teaching should consider the management of ecosystems and natural resources toward sustainability and recognize the complexity and non linearity of nature society relations martín lópez et al 2013 5 conclusions our respondents recognized a lower variety of river related ecosystem services than expected the ecosystem services were also poorly understood in relation to river site characteristics such as the presence of a reservoir in the perception of our respondents the provisioning and cultural river related services were prevalent in their neighboring river sites the regulating and supporting river related services were ignored due probably to the lack of knowledge on the ecohydrological and hydroclimatic processes moreover our respondents didn t discriminate between ecosystem services of natural versus modified river sites and ecosystem services of good versus moderate ecological quality the hydromorphological definition of modified water bodies was not perceived by the respondents nor the hypothetical correlation between the good ecological quality and the regulating and supporting ecosystem services our public translated insufficiently the river s health in ecosystem services which suggests that the good ecological status is insufficiently valued environmental education focused on relationships between the components of the aquatic ecosystem could help to better understand the benefits of the good ecological status therefore further implement the environmental goal in water management moreover maintaining good ecological condition of aquatic ecosystems could ensure the delivery of ecosystem services in

1083,constructed wetlands are considered as a promising wastewater treatment option though extensively studied most field experiments reflect the performance of these systems in temperate and cold climates and in relatively controlled flow conditions this study aims at evaluating the performance of a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland using indigenous macrophytes in a tropical climate i e in east africa ethiopia under suboptimal conditions of flow two selected plant species i e cyperus papyrus papyrus and scirpus validus bulrush were tested using the wastewater from a dormitory at jimma university campus in ethiopia the experimental period consisted of two rather well controlled phases with two non controlled and non sampled phases and one intentional disturbance phase in between bod5 removal was 81 in papyrus 76 in bulrush and 48 in control tss removal was 76 and 75 in papyrus and bulrush compared to 54 in the control cod removal showed 65 and 62 in the planted beds and 32 in the control tss removal demands more controlled operations than other parameters it was concluded that cws can function well under irregular flow conditions and can be the technology of choice in low income countries particularly in tropical climates keywords constructed wetlands indigenous macrophytes irregular flows removal efficiency operational phases organic pollutants 1 background institutions and urban centers in developing countries are suffering from environmental pollution because of the lack of appropriate infrastructure and technologies to treat the generated wastewater the current practice in the industrialized countries focuses on eco hazards and micropollutants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals and the solutions are shifting to membrane technology henze et al 2008 in contrast the major issue for developing countries is still human health due to contamination of sewage thus making the top priority in treatment to be the removal of organic matter nutrients and coliforms in ethiopia wastewater treatment facilities are nearly nonexistent and are often dysfunctional when present haddis et al 2013 the capital addis ababa is sewer connected for less than 10 of its inhabitants and the two treatment plants being oxidation ponds can receive only a small fraction of the design objective of the 398 985m3 wastewater generated every day the city is only able to remove 1723m3 mowie 2015 the recent expansion at kality is expected to treat additional 100 000m3 wastewater as reported by the government owned media in december 2017 wastewater treatment is even worse in regional cities van rooijen and tadesse 2009 haddis et al 2013 world bank 2014 neighboring countries face the same problems estimated sewerage connection in kenya for instance is between 12 and 19 and only 5 of the national sewerage is being treated mburu et al 2013 the major drawbacks can be cited as problems related to low operational capacity of utilities economic constraints and poor technology selection haddis et al 2012 2013 mburu et al 2013 all of which are governed by a lack of awareness constructed wetlands have been widely used as an alternative in wastewater treatment in many parts of the developed world for more than four decades vymazal 2009 mburu et al 2013 hence many of the field experiments thus far reflect the design and performance of these systems in temperate and cold climates for climatic economical and technological reasons constructed wetlands as well as waste stabilization ponds have been considered as a promising solution to wastewater treatment in developing and tropical climates van der bruggen et al 2009 kayombo et al 2005 although attention given is still low indeed few studies have been conducted in tropical africa on the use of constructed wetlands kelvin and tole 2011 kyambade et al 2005 kaserva 2004 mairi et al 2012 mburu et al 2013 mekonnen et al 2015 sara et al 2015 for ethiopia no scientific report is available so far except the case study of guenet 2007 which evaluated the performance of an existing constructed wetland of an office in addis apart from being limited in number these reports often present contradictory results as clearly indicated by mairi et al 2012 some studies report significant performance differences between planted wetland cells and unplanted ones while others report that there is no difference these inconsistencies and low performance evaluations in tropical africa might be attributed to wastewater flow disturbances and irregularities which are a daily encounter in many water and wastewater utility works in developing countries controlling the flow rate is a major challenge in low income countries due to intermittent water supply systems faulty sewerage system designs lack of pumping devices inappropriate plumbing fixtures for flow control and lack of skilled supervision so far the impact of irregular flows in the treatment of wastewater by constructed wetlands in tropical africa has not received a lot of attention although transients in flow rate and cod and tn loading have been reported for mediterranean applications albuquerque et al 2009 and very recently mburu and coworkers presented their results for an extensive range of hydraulic loading rates for constructed wetlands treating the water of a primary facultative pond mburu et al 2013 a recent study by abdelhakeem et al 2016 has tried to evaluate the performance of vertical flow constructed wetlands under different operational conditions but not flow irregularities conclusively this work aims at evaluating the performance in removal of organic pollutants by two indigenous and economically important wetland plants established under irregular flow and variable operational conditions and compares them with a more controlled experiment under the same micro climatic conditions and similar design parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 constructed wetlands and macrophytes the experimental work has been conducted on the campus of jimma university in sw ethiopia using the wastewater generated by one of the dormitories jimma university generates ca 1000m3 of wastewater per day from its population ca 25 000 students based on the 40l c d contribution metcalf and eddy 2003 the amount of wastewater generated from the student dorm located near the pilot plant is ca 24m3 d the three wetland cells together are designed to treat 10 of this flow 2 4m3 of wastewater per day the average bod5 value of the raw wastewater at the campus is found to be 684mg l the wastewater is collected in the existing and non accessible septic tank of the dormitory and passes through primary screening and flow equalization pond with a dimension of 2m 2m 0 7m length width depth respectively with a slope of 0 01 to the distribution point the distribution point is also used as a flow measurement point three cells are designed and constructed see fig 1 and design details below to receive 0 8m3 d each in a continuous feeding mode one cell is planted with an indigenous sedge scirpus validus bulrush known locally as ketema the second cell is planted with papyrus reed cyperus papyrus which is also an indigenous plant and locally known as dengel the third cell is left without macrophytes to serve as a control pollutant removal between different cells is compared with the control the two macrophytes were selected after a pot experiment using eight species of indigenous macrophytes as a screening strategy for identifying the most efficient plants for use in the pilot scale constructed wetland macrophyte selection was based on the following criteria tolerance to high organic and nutrient load indigenousity ability to grow in sand beds efficiency in organics and nutrient removal economic and esthetic value and tolerance to tropical climates plantation was spaced 60 70cm apart thus each cell accommodated a total of 33 batches of plants as sketched in fig 1 2 2 design equations and parameters reed s volumetric design model using a first order plug flow equation parten 2010 epa 1988 was used to design the pilot constructed wetland at the start of the design only a campus average raw influent bod5 concentration of 684mg l was available as the septic tank effluent was inaccessible during the time of measurement hence this worst case value was taken to design the constructed wetland 1 c e c o e k t t where k t k 20 θ t 20 and t lwdn q the required surface area a s lw was calculated by 2 a s q ln c o ln c e k t d n where c e is the desired wetland effluent concentration 30mg l according to vymazal 2010 recommendations c o is the influent concentration 684mg l k t is the temperature dependent

time d q is the average flow rate through the system 0 8m3 d in each cell d is the depth of substrate 0 60m n is the porosity of the bed 0 35 t 22 c mean annual temperature of jimma based on these design parameters the surface area a s was calculated to be 12 33m2 and was rounded off to 16m2 a length to width ratio of 1 4 was assigned finally resulting in 3 beds of 8m 2m 0 6m the treatment medium was sand of 10mm having a porosity of 0 35 and hydraulic conductivity 16 200ft d 4938m d the slope was 1 inlet and outlet gravel size was 40mm with a porosity of 0 45 and hydraulic conductivity of 9997m d the length of the inlet and outlet zone was 1m each the resulting design and configuration can be viewed in fig 1 the bod loading rate q is calculated as 3 q q c a s 800l d 684mg l 16m2 1g 1000mg 34 2g m2 d where q is the inflowing bod loading rate g m2 d q is the wastewater flow rate m3 d a s is the wetland surface area m2 c is the influent wastewater strength mgbod5 l this organic loading rate is significantly higher 3 4 times than used in other designs the typical organic loading for the treatment of secondary domestic wastewater is between 8 and 12gbod5 m2 d in temperate regions chazarnec et al 2007 in addition the value is higher than the recommended loading rate by epa 6g m2 d for treatment systems targeting an effluent quality of 30mg l for domestic effluents vymazal 2010 however it has to be kept in mind that the bod value at the inlet of the constructed wetlands is lower in reality due to biodegradation in the septic and flow equalization tanks thus with possibly lower bod loading rate than calculated the hydraulic loading rate was calculated to be 5cm d this value is again larger than the one recommended by as 0 2 3 0cm d but lower than the recommendation of kadlec and knight 1996 which is 8 3cm d in any case the hlr in this system did not deviate much from lower and higher recommended limits of 3 8cm d 2 3 analytical measurements 2 3 1 onsite parameters onsite parameters like ph dissolved oxygen do conductivity and temperature t were measured using the hach lange hq40d portable multi parameter the probes were dipped about 5cm into the water during the stabilization of the device reading was taken after stabilization 2 3 2 off line parameters measurement of the total suspended solids tss was done according the procedures in the standard methods of apha 1998 the day before the analysis the required amount of filters whatman 1001 090 were dried overnight in an oven at 105 c the next day day of sampling the filters were weighed with an analytical balance and the weights were recorded subsequently 250ml well shaken sample wastewater was filtered and the filters were dried again at 105 c the dried filters were then cooled in a desiccator and the tss was calculated for the measurement of the cod hach lange test kits for water quality were used depending on the expected concentration lck 614 50 300mgo2 l or lck 114 150 1000mgo2 l kits were used samples were then analyzed with the dr 5000 spectrometer and absorption is measured at a wavelength of 605nm hach lange 2011 bod5 was measured using the procedures as stated in apha 1998 in this method samples were collected using airtight bottles having a capacity of 300ml the bottles were filled until they overflow and then stoppered the considered sample was then diluted in such a way that after 5 days storage at 20 c 33 60 of the oxygen is consumed an average oxygen use of 4mg o2 l is assumed the dilution is carried out by diluting ml of sample to a final volume of 1l the dilutions and corresponding bod5 estimations are done according to the relationships mentioned in standard methods of apha 1998 2 4 experimental design the experiment was set up to evaluate the start up of the systems and their steady state performance in addition to the natural disturbances that the beds encountered in terms of flow variations three deliberate disturbance phases were imposed the first was a short no maintenance and control phase denoted with interruption the second was a phase during which the hydraulic retention time and the loading were varied denoted with disturbance phase and the third was a non controlled non fed phase which ended by a restart of the systems after the plants were cut denoted with interruption and re establishment during the deliberate disturbance phase the hydraulic retention time varied between 4 and 7 days and during a short period the incoming wastewater was diluted 50 during that period also unexpected disturbances were present under the form of flooding events the results will be discussed according to the abovementioned phases the switch from transient to steady state phases is not rigorously quantified but is defined by the time instance from which on there is a clear difference between the results from the planted and the control beds whenever average effluent values are mentioned they are calculated on the basis of the measurements of the first steady state the intentional disturbance period and the second steady state periods the study lasted from september 2 2010 to january 15 2012 covering 490 days comparison between the different experimental phases namely disturbance transient and steady state was done to see if there is a difference in performance this was done to check if there is significant variation between controlled and irregular flow conditions in constructed wetlands all design parameters were the same in both systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow conditions and other practical issues one of the main challenges in starting and running the constructed wetlands was the difficulty to maintain a constant flow to reduce the variation of the hydraulic and the bod loading rate three major problems were encountered 1 the local market did not provide peristaltic pumps that are able to release a flow rate as low as 0 8m3 d neither did it provide high quality pipe fitting systems this lack required setting up gate valve control methods with lower precision and induced occasional leakages at the fittings 2 it was very difficult and sometimes out of control to have a continuous supply of wastewater which resulted in wastewater flow interruptions or flooding 3 both the bulrush and the papyrus were favorite food items for apes and birds until the time a proper fencing was installed the plants were damaged several times by these animals which were abundant around the experimental site luckily however they were easily regenerative in order to assess the influence of such non ideal operation conditions the constructed wetland was further operated under variable flow and resource conditions in brief whatever could go wrong flooding water shortage damage due to animals uncontrolled effluent flow rates went wrong in the first transient phase the results of this first transient phase will therefore not be discussed neither compared with the ones of the second transient phase during which for example the influent and effluent flow rates were better controlled 3 2 temperature ph and conductivity the temperature of the influent and effluent was consistently measured at 9 30 am and was on average 17 2 and 22 5 c respectively which is in the optimal range 5 35 c for heterotrophic microbial activity viessman and mammer 2005 while in general the overall wetland functioning is dependent on temperature its effect has been reported to have less impact on bod and p removal but can strongly influence nitrogen removal kadlec and reddy 2001 the ph of the wastewater ranged between 7 and 8 creating an optimum environment for microbial activity as suggested by kayombo et al 2005 who indicated that the ph of a constructed wetland effluent should range between 6 and 8 in dar es salam a ph of 8 73 in the inlet and 7 81 in the outlet was recorded mashauri et al 2000 there was no difference in ph between the influent and effluent in this experiment assessment of the conductivities of the influent and effluent revealed a quite diverse range of 501 5550μs cm in the constructed wetland the mean conductivity values of the influent papyrus bulrush and control bed was found to be 3326 2940 2927 and 2596μs cm respectively and are significantly higher than other reported values indeed these values are extremely high as compared to the conductivity of the constructed wetland cells in kenya which had on average 280μs cm in the influent mburu et al 2013 the reason for this huge difference can be explained by the fact that kenyan wetland used primary facultative pond effluent and in our case a septic tank effluent from a dormitory was used in which a higher concentration of detergents can be expected relatively comparable values of 1098 and 1080μs cm in the outlet and inlet of free water surface wetlands were obtained in another study in kenya kelvin and tole 2011 3 3 dissolved oxygen do and organic carbon cod and bod5 dissolved oxygen showed a significant increase though still anoxic in the effluent of the papyrus and bulrush beds with an average of 1 53 and 1 50mg l respectively as compared to the influent and the control bed with an average of 0 44 and 0 80mg l respectively fig 2 shows the profile of do stretching along the experimental period of the pilot hssf constructed wetland generally effluent do from the planted beds was higher than the do of the influent and the control beds these observations might corroborate the capacity of macrophytes to enrich the subsurface medium with oxygen similar values are reported by e g albuquerque et al 2009 but mburu et al 2013 report lower values of 0 75mg l on average it is assumed that the higher do levels might have been induced by measurement errors during which the samples take more oxygen during pouring into a receptacle although the beds appear to be aerobic on the basis of the measurement values we obtained the plant oxygen transfer may not be sufficient to cope with the administered bod load and hence we are reserved to say the wetland is aerobic the cod profiles are shown in fig 3 and fluctuate during the whole sampling period after the first transient period around 150mg l with a bandwidth of about 50mg l for the planted beds the control bed values are significantly higher and much more erratic the influent cod ranged between 143 and 841mg l with an average value of 413mg l considering the average effluent values of 144 157 and 281mg l for the papyrus bulrush and control beds it can be concluded that the cod removal was low with 65 62 and 32 in the papyrus bulrush and control beds respectively table 1 and exceeds the kenyan discharge limit of 120mg l in kenya an average percentage removal of 60 in the control bed and 59 65 in the planted beds was obtained mburu et al 2013 although it can be inferred from their results and also from the results of trang et al 2010 that for a comparable hydraulic loading rate and retention time values of at least 70 should be possible the lower average cod removal efficiency at the pilot cw might be due to the irregularities in loading rates brought about by flow fluctuations which is for example evidenced by the difference between the first steady state values and the subsequent disturbance period during the latter period more deviations from the mean value can be observed albuquerque et al 2009 reported similar results with low cod and tss removal in constructed wetlands operated under transient loading conditions furthermore as a particular case of flow irregularities the occurrence of overland flow that happened quite frequently in the form of flooding need to be mentioned trang et al 2010 had the same experience with overland flow and reported cod removal between 57 and 84 for different hlr values ranging from 3 10 to 14 6cm d from fig 3 it might seem strange that the effluent values during the second transient are lower than the effluent of steady state values that follow this could be explained by the fact that digestion of the trapped organic material might have occurred during non feeding phase due to which the voids are cleared after the transient the beds are again becoming more filled up with gradual increase as it moves from the transient to the steady state periods however once it reached the steady state period a clear difference between the planted and unplanted beds is observed this might be explained by the plant root zone that has to be developed again and which provides after development an extra basis for physical entrapment of the suspended solids influent and effluent bod5 values of the planted beds for the two years of experiment were relatively stable this was evidenced by the similarity in the performance of the total period with the steady state periods and the low band width as seen in fig 4 the mean inlet bod5 concentration was 224 62mg l while the effluent bod5 values for the planted beds fluctuate around 50mg l with a bandwidth of about 25mg l when comparing figs 3 and 4 in general it can be inferred that the difference between the control and the planted beds in cod effluent values can be explained by the removal of bod due to the higher microbial activity in the planted beds variable removal efficiencies of vegetated beds have been reported worldwide vymazal 2010 reported a bod removal in horizontal and vertical wetlands of 75 and 90 respectively according to kyambadde et al 2009 the removal by cyperus papyrus in uganda was 87 although recent reviews by qomariyah et al 2017 reported 98 55 and 98 46 bod and cod removal respectively using cyperus papyrus in indonesia it is not known under what operational conditions this performance was achieved as indicated by theophile et al 2011 comparison of vegetated and non vegetated beds in cameroun revealed 78 bod removal in vegetated beds while the non vegetated beds were able to remove 71 a study on 6 pilot constructed wetlands in jordan revealed a low bod removal highest 71 and lowest 42 in 3 planted beds and highest 65 and lowest 32 in unplanted beds with higher loading rates and wastewater inlet concentration ranging between 130 and 185mg l al oumari and manyar 2003 a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland at the university of dar es sallam receiving wastewater from a primary facultative pond using phragmites mauritianus was able to remove 71 bod5 in the planted and 45 in unplanted beds mairi et al 2012 hence it can be said that this pilot constructed wetland has performed relatively better even under irregular operation conditions a closer look at fig 4 gives the impression that the system is even not overloaded yet because during the second steady state period effluent values remain low although the influent values are significantly higher than in the periods before however the design criteria to reach 30mg l as effluent bod5 concentration is not achieved yet and might even be unachievable due to background production of organic material as put forward by mburu et al 2013 on the other hand it also becomes clear that the septic tank and piping plus flow equalization and distribution tanks significantly contribute to the overall bod removal given that the average concentration of the raw wastewater was 684mg l the majority of the easily biodegradable matter has most probably already been consumed before the entrance of the constructed wetlands which corroborates the slowly biodegradable nature of the remaining bod the bod5 cod ratio of the influent wastewater was calculated and ranged between 0 242 and 0 978 the highest values concentrating around the 2nd transient and the 2nd steady state periods showing that the wastewater is of more biodegradable in nature during these periods kadlec and wallace 2009 gave bod5 cod ratios for municipal wastewater after primary settling ranges between 0 4 and 0 8 which is similar to this finding this assumption is also supported by the study of mairi et al 2012 in which they used a low bod wastewater coming from a primary facultative pond where much of the biodegradable fraction was removed and as a result they achieved only 71 and 45 in planted and unplanted cells respectively overall the papyrus bed appears to give better removal efficiencies as compared to the bulrush bed and with significant difference with the control bed p 0 005 in fig 5 it can be seen that the removal of suspended solids is as expected predominantly a physico chemical process because during the majority of the experimental period the control bed performed similarly to the planted beds the wider gap between the planted beds and the control that is observed during the second transient and the second steady state periods indicate that part of the suspended matter is of biodegradable in nature which is corroborated by the cod and bod profiles of figs 3 and 4 this gap was possibly caused by the longer interruption period during which the root zone microbial biomass continued to utilize the biodegradable fraction as for the tss removal efficiencies values of 76 in both papyrus and bulrush and 54 in the control beds were measured 1 which is comparable to what was measured during the pot experiments where removal efficiencies of about 80 in papyrus and about 70 in bulrush were observed vymazal 2010 reports 75 and 89 tss removal in a vertical flow and horizontal flow constructed wetland respectively tss removal of the two steady state periods did not show much difference within the period of measurements 78 73 and 52 in papyrus bulrush and control beds respectively comparison of steady state and whole period also showed no significance difference in the removal of tss in all the three treatment cells p 0 172 0 189 and 0 332 in papyrus bulrush and control beds respectively suggesting that cws can easily absorb shock loads 3 4 comparison between the different experimental periods fig 6 shows the performance of the three wetland cells in the removal of bod5 cod and tss in the different experimental periods it was observed that the steady state period has a better performance in removal of om in both the planted beds however the difference was not statistically significant between the steady state and whole period in papyrus bulrush and control beds p 0 172 0 189 and 0 332 respectively the difference between steady state and the disturbance periods was not significant either in all the three wetland beds this may be suggestive that constructed wetlands are tolerant to load fluctuations but the difference was significant when comparing the different phases of planted beds with unplanted cells 3 5 effect of loading rate on the performance of hssf constructed wetland flow rate was assumed to be regulated at 0 8m3 d to each treatment cell however in this system flow fluctuated between interruptions and flooding fig 7 we see from fig 7 that the lowest flow rates represent the interruption phases followed by disturbance periods furthermore despite high fluctuations in flow which is directly proportional to influent bod load the performance did not change much this again is a proof that constructed wetlands can tolerate shock loads constructed wetlands are also proved to absorb variations in hlr recent studies in srilanka by weerakoon et al 2016 indicated that increasing the hlr to up to 25cmd 1 can give good removal of pollutants 4 conclusions developing countries need to rely on low cost efficient and sustainable onsite wastewater treatment systems and constructed wetlands are claimed as being one of the best candidates however their practical applicability is not as simple as stated in literature failure to consider even the simplest technical or managerial tasks could lead to a number of complications the following conclusions are drawn from a pilot scale constructed wetland experiment in jimma ethiopia i pretreatment of the wastewater before it enters the constructed wetland is mandatory screening systems should be introduced to prevent clogging of the sewerage system by old clothes shoes rugs and other coarse materials that are commonly encountered in many low income communities that do not segregate waste and have crude disposal mechanisms ii horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands are proven to be a good choice even when operated under crude conditions and irregular flows with all the problems mentioned the performance is still comparable sometimes even better as indicated in section 3 with other trials in many parts of the world for most of the parameters in addition to using well functioning and controllable septic tanks more technical and managerial skills are needed furthermore the design should consider the use of siphons for better flow control iii macrophyte selection principles worked very well the performance of both papyrus and bulrush in contaminant removal in a tropical climate can be reliable especially if pre treatment systems to reduce the wastewater strength and flow management system is established iv comparison of the different phases for the removal of bod5 cod tss did not show significant difference in any of the parameters showing that the constructed wetland can be a highly load tolerant wastewater treatment technology v as an overall conclusion it can be stated that the considered constructed wetlands with both indigenous plants did behave quite robustly under flow and loading disturbances although the bod cod and tss effluent norms to surface water courses in e g kenya are slightly exceeded further increasing the hydraulic retention time above 4 days might be beneficial although none zero background levels of cod and bod due to natural production in the wetlands can also explain the observed phenomena conflict of interest there is no conflict of interest ethical statement this

1083,constructed wetlands are considered as a promising wastewater treatment option though extensively studied most field experiments reflect the performance of these systems in temperate and cold climates and in relatively controlled flow conditions this study aims at evaluating the performance of a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland using indigenous macrophytes in a tropical climate i e in east africa ethiopia under suboptimal conditions of flow two selected plant species i e cyperus papyrus papyrus and scirpus validus bulrush were tested using the wastewater from a dormitory at jimma university campus in ethiopia the experimental period consisted of two rather well controlled phases with two non controlled and non sampled phases and one intentional disturbance phase in between bod5 removal was 81 in papyrus 76 in bulrush and 48 in control tss removal was 76 and 75 in papyrus and bulrush compared to 54 in the control cod removal showed 65 and 62 in the planted beds and 32 in the control tss removal demands more controlled operations than other parameters it was concluded that cws can function well under irregular flow conditions and can be the technology of choice in low income countries particularly in tropical climates keywords constructed wetlands indigenous macrophytes irregular flows removal efficiency operational phases organic pollutants 1 background institutions and urban centers in developing countries are suffering from environmental pollution because of the lack of appropriate infrastructure and technologies to treat the generated wastewater the current practice in the industrialized countries focuses on eco hazards and micropollutants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals and the solutions are shifting to membrane technology henze et al 2008 in contrast the major issue for developing countries is still human health due to contamination of sewage thus making the top priority in treatment to be the removal of organic matter nutrients and coliforms in ethiopia wastewater treatment facilities are nearly nonexistent and are often dysfunctional when present haddis et al 2013 the capital addis ababa is sewer connected for less than 10 of its inhabitants and the two treatment plants being oxidation ponds can receive only a small fraction of the design objective of the 398 985m3 wastewater generated every day the city is only able to remove 1723m3 mowie 2015 the recent expansion at kality is expected to treat additional 100 000m3 wastewater as reported by the government owned media in december 2017 wastewater treatment is even worse in regional cities van rooijen and tadesse 2009 haddis et al 2013 world bank 2014 neighboring countries face the same problems estimated sewerage connection in kenya for instance is between 12 and 19 and only 5 of the national sewerage is being treated mburu et al 2013 the major drawbacks can be cited as problems related to low operational capacity of utilities economic constraints and poor technology selection haddis et al 2012 2013 mburu et al 2013 all of which are governed by a lack of awareness constructed wetlands have been widely used as an alternative in wastewater treatment in many parts of the developed world for more than four decades vymazal 2009 mburu et al 2013 hence many of the field experiments thus far reflect the design and performance of these systems in temperate and cold climates for climatic economical and technological reasons constructed wetlands as well as waste stabilization ponds have been considered as a promising solution to wastewater treatment in developing and tropical climates van der bruggen et al 2009 kayombo et al 2005 although attention given is still low indeed few studies have been conducted in tropical africa on the use of constructed wetlands kelvin and tole 2011 kyambade et al 2005 kaserva 2004 mairi et al 2012 mburu et al 2013 mekonnen et al 2015 sara et al 2015 for ethiopia no scientific report is available so far except the case study of guenet 2007 which evaluated the performance of an existing constructed wetland of an office in addis apart from being limited in number these reports often present contradictory results as clearly indicated by mairi et al 2012 some studies report significant performance differences between planted wetland cells and unplanted ones while others report that there is no difference these inconsistencies and low performance evaluations in tropical africa might be attributed to wastewater flow disturbances and irregularities which are a daily encounter in many water and wastewater utility works in developing countries controlling the flow rate is a major challenge in low income countries due to intermittent water supply systems faulty sewerage system designs lack of pumping devices inappropriate plumbing fixtures for flow control and lack of skilled supervision so far the impact of irregular flows in the treatment of wastewater by constructed wetlands in tropical africa has not received a lot of attention although transients in flow rate and cod and tn loading have been reported for mediterranean applications albuquerque et al 2009 and very recently mburu and coworkers presented their results for an extensive range of hydraulic loading rates for constructed wetlands treating the water of a primary facultative pond mburu et al 2013 a recent study by abdelhakeem et al 2016 has tried to evaluate the performance of vertical flow constructed wetlands under different operational conditions but not flow irregularities conclusively this work aims at evaluating the performance in removal of organic pollutants by two indigenous and economically important wetland plants established under irregular flow and variable operational conditions and compares them with a more controlled experiment under the same micro climatic conditions and similar design parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 constructed wetlands and macrophytes the experimental work has been conducted on the campus of jimma university in sw ethiopia using the wastewater generated by one of the dormitories jimma university generates ca 1000m3 of wastewater per day from its population ca 25 000 students based on the 40l c d contribution metcalf and eddy 2003 the amount of wastewater generated from the student dorm located near the pilot plant is ca 24m3 d the three wetland cells together are designed to treat 10 of this flow 2 4m3 of wastewater per day the average bod5 value of the raw wastewater at the campus is found to be 684mg l the wastewater is collected in the existing and non accessible septic tank of the dormitory and passes through primary screening and flow equalization pond with a dimension of 2m 2m 0 7m length width depth respectively with a slope of 0 01 to the distribution point the distribution point is also used as a flow measurement point three cells are designed and constructed see fig 1 and design details below to receive 0 8m3 d each in a continuous feeding mode one cell is planted with an indigenous sedge scirpus validus bulrush known locally as ketema the second cell is planted with papyrus reed cyperus papyrus which is also an indigenous plant and locally known as dengel the third cell is left without macrophytes to serve as a control pollutant removal between different cells is compared with the control the two macrophytes were selected after a pot experiment using eight species of indigenous macrophytes as a screening strategy for identifying the most efficient plants for use in the pilot scale constructed wetland macrophyte selection was based on the following criteria tolerance to high organic and nutrient load indigenousity ability to grow in sand beds efficiency in organics and nutrient removal economic and esthetic value and tolerance to tropical climates plantation was spaced 60 70cm apart thus each cell accommodated a total of 33 batches of plants as sketched in fig 1 2 2 design equations and parameters reed s volumetric design model using a first order plug flow equation parten 2010 epa 1988 was used to design the pilot constructed wetland at the start of the design only a campus average raw influent bod5 concentration of 684mg l was available as the septic tank effluent was inaccessible during the time of measurement hence this worst case value was taken to design the constructed wetland 1 c e c o e k t t where k t k 20 θ t 20 and t lwdn q the required surface area a s lw was calculated by 2 a s q ln c o ln c e k t d n where c e is the desired wetland effluent concentration 30mg l according to vymazal 2010 recommendations c o is the influent concentration 684mg l k t is the temperature dependent first order reaction rate constant d 1 k 20 0 86 d epa 1988 θ is the temperature coefficient at 20 c 1 06 parten 2010 a s is the surface area of the treatment medium m2 t is the hydraulic residence time d q is the average flow rate through the system 0 8m3 d in each cell d is the depth of substrate 0 60m n is the porosity of the bed 0 35 t 22 c mean annual temperature of jimma based on these design parameters the surface area a s was calculated to be 12 33m2 and was rounded off to 16m2 a length to width ratio of 1 4 was assigned finally resulting in 3 beds of 8m 2m 0 6m the treatment medium was sand of 10mm having a porosity of 0 35 and hydraulic conductivity 16 200ft d 4938m d the slope was 1 inlet and outlet gravel size was 40mm with a porosity of 0 45 and hydraulic conductivity of 9997m d the length of the inlet and outlet zone was 1m each the resulting design and configuration can be viewed in fig 1 the bod loading rate q is calculated as 3 q q c a s 800l d 684mg l 16m2 1g 1000mg 34 2g m2 d where q is the inflowing bod loading rate g m2 d q is the wastewater flow rate m3 d a s is the wetland surface area m2 c is the influent wastewater strength mgbod5 l this organic loading rate is significantly higher 3 4 times than used in other designs the typical organic loading for the treatment of secondary domestic wastewater is between 8 and 12gbod5 m2 d in temperate regions chazarnec et al 2007 in addition the value is higher than the recommended loading rate by epa 6g m2 d for treatment systems targeting an effluent quality of 30mg l for domestic effluents vymazal 2010 however it has to be kept in mind that the bod value at the inlet of the constructed wetlands is lower in reality due to biodegradation in the septic and flow equalization tanks thus with possibly lower bod loading rate than calculated the hydraulic loading rate was calculated to be 5cm d this value is again larger than the one recommended by as 0 2 3 0cm d but lower than the recommendation of kadlec and knight 1996 which is 8 3cm d in any case the hlr in this system did not deviate much from lower and higher recommended limits of 3 8cm d 2 3 analytical measurements 2 3 1 onsite parameters onsite parameters like ph dissolved oxygen do conductivity and temperature t were measured using the hach lange hq40d portable multi parameter the probes were dipped about 5cm into the water during the stabilization of the device reading was taken after stabilization 2 3 2 off line parameters measurement of the total suspended solids tss was done according the procedures in the standard methods of apha 1998 the day before the analysis the required amount of filters whatman 1001 090 were dried overnight in an oven at 105 c the next day day of sampling the filters were weighed with an analytical balance and the weights were recorded subsequently 250ml well shaken sample wastewater was filtered and the filters were dried again at 105 c the dried filters were then cooled in a desiccator and the tss was calculated for the measurement of the cod hach lange test kits for water quality were used depending on the expected concentration lck 614 50 300mgo2 l or lck 114 150 1000mgo2 l kits were used samples were then analyzed with the dr 5000 spectrometer and absorption is measured at a wavelength of 605nm hach lange 2011 bod5 was measured using the procedures as stated in apha 1998 in this method samples were collected using airtight bottles having a capacity of 300ml the bottles were filled until they overflow and then stoppered the considered sample was then diluted in such a way that after 5 days storage at 20 c 33 60 of the oxygen is consumed an average oxygen use of 4mg o2 l is assumed the dilution is carried out by diluting ml of sample to a final volume of 1l the dilutions and corresponding bod5 estimations are done according to the relationships mentioned in standard methods of apha 1998 2 4 experimental design the experiment was set up to evaluate the start up of the systems and their steady state performance in addition to the natural disturbances that the beds encountered in terms of flow variations three deliberate disturbance phases were imposed the first was a short no maintenance and control phase denoted with interruption the second was a phase during which the hydraulic retention time and the loading were varied denoted with disturbance phase and the third was a non controlled non fed phase which ended by a restart of the systems after the plants were cut denoted with interruption and re establishment during the deliberate disturbance phase the hydraulic retention time varied between 4 and 7 days and during a short period the incoming wastewater was diluted 50 during that period also unexpected disturbances were present under the form of flooding events the results will be discussed according to the abovementioned phases the switch from transient to steady state phases is not rigorously quantified but is defined by the time instance from which on there is a clear difference between the results from the planted and the control beds whenever average effluent values are mentioned they are calculated on the basis of the measurements of the first steady state the intentional disturbance period and the second steady state periods the study lasted from september 2 2010 to january 15 2012 covering 490 days comparison between the different experimental phases namely disturbance transient and steady state was done to see if there is a difference in performance this was done to check if there is significant variation between controlled and irregular flow conditions in constructed wetlands all design parameters were the same in both systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow conditions and other practical issues one of the main challenges in starting and running the constructed wetlands was the difficulty to maintain a constant flow to reduce the variation of the hydraulic and the bod loading rate three major problems were encountered 1 the local market did not provide peristaltic pumps that are able to release a flow rate as low as 0 8m3 d neither did it provide high quality pipe fitting systems this lack required setting up gate valve control methods with lower precision and induced occasional leakages at the fittings 2 it was very difficult and sometimes out of control to have a continuous supply of wastewater which resulted in wastewater flow interruptions or flooding 3 both the bulrush and the papyrus were favorite food items for apes and birds until the time a proper fencing was installed the plants were damaged several times by these animals which were abundant around the experimental site luckily however they were easily regenerative in order to assess the influence of such non ideal operation conditions the constructed wetland was further operated under variable flow and resource conditions in brief whatever could go wrong flooding water shortage damage due to animals uncontrolled effluent flow rates went wrong in the first transient phase the results of this first transient phase will therefore not be discussed neither compared with the ones of the second transient phase during which for example the influent and effluent flow rates were better controlled 3 2 temperature ph and conductivity the temperature of the influent and effluent was consistently measured at 9 30 am and was on average 17 2 and 22 5 c respectively which is in the optimal range 5 35 c for heterotrophic microbial activity viessman and mammer 2005 while in general the overall wetland functioning is dependent on temperature its effect has been reported to have less impact on bod and p removal but can strongly influence nitrogen removal kadlec and reddy 2001 the ph of the wastewater ranged between 7 and 8 creating an optimum environment for microbial activity as suggested by kayombo et al 2005 who indicated that the ph of a constructed wetland effluent should range between 6 and 8 in dar es salam a ph of 8 73 in the inlet and 7 81 in the outlet was recorded mashauri et al 2000 there was no difference in ph between the influent and effluent in this experiment assessment of the conductivities of the influent and effluent revealed a quite diverse range of 501 5550μs cm in the constructed wetland the mean conductivity values of the influent papyrus bulrush and control bed was found to be 3326 2940 2927 and 2596μs cm respectively and are significantly higher than other reported values indeed these values are extremely high as compared to the conductivity of the constructed wetland cells in kenya which had on average 280μs cm in the influent mburu et al 2013 the reason for this huge difference can be explained by the fact that kenyan wetland used primary facultative pond effluent and in our case a septic tank effluent from a dormitory was used in which a higher concentration of detergents can be expected relatively comparable values of 1098 and 1080μs cm in the outlet and inlet of free water surface wetlands were obtained in another study in kenya kelvin and tole 2011 3 3 dissolved oxygen do and organic carbon cod and bod5 dissolved oxygen showed a significant increase though still anoxic in the effluent of the papyrus and bulrush beds with an average of 1 53 and 1 50mg l respectively as compared to the influent and the control bed with an average of 0 44 and 0 80mg l respectively fig 2 shows the profile of do stretching along the experimental period of the pilot hssf constructed wetland generally effluent do from the planted beds was higher than the do of the influent and the control beds these observations might corroborate the capacity of macrophytes to enrich the subsurface medium with oxygen similar values are reported by e g albuquerque et al 2009 but mburu et al 2013 report lower values of 0 75mg l on average it is assumed that the higher do levels might have been induced by measurement errors during which the samples take more oxygen during pouring into a receptacle although the beds appear to be aerobic on the basis of the measurement values we obtained the plant oxygen transfer may not be sufficient to cope with the administered bod load and hence we are reserved to say the wetland is aerobic the cod profiles are shown in fig 3 and fluctuate during the whole sampling period after the first transient period around 150mg l with a bandwidth of about 50mg l for the planted beds the control bed values are significantly higher and much more erratic the influent cod ranged between 143 and 841mg l with an average value of 413mg l considering the average effluent values of 144 157 and 281mg l for the papyrus bulrush and control beds it can be concluded that the cod removal was low with 65 62 and 32 in the papyrus bulrush and control beds respectively table 1 and exceeds the kenyan discharge limit of 120mg l in kenya an average percentage removal of 60 in the control bed and 59 65 in the planted beds was obtained mburu et al 2013 although it can be inferred from their results and also from the results of trang et al 2010 that for a comparable hydraulic loading rate and retention time values of at least 70 should be possible the lower average cod removal efficiency at the pilot cw might be due to the irregularities in loading rates brought about by flow fluctuations which is for example evidenced by the difference between the first steady state values and the subsequent disturbance period during the latter period more deviations from the mean value can be observed albuquerque et al 2009 reported similar results with low cod and tss removal in constructed wetlands operated under transient loading conditions furthermore as a particular case of flow irregularities the occurrence of overland flow that happened quite frequently in the form of flooding need to be mentioned trang et al 2010 had the same experience with overland flow and reported cod removal between 57 and 84 for different hlr values ranging from 3 10 to 14 6cm d from fig 3 it might seem strange that the effluent values during the second transient are lower than the effluent of steady state values that follow this could be explained by the fact that digestion of the trapped organic material might have occurred during non feeding phase due to which the voids are cleared after the transient the beds are again becoming more filled up with gradual increase as it moves from the transient to the steady state periods however once it reached the steady state period a clear difference between the planted and unplanted beds is observed this might be explained by the plant root zone that has to be developed again and which provides after development an extra basis for physical entrapment of the suspended solids influent and effluent bod5 values of the planted beds for the two years of experiment were relatively stable this was evidenced by the similarity in the performance of the total period with the steady state periods and the low band width as seen in fig 4 the mean inlet bod5 concentration was 224 62mg l while the effluent bod5 values for the planted beds fluctuate around 50mg l with a bandwidth of about 25mg l when comparing figs 3 and 4 in general it can be inferred that the difference between the control and the planted beds in cod effluent values can be explained by the removal of bod due to the higher microbial activity in the planted beds variable removal efficiencies of vegetated beds have been reported worldwide vymazal 2010 reported a bod removal in horizontal and vertical wetlands of 75 and 90 respectively according to kyambadde et al 2009 the removal by cyperus papyrus in uganda was 87 although recent reviews by qomariyah et al 2017 reported 98 55 and 98 46 bod and cod removal respectively using cyperus papyrus in indonesia it is not known under what operational conditions this performance was achieved as indicated by theophile et al 2011 comparison of vegetated and non vegetated beds in cameroun revealed 78 bod removal in vegetated beds while the non vegetated beds were able to remove 71 a study on 6 pilot constructed wetlands in jordan revealed a low bod removal highest 71 and lowest 42 in 3 planted beds and highest 65 and lowest 32 in unplanted beds with higher loading rates and wastewater inlet concentration ranging between 130 and 185mg l al oumari and manyar 2003 a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland at the university of dar es sallam receiving wastewater from a primary facultative pond using phragmites mauritianus was able to remove 71 bod5 in the planted and 45 in unplanted beds mairi et al 2012 hence it can be said that this pilot constructed wetland has performed relatively better even under irregular operation conditions a closer look at fig 4 gives the impression that the system is even not overloaded yet because during the second steady state period effluent values remain low although the influent values are significantly higher than in the periods before however the design criteria to reach 30mg l as effluent bod5 concentration is not achieved yet and might even be unachievable due to background production of organic material as put forward by mburu et al 2013 on the other hand it also becomes clear that the septic tank and piping plus flow equalization and distribution tanks significantly contribute to the overall bod removal given that the average concentration of the raw wastewater was 684mg l the majority of the easily biodegradable matter has most probably already been consumed before the entrance of the constructed wetlands which corroborates the slowly biodegradable nature of the remaining bod the bod5 cod ratio of the influent wastewater was calculated and ranged between 0 242 and 0 978 the highest values concentrating around the 2nd transient and the 2nd steady state periods showing that the wastewater is of more biodegradable in nature during these periods kadlec and wallace 2009 gave bod5 cod ratios for municipal wastewater after primary settling ranges between 0 4 and 0 8 which is similar to this finding this assumption is also supported by the study of mairi et al 2012 in which they used a low bod wastewater coming from a primary facultative pond where much of the biodegradable fraction was removed and as a result they achieved only 71 and 45 in planted and unplanted cells respectively overall the papyrus bed appears to give better removal efficiencies as compared to the bulrush bed and with significant difference with the control bed p 0 005 in fig 5 it can be seen that the removal of suspended solids is as expected predominantly a physico chemical process because during the majority of the experimental period the control bed performed similarly to the planted beds the wider gap between the planted beds and the control that is observed during the second transient and the second steady state periods indicate that part of the suspended matter is of biodegradable in nature which is corroborated by the cod and bod profiles of figs 3 and 4 this gap was possibly caused by the longer interruption period during which the root zone microbial biomass continued to utilize the biodegradable fraction as for the tss removal efficiencies values of 76 in both papyrus and bulrush and 54 in the control beds were measured 1 which is comparable to what was measured during the pot experiments where removal efficiencies of about 80 in papyrus and about 70 in bulrush were observed vymazal 2010 reports 75 and 89 tss removal in a vertical flow and horizontal flow constructed wetland respectively tss removal of the two steady state periods did not show much difference within the period of measurements 78 73 and 52 in papyrus bulrush and control beds respectively comparison of steady state and whole period also showed no significance difference in the removal of tss in all the three treatment cells p 0 172 0 189 and 0 332 in papyrus bulrush and control beds respectively suggesting that cws can easily absorb shock loads 3 4 comparison between the different experimental periods fig 6 shows the performance of the three wetland cells in the removal of bod5 cod and tss in the different experimental periods it was observed that the steady state period has a better performance in removal of om in both the planted beds however the difference was not statistically significant between the steady state and whole period in papyrus bulrush and control beds p 0 172 0 189 and 0 332 respectively the difference between steady state and the disturbance periods was not significant either in all the three wetland beds this may be suggestive that constructed wetlands are tolerant to load fluctuations but the difference was significant when comparing the different phases of planted beds with unplanted cells 3 5 effect of loading rate on the performance of hssf constructed wetland flow rate was assumed to be regulated at 0 8m3 d to each treatment cell however in this system flow fluctuated between interruptions and flooding fig 7 we see from fig 7 that the lowest flow rates represent the interruption phases followed by disturbance periods furthermore despite high fluctuations in flow which is directly proportional to influent bod load the performance did not change much this again is a proof that constructed wetlands can tolerate shock loads constructed wetlands are also proved to absorb variations in hlr recent studies in srilanka by weerakoon et al 2016 indicated that increasing the hlr to up to 25cmd 1 can give good removal of pollutants 4 conclusions developing countries need to rely on low cost efficient and sustainable onsite wastewater treatment systems and constructed wetlands are claimed as being one of the best candidates however their practical applicability is not as simple as stated in literature failure to consider even the simplest technical or managerial tasks could lead to a number of complications the following conclusions are drawn from a pilot scale constructed wetland experiment in jimma ethiopia i pretreatment of the wastewater before it enters the constructed wetland is mandatory screening systems should be introduced to prevent clogging of the sewerage system by old clothes shoes rugs and other coarse materials that are commonly encountered in many low income communities that do not segregate waste and have crude disposal mechanisms ii horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands are proven to be a good choice even when operated under crude conditions and irregular flows with all the problems mentioned the performance is still comparable sometimes even better as indicated in section 3 with other trials in many parts of the world for most of the parameters in addition to using well functioning and controllable septic tanks more technical and managerial skills are needed furthermore the design should consider the use of siphons for better flow control iii macrophyte selection principles worked very well the performance of both papyrus and bulrush in contaminant removal in a tropical climate can be reliable especially if pre treatment systems to reduce the wastewater strength and flow management system is established iv comparison of the different phases for the removal of bod5 cod tss did not show significant difference in any of the parameters showing that the constructed wetland can be a highly load tolerant wastewater treatment technology v as an overall conclusion it can be stated that the considered constructed wetlands with both indigenous plants did behave quite robustly under flow and loading disturbances although the bod cod and tss effluent norms to surface water courses in e g kenya are slightly exceeded further increasing the hydraulic retention time above 4 days might be beneficial although none zero background levels of cod and bod due to natural production in the wetlands can also explain the observed phenomena conflict of interest there is no conflict of interest ethical statement this

1084,in agricultural lands the way in which slope position affects the detachment of material and the runoff generation is not clear there are complex interactions between slope position slope gradient and a series of soil characteristics and their impact on runoff generation and soil erosion may vary from site to site we designed an experiment to investigate the initial hydrological responces of soils located on different slope positions footslope backslope and shoulder in runoff and soil detachment generation to achieve these goals 25 high intensity low frequency rainfall events were simulated in experiments with a return period of 5 years on 0 25m2 circular plots to measure the detachment along a hillslope in the celler del roure vineyards in eastern spain the results of this investigation showed that soil erosion rates 3mgha 1 h 1 were high and there were no significant differences between sites in relation to slope position all the plots generated runoff runoff coefficient of 24 8 these results allow us to conclude that soil detachment and runoff generation in mediterranean vineyards where tillage is millennia old management practice could be also evenly distributed therefore the used management practices in these vineyards contribute to creating net source areas of runoff and erosion with no areas that could act as a sink under intensive rainfall events based on our research and a literature review we propose to implement nature based solutions that would contribute to reducing soil erosion in agricultural land by creating sink areas in the form of hedgerows ponds or vegetation strips where the surface wash deposits and water can sediment and infiltrate we also discussed other management practices contributing to reduction of erosion such as mulching and inter row crops we state that there is an urgent need to apply strategies to reduce soil loss in vineyards keywords soil erosion tillage slope positions land management runoff

management at the hillslope scale the upper slope position yields material transport is dominant at the backslope section and at the footslope part the sedimentation is prevalent this is a dynamic question and the consequence of the shallow soils in the upper part of the slope is that they generate higher runoff rates bracken et al 2015 martz and de jong 1987 on the other hand deep soils formed in the lower hillslope positions where the colluvium is accumulated use to show higher infiltration rates gregorich et al 1998 this pattern of sediment source and sinks is also related to the climatic conditions imeson and lavee 1998 poesen 1986 yair and lavee 1976 the sediment transport at the slope and watershed scale is highly dependent on the runoff generation and the connectivity of the flows keesstra et al 2018 poeppl and parsons 2018 vegetation also plays a key role in the runoff generation and sediment delivery the footslopes use to show a higher vegetation cover than the rest of the hillslope as a consequence of a higher soil moisture content which allow enhancing biological processes and infiltration croke et al 2017 he et al 2017 moreover this dynamic allows a well known increase in organic matter soil structure and nutrients which is related to the catena concept chiang and peterson 1970 different soils can be developed under several different and specific geomorphological locations and conditions gabbard et al 1998 huang et al 2014 kreznor et al 1989 this is because different soil formation processes act at different rates upon different hillslope positions cerdà 1998 this is also a key effect of the vegetation controlling the soil erosion at the pedon scale such as scientists found in different landscapes where the plant tussocks act as a sink and the inter patch as a source of sediments water and seeds aguiar and sala 1999 cerdà 1997 ouyang et al 2010 soil erosion is a well known process that is developed following three phaseś detachment transport and sedimentation detachment is a key mechanism that finally will determine the soil erosion rate how to measure detachment is not established but it is accepted that it refers to the material that is removed from the soil surface in this process different natural mechanisms can act i splash fernández raga et al 2017 ii surface wash cantón et al 2011 and iii bioturbation breuning madsen et al 2017 sanford 2008 on the other hand human impacts are also factors that activate soil erosion processes with diverse intensity and distribution however it is well known that the variability is very high and still not well understood garcía ruiz et al 2015 the above rationale affects lands under natural forest scrublands or grasslands which are managed by the forces of nature however soils under the human activities control the vegetation cover and modify the soil properties however in the agricultural lands in general and specifically in vineyards where tillage can modify both hydrological and pedological dynamics at the short term period bagagiolo et al 2018 martínez casasnovas et al 2016 and fine scales novara et al 2018 vrsic et al 2011 little is known about the differences of soil erosion at different slope positions in this way recent researches rodrigo comino et al 2016 observed in spanish vineyards that extreme intra plot variability in soil erosion and permeability could be measured using a small portable rainfall simulator and guelph permeameter any spatial trends were not well defined obtaining high standard deviation values because of the high stoniness and high inclination differences soil erodibility can be measured in the laboratory or by means of an empirical equation such as rusle revised universal soil loss equation dabney et al 2012 direct measurements can be also done with small plots that reduce the transport of the detached sediments seeger 2017 rainfall simulators are precise devices that are applied to measure the initial soil detachment when small plots 1m2 are used then we designed an experiment to investigate the impact of slope position footslope backslope and shoulder on runoff and soil detachment to achieve these goals 25 rainfall simulated experiments with a return period of 5 years on 0 25m2 circular plots were performed to measure the detachment and runoff initiation along a hillslope in the celler del roure vineyards in eastern spain we pretended to confirm that the hillslope position is relevant to determine soil detachment and runoff generation for vineyards under a tillage management system this is why small plots under simulated rainfall are used such as other researchers did arnaez et al 2007 blavet et al 2009 we applied low frequency high magnitude simulated rainfall events to determine initial soil erosion processes at different hillslope positions in a highly anthropized soil such as the millennia old vineyards in les alcusses valley in eastern spain with this purpose a hillslope was selected in the celler del roure vineyards in eastern spain 2 material and methods 2 1 study site les alcusses valley is located in eastern spain valencia province and the research sites are placed at celler del roure winery which produces monastrell grape variety in the moixent municipality valencia eastern spain at 38 816 n 0 810 e 560m a s l fig 1 mean annual rainfall is 450mm and the average mean temperature is 15 c the vineyard is located on cretaceous limestones hills and eocene marls valley bottom as well as on colluvium at the base of hillslopes the upper part of the hills is covered with pine forest pinus halepensis and shrubs quercus coccifera and juniperus oxycedrus mostly which are used as rangelands the plantation is 25 years old with a regular distribution of the plants of 3 0 1 4m each row has approximately 125 130 vines 175m with soils that reach 40 60cm depth due to the millennia old practice of tillage the soil profile is mixed and homogenized the main tillage activities are carried out three times per year soil texture is sandy loam and soils can be classified as terric anthrosols with colluvial materials iuss working group wrb 2014 2 2 rainfall simulation experiments 2 2 1 environmental plot characteristics plant cover rock fragment cover and roughness coefficient were measured prior to rainfall simulation experiments plant and rock fragment covers were determined by measuring the presence 1 or absence 0 in 100 points regularly distributed at each 0 25m2 plot and the total amount of 1 values was considered as a representative of each one fig 2 the roughness of the soil surface was determined in four 55 cm long adjacent transects located at the north south east and west of each plot using a 1 m long chain saleh 1993 the chain was carefully placed on the irregular soil surface and the roughness coefficient mm 1 was calculated as the total length of the chain distributed over a horizontal distance of 55cm soil samples 0 20mm were collected in points a few centimetres downslope from each study plot and soil water content was measured on a weight basis after drying samples 105 c 24h soil organic matter was determined by the walkley black method walkley and black 1934 bulk density was measured by the ring method 100cm3 for the 0 60mm soil layer 2 2 2 rainfall simulation procedures twenty five rainfall simulation experiments 7 shoulders 9 backslope 9 footslope were carried out using a rainfall intensity of 55mmh 1 for one hour on circular plots 0 55m in diameter 0 25m2 rainfall intensities about 55mmh 1 have a return period of 5 years elías castillo and ruiz beltrán 1979 more information about its calibration can be found in iserloh et al 2013a b in order to allow comparisons among plots all experiments were carried out during the summer drought when the soil moisture is low july 2015 at each plot runoff flow was collected at 1 min intervals and water volume was measured runoff coefficient was calculated as the percentage of rainfall water running out the circular plot runoff samples were desiccated and sediment yield was calculated on a weight basis in order to calculate soil loss per area and time during rainfall simulation experiments time to ponding time required for 50 of the surface to be ponded tp s time to runoff initiation tr s and time required by runoff to reach the outlet tro s were recorded tp was determined when ponds were found and tr when those ponds were communicated by the runoff tr tp tro tr and tro tp were also calculated because they indicate how the ponding is transformed into runoff and how much runoff in the soil surface last to reach the plot outlet 2 3 statistical analysis and initial soil erosion results mapping firstly environmental plot characteristics such as inclination the cover of rock fragments and vegetation roughness bulk density and antecedent soil moisture were depicted in box plots the mean dash lines and median values were also added and the results were represented between 5th and 95th percentiles fig 3 secondly hydrological responses and soil detachment are also included after calculating averages standard deviations the coefficient of variations maxima and minima then the results per hillslope position of hydrological responses and soil erosion were compared using the one way anova test equal variance and shapiro wilk tests were also conducted to check the normal distribution of the data all the data showed no normal distribution then the tukey test was used to find differences among hillslope positions shoulder backslope and footslope when significant differences were found a post hoc test was used the results of sediment concentration runoff coefficient and soil erosion rates were then mapped using proportional symbols with the software arcmap 10 5 esri usa finally to evaluate if some environmental factors are affecting the activation of soil erosion and runoff generation per hillslope position a spearman rank correlation was conducted using the software spss v 23 ibm usa this non parametric test was preferred instead of other ones e g pearson correlation because we observed that the results did not follow a linear trend moreover a principal component analysis pca was carried out for the whole dataset 25 rainfall simulations in order to reduce the factors in specific components that can explain the relationships among variables environmental plot characteristics and soil erosion results the kmo and bartlett s test for sphericity testing that the correlation matrix has an identity matrix and varimax rotation were selected to get the most accurate results for a maximum of three components 3 results 3 1 environmental plot characteristics the environmental plot characteristics with direct influence on runoff generation and soil detachment were depicted in fig 3 the highest total average inclination was 8 6 with maximum values of 10 in the shoulder in the backslope and footslope 7 9 and 3 1 were obtained respectively roughness reached average values of 1 14 1 11 and 1 09mmmm 1 in the shoulder backslope and footslope respectively the lowest bulk density values were found in the footslope reaching average values of 1 19gcm 3 on the other hand in the shoulder and backslope bulk density increased by 1 23 and 1 20 1 19gcm 3 respectively organic matter content registered the highest values in the footslope part of the hillslope 2 2 followed by the backslope 1 5 and shoulder 1 2 the same trend was found for the vegetation cover where the values increased from the footslope to the shoulder from 7 3 to 3 7 rock fragment content was 20 4 in the shoulder 15 5 in the backslope and 9 8 in the footslope 3 2 runoff generation hydrological response considering the time to ponding runoff generation and runoff in the outlet per hillslope position and the total study area were summarized in table 1 only statistically significant differences were found for tro tro tr and tro tp among hillslope positions tro reached the plot outlet after 606 641 4 and 668 9s in the shoulder backslope and footslope plots respectively those results were also reaffirmed with lower values of tro tr and tro tp because they showed that the runoff generation from the plot to the outlet was faster in the footslope plots than in the shoulder and backslope the rest of the hydrological descriptors showed no statistically significant differences among hillslope positions average tp was found after 166s in each slope position and tr was measured from 306 to 318s 3 3 soil detachment and slope position the final results of runoff coefficient sediment concentration and soil erosion were represented in maps of proportional symbols in figs 4 6 moreover average standard deviation the coefficient of variation maxima and minima were summarized per hillslope position and for the whole dataset in table 2 also statistically significant differences using the tukey test were calculated in the shoulder an average of 3 4l of runoff was collected and ranged from 2 7 to 3 9l the runoff coefficient averaged 24 7 with a maximum of 28 7 and a minimum of 19 9 average sediment concentration was 18 9gl 1 with a maximum of 24gl 1 and minimum of 15 5gl 1 the sediment yield sy and the soil erosion se1 and se2 averaged 64 1g 256 3gm 2 h 1 and 2 6mgha 1 h 1 respectively in the backslope an average of 3 6l of runoff was obtained the highest and lowest values reached 2 9 and 4 4l respectively 26 of the rainfall was collected as runoff with a maximum value of 32 and a minimum of 21 3 average sediment concentration obtained 23 3gl 1 with a maximum of 30 0gl 1 and minimum of 15 7gl 1 the sediment yield sy averaged 82 6g the soil erosion se1 and se2 obtained 330 6gm 2 h 1 and 3 3mgha 1 h 1 respectively average runoff was 3 3l in the footslope plots these values ranged from 3 0 to 4 0l average runoff coefficient obtained 23 7 the highest value of runoff coefficient ranged from 21 7 to 29 1 average sediment concentration showed 23 2gl 1 ranging from 16 8 to 33 0gl 1 the sediment yield sy and the soil erosion se1 and se2 averaged 74 9g 299 6gm 2 h 1 and 3 0mgha 1 h 1 respectively no statistically significant differences were found among slope positions after conducting the tukey test 3 4 statistical analysis spearman rank correlation was applied to determine the factors that most influenced soil losses and different hydrological responses per slope position and the whole dataset table 3 all performed correlations were conducted to find significant results at 0 01 and 0 05 in the whole dataset the analysis only showed significant correlations for tro time to the runoff in the outlet with an increase in slope 0 52 and rock fragments 0 43 and a decrease in organic matter 0 70 and vegetation cover 0 70 also the runoff coefficient registered a significant correlation with the rock fragments 0 45 these results also agree with the tukey test above performed where tro showed to be the unique different parameter among slope positions on the other hand per slope positions in the shoulder only between tro and organic matter 0 82 a significant positive correlation was noted finally the results obtained for the pca are presented in tables 4 and 5 using three components a total of 65 7 of the whole dataset could be explained amounting 37 7 14 7 and 13 3 the first second and third components respectively table 4 in general runoff and sediment yield could not be explained by any component specifically however we can observe as tro appeared involved with other factors into the first component with the slope 0 817 rock fragments 0 717 organic matter 0 888 vegetation cover 0 836 the second component has the runoff coefficient 0 748 and sediment yield 0 839 this indicates that when runoff increases also sediment yield is activated and increases finally in the third component the relative negative influence of the roughness 0 538 bulk density 0 764 on tp 0 678 was obtained 4 discussion the results of the experiments conducted at the celler del roure vineyard demonstrate that soil detachment and runoff generation can be evenly distributed along the hillslope and all parts of the study area and the individual plots contribute with runoff this means that there is not a pattern of the spatial distribution of the runoff generation the sediment detachment and the soil erosion as other authors confirmed in mediterranean sloping vineyards rodrigo comino et al 2017 a key issue in our research is that we did not find any natural factor that controls the initial soil erosion processes a third finding is the high erosion rates measured at the pedon scale the main reason for the high and even detachment of sediments and runoff rate could be the soil management system tillage conducted for millennia at the les alcusses valley due to the repeated tillage soils are disturbed by the tractor passes machinery and human trampling and the fact that the soil remains bare most of the year these results also agree with other investigations carried out in european vineyards under similar conventional soil management systems bagagiolo et al 2018 martínez casasnovas et al 2005 ruiz colmenero et al 2011 then we assume that the tillage homogenizes the soils and reduce the spatial variability such as previous research found arnaez et al 2007 ashraf et al 1999 similar findings were found recently in other regions of the world central europe lieskovský et al 2013 vrsic et al 2011 chinese loess plateau wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 ethiopia adimassu et al 2019 or the mediterranean novara et al 2018 our experiment set up followed previous experimental designs prepared correctly because the rainfall simulator was previously calibrated cerdà et al 2009 iserloh et al 2013a b and kinetical energy of the raindrops was according to the typical rainfall storms of the studied area cerdà 1997 some researchers are still working to fix the use of small round experimental plots because they affirm that they could not provide appropriate data on erosion and therefore some of the conclusions could become limited kinnell 2016 however as other authors also demonstrated the use of small circular plots can be a perfect tool to assess the activation of initial soil detachment and runoff avoiding loss of data using the most ideal scale that will also allow extrapolating the results to larger scales iserloh et al 2017 zemke 2017 however we logically agree that the experiments carried out in this paper cannot be directly extrapolated to conditions when a similar rain fell on the entire hillslope illustrative might be an analysis that bayabil et al 2017 performed in ethiopia where they looked at the relationship between soil loss and plot size and sediment yield it is obvious from this manuscript that erosion rates are directly related to plot size such as cerdà et al 2018 and bagarello et al 2018 recently demonstrated at the el teularet soil erosion and degradation experimental station essentially what is measured in small plot 8 1m2 by these authors that found some kind of sheet erosion when it is measured on larger plots sheet and rill erosion can occur and on a watershed scale deposition occurs as well also depending on the weather types that are able to generate different rainfall intensity and duration which are directly related to the soil erodibility nadal romero et al 2015 rodrigo comino et al 2019 this might be different than on the hillslope like in our research the use of a small portable rainfall simulators does not pretend to quantify the total soil and water losses of a specific area but the initial hydrological responses of specific hotspots that will allow understanding the potential hillslope dynamic arnaez et al 2007 grismer 2016 although the sediment detachment and the runoff generation are unevenly distributed the connectivity of the flows along the hillslope contributes to redistribute the soil particles from the upper to the lower part of the hillslope biddoccu et al 2017 cossart and fressard 2017 in this research we noted that the runoff coefficient was around 1 4 of the total rainfall under high intensity low frequency rainfall events such as the ones simulated here the sediment detached was 20gl 1 of runoff which results in almost 300gm2 h 1 previous research in the study area showed that the connectivity of the flows is restricted to few rainfall events as a consequence of the impact of the ridges formed under the vines by the tillage which disconnect the water and sediment flows along the slope rodrigo comino et al 2018 this confirms that our experiments show a rainfall event that can trigger runoff from all the parts of the slope such as our data shown at the pedon scale we observed that runoff and soil losses were similar for all the 25 research plots all of them produced surface wash and the sediment and water yield were very similar no plots showed a high infiltration rate our research demonstrates that under high intensity rainfall events the vineyards do not have sinks of water and sediments and all the farm could be a net contributor to the surface wash as the soil surface characteristics are very similar our measurements confirm that in agriculture lands the diversity is very low and the soil detachment and surface flow is similar in any part of the slope other authors found that the spatial distribution of the runoff and sediment detachment are mainly determined by the plant cover ben salem et al 2018 rock fragments follain et al 2012 quiquerez et al 2014 or hillslope angle camera et al 2018 rodrigo comino et al 2016 however in our research all three factors were not relevant after applying multivariate analysis techniques the vegetation cover was low the rock fragment cover was present in all the plots and the hillslope positions and the inclination angle did not show any key trend when plotted against soil or water yields in our rainfall simulation experiments the implications of our findings are that the millennia old tillage in vineyards results in the homogenization of soil detachment and that the hillslope position may not affect the surface wash these results demonstrate that the management in this vineyard using tillage is determined by three facts i the detachment is very high ii affect all the hillslope positions and iii that the spatial distribution is even these findings suggest that the current management of this vineyard is not sustainable due to the high detachment rate and the lack of sink areas that would reduce the runoff and sediment discharge at the hillslope and the watershed scales this issue is relevant to achieve the expected sustainable management that will contribute to accomplishing the sustainable management goals that the united nations are promoting caiado et al 2018 it is usual that at the spanish vineyard farms all the land is used to crop vines and there are no areas within the hillslope that is devoted to acting as sinks such as our research has shown thus here we would want to discuss the possible use of nature based solutions to develop proper agricultural management for example the use of grass strips could solve the problem of soil erosion rates in terraced vineyards such as in cereals was applied successfully dong et al 2018 kervroëdan et al 2018 grass strips increase diversity and reduce pollutants and soil losses janssen et al 2018 novara et al 2013 other solution could be the use of straw mulch in the inter row areas and close to the ridges because of its high efficiency to drastically reduce soil loss and runoff amounts gholami et al 2013 lucas borja et al 2018 other management that should be applied in agriculture lands is the use of sinks ponds in order to contribute to creating source areas of sediments and water for intense rainfall events this has been found as a good strategy in ethiopia where soil erosion is extremely high and the use of natural sediment sinks in a catchment reduces the sediment connectivity the sinks to reduce the soil erosion losses can be promoted with the use of intercropping wang et al 2015 or the use of catch crops lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 then the sinks are located in each row of vines and favour the reduction in the detachment of soil and the runoff generation the use of vegetation as a strategy to control soil erosion is part of the soil and water bioengineering approach that promotes the natural hazard control and the ecological restoration rey et al 2019 hedgerows could be also efficient structures in vineyards because of the use of the vegetation as a sink of runoff and sediments holden et al 2019 herbaceous hedges are a mix of grass strips and hedgerows and they could be efficient to control non sustainable erosion rates kervroëdan et al 2018 as they are measured at the mediterranean vineyards prosdocimi et al 2016 rodrigo comino 2018 in fact this is found in some parts of the celler del roure vineyards but they are reduced year after year to increase the area planted with vines our research suggests that farmers and policymakers should induce a reduction in the runoff and sediment yield this could be done with a general improvement of the soil quality and soil cover buchholz et al 2017 calleja cervantes et al 2015 the use of mulches can be a good strategy such as li et al 2019 found in steep slopes in china or abrantes et al 2018 observed under laboratory condition in portugal the use of natural soil components such as the vegetation and the rock fragment content are also efficient strategies that can reduce the soil losses lv et al 2018 however the cover of the soil by mulches or vegetation is not well accepted by the farmers such as previous research demonstrated marques et al 2015 sastre et al 2016 this is why the use of ponds and grass strips or hedgerows can be better accepted by the farmers this research confirms that the high runoff rates and high erosion rates are a consequence of the bare soils that use to be preferred by the farmers in the mediterranean region this also shows high connectivity as all the soils yield water and sediments do not find obstacles sinks when high intensity low frequency rainfall event takes place as it was also demonstrated in france using the graph theory tool fressard and cossart 2019 the investigations of rodrigo comino et al 2018 in this area demonstrated that the ridges generated by the tillage underneath the vine rows can act as a barrier to reduce the connectivity of the flows however under intense rainfall event the surface wash is well connected and due to the lack of any sink the flows will be very efficient similar results were found by lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 in aragón or bagagiolo et al 2018 in italian sloping vineyards we propose that agricultural lands should have sink areas such as rangelands wetlands ponds meadows or vegetation strips where the surface wash deposit the water and sediments and also the pollutants and seeds this as a nature based solution could contribute to reduction of land degradation and achievement of the desertification neutrality pacheco et al 2018 at the studied vineyards the tillage following the contour lines vine rows resulted in ridges underneath the vines and they work as sinks as they favour the reduction in the detachment of soil and the runoff generation rodrigo comino et al 2018 5 conclusions our results confirmed that soil detachment and runoff generation can be high and uneven in mediterranean sloping vineyards with bare soils and managed by tillage the measurements performed with simulated rainfalls under high intensity low frequency rainfall events demonstrated that the hillslope position does not affect soil detachment and runoff rates the impact of human activity in the form of tillage and bare soil surfaces highly affects water discharges and soil erosion in comparison to other research natural factors were not found relevant to understand and foresee the soil erosion spatial distribution therefore we state that there is an urgent need to apply strategies to reduce soil losses in vineyards for this study case we strongly propose the use of hedgerows ponds and grass strips that will act as sinks and they will increase the spatial variability of the hydrological and erosional response along the slope conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgements the research leading to these results has received funding from the european union seventh framework programme fp7 2007 2013 under grant

1084,in agricultural lands the way in which slope position affects the detachment of material and the runoff generation is not clear there are complex interactions between slope position slope gradient and a series of soil characteristics and their impact on runoff generation and soil erosion may vary from site to site we designed an experiment to investigate the initial hydrological responces of soils located on different slope positions footslope backslope and shoulder in runoff and soil detachment generation to achieve these goals 25 high intensity low frequency rainfall events were simulated in experiments with a return period of 5 years on 0 25m2 circular plots to measure the detachment along a hillslope in the celler del roure vineyards in eastern spain the results of this investigation showed that soil erosion rates 3mgha 1 h 1 were high and there were no significant differences between sites in relation to slope position all the plots generated runoff runoff coefficient of 24 8 these results allow us to conclude that soil detachment and runoff generation in mediterranean vineyards where tillage is millennia old management practice could be also evenly distributed therefore the used management practices in these vineyards contribute to creating net source areas of runoff and erosion with no areas that could act as a sink under intensive rainfall events based on our research and a literature review we propose to implement nature based solutions that would contribute to reducing soil erosion in agricultural land by creating sink areas in the form of hedgerows ponds or vegetation strips where the surface wash deposits and water can sediment and infiltrate we also discussed other management practices contributing to reduction of erosion such as mulching and inter row crops we state that there is an urgent need to apply strategies to reduce soil loss in vineyards keywords soil erosion tillage slope positions land management runoff vineyards nature based solutions 1 introduction soil erosion is unevenly distributed in the landscapes khan et al 2016 martz and de jong 1987 shi et al 2012 the watersheds yield sediment from the summits and shoulders and subsequently the rivers transport material to the alluvial plains and deltas where the sedimentation takes place bayabil et al 2010 heimsath et al 1999 in non disturbed ecosystems such as grasslands forest and scrublands soil erosion spatial distribution plays a key role in the landscape evolution chaplot and le bissonnais 2000 d alpaos et al 2007 poesen et al 1990 moreover the influence of different weather types can also include new key factors that will determine new rates of morphological changes related to the water erosion processes nadal romero et al 2015 the erosion process shapes landforms but also landforms determine the erosion processes poesen et al 1990 topography plays a key role in spatial soil erosion distribution and this is why the terrain morphology is relevant to soil erosion modelling ciampalini et al 2012 moore and burch 1986 the influence of the topography affects the soil distribution in natural and man made landscapes but little is known about how much humans change the spatial distribution of soil and water resources and this is relevant to understand the fate of the soils in agricultural land and to plan sustainable management at the hillslope scale the upper slope position yields material transport is dominant at the backslope section and at the footslope part the sedimentation is prevalent this is a dynamic question and the consequence of the shallow soils in the upper part of the slope is that they generate higher runoff rates bracken et al 2015 martz and de jong 1987 on the other hand deep soils formed in the lower hillslope positions where the colluvium is accumulated use to show higher infiltration rates gregorich et al 1998 this pattern of sediment source and sinks is also related to the climatic conditions imeson and lavee 1998 poesen 1986 yair and lavee 1976 the sediment transport at the slope and watershed scale is highly dependent on the runoff generation and the connectivity of the flows keesstra et al 2018 poeppl and parsons 2018 vegetation also plays a key role in the runoff generation and sediment delivery the footslopes use to show a higher vegetation cover than the rest of the hillslope as a consequence of a higher soil moisture content which allow enhancing biological processes and infiltration croke et al 2017 he et al 2017 moreover this dynamic allows a well known increase in organic matter soil structure and nutrients which is related to the catena concept chiang and peterson 1970 different soils can be developed under several different and specific geomorphological locations and conditions gabbard et al 1998 huang et al 2014 kreznor et al 1989 this is because different soil formation processes act at different rates upon different hillslope positions cerdà 1998 this is also a key effect of the vegetation controlling the soil erosion at the pedon scale such as scientists found in different landscapes where the plant tussocks act as a sink and the inter patch as a source of sediments water and seeds aguiar and sala 1999 cerdà 1997 ouyang et al 2010 soil erosion is a well known process that is developed following three phaseś detachment transport and sedimentation detachment is a key mechanism that finally will determine the soil erosion rate how to measure detachment is not established but it is accepted that it refers to the material that is removed from the soil surface in this process different natural mechanisms can act i splash fernández raga et al 2017 ii surface wash cantón et al 2011 and iii bioturbation breuning madsen et al 2017 sanford 2008 on the other hand human impacts are also factors that activate soil erosion processes with diverse intensity and distribution however it is well known that the variability is very high and still not well understood garcía ruiz et al 2015 the above rationale affects lands under natural forest scrublands or grasslands which are managed by the forces of nature however soils under the human activities control the vegetation cover and modify the soil properties however in the agricultural lands in general and specifically in vineyards where tillage can modify both hydrological and pedological dynamics at the short term period bagagiolo et al 2018 martínez casasnovas et al 2016 and fine scales novara et al 2018 vrsic et al 2011 little is known about the differences of soil erosion at different slope positions in this way recent researches rodrigo comino et al 2016 observed in spanish vineyards that extreme intra plot variability in soil erosion and permeability could be measured using a small portable rainfall simulator and guelph permeameter any spatial trends were not well defined obtaining high standard deviation values because of the high stoniness and high inclination differences soil erodibility can be measured in the laboratory or by means of an empirical equation such as rusle revised universal soil loss equation dabney et al 2012 direct measurements can be also done with small plots that reduce the transport of the detached sediments seeger 2017 rainfall simulators are precise devices that are applied to measure the initial

roure vineyards in eastern spain we pretended to confirm that the hillslope position is relevant to determine soil detachment and runoff generation for vineyards under a tillage management system this is why small plots under simulated rainfall are used such as other researchers did arnaez et al 2007 blavet et al 2009 we applied low frequency high magnitude simulated rainfall events to determine initial soil erosion processes at different hillslope positions in a highly anthropized soil such as the millennia old vineyards in les alcusses valley in eastern spain with this purpose a hillslope was selected in the celler del roure vineyards in eastern spain 2 material and methods 2 1 study site les alcusses valley is located in eastern spain valencia province and the research sites are placed at celler del roure winery which produces monastrell grape variety in the moixent municipality valencia eastern spain at 38 816 n 0 810 e 560m a s l fig 1 mean annual rainfall is 450mm and the average mean temperature is 15 c the vineyard is located on cretaceous limestones hills and eocene marls valley bottom as well as on colluvium at the base of hillslopes the upper part of the hills is covered with pine forest pinus halepensis and shrubs quercus coccifera and juniperus oxycedrus mostly which are used as rangelands the plantation is 25 years old with a regular distribution of the plants of 3 0 1 4m each row has approximately 125 130 vines 175m with soils that reach 40 60cm depth due to the millennia old practice of tillage the soil profile is mixed and homogenized the main tillage activities are carried out three times per year soil texture is sandy loam and soils can be classified as terric anthrosols with colluvial materials iuss working group wrb 2014 2 2 rainfall simulation experiments 2 2 1 environmental plot characteristics plant cover rock fragment cover and roughness coefficient were measured prior to rainfall simulation experiments plant and rock fragment covers were determined by measuring the presence 1 or absence 0 in 100 points regularly distributed at each 0 25m2 plot and the total amount of 1 values was considered as a representative of each one fig 2 the roughness of the soil surface was determined in four 55 cm long adjacent transects located at the north south east and west of each plot using a 1 m long chain saleh 1993 the chain was carefully placed on the irregular soil surface and the roughness coefficient mm 1 was calculated as the total length of the chain distributed over a horizontal distance of 55cm soil samples 0 20mm were collected in points a few centimetres downslope from each study plot and soil water content was measured on a weight basis after drying samples 105 c 24h soil organic matter was determined by the walkley black method walkley and black 1934 bulk density was measured by the ring method 100cm3 for the 0 60mm soil layer 2 2 2 rainfall simulation procedures twenty five rainfall simulation experiments 7 shoulders 9 backslope 9 footslope were carried out using a rainfall intensity of 55mmh 1 for one hour on circular plots 0 55m in diameter 0 25m2 rainfall intensities about 55mmh 1 have a return period of 5 years elías castillo and ruiz beltrán 1979 more information about its calibration can be found in iserloh et al 2013a b in order to allow comparisons among plots all experiments were carried out during the summer drought when the soil moisture is low july 2015 at each plot runoff flow was collected at 1 min intervals and water volume was measured runoff coefficient was calculated as the percentage of rainfall water running out the circular plot runoff samples were desiccated and sediment yield was calculated on a weight basis in order to calculate soil loss per area and time during rainfall simulation experiments time to ponding time required for 50 of the surface to be ponded tp s time to runoff initiation tr s and time required by runoff to reach the outlet tro s were recorded tp was determined when ponds were found and tr when those ponds were communicated by the runoff tr tp tro tr and tro tp were also calculated because they indicate how the ponding is transformed into runoff and how much runoff in the soil surface last to reach the plot outlet 2 3 statistical analysis and initial soil erosion results mapping firstly environmental plot characteristics such as inclination the cover of rock fragments and vegetation roughness bulk density and antecedent soil moisture were depicted in box plots the mean dash lines and median values were also added and the results were represented between 5th and 95th percentiles fig 3 secondly hydrological responses and soil detachment are also included after calculating averages standard deviations the coefficient of variations maxima and minima then the results per hillslope position of hydrological responses and soil erosion were compared using the one way anova test equal variance and shapiro wilk tests were also conducted to check the normal distribution of the data all the data showed no normal distribution then the tukey test was used to find differences among hillslope positions shoulder backslope and footslope when significant differences were found a post hoc test was used the results of sediment concentration runoff coefficient and soil erosion rates were then mapped using proportional symbols with the software arcmap 10 5 esri usa finally to evaluate if some environmental factors are affecting the activation of soil erosion and runoff generation per hillslope position a spearman rank correlation was conducted using the software spss v 23 ibm usa this non parametric test was preferred instead of other ones e g pearson correlation because we observed that the results did not follow a linear trend moreover a principal component analysis pca was carried out for the whole dataset 25 rainfall simulations in order to reduce the factors in specific components that can explain the relationships among variables environmental plot characteristics and soil erosion results the kmo and bartlett s test for sphericity testing that the correlation matrix has an identity matrix and varimax rotation were selected to get the most accurate results for a maximum of three components 3 results 3 1 environmental plot characteristics the environmental plot characteristics with direct influence on runoff generation and soil detachment were depicted in fig 3 the highest total average inclination was 8 6 with maximum values of 10 in the shoulder in the backslope and footslope 7 9 and 3 1 were obtained respectively roughness reached average values of 1 14 1 11 and 1 09mmmm 1 in the shoulder backslope and footslope respectively the lowest bulk density values were found in the footslope reaching average values of 1 19gcm 3 on the other hand in the shoulder and backslope bulk density increased by 1 23 and 1 20 1 19gcm 3 respectively organic matter content registered the highest values in the footslope part of the hillslope 2 2 followed by the backslope 1 5 and shoulder 1 2 the same trend was found for the vegetation cover where the values increased from the footslope to the shoulder from 7 3 to 3 7 rock fragment content was 20 4 in the shoulder 15 5 in the backslope and 9 8 in the footslope 3 2 runoff generation hydrological response considering the time to ponding runoff generation and runoff in the outlet per hillslope position and the total study area were summarized in table 1 only statistically significant differences were found for tro tro tr and tro tp among hillslope positions tro reached the plot outlet after 606 641 4 and 668 9s in the shoulder backslope and footslope plots respectively those results were also reaffirmed with lower values of tro tr and tro tp because they showed that the runoff generation from the plot to the outlet was faster in the footslope plots than in the shoulder and backslope the rest of the hydrological descriptors showed no statistically significant differences among hillslope positions average tp was found after 166s in each slope position and tr was measured from 306 to 318s 3 3 soil detachment and slope position the final results of runoff coefficient sediment concentration and soil erosion were represented in maps of proportional symbols in figs 4 6 moreover average standard deviation the coefficient of variation maxima and minima were summarized per hillslope position and for the whole dataset in table 2 also statistically significant differences using the tukey test were calculated in the shoulder an average of 3 4l of runoff was collected and ranged from 2 7 to 3 9l the runoff coefficient averaged 24 7 with a maximum of 28 7 and a minimum of 19 9 average sediment concentration was 18 9gl 1 with a maximum of 24gl 1 and minimum of 15 5gl 1 the sediment yield sy and the soil erosion se1 and se2 averaged 64 1g 256 3gm 2 h 1 and 2 6mgha 1 h 1 respectively in the backslope an average of 3 6l of runoff was obtained the highest and lowest values reached 2 9 and 4 4l respectively 26 of the rainfall was collected as runoff with a maximum value of 32 and a minimum of 21 3 average sediment concentration obtained 23 3gl 1 with a maximum of 30 0gl 1 and minimum of 15 7gl 1 the sediment yield sy averaged 82 6g the soil erosion se1 and se2 obtained 330 6gm 2 h 1 and 3 3mgha 1 h 1 respectively average runoff was 3 3l in the footslope plots these values ranged from 3 0 to 4 0l average runoff coefficient obtained 23 7 the highest value of runoff coefficient ranged from 21 7 to 29 1 average sediment concentration showed 23 2gl 1 ranging from 16 8 to 33 0gl 1 the sediment yield sy and the soil erosion se1 and se2 averaged 74 9g 299 6gm 2 h 1 and 3 0mgha 1 h 1 respectively no statistically significant differences were found among slope positions after conducting the tukey test 3 4 statistical analysis spearman rank correlation was applied to determine the factors that most influenced soil losses and different hydrological responses per slope position and the whole dataset table 3 all performed correlations were conducted to find significant results at 0 01 and 0 05 in the whole dataset the analysis only showed significant correlations for tro time to the runoff in the outlet with an increase in slope 0 52 and rock fragments 0 43 and a decrease in organic matter 0 70 and vegetation cover 0 70 also the runoff coefficient registered a significant correlation with the rock fragments 0 45 these results also agree with the tukey test above performed where tro showed to be the unique different parameter among slope positions on the other hand per slope positions in the shoulder only between tro and organic matter 0 82 a significant positive correlation was noted finally the results obtained for the pca are presented in tables 4 and 5 using three components a total of 65 7 of the whole dataset could be explained amounting 37 7 14 7 and 13 3 the first second and third components respectively table 4 in general runoff and sediment yield could not be explained by any component specifically however we can observe as tro appeared involved with other factors into the first component with the slope 0 817 rock fragments 0 717 organic matter 0 888 vegetation cover 0 836 the second component has the runoff coefficient 0 748 and sediment yield 0 839 this indicates that when runoff increases also sediment yield is activated and increases finally in the third component the relative negative influence of the roughness 0 538 bulk density 0 764 on tp 0 678 was obtained 4 discussion the results of the experiments conducted at the celler del roure vineyard demonstrate that soil detachment and runoff generation can be evenly distributed along the hillslope and all parts of the study area and the individual plots contribute with runoff this means that there is not a pattern of the spatial distribution of the runoff generation the sediment detachment and the soil erosion as other authors confirmed in mediterranean sloping vineyards rodrigo comino et al 2017 a key issue in our research is that we did not find any natural factor that controls the initial soil erosion processes a third finding is the high erosion rates measured at the pedon scale the main reason for the high and even detachment of sediments and runoff rate could be the soil management system tillage conducted for millennia at the les alcusses valley due to the repeated tillage soils are disturbed by the tractor passes machinery and human trampling and the fact that the soil remains bare most of the year these results also agree with other investigations carried out in european vineyards under similar conventional soil management systems bagagiolo et al 2018 martínez casasnovas et al 2005 ruiz colmenero et al 2011 then we assume that the tillage homogenizes the soils and reduce the spatial variability such as previous research found arnaez et al 2007 ashraf et al 1999 similar findings were found recently in other regions of the world central europe lieskovský et al 2013 vrsic et al 2011 chinese loess plateau wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 ethiopia adimassu et al 2019 or the mediterranean novara et al 2018 our experiment set up followed previous experimental designs prepared correctly because the rainfall simulator was previously calibrated cerdà et al 2009 iserloh et al 2013a b and kinetical energy of the raindrops was according to the typical rainfall storms of the studied area cerdà 1997 some researchers are still working to fix the use of small round experimental plots because they affirm that they could not provide appropriate data on erosion and therefore some of the conclusions could become limited kinnell 2016 however as other authors also demonstrated the use of small circular plots can be a perfect tool to assess the activation of initial soil detachment and runoff avoiding loss of data using the most ideal scale that will also allow extrapolating the results to larger scales iserloh et al 2017 zemke 2017 however we logically agree that the experiments carried out in this paper cannot be directly extrapolated to conditions when a similar rain fell on the entire hillslope illustrative might be an analysis that bayabil et al 2017 performed in ethiopia where they looked at the relationship between soil loss and plot size and sediment yield it is obvious from this manuscript that erosion rates are directly related to plot size such as cerdà et al 2018 and bagarello et al 2018 recently demonstrated at the el teularet soil erosion and degradation experimental station essentially what is measured in small plot 8 1m2 by these authors that found some kind of sheet erosion when it is measured on larger plots sheet and rill erosion can occur and on a watershed scale deposition occurs as well also depending on the weather types that are able to generate different rainfall intensity and duration which are directly related to the soil erodibility nadal romero et al 2015 rodrigo comino et al 2019 this might be different than on the hillslope like in our research the use of a small portable rainfall simulators does not pretend to quantify the total soil and water losses of a specific area but the initial hydrological responses of specific hotspots that will allow understanding the potential hillslope dynamic arnaez et al 2007 grismer 2016 although the sediment detachment and the runoff generation are unevenly distributed the connectivity of the flows along the hillslope contributes to redistribute the soil particles from the upper to the lower part of the hillslope biddoccu et al 2017 cossart and fressard 2017 in this research we noted that the runoff coefficient was around 1 4 of the total rainfall under high intensity low frequency rainfall events such as the ones simulated here the sediment detached was 20gl 1 of runoff which results in almost 300gm2 h 1 previous research in the study area showed that the connectivity of the flows is restricted to few rainfall events as a consequence of the impact of the ridges formed under the vines by the tillage which disconnect the water and sediment flows along the slope rodrigo comino et al 2018 this confirms that our experiments show a rainfall event that can trigger runoff from all the parts of the slope such as our data shown at the pedon scale we observed that runoff and soil losses were similar for all the 25 research plots all of them produced surface wash and the sediment and water yield were very similar no plots showed a high infiltration rate our research demonstrates that under high intensity rainfall events the vineyards do not have sinks of water and sediments and all the farm could be a net contributor to the surface wash as the soil surface characteristics are very similar our measurements confirm that in agriculture lands the diversity is very low and the soil detachment and surface flow is similar in any part of the slope other authors found that the spatial distribution of the runoff and sediment detachment are mainly determined by the plant cover ben salem et al 2018 rock fragments follain et al 2012 quiquerez et al 2014 or hillslope angle camera et al 2018 rodrigo comino et al 2016 however in our research all three factors were not relevant after applying multivariate analysis techniques the vegetation cover was low the rock fragment cover was present in all the plots and the hillslope positions and the inclination angle did not show any key trend when plotted against soil or water yields in our rainfall simulation experiments the implications of our findings are that the millennia old tillage in vineyards results in the homogenization of soil detachment and that the hillslope position may not affect the surface wash these results demonstrate that the management in this vineyard using tillage is determined by three facts i the detachment is very high ii affect all the hillslope positions and iii that the spatial distribution is even these findings suggest that the current management of this vineyard is not sustainable due to the high detachment rate and the lack of sink areas that would reduce the runoff and sediment discharge at the hillslope and the watershed scales this issue is relevant to achieve the expected sustainable management that will contribute to accomplishing the sustainable management goals that the united nations are promoting caiado et al 2018 it is usual that at the spanish vineyard farms all the land is used to crop vines and there are no areas within the hillslope that is devoted to acting as sinks such as our research has shown thus here we would want to discuss the possible use of nature based solutions to develop proper agricultural management for example the use of grass strips could solve the problem of soil erosion rates in terraced vineyards such as in cereals was applied successfully dong et al 2018 kervroëdan et al 2018 grass strips increase diversity and reduce pollutants and soil losses janssen et al 2018 novara et al 2013 other solution could be the use of straw mulch in the inter row areas and close to the ridges because of its high efficiency to drastically reduce soil loss and runoff amounts gholami et al 2013 lucas borja et al 2018 other management that should be applied in agriculture lands is the use of sinks ponds in order to contribute to creating source areas of sediments and water for intense rainfall events this has been found as a good strategy in ethiopia where soil erosion is extremely high and the use of natural sediment sinks in a catchment reduces the sediment connectivity the sinks to reduce the soil erosion losses can be promoted with the use of intercropping wang et al 2015 or the use of catch crops lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 then the sinks are located in each row of vines and favour the reduction in the detachment of soil and the runoff generation the use of vegetation as a strategy to control soil erosion is part of the soil and water bioengineering approach that promotes the natural hazard control and the ecological restoration rey et al 2019 hedgerows could be also efficient structures in vineyards because of the use of the vegetation as a sink of runoff and sediments holden et al 2019 herbaceous hedges are a mix of grass strips and hedgerows and they could be efficient to control non sustainable erosion rates kervroëdan et al 2018 as they are measured at the mediterranean vineyards prosdocimi et al 2016 rodrigo comino 2018 in fact this is found in some parts of the celler del roure vineyards but they are reduced year after year to increase the area planted with vines our research suggests that farmers and policymakers should induce a reduction in the runoff and sediment yield this could be done with a general improvement of the soil quality and soil cover buchholz et al 2017 calleja cervantes et al 2015 the use of mulches can be a good strategy such as li et al 2019 found in steep slopes in china or abrantes et al 2018 observed under laboratory condition in portugal the use of natural soil components such as the vegetation and the rock fragment content are also efficient strategies that can reduce the soil losses lv et al 2018 however the cover of the soil by mulches or vegetation is not well accepted by the farmers such as previous research demonstrated marques et al 2015 sastre et al 2016 this is why the use of ponds and grass strips or hedgerows can be better accepted by the farmers this research confirms that the high runoff rates and high erosion rates are a consequence of the bare soils that use to be preferred by the farmers in the mediterranean region this also shows high connectivity as all the soils yield water and sediments do not find obstacles sinks when high intensity low frequency rainfall event takes place as it was also demonstrated in france using the graph theory tool fressard and cossart 2019 the investigations of rodrigo comino et al 2018 in this area demonstrated that the ridges generated by the tillage underneath the vine rows can act as a barrier to reduce the connectivity of the flows however under intense rainfall event the surface wash is well connected and due to the lack of any sink the flows will be very efficient similar results were found by lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 in aragón or bagagiolo et al 2018 in italian sloping vineyards we propose that agricultural lands should have sink areas such as rangelands wetlands ponds meadows or vegetation strips where the surface wash deposit the water and sediments and also the pollutants and seeds this as a nature based solution could contribute to reduction of land degradation and achievement of the desertification neutrality pacheco et al 2018 at the studied vineyards the tillage following the contour lines vine rows resulted in ridges underneath the vines and they work as sinks as they favour the reduction in the detachment of soil and the runoff generation rodrigo comino et al 2018 5 conclusions our results confirmed that soil detachment and runoff generation can be high and uneven in mediterranean sloping vineyards with bare soils and managed by tillage the measurements performed with simulated rainfalls under high intensity low frequency rainfall events demonstrated that the hillslope position does not affect soil detachment and runoff rates the impact of human activity in the form of tillage and bare soil surfaces highly affects water discharges and soil erosion in comparison to other research natural factors were not found relevant to understand and foresee the soil erosion spatial distribution therefore we state that there is an urgent need to apply strategies to reduce soil losses in vineyards for this study case we strongly propose the use of hedgerows ponds and grass strips that will act as sinks and they will increase the spatial variability of the hydrological and erosional response along the slope conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research
