1030,precocious breeding is a major challenge in the culturing of coptodon rendalli laboratory experiments were undertaken to evaluate the biological control potential of two predatory aquatic insects anisops debilis and gerris swakopensis against tilapia fry the functional response of these insects was determined at different prey densities during a 24 hr experiment a debilis and g swakopensis exhibited type iii and type ii functional responses respectively the attack rate 2 2046 was higher in a debilis than g swakopensis 0 00239 handling time was lower in a debilis 0 5420 than g swakopensis 1 6153 another experiment was done at different prey densities under light and dark conditions anisops debilis exhibited a type ii functional response under light conditions and a type iii functional response under dark conditions the attack rate of a debilis declined from 2 5950 under light conditions to 1 2372 under dark conditions the handling time for a debilis was lower under dark conditions than under light conditions g swakopensis maintained a type ii functional response under light and dark conditions the attack rate for g swakopensis increased under dark conditions while the handling time declined the relative control potential rcp was also calculated the rcps for the 24 hrs experiment light and dark conditions were 4 7941 5 4431 and 3 5622 respectively this probably indicates that a debilis may be effective in controlling tilapia fry keywords attack rate fish handling time insects predator 1 introduction one of the major challenges besetting the culture of tilapias is precocious breeding singh et al 2017 this is the tendency of tilapias to reproduce at a very small size resulting in overcrowding in fish ponds it is this tendency that has led to tilapias to be classified as pests in australia koehn and mackenzie 2004 russell et al 2012 however in africa and asia tilapias are an important fish food and are thus widely cultured the most widely cultured species are oreochromis niloticus oreochromis mossambicus and coptodon rendalli all these species experience precocious breeding despite their high aquaculture potential it is important to prevent overcrowding in tilapia fish ponds so that the fish can grow to marketable size the marketable size for tilapias is 200 g but their growth is stunted when precocious breeding occurs and only grow up to 60 g as they channel their energy towards breeding rather than growth one of the methods that has been suggested to control overcrowding due to precocious breeding in tilapias is the use of predators it has been reported that some predatory aquatic insects feed on fish fry tomazelli et al 2016 however there is scanty information on the use of predatory aquatic insects in the biological control of tilapia fry anisops debilis heteroptera notonectidae and gerris swakopensis hemiptera gerridae are two predatory aquatic insects that are cosmopolitan and widely distributed in south africa rapatsa and moyo 2013 the potential of these two predatory insects for biological control of tilapia fry has not been evaluated before anisops debilis commonly known as backswimmers are voracious predators papacek 2001 they have a broad diet and attack anything that is moving in the water giller 1986 stream 1992 thus their diet is cosmopolitan the habitat of tilapia fry in fish ponds overlaps with that of backswimmers tilapia fry feeds at the surface and midwater lowe mcconnel 2000 khan et al 2016 it is thus prudent to investigate if a debilis can be effective in controlling tilapia fry since there is habitat overlap between tilapia fry and a debilis another potential biocontrol agent is gerris swakopensis gerris swakopensis are found on the water surface and have long hydrophobic legs that help them stay above water william feltmate 1992 they feed on terrestrial insects that fall on the surface and aquatic organisms that come to the surface william feltmate 1992 tilapia fry come to the surface to feed on algae and they may be vulnerable to attack by g swakopensis a first step in evaluating the biological control potential of an organism is undertaking functional response studies in the laboratory simulation of field conditions in the laboratory has its own limitations however the functional response experiments give useful insight on predator prey interactions the form of the predator s functional response has important implications for prey populations because the functional response of the predator describes the rate at which a predator kills its prey at different prey densities this therefore determines the efficiency of a predator in regulating prey populations murdock oaten 1975 gross et al 2004 mccann et al 2005 for example the backswimmer buenoa fuscipennis heteroptera notonectidae regulated the population of mosquito immature stages fisher et al 2013 a plot of the number of prey killed against the number available gives three different types of curves the functional response curves can be an increasing linear relationship type i a deaccelerating curve type ii or a sigmoid curve type iii holling 1959 the type of curve predator handling time and attack rate were used to determine predator efficiency of a debilis and g swakopensis type i ii and iii are all classic prey dependent models that all assume the predation rate is a function of prey density only recent studies have shown that although prey density is an important factor in functional responses there are other factors at play weterings et al 2015 light is one factor that has a significant effect on predation within freshwater communities gergs et al 2011 tilapias are diurnal feeders and it is thus important to look at the functional response of a debilis and g swakopensis during the day and at night in cooperation of light in functional response experiments will improve the accuracy of the models it was therefore deemed important in this study to investigate the functional response of a debilis and g swakopensis during the night and during the day although functional response is an important first step it however only assesses per capita impacts and the main challenge is that the predation efficiency of predators against prey is limited when only per capita impacts are considered cuthbert et al 2018 recently developed the relative control potential rcp metric that uses per capita and consumer population responses to compare efficacy among biological control agents the functional response data was used to determine the rcp in this study the objectives in this study are i to determine the functional response of a debilis and g swakopensis consuming tilapia fry under 24 hrs regime light and dark conditions and ii to compare the biological control efficacy of a debilis and g swakopensis 2 materials and methods the study was conducted at the aquaculture research unit university of limpopo south africa 2 1 fry rearing two fibre glass tanks 1 5 0 5 0 6 m were used for the rearing of fry the bottom of the tanks was lined with sand and gravel stones as substrate water temperature was kept constant at 27 c using thermostatic immersion heaters dissolved oxygen was between 6 9 mg l ph ranged between 7 and 8 and photoperiod was natural brood stock coptodon rendalli was stocked in the tanks at a sex ratio of 1 3 male to females females were stocked at a weight of 220 g and males at 250 g fish were fed 5 of their body weight twice a day the breeding experiment ran for 3 weeks before the eggs hatched five days after egg hatching the fry were collected from the tanks using hand nets the average total length of tilapia fry was 4 mm fry were taken to the laboratory in buckets filled with water from the tanks they were reared in water was kept aerated using stone aerators 2 2 production and collection of predator species three outdoors aquadams 1 m high and 3 m diameter were filled with aged tap water and allowed to stand for a week before application of chicken manure the chicken manure was collected from a local small scale farm and ground into a fine powder after sun drying the aquadams were fertilized after two weeks at an application rate of 0 26 kg m2 week the manure was applied to increase the nutrient levels in the aquadams and thus increase the abundance of predatory insects gerridae and notonectidae were collected from the aquadams they were collected using scoop nets 80 Âµm mesh and taken to the laboratory the insects were measured and notonectidae with length 10 mm and gerridae with length 15 mm were selected for the experiment these sizes represented the adult stage of both notonectidae and gerridae the insects were identified to species level gerridae was identified as gerris swakopensis and notonectidae was identified as anisops debilis 2 3 experimental design functional response experiments were undertaken in the laboratory at a temperature of 27 c the experiments were done in circular plastic containers filled to capacity with 300 ml of water taken from tanks where fry was collected the plastic containers were all covered with plastic lids punched with holes to facilitate aeration the containers were covered to prevent both predator and prey from escaping ten replicates of prey densities 10 20 40 80 and 160 were assigned to containers in a completely randomized design and a single predator a debilis was allocated to each container randomly the stocking densities were deemed appropriate based on previous studies from our laboratory rapatsa 2016 anisops debilis were exposed to fry for 24 hours and then starved for 12 hours to standardize their hunger level before releasing them to the plastic containers the controls for each treatment were not allocated predators this was done to ensure that experimental conditions were adequate for survival of fry this experiment lasted for 24 hrs and the photoperiod was natural after 24 hrs the predator was removed and remaining prey were counted and the difference from the initial number was considered as the number of prey consumed the same procedure was followed using g swakopensis as a predator 2 4 light and dark regime experiments for day time light regime functional response experiment a single a debilis was allowed to forage at five prey densities 4 8 16 32 and 64 from 09 00 hrs to 18 00 hrs in plastic containers mentioned above this was done in the laboratory as in the previous 24 hr experiment the experiment was replicated 10 times and there were controls at each stocking density without a debilis the same experimental procedure was done using g swakopensis to examine functional responses at night time dark regime the same procedure as day time experiments was followed except that the experiment was run at night 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 functional response analysis the type of functional response was assessed using juliano 2001 s method this model takes into consideration the proportion of prey eaten ne n0 as a proportion of prey offered n0 the data were fitted to a polynomial function given below that describes the relationship between ne n0 and n0 n e n 0 e x p p 0 p 1 n 0 p 2 n 0 2 p 3 n 0 3 1 e x p p 0 p 1 n 0 p 2 n 0 2 p 3 n 0 3 where ne number of consumed prey n0 number of initial prey individuals ne n0 probability of a prey being consumed p0 intercept p1 linear coefficient p2 quadratic coefficient p3 cubic coefficient p0 p1 p2 and p3 are parameters estimated by the model and they are maximum likelihood estimates p0 is the intercept p1 is linear p2 is quadratic and p3 is cubic coefficient they were estimated using catmod procedure in sas software sas institute inc 2009 proc catmod uses maximum likelihood estimation of parameters for log linear models and the analysis of generalized logits weighted least squares estimation of parameter for a wide range of general linear models identification of the type of functional response was done by examining the signs of the p1 and p2 and also the significance of coefficients a negative linear parameter p1 indicates a type ii functional response a positive linear parameter p1 together with a negative quadratic parameter p2 indicates a type iii functional response juliano 2001 once the type of functional response was identified the functional response parameters handling time and attack rate were estimated by means of non linear least square regression using the formulas n e n 0 1 exp a t h n e t for type ii where ne number of prey eaten n0 initial number of prey a attack rate th handling time t total time available n e n 0 1 e x p d b n 0 t h n e t 1 c n 0 for type iii where a d bn0 1 cn0 b c and d fitted constants a t test was used to determine if there were significant differences in the consumption rate of prey by predatory insects under light and dark conditions the t test analysis was done using statistical package and service solutions ibm spss version 20 the effectiveness of a debilis and g swakopensis as biological control agents was predicted by calculating relative control potential rcp which is defined by cuthbert et al 2018 as rcp fr agent a fr agent b ab agent a ab agent b where fr is maximum feeding rate reciprocal of handling time and ab a measure of predator field abundance the field abundance data was obtained from rapatsa moyo 2015 an rcp value greater than 1 indicates that agent a a debilis has greater control efficacy than agent b g swakopensis and rcp 1 indicates that agent b has a higher control efficacy than agent a an rcp 1 indicates that there is no difference between agent a and agent b 3 results anisops debilis consumed significantly p 0 05 t test more fry than g swakopensis during the 24 hrs experiment fig 1 the number of tilapia fry consumed by a debilis initially increased with prey density before reaching an asymptote fig 1 however for g swakopensis the number of tilapia fry consumed increased with prey density but did not reach an asymptote fig 1 under the light regime the functional response of a debilis also increased with prey density until it reached an upper asymptote before declining fig 2 the functional response of g swakopensis was the same under light regime as in the 24 hrs regime fig 1 fig 2 during the dark regime a debilis s functional response also increased with prey density before reaching an asymptote fig 3 the functional response of g swakopensis increased with prey density before reaching an asymptote fig 3 the proportion of prey consumed by a debilis declined with increasing prey density during the 24 hrs period fig 4 this is contrary to g swakopensis which showed an increase in the proportion of prey consumed with high prey density fig 4 under the light regime the proportion of prey consumed by a debilis also declined as prey density increased fig 5 the proportion of prey consumed by g swakopensis increased with increasing in prey density fig 5 during the dark regime the proportion of prey consumed by a debilis again declined as prey density increased fig 6 the proportion of prey consumed by g swakopensis increased with prey density under the dark regime anisops debilis consumed more tilapia fry under light conditions than under dark conditions and there was a significant difference p 0 05 t test between the different regimes there was no significant difference p 0 05 t test between the proportion of prey consumed by g swakopensis between light or dark although more fry were consumed under the dark regime fig 5 fig 6 anisops debilis showed a type iii functional response during the 24 hrs period experiment table 1 because results from logistic regression and log likelihood ratio tests showed that linear parameters were positive whereas the quadratic parameters were negative table 1 anisops debilis also showed an estimated attack rate higher and handling time lower than that of g swakopensis table 2 g swakopensis showed a type ii functional response table 1 because the results from logistic regression and log likelihood ratio analysis showed that linear parameters were negative the estimated attack rate of g swakopensis was lower and handling time higher than that of a debilis table 2 both a debilis and g swakopensis showed a type ii functional response under light conditions table 3 g swakopensis had lower attacking rate and higher handling time than a debilis table 4 anisops debilis showed a type iii functional response while gerris swakopensis showed a type ii functional response table 5 under dark conditions anisops debilis still showed a higher attack rate and lower handling time than g swakopensis table 6 under dark conditions the relative control potential during the 24 hr experiment was 4 7941 fig 7 under light conditions rcp increased to 5 4431 however under dark conditions the rcp decreased to 3 5622 fig 7 4 discussion anisops debilis exhibited a type iii functional response during the 24 hrs experiment whereas g swakopensis exhibited type ii functional response during a similar experiment only a few predators exhibiting type ii functional response have been successfully used to control prey populations hughes et al 1992 fernandez arhex and corley 2003 modal et al 2017 sugawara et al 2018 thus during the 24 hrs experiment g swakopensis did not appear to be effective in controlling tilapia fry unlike a debilis which exhibited a type iii functional response the attack rate and handling time were the parameters used to determine the extent of functional responses the handling time was much smaller in a debilis than g swakopensis handling time is normally a good indicator of the consumption rate as it reflects the accumulative effect of time taken during capturing killing subduing and digesting prey veeravel and baskaran 1997 anisops debilis had a handling time almost three times shorter than g swakopensis the difference in the handling time between a debilis and g swakopensis is probably explained by the different feeding habits in these two predatory insect groups anisops debilis use their raptorial fore legs to subdue and then inject enzymes into the prey before sucking gerris swakopensis do not have specialized appendages to subdue prey they use the proboscis to inject enzymes into the prey furthermore a debilis can handle fry at the water surface and in midwater efficiently on the other hand g swakopensis can only handle fry at the water surface the attack rate between a debilis and g swakopensis was equally different the attack rate in g swakopensis during the 24 hrs experiment was 0 00239 compared to 2 2046 in a debilis which was 900 times more efficient at attacking tilapia fry than g swakopensis on average a debilis killed 19 fry compared to 3 killed by g swakopensis these differences in the attack rate and consumption rate can again be explained by the efficient feeding apparatus in a debilis anisops debilis have always been reputed as very aggressive predators that attack aquatic invertebrates fish larvae and amphibian tadpoles cooper 1983 giller 1986 muiruri et al 2013 although both g swakopensis and a debilis exhibited a type ii functional response under light conditions the attack rate was much higher in a debilis than g swakopensis handling time was higher in g swakopensis than a debilis under light conditions mean consumption was 1 fry under light conditions for g swakopensis compared to 13 for a debilis these results again show that a debilis is a more efficient predator than g swakopensis under light conditions zalom 1978 reported that vision played a role in prey detection in notonectidae this was however contradicted by scott and murdoch 1983 anddieguez and gilbert 2003 who observed differences in anisops species predation during the day and during the night our results are in agreement with zalom 1978 because under dark conditions the attack rate declined by 52 in a debilis since tilapias are diurnal feeders a debilis will be effective at controlling the tilapia fry since they feed during the day the attack rate in g swakopensis increased by 96 22 under dark conditions the handling time was much lower under dark conditions than under light conditions this suggests that mechanoreception plays an important role in the feeding of g swakopensis since tilapia fry are diurnal feeders g swakopensis will not be effective at preying on the fry because the fry will be sedentary during the night the relative control potential rcp is a comparative ratio between potential biocontrol agents the rcp was greater than 1 in all the experiments this indicates that a debilis may be effective in controlling fry populations cuthbert et al 2018 do not give a scale that measures the efficacy of biocontrol agents but indicate that rcp values greater 1 are indicative of high relative control efficacy in this study the rcp values declined from 5 4431 during the day to 3 5622 at night based on these rcp values it appears that a debilis may be more effective in controlling fry populations during the day than at night this is consistent with our previous observations under the 24 hr light and dark experimental regimes the use of insects as biocontrol agents against tilapia fry in overcrowded fish ponds has largely been ignored however this simple technology may be useful in rural fish farming communities who do not have access to sex reversal techniques that alleviate the problem of precocious breeding although functional response experiments undertaken in this study may not reflect the complex dynamics that takes place in a fish pond it is however a significant first step that shows the potential of a debilis in controlling tilapia fry populations it is recommended that field trials be undertaken to determine the effectiveness of a debilis in controlling tilapia fry populations declaration of

1030,precocious breeding is a major challenge in the culturing of coptodon rendalli laboratory experiments were undertaken to evaluate the biological control potential of two predatory aquatic insects anisops debilis and gerris swakopensis against tilapia fry the functional response of these insects was determined at different prey densities during a 24 hr experiment a debilis and g swakopensis exhibited type iii and type ii functional responses respectively the attack rate 2 2046 was higher in a debilis than g swakopensis 0 00239 handling time was lower in a debilis 0 5420 than g swakopensis 1 6153 another experiment was done at different prey densities under light and dark conditions anisops debilis exhibited a type ii functional response under light conditions and a type iii functional response under dark conditions the attack rate of a debilis declined from 2 5950 under light conditions to 1 2372 under dark conditions the handling time for a debilis was lower under dark conditions than under light conditions g swakopensis maintained a type ii functional response under light and dark conditions the attack rate for g swakopensis increased under dark conditions while the handling time declined the relative control potential rcp was also calculated the rcps for the 24 hrs experiment light and dark conditions were 4 7941 5 4431 and 3 5622 respectively this probably indicates that a debilis may be effective in controlling tilapia fry keywords attack rate fish handling time insects predator 1 introduction one of the major challenges besetting the culture of tilapias is precocious breeding singh et al 2017 this is the tendency of tilapias to reproduce at a very small size resulting in overcrowding in fish ponds it is this tendency that has led to tilapias to be classified as pests in australia koehn and mackenzie 2004 russell et al 2012 however in africa and asia tilapias are an important fish food and are thus widely cultured the most widely cultured species are oreochromis niloticus oreochromis mossambicus and coptodon rendalli all these species experience precocious breeding despite their high aquaculture potential it is important to prevent overcrowding in tilapia fish ponds so that the fish can grow to marketable size the marketable size for tilapias is 200 g but their growth is stunted when precocious breeding occurs and only grow up to 60 g as they channel their energy towards breeding rather than growth one of the methods that has been suggested to control overcrowding due to precocious breeding in tilapias is the use of predators it has been reported that some predatory aquatic insects feed on fish fry tomazelli et al 2016 however there is scanty information on the use of predatory aquatic insects in the biological

legs that help them stay above water william feltmate 1992 they feed on terrestrial insects that fall on the surface and aquatic organisms that come to the surface william feltmate 1992 tilapia fry come to the surface to feed on algae and they may be vulnerable to attack by g swakopensis a first step in evaluating the biological control potential of an organism is undertaking functional response studies in the laboratory simulation of field conditions in the laboratory has its own limitations however the functional response experiments give useful insight on predator prey interactions the form of the predator s functional response has important implications for prey populations because the functional response of the predator describes the rate at which a predator kills its prey at different prey densities this therefore determines the efficiency of a predator in regulating prey populations murdock oaten 1975 gross et al 2004 mccann et al 2005 for example the backswimmer buenoa

investigate the functional response of a debilis and g swakopensis during the night and during the day although functional response is an important first step it however only assesses per capita impacts and the main challenge is that the predation efficiency of predators against prey is limited when only per capita impacts are considered cuthbert et al 2018 recently developed the relative control potential rcp metric that uses per capita and consumer population responses to compare efficacy among biological control agents the functional response data was used to determine the rcp in this study the objectives in this study are i to determine the functional response of a debilis and g swakopensis consuming tilapia fry under 24 hrs regime light and dark conditions and ii to compare the biological control efficacy of a debilis and g swakopensis 2 materials and methods the study was conducted at the aquaculture research unit university of limpopo south africa 2 1 fry rearing two fibre glass tanks 1 5 0 5 0 6 m were used for the rearing of fry the bottom of the tanks was lined with sand and gravel stones as substrate water temperature was kept constant at 27 c using thermostatic immersion heaters dissolved oxygen was between 6 9 mg l ph ranged between 7 and 8 and photoperiod was natural brood stock coptodon rendalli was stocked in the tanks at a sex ratio of 1 3 male to females females were stocked at a weight of 220 g and males at 250 g fish were fed 5 of their body weight twice a day the breeding experiment ran for 3 weeks before the eggs hatched five days after egg hatching the fry were collected from the tanks using hand nets the average total length of tilapia fry was 4 mm fry were taken to the laboratory in buckets filled with water from the tanks they were reared in water was kept aerated using stone aerators 2 2 production and collection of predator species three outdoors aquadams 1 m high and 3 m diameter were filled with aged tap water and allowed to stand for a week before application of chicken manure the chicken manure was collected from a local small scale farm and ground into a fine powder after sun drying the aquadams were fertilized after two weeks at an application rate of 0 26 kg m2 week the manure was applied to increase the nutrient levels in the aquadams and thus increase the abundance of predatory insects gerridae and notonectidae were collected from the aquadams they were collected using scoop nets 80 Âµm mesh and taken to the laboratory the insects were measured and notonectidae with length 10 mm and gerridae with length 15 mm were selected for the experiment these sizes represented the adult stage of both notonectidae and gerridae the insects were identified to species level gerridae was identified as gerris swakopensis and notonectidae was identified as anisops debilis 2 3 experimental design functional response experiments were undertaken in the laboratory at a temperature of 27 c the experiments were done in circular plastic containers filled to capacity with 300 ml of water taken from tanks where fry was collected the plastic containers were all covered with plastic lids punched with holes to facilitate aeration the containers were covered to prevent both predator and prey from escaping ten replicates of prey densities 10 20 40 80 and 160 were assigned to containers in a completely randomized design and a single predator a debilis was allocated to each container randomly the stocking densities were deemed appropriate based on previous studies from our laboratory rapatsa 2016 anisops debilis were exposed to fry for 24 hours and then starved for 12 hours to standardize their hunger level before releasing them to the plastic containers the controls for each treatment were not allocated predators this was done to ensure that experimental conditions were adequate for survival of fry this experiment lasted for 24 hrs and the photoperiod was natural after 24 hrs the predator was removed and remaining prey were counted and the difference from the initial number was considered as the number of prey consumed the same procedure was followed using g swakopensis as a predator 2 4 light and dark regime experiments for day time light regime functional response experiment a single a debilis was allowed to forage at five prey densities 4 8 16 32 and 64 from 09 00 hrs to 18 00 hrs in plastic containers mentioned above this was done in the laboratory as in the previous 24 hr experiment the experiment was replicated 10 times and there were controls at each stocking density without a debilis the same experimental procedure was done using g swakopensis to examine functional responses at night time dark regime the same procedure as day time experiments was followed except that the experiment was run at night 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 functional response analysis the type of functional response was assessed using juliano 2001 s method this

of parameters for log linear models and the analysis of generalized logits weighted least squares estimation of parameter for a wide range of general linear models identification of the type of functional response was done by examining the signs of the p1 and p2 and also the significance of coefficients a negative linear parameter p1 indicates a type ii functional response a positive linear parameter p1 together with a negative quadratic parameter p2 indicates a type iii functional response juliano 2001 once the type of functional response was identified the functional response

determine if there were significant differences in the consumption rate of prey by predatory insects under light and dark conditions the t test analysis was done using statistical package and service solutions ibm spss version 20 the effectiveness of a debilis and g swakopensis as biological control agents was predicted by calculating relative control potential rcp which is defined by cuthbert et al 2018 as rcp fr agent a fr agent b ab agent a ab agent b where fr is maximum feeding rate reciprocal of handling time and ab a measure of predator field abundance the field abundance data was obtained from rapatsa moyo 2015 an rcp value greater than 1 indicates that agent a a debilis has greater control efficacy than agent b g swakopensis and rcp 1 indicates that agent b has a higher control efficacy than agent a an rcp 1 indicates that there is no difference between agent a and agent b 3 results anisops debilis consumed significantly p 0 05 t test more fry than g swakopensis during the 24 hrs experiment fig 1 the number of tilapia fry consumed by a debilis initially increased with prey density before reaching an asymptote fig 1 however for g swakopensis the number of tilapia fry consumed increased with prey density but did not reach an asymptote fig 1 under the light regime the functional response of a debilis also increased with prey density until it reached an upper asymptote before declining fig 2 the functional response of g swakopensis was the same under light regime as in the 24 hrs regime fig 1 fig 2 during the dark regime a debilis s functional response also increased with prey density before reaching an asymptote fig 3 the functional response of g swakopensis increased with prey density before reaching an asymptote fig 3 the proportion of prey consumed by a debilis declined with increasing prey density during the 24 hrs period fig 4 this is contrary to g swakopensis which showed an increase in the proportion of prey consumed with high prey density fig 4 under the light regime the proportion of prey consumed by a debilis also declined as prey density increased fig 5 the proportion of prey consumed by g swakopensis increased with increasing in prey density fig 5 during the dark regime the proportion of prey consumed by a debilis again declined as prey density increased fig 6 the proportion of prey consumed by g swakopensis increased with prey density under the dark regime anisops debilis consumed more tilapia fry under light conditions than under dark conditions and there was a significant difference p 0 05 t test between the different regimes there was no significant difference p 0 05 t test between the proportion of prey consumed by g swakopensis between light or dark although more fry were consumed under the dark regime fig 5 fig 6 anisops debilis showed a type iii functional response during the 24 hrs period experiment table 1 because results from logistic regression and log likelihood ratio tests showed that linear parameters were positive whereas the quadratic parameters were negative table 1 anisops debilis also showed an estimated attack rate higher and handling time lower than that of g swakopensis table 2 g swakopensis showed a type ii functional response table 1 because the results from logistic regression and log likelihood ratio analysis showed that linear parameters were negative the estimated attack rate of g swakopensis was lower and handling time higher than that of a debilis table 2 both a debilis and g swakopensis showed a type ii functional response under light conditions table 3 g swakopensis had lower attacking rate and higher handling time than a debilis table 4 anisops debilis showed a type iii functional response while gerris swakopensis showed a type ii functional response table 5 under dark conditions anisops debilis still showed a higher attack rate and lower handling time than g swakopensis table 6 under dark conditions the relative control potential during the 24 hr experiment was 4 7941 fig 7 under light conditions rcp increased to 5 4431 however under dark conditions the rcp decreased to 3 5622 fig 7 4 discussion anisops debilis exhibited a type iii functional response during the 24 hrs experiment whereas g swakopensis exhibited type ii functional response during a similar experiment only a few predators exhibiting type ii functional response have been successfully used to control prey populations hughes et al 1992 fernandez arhex and corley 2003 modal et al 2017 sugawara et al 2018 thus during the 24 hrs experiment g swakopensis did not appear to be effective in controlling tilapia fry unlike a debilis which exhibited a type iii functional response the attack rate and handling time were the parameters used to determine the extent of functional responses the handling time was much smaller in a debilis than g swakopensis handling time is normally a good indicator of the consumption rate as it reflects the accumulative effect of time taken during capturing killing subduing and digesting prey veeravel and baskaran 1997 anisops debilis had a handling time almost three times shorter than g swakopensis the difference in the handling time between a debilis and g swakopensis is probably explained by the different feeding habits in these two predatory insect groups anisops debilis use their raptorial fore legs to subdue and then inject enzymes into the prey before sucking gerris swakopensis do not have specialized appendages to subdue prey they use the proboscis to inject enzymes into the prey furthermore a debilis can handle fry at the water surface and in midwater efficiently on the other hand g swakopensis can only handle fry at the water surface the attack rate between a debilis and g swakopensis was equally different the attack rate in g swakopensis during the 24 hrs experiment was 0 00239 compared to 2 2046 in a debilis which was 900 times more efficient at attacking tilapia fry than g swakopensis on average a debilis killed 19 fry compared to 3 killed by g swakopensis these differences in the attack rate and consumption rate can again be explained by the efficient feeding apparatus in a debilis anisops debilis have always been reputed as very aggressive predators that attack aquatic invertebrates fish larvae and amphibian tadpoles cooper 1983 giller 1986 muiruri et al 2013 although both g swakopensis and a debilis exhibited a type ii functional response under light conditions the attack rate was much higher in a debilis than g swakopensis handling time was higher in g swakopensis than a debilis under light conditions mean consumption was 1 fry under light conditions for g swakopensis compared to 13 for a debilis these results again show that a debilis is a more efficient predator than g swakopensis under light conditions zalom 1978 reported that vision played a role in prey detection in notonectidae this was however contradicted by scott and murdoch 1983 anddieguez and gilbert 2003 who observed differences in anisops species predation during the day and during the night our results are in agreement with zalom 1978 because under dark conditions the attack rate declined by 52 in a debilis since tilapias are diurnal feeders a debilis will be effective at controlling the tilapia fry since they feed during the day the attack rate in g swakopensis increased by 96 22 under dark conditions the handling time was much lower under dark conditions than under light conditions this suggests that mechanoreception plays an important role in the feeding of g swakopensis since tilapia fry are diurnal feeders g swakopensis will not be effective at preying on the fry because the fry will be sedentary during the night the relative control potential rcp is a comparative ratio between potential biocontrol agents the rcp was greater than 1 in all the experiments this indicates that a debilis may be effective in controlling fry populations cuthbert et al 2018 do not give a scale that measures the efficacy of biocontrol agents but indicate that rcp values greater 1 are indicative of high relative control efficacy in this study the rcp values declined from 5 4431 during the day to 3 5622 at night based on these rcp values it appears that a debilis may be more effective in controlling fry populations during the day than at night this is consistent with our previous observations under the 24 hr light and dark experimental regimes the use of insects as biocontrol agents against tilapia fry in overcrowded fish ponds has largely been ignored however this simple technology may be useful in rural fish farming communities who do not have access to sex reversal techniques that alleviate the problem of precocious breeding although functional response experiments undertaken in this study may not reflect the complex dynamics that takes place in a fish pond it is however a significant first step that shows the potential of a debilis in controlling tilapia fry populations it is recommended that field trials be undertaken to determine the effectiveness of a debilis in controlling tilapia fry populations declaration of

1031,water quality tools are necessary to control and prevent eutrophication in reservoirs particularly reservoirs with aquaculture cages because these lead to nutrient loads from fish food a combined bioenergetic and water quality model was implemented in this study to assess the contribution of aquaculture activity to algal growth in el paÃ±e reservoir peru in addition to its complexity four different algal groups chlorophyta cyanobacteria chrysophyta and cryptophyta were modeled according to their dominance in the water column of el paÃ±e reservoir moderately reasonable distribution plots of chlorophyll a were obtained when calibrating the model despite data scarcity and low r2 values 0 04 in the intermediate zone and 0 16 in the dam zone of the reservoir six scenarios of annual aquaculture production were analyzed and the scenario with an annual fish production of 100 000 kg increased cyanobacteria blooms to a dangerous level furthermore the results indicate that an annual aquaculture production of 36 000 kg still requires careful consideration in terms of its impact on the water quality of el paÃ±e reservoir keywords eutrophication bioenergetic reservoir aquaculture water quality 1 introduction global human population growth has increased the demand for fish as a food resource fao 2018 2016a peru has the highest average annual per capita consumption of fish in latin america fao 2016b and aquaculture development is important for the economic and nutritional sustenance of andean peruvian areas an increase in aquaculture activities is expected according to the peruvian national aquaculture plan produce 2010 which may impact the water quality of lakes and reservoirs as a result of the increased nutrient loads that could lead to different states of eutrophication for example as has occurred in el paÃ±e reservoir peru mamani larico and zÃºÃ±iga medina 2019 although several bioenergetic models have been proposed to estimate the fish feeding rate and nutrient waste load azevedo et al 2011 bureau et al 2011 cho and bureau 1998 papatryphon et al 2005 stigebrandt 1999 few studies have linked a bioenergetic model to a water quality model for management purposes canale and chapra 2016 dalyander and cerco 2010 mckillip 2008 there has been evidence of algal blooms reported by the local population in el paÃ±e reservoir which has caused the death of animals autodema 2012 in september 2014 ana 2014 the citizens of arequipa reported particular organoleptic alterations such as smell and taste in drinking water which suggested an abundance of cyanobacteria cyanobacterial blooms are one of the most obvious indications of eutrophication salazar torres et al 2016 according to schreurs 1992 a long term dominance of filamentous cyanobacteria species is related to a shallow lake depth while colony forming species are more commonly dominant in deeper lakes dolichospermum cf circinale a filamentous cyanobacteria is the seasonally dominant species in el paÃ±e reservoir autodema 2019 the reports in september 2014 led to an extensive sampling campaign which determined that a large part of the hydraulic system of the chili basin which includes el paÃ±e reservoir and provides water resources to the arequipa region was experiencing eutrophication ana 2014 the phytoplankton of many lakes especially those of higher trophic levels are dominated by large colony forming species of cyanobacteria formerly referred to as blue green algae such as microcystis planktothrix limnothrix anabaena dolichospermum and aphanizomenon dokulil and teubner 2000 signs of eutrophication have been observed in the upper basin of el paÃ±e reservoir where the only activities near the reservoir are livestock and aquaculture ana 2012 however specific sources of eutrophication have not been identified ana 2014 accordingly both of these activities need to be quantified to assess their impacts on the water quality of the reservoir in order to ensure their sustainable development in consideration of the different water uses for livestock and human consumption the aquaculture activity in el paÃ±e reservoir has prospered and the consequences for the nutrient balance and proliferation of algae have not yet been determined a previous study mamani larico and zÃºÃ±iga medina 2019 highlighted the need to use bioenergetic models to estimate the nutrient loads associated with aquaculture identifying the impact of aquaculture activities on a waterbody is necessary to establish control mitigation measures to guarantee the development of such activities and to ensure an adequate raw water quality for the intended purpose of the water in this study a combined bioenergetic and water quality model was used to assess the contribution of aquaculture activity to algal growth in el paÃ±e reservoir in consideration of the potential future increase in aquaculture activity 2 study area and data sources el paÃ±e reservoir is located in the southern peruvian andes in the limits of the cusco puno and arequipa regions at 4535 m above sea level which is the highest altitude of the chili hydraulic system it is the second largest reservoir of the chili hydraulic system with a total volume of 145 106 m3 41 106 m3 due to sedimentation length of 15 km average area of 14 km2 and depth ranging from 1 m to 30 m according to preliminary bathymetry undertaken by the drinking water and sewerage service of arequipa sedapar s a the reservoir is surrounded by rocky glacier wetland and shrubland cover within the el paÃ±e basin 200 km2 where no agriculture for crops is undertaken el paÃ±e reservoir is situation at the head of the colca camana basin of the arequipa region and has an earth filled dam in the southern area and five main tributaries huilachanca japu puculluta saÃ±uta chaÃ±e catamayo and suramayo fig 1 reservoir water is diverted to the chili system due to the increasing basin water demand el paÃ±e reservoir was built in 1965 as a multi purpose hydraulic project autodema 2012 to provide water for irrigation drinking and power generation in addition the local population use water to sustain livestock and aquaculture activities aquaculture activity uses floating cages within the reservoir which represent an important nutrient load to the reservoir such a nutrient load may exacerbate eutrophication of the reservoir which has caused the death of animals autodema 2012 2 1 aquaculture production aquaculture activity in el paÃ±e reservoir focuses on oncorhynchus mykiss production in the aforementioned floating cages there are 18 government permitted aquaculture areas concessions registered in the national aquaculture cadastre of peru produce 2015 as of march 2020 available at http catastroacuicola produce gob pe web concessions are distributed mainly in the intermediate zone segment 2 and dam or lake area segment 6 of the reservoir and began operating in 2008 autodema 2012 each concession consists of an area of either 1 ha or 2 ha inside the reservoir based on personal communications with local producers an annual production of 12 000 kg has been established by the concessions whereby fish growth commence during the period from april to september winter and autumn due to the lower temperatures in comparison to spring and summer when the increased temperature limits fish growth this is considered to be standard for all concessions even though there may be variations due to increased production cessation for economic reasons and fish disease etc an increased aquaculture production is expected over the next 10 years fao 2020 whereby the potential impact could lead to water quality issues in el paÃ±e reservoir hence mamani larico and zÃºÃ±iga medina 2019 suggested that further analysis in aquaculture nutrient loads are required in this study six scenarios table 1 were modeled based on the production limits per concession that were granted by peruvian legislation which corresponds to an annual production of between 3 500 kg to 150 000 kg per concession three cohorts were considered for each concession to begin growth monthly from april to september 2 2 data sources water quality data for the period 2014 2019 were obtained from the peruvian national water authority ana and the hydraulic operator autoridad autonoma de majes autodema that perform annual and monthly monitoring programs respectively in the reservoir in addition a sampling campaign during 2018 and 2019 was performed for this study to obtain additional water quality data and used a multiprobe xylem ysi exo2 instrument snazelle 2015 to measure chlorophyll a Âµg l nitrate Âµg l ammonium Âµg l ph temperature c and dissolved oxygen mg l phytoplankton data were provided by the water quality laboratory of autodema preliminary bathymetry measured in 2019 was obtained from sedapar s a meteorological and hydrological data were obtained from autodema and aquaculture data were obtained from the national aquaculture cadastre of peru produce 2015 and through personal communication fish and fish food compositions were analyzed for phosphorus nitrogen and energy for use in the bioenergetic model table 2 3 methodology 3 1 bioenergetic model the bioenergetic model developed by canale et al 2016 was applied to estimate the growth and food requirements of fish nutrient waste loads from this operation were determined using the equations of canale and chapra 2016 the model outputs were connected with a water quality model in an integrated framework to assess the algal bloom impact of aquaculture on el paÃ±e reservoir 3 1 1 fish growth and feeding the model of canale et al 2016 was applied to determine the fish growth and feeding rates based on energy conservation through the available net energy enet which is used to increase the fish biomass this energy is provided by food intake and decreases due to various losses and non metabolic activities through the continuity equation eq 1 1 e n e t e c e f e e e r e s where ec is the rate of energy from consumed food ef is the rate of energy lost by egestion of feces ee is the rate of energy lost by excretion of nitrogenous waste in urine and ammonia lost across gills er is the rate of energy used for respiration es is the rate of energy used for ingestion digestion and food assimilation the energy loss due to reproduction was not considered thus the calculation is only valid until the sexual maturation stage of the fish an important assumption of this model is that the food energy lost by fecal egestion ef is a constant fraction of consumption and that excretion ee and the energy required to digest food es are constant fractions of the assimilated food energy the energy required for respiration being a function of the ration feed composition lipid content historical diet and culture density was determined by calibration canale and chapra 2016 the energy density of a fish É fish is a function of its approximate composition and was estimated for oncorhynchus mykiss by persson 1988 and used by canale et al 2013 it is expressed through a simple power function eq 2 where w is the wet weight of fish and Î± and Î² are area empirical constants obtained through calibration then the total weight of a fish can be obtained using eq 3 2 Îµ f i s h Î± w Î² 3 w Îµ f i s h e n e t the development of the complete equations of the model is explained in more detail by canale et al 2013 and canale and breck 2013 3 1 2 nutrients loads the contribution rates of phosphorus nitrogen and carbon lp ln and lc respectively were estimated from the simple difference between the nutrients provided by the food and the nutrients retained in the fish s body through the mass balance eqs 4 5 and 6 which were applied by canale and chapra 2016 4 l p Î¼ p l f o o d Î» p n d w d t 5 l n Î¼ n l f o o d Î» n n d w d t 6 l c Î¼ c l f o o d Î» c n d w d t r n w where Î¼p Î¼n and Î¼c are the fractions of

rate of change of the wet weight of a fish n is the number of fish r is the specific respiration rate the proximate composition of many fish depends on their weight and life cycle hence the relationships of shearer 1995 ramseyer 2002 and hall et al 1990 were used for phosphorous nitrogen and carbon respectively as the water quality model requires an input as the fractions of the loads estimated from the bioenergy model the corresponding estimated fractions were used as 65 for nh3 and 40 for po4 azevedo et al 2011 in the case of carbon 50 was assumed as dissolved and particulate organic carbon 3 2 reservoir water quality model the system dynamics sd eutrophication model afshar et al 2012 is based on the nutrient food chain model chapra 2008 and was adapted in this study to assess the impact of aquaculture activities on the nutrient enrichment of el paÃ±e reservoir implementation of this dynamic two dimensional model consisted of a system of 100 ordinary differential equations which represents 10 state variables in daily time steps zooplankton algae 1 chlorophyta algae 2 cyanobacteria algae 3 chrysophyta algae 4 cryptophyta nitrate ammonium dissolved inorganic phosphorous dip dissolved organic matter dom and particulate organic matter pom 3 2 1 spatial segmentation and physics thermal profiles of el paÃ±e reservoir were developed for this study and by autodema in 2018 and 2019 the data revealed a minimum temperature variation of 0 2 c in july and a maximum variation of 1 9 c in october from these data a thermal stability analysis based on the schmidt stability index st brunt vÃ¤isÃ¤lÃ¤ frequency n 2 wedderburn number w lake number nl and richardson number ri was performed using the rlakeanalyzer package in the r programming language read et al 2011 the results indicated a weak thermal stratification from april to july and a stronger stratification for the rest of the year due to this thermal stratification a two layer vertical differentiation was established one layer was for epilimnion and the other was for hypolimnion in the segments at greater depth segments 2 3 4 5 and 6 in fig 1 the present study considered a stratification with a constant heat transfer coefficient between 0 01 m d to 1 3 m d estimated from the previously explained indices the model calibration and the equations developed by chapra 1980 and snodgrass and o melia 1975 the mass balance between the epilimnion and hypolimnion layers is expressed by eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 v 1 d c 1 d t l t r i b q o u t c 1 v t a t c 2 c 1 l a q u a s

intersection between both layers s is the source or sink term for each state variable see afshar et al 2012 ltrib and laqua are the tributary load and aquaculture load respectively as inputs to the epilimnion layer only the preliminary bathymetry carried out by sedapar s a in 2019 was used to delimit the segmentation in this study which included six epilimnion layers and four hypolimnion layers the horizontal segmentation was also carried out according to depth and the presence of aquaculture activity diffusion was established as being between 60 m d and 80 m d murthy 1976 by model calibration the water temperature for each segment was determined from the heat balance using recorded meteorological information obtained from autodema estimated temperatures are necessary for the bioenergetic model and water quality model based on the locations of aquaculture cages and the depth along the reservoir the reservoir was divided into 10 segments 6 for epilimnion and 4 for hypolimnion fig 2 a 3 2 2 kinetic segmentation the kinetics of the sd eutrophication model was modified using the aforementioned 10 state variables zooplankton algae 1 2 3 4 nitrate ammonium dip dom and pom mass balance equations were determined for each variable in each layer thus forming a system of 100 ordinary differential equations that were solved using the runge kutta method the relationship between the variables is illustrated in fig 2b the equations of the state variables are described in more detail by afshar et al 2012 and chapra 2008 the behavior of algae a is

in the nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations from the five tributaries are shown in fig 3 3 2 3 biovolume and phytoplankton abundance according to the biological reports of autodema autodema 2019 and the national water authority ana 2016 2014 regarding el paÃ±e reservoir the water column has a phytoplankton diversity composed mainly of four algal divisions cyanobacteria cryptophyta chlorophyta and chrysophyta cryptophyta presented the highest values with respect to biomass expressed as biovolume in mmÂ³ l however cyanobacteria were the highest in terms of abundance cells ml and reached 13 208 cells ml in march 2018 and were followed by cryptophyta chlorophyta and chrysophyta respectively fig 4 within all the divisions found in el paÃ±e reservoir this study focuses on cyanobacteria which are a cause for concern as they generate annually occurring algal blooms that potentially produce cyanotoxins giannuzzi 2018 which presents a raw water quality risk and makes subsequent water treatment more difficult for this reason the alert level of the world health organization who was taken into account chorus and bartram 1999 4 model evaluation 4 1 bioenergetic model calibration information regarding fish growth that is currently used as a guide for aquaculture production in el paÃ±e reservoir was coupled to calibrate the fish growth calculated by the bioenergetic model this was calculated over a period of 310 d in consideration of the variation of the type of feed provided according to the growth stage of the fish the biomass estimated by the bioenergetic model is shown in fig 5 and adequately represented the biomass indicated by the aquaculture guide r2 0 997 this guide was the only available data to determine the accuracy of the simulated fish mass variation over time under the food supply and reservoir conditions as the nutrients that were ingested and retained were known it is expected that the waste estimations had the same degree of accuracy furthermore the bioenergetic nature of this model allows the incorporation of water temperature effects on fish growth which is similar to other bioenergetic models such as the fish prfeq model azevedo et al 2011 the coefficients of the bioenergetic model used in the present study are listed in table 3 4 2 reservoir water quality model calibration the sd eutrophication model was calibrated for the period from october 2015 to december 2019 to correspond with the available observation data the calibration was performed for epilimnion segments 2 and 6 in a trial and error fashion with the support of the opensource software pest v 17 05 doherty 2015 a comparison of probabilities was plotted and r2 was estimated for this purpose the calibrated parameters included chlorophyll a ammonium nitrate dip and temperature the coefficients for the water quality model were those suggested in other studies bowie et al 1985 chapra 2008 martin et al 1999 see table 4 the parameter sensitivities were calculated as the derivatives of the model outputs with respect to the parameters at each iteration the composite sensitivity was provided by pest as a byproduct of the parameter estimation results tang et al 2007 although the chlorophyll a concentration can vary considerably the model was able to adequately represent the observed seasonal trend in the reservoir fig 7 and 8 however the model did underestimate some values especially in segment 6 a higher chlorophyll a concentration was evident in segment 2 in comparison to segment 6 which can be explained by the fact that segments 1 2 and 3 correspond to lower water volumes that caused a dissipation effect of the parameter concentrations in segments 4 5 and 6 the modeled and observed concentrations of chlorophyll a ammonium nitrate and dip are shown in figs 7 and 8 the dip nitrate and ammonia modeled data fitted the observation data well during the evaluation period despite the low values of the calibration statistics the calibration statistics are summarized in table 5 which reveal low r2 values for all parameters except for temperature nonetheless the distribution plots of the modeled data exhibited a relatively good representation of the observed data fig 6 as well as the low values of the root mean square error rmse 5 results and discussion 5 1 bioenergetic model based on the aquaculture production scenarios table 1 the bioenergetic model estimates the nutrient loads based on fish growth for each scenario considering the variation of water temperature fig 9 the estimated nutrient loads are shown in table 6 in all scenarios the month of maximum production was may whereas there was no production during october and november fig 5 these results reflect the model s simplification of the aquaculture schedule because the actual production is generally maintained over the year to assure economic income furthermore the presence of any unauthorized aquaculture activity in the reservoir would lead to higher actual nutrient loads than those estimated this implies that a further refinement of the model in these aspects would enhance the results that need to be considered for management purposes besides reservoir management use the bioenergetic model could be used as a tool to improve fish feeding thus increasing profits for local producers while maintaining compliance with water quality goals and standards in addition the model is able to calculate reductions of byproduct loads under different strategies such as i using food with a lower phosphorus content ii a reduction or modification of the ration iii a reduction of the number of fish and iv the installation of waste treatment equipment these scenarios were assessed with the bioenergetic model used in the present study for a river system by canale and chapra 2016 5 2 reservoir water quality model application the composite sensitivity provided by pest highlighted the carbon dissolution rate kp20 zooplankton death rate kdh20 nitrogen to chlorophyll a ratio ana carbon particulate settling vp phosphorus to chlorophyll a ratio apa and chrysophyta growth rate kg20criso as the most sensitive parameters these parameters belong to the main groups carbon zooplankton nutrients and algae of the nutrient food chain model used thus reflecting the interrelation between the variables although this model did not account for sediment interaction due to a lack of data this should be considered in future studies because carbon particulate settling is a very sensitivity parameter and could play a relevant role in the long term further studies focusing on the environmental drivers influencing cyanobacteria blooms for example as undertaken by shan et al 2019 would be required to better comprehend the system based on the data of el paÃ±e reservoir from autodema 2019 biovolume and chlorophyll a exhibited a strong linear relationship fig 10 as the simulation results are expressed as chlorophyll a and each observed data for algal group are reported as biovolume the biovolume data were used as reference values for the behavior of each algae group especially for cyanobacteria as the trends were represented moderately well for segments 2 and 6 fig 11 this indicates that even though the model represents each algal group as chlorophyll a it was still able to reproduce the general trends of each algal group 6 aquaculture water quality impact an increase in aquaculture activity implies increased nutrient loads to the reservoir which would impact the trophic chain and generate conditions for phytoplankton growth the variation in phytoplankton that is associated with the current aquaculture activity in comparison to a scenario of no aquaculture activity represented an increase in chlorophyll a of 1 Âµg l in segment 2 and 0 7 Âµg l in segment 6 furthermore the majority of aquaculture waste is particulate and has an estimated settling rate of 6 cm s reid et al 2009 which corresponds to a relatively rapid settling out of fecal material and uneaten food from the epilimnion to the sediment accordingly we suggest the need to undertake further research regarding feed pellet traps concordant with sediment traps as recommended by blomqvist 1981 and performed by effler et al 2012 and penn and auer 1997 the who propose an alert level 1 threshold for a cyanobacteria biovolume of 0 2 mm3 l which indicates the potential production of microcystin the alert level 2 threshold for a cyanobacteria biovolume of 10 mm3 l indicates a significant increase in the risk of adverse human health effects from the supply of water that is untreated or treated by an ineffective system chorus and bartram 1999 even though the alert level 2 has never been recorded in el paÃ±e reservoir some of the effects were present in the past and caused the death of animals as reported by the local population autodema 2012 the alert level 1 is frequently exceeded which suggests that the general guidelines of the who should be modified for el paÃ±e reservoir considering alert level 1 a critical cyanobacteria biovolume was reached for the entire reservoir under the annual production scenario of 100 000 kg fig 12 further an annual production of 50 000 kg would represent an important impact while an annual production of 36 000 kg would still require careful consideration the average cyanobacteria biovolume of segment 2 exceeded the alert level 1 under the current annual aquaculture production however segment 2 also exceeded this limit during summer and spring under the scenario of no aquaculture production these results do not necessarily apply to the water quality of segment 6 where the discharge is located segment 6 was found to have a cyanobacteria biovolume that exceeded the alert level during some periods under the current annual aquaculture production and increased as the annual aquaculture production increased fig 13 presents a heatmap of the total chlorophyll a concentration this reveals a dilution effect from the upper segments segments 1 2 and 3 to the dam zone segments 4 5 and 6 which was due to the larger water volumes of segments 4 5 and 6 for the evaluated period the substantial nutrient loading from aquaculture waste and or other sources are not reflected in the increased nutrient concentrations in the water as reported by several authors hÃ¥kanson 1998 kelly et al 1996 temporetti and pedrozo 2000 hence the assessment of the eutrophication potential of cage aquaculture in lakes or reservoirs should be not based on simple measurements of nutrient loading or concentration in the receiving water azevedo et al 2011 instead the use of a combined bioenergetic and water quality model provides a better decision support tool for producers regulators and operators 7 conclusions a sustainable aquaculture operation should convert feedstocks into fish biomass efficiently while maintaining compliance with water quality goals and standards canale and chapra 2016 the bioenergetic model implemented in the present study was able to provide a good fit r2 0 99 of the observed aquaculture production of oncorhynchus mykiss in el paÃ±e reservoir as the model results yield theoretical feed waste values future research should attempt to validate these values as recommended by azevedo et al 2011 however as the bioenergetic model is based on nutritional and bioenergetic data it is expected that the estimated waste values are associated with a relatively high degree of accuracy in the modeled scenario of an actual annual aquaculture production of 12 000 kg the estimated waste yielded annual loads of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus of 4270 kg 760 kg and 50 kg respectively to the reservoir despite the low r2 values of the water quality model table 5 it was able to moderately represent the distribution of the observed chlorophyll a concentration fig 6 and get low rmse values the fact that the carbon particulate settling is a strong sensitivity parameter suggests that the inclusion of a sediment interaction parameter would improve the model s performance thus making it useful for the analysis of the long term cumulative effect of fish food sedimentation on water quality such an improvement to the model would require intensive monitoring campaigns including sediment sampling in certain reservoir segments moreover the role of sediment in the nutrient budget as well as the physics of the system need to be quantified appropriate models for this include ce qual w2 cole and wells 2006 which could provide a better representation of the hydrodynamics and water quality of the reservoir however a more detailed bathymetry would be required to obtain confident results an emerging approach is the use of machine learning techniques that use less data and can present highly accurate results for the general assessment of eutrophication for example the semi supervised classification ssc model wu et al 2017 and the rough set and multidimensional cloud model yan et al 2017 the model results in the present study showed a higher algal growth in the northern part of the reservoir in comparison to the southern part this was due to the higher water volume dilution effect and the deeper water light limitation of algal growth in the south fig 13 therefore the northern part of el paÃ±e reservoir was inferred to be more sensitive to the nutrient load considering the alert level 1 an annual aquaculture production of 100 000 kg was found to be detrimental for the entire reservoir and an annual production of 36 000 kg would still require careful consideration as suggested by chorus and bartram 1999 it may be necessary to adjust the alert level 2 a cyanobacteria biovolume of 10 mm3 l for el paÃ±e reservoir due to its oligotrophic nature there is a need to quantify the aquaculture production of the entire reservoir so that local managers can take this into consideration in order to guarantee the sustainability of aquaculture and water quality furthermore the standardization of parameter measurements by different entities stakeholders could help reduce measurement errors and unify data in databases to improve future research for

1031,water quality tools are necessary to control and prevent eutrophication in reservoirs particularly reservoirs with aquaculture cages because these lead to nutrient loads from fish food a combined bioenergetic and water quality model was implemented in this study to assess the contribution of aquaculture activity to algal growth in el paÃ±e reservoir peru in addition to its complexity four different algal groups chlorophyta cyanobacteria chrysophyta and cryptophyta were modeled according to their dominance in the water column of el paÃ±e reservoir moderately reasonable distribution plots of chlorophyll a were obtained when calibrating the model despite data scarcity and low r2 values 0 04 in the intermediate zone and 0 16 in the dam zone of the reservoir six scenarios of annual aquaculture production were analyzed and the scenario with an annual fish production of 100 000 kg increased cyanobacteria blooms to a dangerous level furthermore the results indicate that an annual aquaculture production of 36 000 kg still requires careful consideration in terms of its impact on the water quality of el paÃ±e reservoir keywords eutrophication bioenergetic reservoir aquaculture water quality 1 introduction global human population growth has increased the demand for fish as a food resource fao 2018 2016a peru has the highest average annual per capita consumption of fish in latin america fao 2016b and aquaculture development is important for the economic and nutritional sustenance of andean peruvian areas an increase in aquaculture activities is expected according to the peruvian national aquaculture plan produce 2010 which may impact the water quality of lakes and reservoirs as a result of the increased nutrient loads that could lead to different states of eutrophication for example as has occurred in el paÃ±e reservoir peru mamani larico and zÃºÃ±iga medina 2019 although several bioenergetic models have been proposed to estimate the fish feeding rate and nutrient waste load azevedo et al 2011 bureau et al 2011 cho and bureau 1998 papatryphon et al 2005 stigebrandt 1999 few studies have linked a bioenergetic model to a water quality model for management purposes canale and chapra 2016 dalyander and cerco 2010 mckillip 2008 there has been evidence of algal blooms reported by the local population in el paÃ±e reservoir which has caused the death of animals autodema 2012 in september 2014 ana 2014 the citizens of arequipa reported particular organoleptic alterations such as smell and taste in drinking water which suggested an abundance of cyanobacteria cyanobacterial blooms are one of the most obvious indications of eutrophication salazar torres et al 2016 according to schreurs 1992 a long term dominance of filamentous cyanobacteria species is related to a shallow lake depth while colony forming species are more commonly dominant in deeper lakes dolichospermum cf circinale a filamentous cyanobacteria is the seasonally dominant species in el paÃ±e reservoir autodema 2019 the reports in september 2014 led to an extensive sampling campaign which determined that a large part of the hydraulic system of the chili basin which includes el paÃ±e reservoir and provides water resources to the arequipa region was experiencing eutrophication ana 2014 the phytoplankton of many lakes especially those of higher trophic levels are dominated by large colony forming species of cyanobacteria formerly referred to as blue green algae such as microcystis planktothrix limnothrix anabaena dolichospermum and aphanizomenon dokulil and teubner 2000 signs of eutrophication have been observed in the upper basin of el paÃ±e reservoir where the only activities near the reservoir are livestock and aquaculture ana 2012 however specific sources of eutrophication have not been identified ana 2014 accordingly both of these activities need to be quantified to assess their impacts on the water quality of the reservoir in order to ensure their sustainable development in consideration of the different water uses for livestock and human consumption the aquaculture activity in el paÃ±e reservoir has prospered and the consequences for the nutrient balance and proliferation of algae have not yet been determined a previous study mamani larico and zÃºÃ±iga medina 2019 highlighted the need to use bioenergetic models to estimate the nutrient loads associated with aquaculture identifying the impact of aquaculture activities on a waterbody is necessary to establish control mitigation measures to guarantee the development of such activities and to ensure an adequate raw water quality for the intended purpose of the water in this study a combined bioenergetic and water quality model was used to assess the contribution of aquaculture activity to algal growth in el paÃ±e reservoir in consideration of the potential future increase in aquaculture activity 2 study area and data sources el paÃ±e reservoir is located in the southern peruvian andes in the limits of the cusco puno and arequipa regions at 4535 m above sea level which is the highest altitude of the chili hydraulic system it is the second largest reservoir of the chili hydraulic system with a total volume of 145 106 m3 41 106 m3 due to sedimentation length of 15 km average area of 14 km2 and depth ranging from 1 m to 30 m according to preliminary bathymetry undertaken by the drinking water and sewerage service of arequipa sedapar s a the reservoir is surrounded by rocky glacier wetland and shrubland cover within the el paÃ±e basin 200 km2 where no agriculture for crops is undertaken el paÃ±e reservoir is situation at the head of the colca camana basin of the arequipa region and has an earth filled dam in the southern area and five main tributaries huilachanca japu puculluta saÃ±uta chaÃ±e catamayo and suramayo fig 1 reservoir water is diverted to the chili system due to the increasing basin water demand el paÃ±e reservoir was built in 1965 as a multi purpose hydraulic project autodema 2012 to provide water for irrigation drinking and power generation in addition the local population use water to sustain livestock and aquaculture activities aquaculture activity uses floating cages within the reservoir which represent an important nutrient load to the reservoir such a nutrient load may exacerbate eutrophication of the reservoir which has caused the death of animals autodema 2012 2 1 aquaculture production aquaculture activity in el paÃ±e reservoir focuses on oncorhynchus mykiss production in the aforementioned floating cages there are 18 government permitted aquaculture areas concessions registered in the national aquaculture cadastre of peru produce 2015 as of march 2020 available at http catastroacuicola produce gob pe web concessions are distributed mainly in the intermediate zone segment 2 and dam or lake area segment 6 of the reservoir and began operating in 2008 autodema 2012 each concession consists of an area of either 1 ha or 2 ha inside the reservoir based on personal communications with local producers an annual production of 12 000 kg has been established by the concessions whereby fish growth commence during the period from april to september winter and autumn due to the lower temperatures in comparison to spring and summer when the increased temperature limits fish growth this is considered to be standard for all concessions even though there may be variations due to increased production cessation for economic reasons and fish disease etc an increased aquaculture production is expected over the next 10 years fao 2020 whereby the potential impact could lead to water quality issues in el paÃ±e reservoir hence mamani larico and zÃºÃ±iga medina 2019 suggested that further analysis in aquaculture nutrient loads are required in this study six scenarios table 1 were modeled based on the production limits per concession that were granted by peruvian legislation which corresponds to an annual production of between 3 500 kg to 150 000 kg per concession three cohorts were considered for each concession to begin growth monthly from april to september 2 2 data sources water quality data for the period 2014 2019 were obtained from the peruvian national water authority ana and the hydraulic operator autoridad autonoma de majes autodema that perform annual and monthly monitoring programs respectively in the reservoir in addition a sampling campaign during 2018 and 2019 was performed for this study to obtain additional water quality data and used a multiprobe xylem ysi exo2 instrument snazelle 2015 to measure chlorophyll a Âµg l nitrate Âµg l ammonium Âµg l ph temperature c and dissolved oxygen mg l phytoplankton data were provided by the water quality laboratory of autodema preliminary bathymetry measured in 2019 was obtained from sedapar s a meteorological and hydrological data were obtained from autodema and aquaculture data were obtained from the national aquaculture cadastre of peru produce 2015 and through personal communication fish and fish food compositions were analyzed for phosphorus nitrogen and energy for use in the bioenergetic model table 2 3 methodology 3 1 bioenergetic model the bioenergetic model developed by canale et al 2016 was applied to estimate the growth and food requirements of fish nutrient waste loads from this operation were determined using the equations of canale and chapra 2016 the model outputs were connected with a water quality model in an integrated framework to assess the algal bloom impact of aquaculture on el paÃ±e reservoir 3 1 1 fish growth and feeding the model of canale et al 2016 was applied to determine the fish growth and feeding rates based on energy conservation through the available net energy enet which is used to increase the fish biomass this energy is provided by food intake and decreases due to various losses and non metabolic activities through the continuity equation eq 1 1 e n e t e c e f e e e r e s where ec is the rate of energy from consumed food ef is the rate of energy lost by egestion of feces ee is the rate of energy lost by excretion of nitrogenous waste in urine and ammonia lost across gills er is the rate of energy used for respiration es is the rate of energy used for ingestion digestion and food assimilation the energy loss due to reproduction was not considered thus the calculation is only valid until the sexual maturation stage of the fish an important assumption of this model is that the food energy lost by fecal egestion ef is a constant fraction of consumption and that excretion ee and the energy required to digest food es are constant fractions of the assimilated food energy the energy required for respiration being a function of the ration feed composition lipid content historical diet and culture density was determined by calibration canale and chapra 2016 the energy density of a fish É fish is a function of its approximate composition and was estimated for oncorhynchus mykiss by persson 1988 and used by canale et al 2013 it is expressed through a simple power function eq 2 where w is the wet weight of fish and Î± and Î² are area empirical constants obtained through calibration then the total weight of a fish can be obtained using eq 3 2 Îµ f i s h Î± w Î² 3 w Îµ f i s h e n e t the development of the complete equations of the model is explained in more detail by canale et al 2013 and canale and breck 2013 3 1 2 nutrients loads the contribution rates of phosphorus nitrogen and carbon lp ln and lc respectively were estimated from the simple difference between the nutrients provided by the food and the nutrients retained in the fish s body through the mass balance eqs 4 5 and 6 which were applied by canale and chapra 2016 4 l p Î¼ p l f o o d Î» p n d w d t 5 l n Î¼ n l f o o d Î» n n d w d t 6 l c Î¼ c l f o o d Î» c n d w d t r n w where Î¼p Î¼n and Î¼c are the fractions of phosphorus nitrogen and carbon respectively in the food supply Î»p Î»n and Î»c are the fractions of phosphorus nitrogen and carbon in the wet weight of fish lfood is food supply rate d w d t is the rate of change of the wet weight of a fish n is the number of fish r is the specific respiration rate the proximate composition of many fish depends on their weight and life cycle hence the relationships of shearer 1995 ramseyer 2002 and hall et al 1990 were used for phosphorous nitrogen and carbon respectively as the water quality model requires an input as the fractions of the loads estimated from the bioenergy model the corresponding estimated fractions were used as 65 for nh3 and 40 for po4 azevedo et al 2011 in the case of carbon 50 was assumed as dissolved and particulate organic carbon 3 2 reservoir water quality model the system dynamics sd eutrophication model afshar et al 2012 is based on the nutrient food chain model chapra 2008 and was adapted in this study to assess the impact of aquaculture activities on the nutrient enrichment of el paÃ±e reservoir implementation of this dynamic two dimensional model consisted of a system of 100 ordinary differential equations which represents 10 state variables in daily time steps zooplankton algae 1 chlorophyta algae 2 cyanobacteria algae 3 chrysophyta algae 4 cryptophyta nitrate ammonium dissolved inorganic phosphorous dip dissolved organic matter dom and particulate organic matter pom 3 2 1 spatial segmentation and physics thermal profiles of el paÃ±e reservoir were developed for this study and by autodema in 2018 and 2019 the data revealed a minimum temperature variation of 0 2 c in july and a maximum variation of 1 9 c in october from these data a thermal stability analysis based on the schmidt stability index st brunt vÃ¤isÃ¤lÃ¤ frequency n 2 wedderburn number w lake number nl and richardson number ri was performed using the rlakeanalyzer package in the r programming language read et al 2011 the results indicated a weak thermal stratification from april to july and a stronger stratification for the rest of the year due to this thermal stratification a two layer vertical differentiation was established one layer was for epilimnion and the other was for hypolimnion in the segments at greater depth segments 2 3 4 5 and 6 in fig 1 the present study considered a stratification with a constant heat transfer coefficient between 0 01 m d to 1 3 m d estimated from the previously explained indices the model calibration and the equations developed by chapra 1980 and snodgrass and o melia 1975 the mass balance between the epilimnion and hypolimnion layers is expressed by eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 v 1 d c 1 d t l t r i b q o u t c 1 v t a t c 2 c 1 l a q u a s

intersection between both layers s is the source or sink term for each state variable see afshar et al 2012 ltrib and laqua are the tributary load and aquaculture load respectively as inputs to the epilimnion layer only the preliminary bathymetry carried out by sedapar s a in 2019 was used to delimit the segmentation in this study which included six epilimnion layers and four hypolimnion layers the horizontal segmentation was also carried out according to depth and the presence of aquaculture activity diffusion was established as being between 60 m d and 80 m d murthy 1976 by model calibration the water temperature for each segment was determined from the heat balance using recorded meteorological information obtained from autodema estimated temperatures are necessary for the bioenergetic model and water quality model based on the locations of aquaculture cages and the depth along the reservoir the reservoir was divided into 10 segments 6 for epilimnion and 4 for hypolimnion fig 2 a 3 2 2 kinetic segmentation the kinetics of the sd eutrophication model was modified using the aforementioned 10 state variables zooplankton algae 1 2 3 4 nitrate ammonium dip dom and pom mass balance equations were determined for each variable in each layer thus forming a system of 100 ordinary differential equations that were solved using the runge kutta method the relationship between the variables is illustrated in fig 2b the equations of the state variables are described in more detail by afshar et al 2012 and chapra 2008 the behavior of algae a is

in the nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations from the five tributaries are shown in fig 3 3 2 3 biovolume and phytoplankton abundance according to the biological reports of autodema autodema 2019 and the national water authority ana 2016 2014 regarding el paÃ±e reservoir the water column has a phytoplankton diversity composed mainly of four algal divisions cyanobacteria cryptophyta chlorophyta and chrysophyta cryptophyta presented the highest values with respect to biomass expressed as biovolume in mmÂ³ l however cyanobacteria were the highest in terms of abundance cells ml and reached 13 208 cells ml in march 2018 and were followed by cryptophyta chlorophyta and chrysophyta respectively fig 4 within all the divisions found in el paÃ±e reservoir this study focuses on cyanobacteria which are a cause for concern as they generate annually occurring algal blooms that potentially produce cyanotoxins giannuzzi 2018 which presents a raw water quality risk and makes subsequent water treatment more difficult for this reason the alert level of the world health organization who was taken into account chorus and bartram 1999 4 model evaluation 4 1 bioenergetic model calibration information regarding fish growth that is currently used as a guide for aquaculture production in el paÃ±e reservoir was coupled to calibrate the fish growth calculated by the bioenergetic model this was calculated over a period of 310 d in consideration of the variation of the type of feed provided according to the growth stage of the fish the biomass estimated by the bioenergetic model is shown in fig 5 and adequately represented the biomass indicated by the aquaculture guide r2 0 997 this guide was the only available data to determine the accuracy of the simulated fish mass variation over time under the food supply and reservoir conditions as the nutrients that were ingested and retained were known it is expected that the waste estimations had the same degree of accuracy furthermore the bioenergetic nature of this model allows the incorporation of water temperature effects on fish growth which is similar to other bioenergetic models such as the fish prfeq model azevedo et al 2011 the coefficients of the bioenergetic model used in the present study are listed in table 3 4 2 reservoir water quality model calibration the sd eutrophication model was calibrated for the period from october 2015 to december 2019 to correspond with the available observation data the calibration was performed for epilimnion segments 2 and 6 in a trial and error fashion with the support of the opensource software pest v 17 05 doherty 2015 a comparison of probabilities was plotted and r2 was estimated for this purpose the calibrated parameters included chlorophyll a ammonium nitrate dip and temperature the coefficients for the water quality model were those suggested in other studies bowie et al 1985 chapra 2008 martin et al 1999 see table 4 the parameter sensitivities were calculated as the derivatives of the model outputs with respect to the parameters at each iteration the composite sensitivity was provided by pest as a byproduct of the parameter estimation results tang et al 2007 although the chlorophyll a concentration can vary considerably the model was able to adequately represent the observed seasonal trend in the reservoir fig 7 and 8 however the model did underestimate some values especially in segment 6 a higher chlorophyll a concentration was evident in segment 2 in comparison to segment 6 which can be explained by the fact that segments 1 2 and 3 correspond to lower water volumes that caused a dissipation effect of the parameter concentrations in segments 4 5 and 6 the modeled and observed concentrations of chlorophyll a ammonium nitrate and dip are shown in figs 7 and 8 the dip nitrate and ammonia modeled data fitted the observation data well during the evaluation period despite the low values of the calibration statistics the calibration statistics are summarized in table 5 which reveal low r2 values for all parameters except for temperature nonetheless the distribution plots of the modeled data exhibited a relatively good representation of the observed data fig 6 as well as the low values of the root mean square error rmse 5 results and discussion 5 1 bioenergetic model based on the aquaculture production scenarios table 1 the bioenergetic model estimates the nutrient loads based on fish growth for each scenario considering the variation of water temperature fig 9 the estimated nutrient loads are shown in table 6 in all scenarios the month of maximum production was may whereas there was no production during october and november fig 5 these results reflect the model s simplification of the aquaculture schedule because the actual production is generally maintained over the year to assure economic income furthermore the presence of any unauthorized aquaculture activity in the reservoir would lead to higher actual nutrient loads than those estimated this implies that a further refinement of the model in these aspects would enhance the results that need to be considered for management purposes besides reservoir management use the bioenergetic model could be used as a tool to improve fish feeding thus increasing profits for local producers while maintaining compliance with water quality goals and standards in addition the model is able to calculate reductions of byproduct loads under different strategies such as i using food with a lower phosphorus content ii a reduction or modification of the ration iii a reduction of the number of fish and iv the installation of waste treatment equipment these scenarios were assessed with the bioenergetic model used in the present study for a river system by canale and chapra 2016 5 2 reservoir water quality model application the composite sensitivity provided by pest highlighted the carbon dissolution rate kp20 zooplankton death rate kdh20 nitrogen to chlorophyll a ratio ana carbon particulate settling vp phosphorus to chlorophyll a ratio apa and chrysophyta growth rate kg20criso as the most sensitive parameters these parameters belong to the main groups carbon zooplankton nutrients and algae of the nutrient food chain model used thus reflecting the interrelation between the variables although this model did not account for sediment interaction due to a lack of data this should be considered in future studies because carbon particulate settling is a very sensitivity parameter and could play a relevant role in the long term further studies focusing on the environmental drivers influencing cyanobacteria blooms for example as undertaken by shan et al 2019 would be required to better comprehend the system based on the data of el paÃ±e reservoir from autodema 2019 biovolume and chlorophyll a exhibited a strong linear relationship fig 10 as the simulation results are expressed as chlorophyll a and each observed data for algal group are reported as biovolume the biovolume data were used as reference values for the behavior of each algae group especially for cyanobacteria as the trends were represented moderately well for segments 2 and 6 fig 11 this indicates that even though the model represents each algal group as chlorophyll a it was still able to reproduce the general trends of each algal group 6 aquaculture water quality impact an increase in aquaculture activity implies increased nutrient loads to the reservoir which would impact the trophic chain and generate conditions for phytoplankton growth the variation in phytoplankton that is associated with the current aquaculture activity in comparison to a scenario of no aquaculture activity represented an increase in chlorophyll a of 1 Âµg l in segment 2 and 0 7 Âµg l in segment 6 furthermore the majority of aquaculture waste is particulate and has an estimated settling rate of 6 cm s reid et al 2009 which corresponds to a relatively rapid settling out of fecal material and uneaten food from the epilimnion to the sediment accordingly we suggest the need to undertake further research regarding feed pellet traps concordant with sediment traps as recommended by blomqvist 1981 and performed by effler et al 2012 and penn and auer 1997 the who propose an alert level 1 threshold for a cyanobacteria biovolume of 0 2 mm3 l which indicates the potential production of microcystin the alert level 2 threshold for a cyanobacteria biovolume of 10 mm3 l indicates a significant increase in the risk of adverse human health effects from the supply of water that is untreated or treated by an ineffective system chorus and bartram 1999 even though the alert level 2 has never been recorded in el paÃ±e reservoir some of the effects were present in the past and caused the death of animals as reported by the local population autodema 2012 the alert level 1 is frequently exceeded which suggests that the general guidelines of the who should be modified for el paÃ±e reservoir considering alert level 1 a critical cyanobacteria biovolume was reached for the entire reservoir under the annual production scenario of 100 000 kg fig 12 further an annual production of 50 000 kg would represent an important impact while an annual production of 36 000 kg would still require careful consideration the average cyanobacteria biovolume of segment 2 exceeded the alert level 1 under the current annual aquaculture production however segment 2 also exceeded this limit during summer and spring under the scenario of no aquaculture production these results do not necessarily apply to the water quality of segment 6 where the discharge is located segment 6 was found to have a cyanobacteria biovolume that exceeded the alert level during some periods under the current annual aquaculture production and increased as the annual aquaculture production increased fig 13 presents a heatmap of the total chlorophyll a concentration this reveals a dilution effect from the upper segments segments 1 2 and 3 to the dam zone segments 4 5 and 6 which was due to the larger water volumes of segments 4 5 and 6 for the evaluated period the substantial nutrient loading from aquaculture waste and or other sources are not reflected in the increased nutrient concentrations in the water as reported by several authors hÃ¥kanson 1998 kelly et al 1996 temporetti and pedrozo 2000 hence the assessment of the eutrophication potential of cage aquaculture in lakes or reservoirs should be not based on simple measurements of nutrient loading or concentration in the receiving water azevedo et al 2011 instead the use of a combined bioenergetic and water quality model provides a better decision support tool for producers regulators and operators 7 conclusions a sustainable aquaculture operation should convert feedstocks into fish biomass efficiently while maintaining compliance with water quality goals and standards canale and chapra 2016 the bioenergetic model implemented in the present study was able to provide a good fit r2 0 99 of the observed aquaculture production of oncorhynchus mykiss in el paÃ±e reservoir as the model results yield theoretical feed waste values future research should attempt to validate these values as recommended by azevedo et al 2011 however as the bioenergetic model is based on nutritional and bioenergetic data it is expected that the estimated waste values are associated with a relatively high degree of accuracy in the modeled scenario of an actual annual aquaculture production of 12 000 kg the estimated waste yielded annual loads of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus of 4270 kg 760 kg and 50 kg respectively to the reservoir despite the low r2 values of the water quality model table 5 it was able to moderately represent the distribution of the observed chlorophyll a concentration fig 6 and get low rmse values the fact that the carbon particulate settling is a strong sensitivity parameter suggests that the inclusion of a sediment interaction parameter would improve the model s performance thus making it useful for the analysis of the long term cumulative effect of fish food sedimentation on water quality such an improvement to the model would require intensive monitoring campaigns including sediment sampling in certain reservoir segments moreover the role of sediment in the nutrient budget as well as the physics of the system need to be quantified appropriate models for this include ce qual w2 cole and wells 2006 which could provide a better representation of the hydrodynamics and water quality of the reservoir however a more detailed bathymetry would be required to obtain confident results an emerging approach is the use of machine learning techniques that use less data and can present highly accurate results for the general assessment of eutrophication for example the semi supervised classification ssc model wu et al 2017 and the rough set and multidimensional cloud model yan et al 2017 the model results in the present study showed a higher algal growth in the northern part of the reservoir in comparison to the southern part this was due to the higher water volume dilution effect and the deeper water light limitation of algal growth in the south fig 13 therefore the northern part of el paÃ±e reservoir was inferred to be more sensitive to the nutrient load considering the alert level 1 an annual aquaculture production of 100 000 kg was found to be detrimental for the entire reservoir and an annual production of 36 000 kg would still require careful consideration as suggested by chorus and bartram 1999 it may be necessary to adjust the alert level 2 a cyanobacteria biovolume of 10 mm3 l for el paÃ±e reservoir due to its oligotrophic nature there is a need to quantify the aquaculture production of the entire reservoir so that local managers can take this into consideration in order to guarantee the sustainability of aquaculture and water quality furthermore the standardization of parameter measurements by different entities stakeholders could help reduce measurement errors and unify data in databases to improve future research for

1032,meretrix meretrix m meretrix are commonly found on tidal flats along the global coastlines they are believed to potentially affect the sedimentary processes and thus morphological dynamics on the tidal flat their effects on sediment erosion and deposition however are not well quantitatively understood to fill this gap we conducted an integrated synchronous field investigation of hydrodynamic sediment properties and macrobenthos at two nearby tidal flats one with abundant m meretrix and the other without in addition seasonal comparison between summer and winter for the m meretrix abundant site where there was much less m meretrix in winter than in summer was conducted to further examine the influence of m meretrix on critical value for the initiation of sediment entrainment the results show that the critical shear stress for erosion Ï e in the m meretrix abundant site was lower than the bare tidal flat by 23 differently for the critical shear stress for deposition Ïd the value at the m meretrix abundant site was greater than that at the bare tidal flat by 30 overall we concluded that the existence of m meretrix tends to enhance both the erodibility of the sea bed and the deposition of suspended sediment in the water column it is suggested that the effect of macrobenthos on sediment erosion deposition should not be neglected when predicting long term morphological

brinsley bowley et al 1998 to determine the effect of different bioturbators with respect to morphodynamics and dynamic equilibria of a tidal flat the determination of critical shear stress associated with erosion and deposition based on in situ measurements is needed in tidal flats many benthic animals are ecological engineers and play a key role in geomorphological evolution and functions of tidal flats for example the bioturbation such as burrowing behavior of benthonic animals generally lead to an increase in bed roughness favoring sediment erosions kristensen et al 2013 li et al 2017 neumeier et al 2006 widdows brinsley salkeld et al 1998 cozzoli et al 2020 reported that bivalve cerastoderma edule was able to enhance the sediment resuspension for instance the bioturbated sediment was easily suspended when the water flow is not strong enough to overcome the abiotic sediment resistance different from the majority of the bioturbators the polychaeta hediste diversicolor was able to reduce sediment resuspension at low shear stress cozzoli et al 2019 these bioturbations by benthic animals that probably produce some secretion substance heinonen et al 2007 mckee et al 2005 affect the bottom and suspended sediment properties and eventually change sediment erosion and deposition thresholds macrobenthos may play a role in the short term and long term development of tidal flat morphology via their bioturbation effect on sediment erodibility andersen et al 2010 cozzoli et al 2019 thus in situ estimation of sediment erosion and deposition thresholds is desirable under natural context with biological effect and it is vital for numerical model parameterization to accurately predict morphological changes of tidal flats in this study the critical shear stresses of sediment erosion and deposition in the rudong tidal flat jiangsu coast were calculated based on in situ integrated field measurement of waves currents erosion and deposition processes and synchronous samplings of macrobenthos the main objectives of this study are 1 to determinate the critical shear stresses for bottom sediment erosion and suspended sediment deposition through in situ observations and 2 to investigate the effects of meretrix meretrix linnaeus1758 hereafter referred to as m meretrix on the sediment erosion and deposition by comparing the sediment processes at bare tidal flat and m meretrix site the present study will improve our understanding of the stability of bottom sediments and the settling of suspended sediments the measures reported in this study will also provide values useful for parameterization in sediment transport models 2 study area the field measurements were conducted on a tidal flat in the southern jiangsu coast facing the largest radial sand ridge system of china fig 1 the studied tidal flat spans 7 10 km perpendicular to the coastline ren 1986 and its slope is around 0 09 chen et al 2010 the study area is subject to semi diurnal tides with a mean tidal range of 4 61 m and an extreme tidal range around 8 0 m zhao and gao 2015 and bottom sediments are composed of silty sand and sandy silt wang et al 2012 the study area is characterized by highly turbid water because of strong tidal current and abundant sediments transported from the offshore radial sand ridge system wang et al 2012 xing et al 2012 this feature makes it a suitable cultivation zone for m meretrix and the farming of m meretrix aquaculture has become a major fishery in the studied area the bivalve m meretrix is the dominant intertidal macrobenthos species in the study area gosling 2003 yuan et al 2018 two observation sites s1 with an elevation of 9 86 m and s2 with an elevation of 9 73 m were located on the tidal flat 1 7 and 1 4 km away from a seawall respectively fig

located at a bare tidal flat 3 materials and methods 3 1 field measurements the first field survey was conducted over four continuous tidal cycles in 29 31 august 2016 at the two observation sites site s1 and site s2 the second field survey was conducted over three continuous tidal cycles from 30 november to 1 december 2017 at the site s1 to estimate the time series of hydrodynamic and bed level changes during field measurement integrated measurement of turbulent velocity waves and the critical shear stress of erosion and deposition were utilized acoustic doppler velocimeters advs were deployed with the down looking transducer 0 37 m above the seabed the advs were programmed in autonomous deployment mode at 16 hz for 256 s i e 4096 samples per burst at 300 s intervals to record turbulent velocity the distance from the transducer to the sediment surface was continuously recorded by adv at a rate of 1 hz with an accuracy of 0 1 cm then the accumulative bed level changes mm were obtained to study the erosion or deposition previous studies have deemed this rate accurate to measure sediment erosion and deposition salehi and strom 2012 shi et al 2015 shi et al 2012 the wave parameters were measured by sbe26 plus which was installed horizontally to obtain high frequency pressure data the pressure sensor of this wave instrument was located at the height of 0 1 m above the seabed to measure the pressure at 4 hz over 256 s for each 10 minute burst interval surficial sediment samples were collected from the uppermost 1 2 cm when the tidal flat was exposed to estimate the population density of m meretrix three sediment samples 30 cm long 30 cm wide 10 cm high in dimension were collected from the tidal flat at each site and then sifted through a 0 1 cm mesh sieve during the observation three surface sediment samples 0 5 cm were also collected to measure the organic matter contents which were then determined by loss on ignition loi after combustion at 350 iso10694 bs7755 1995 furthermore to measure the extracellular polymeric substances eps content of bottom sediment three sediment cores each core has a diameter of 0 08 m were collected at each site on 20 september 2018 the eps contents of surface sediment layer from the surface of the sea bed to 0 2 cm depth were extracted according to the method modified from orvain et al 2014 by chen et al 2017 3 2 data analysis the spikes and noise in adv data sequences were inspected and subsequently interpolated using a third order polynomial according to the phase space despiking method described in goring

stresses the time serials of accumulative bed level changes mm were determined by adv during flood ebb each tide and the entire field observation period positive accumulative values indicate net deposition and negative accumulative values indicate net erosion the critical shear stress for erosion and deposition is determined by examining the accumulative bed level changes and corresponding total bed shear stress Ïcw andersen et al 2007 the critical shear stress for erosion Ïe is defined as the value of Ïcw at the point when the seabed sedimentation regime switches from deposition to erosion with increasing Ïcw the critical shear stress for deposition Ïd is the value of Ïcw at the point when the seabed begins to accrete when with a decreasing Ïcw 4 results 4 1 density of m meretrix organic content and eps the density of m meretrix was significantly different between the two sites with the density of individuals of 137 26 ind m 2 in the summer and 22 11 ind m 2 in the winter at site s1 table 1 the density of individuals was 3 7 7 ind m 2 at site s2 and thus the m meretrix impact at this site was negligible treated as without m meretrix at site s1 the mean individual wet weight was 8 4 4 4 g the values of organic content and eps contents at site s1 were smaller than those at site s2 in the summer table 1 in the winter november 2017 the density of m meretrix at site s1 decreased to 22 0 9 ind m 2 after harvesting the bottom sediment was composed mainly of sand and silt at two sites the sand silt and clay contents for site s1 were 90 09 9 08 and 0 83 respectively the corresponding values for site s2 were 97 21 2 79 and 0 4 2 hydrodynamics in the summer the maximum water depth ranged between 3 13 and 3 58 m at site s1 fig 2 a the significant wave height ranged from 0 02 to 1 45 m with an average value of 0 43 m the near bed current speed ranged between 0 09 and 0 38 m s 1 whereas at site s2 the maximum water depth ranged between 3 34 and 3 79 m the maximum significant wave height was higher than that at site s1 ranging from 0 02 to 2 46 m with an average value of 0 77 m the current speed ranged between 0 08 and 0 36 m s 1 similar to that at site s1 the near bed current 0 15 m above the seabed rotated in an anticlockwise direction at each site overall in summer the two sites had similar hydrodynamic conditions in terms of mean water depth 2 0 m for site s1 and 2 1 m for site s2 and mean current speeds 0 22 m s 1 for site s1 and 0 23 m s 1 for site s2 the significant wave height increased with water depth and peaked at high tide at both sites the mean significant wave height of site s2 was greater than that of site s1 s1 mean 0 43 m s2 mean 0 77 m values of Ïw varied between 0 03 and 0 41 n m 2 0 20 n m 2 on average for site s1 and between 0 04 and 0 38 n m 2 0 16 n m 2 on average for site s2 fig 2e and 3 e the greater wave heights in tide 3 resulted in increased Ïw values the values of Ïc calculated using the lp tke and tkew methods were similar in terms of magnitude and temporal trend at both sites fig 2 and 3 Ïc increased during the initial flood tide and mid ebb and reached its minimum value at the high water slack period overall the temporal variation in Ïc followed the same trend as the current velocities and Ïc values were of the same order of magnitude as Ïw the mean values of Ïc generated by the lp tke and tkew methods are regarded as being a reliable proxy for the actual current induced bed shear stress compared with mean Ïc values 0 12 n m 2 at both sites the values of Ïcw 0 15 at site s1 and 0 14 n m 2 at site s2 were slightly larger similar to Ïc Ïcw reached minimum values in conjunction with the minimum current speeds and peaked at the same time as current velocities became maximum as shown in fig 2g and 3g Ïcw usually peaked at the initial stage of the flood tide decreased gradually until high tide and increased again during the ebb tide in the winter the maximum water depth ranged between 2 5 and 3 09 m at site s1 fig 4 the mean current speed was 0 19 m s 1 the mean wave height was 0 47 m the averaged value of Ïcw at site s1 was 0 15 n m 2 equal to that in summer at s1 and had similar variation tendencies with that in the summer fig 4c 4 3 measured bed level changes in the summer at site s1 strong erosion of the seabed usually occurred with the early ebb tide as Ïcw increased phases e2 e4 and e6 marked in fig 2h depositional periods were evident during the late flood tide phases d1 d4 and d5 in fig 2h and the final stage of the ebb tide except during tide 3 phases d2 d3 and d6 in fig 2h at site s2 deposition usually occurred during flood tide with erosion being the dominant process during the ebb tide table 2 net deposition appeared during the early flood tide except during tide 4 phases d1 d3 and d4 in fig 3h the bare flats at site s2 underwent net deposition upon the seabed 2 3 14 7 mm during the flood tide for tides 1 4 and net erosion approximately 5 8 to 13 3 mm during the ebb tide for tides 1 3 in contrast site s1 underwent net erosion during the flood tide during tides 2 and 3 table 2 overall during the observation period the seabed at site s1 shows a total net erosion of 16 mm with an average of 4 0 mm of erosion per tide conversely the seabed at site s2 shows a total net sediment accumulation of 8 6 mm with an average of 2 2 mm per tidal cycle in the winter the tidal changes in bed elevation at s1 were not obvious with the tidally accumulative values varying between 0 3 and 3 9 mm 4 4 critical shear stress for erosion Ïe and deposition Ïd in the summer the estimated critical shear stresses for erosion Ïe ranged between 0 08 and 0 17 n m 2 at site s1 and between 0 13 and 0 22 n m 2 at site s2 the mean value of estimated Ïe at s1 was 0 13 n m 2 table 3 lower than the mean estimated Ïe at site s2 of 0 17 n m 2 the value of Ïd varied between 0 08 and 0 18 n m 2 with a mean value of 0 13 n m 2 at s1 this value ranged between 0 06 and 0 15 n m 2 with a mean value of 0 10 n m 2 at site s2 table 3 the mean critical shear stress for deposition at site s1 was 30 greater than that at s2 in the winter the determined mean value of Ïe at site s1 was 0 2 n m 2 whilst the value of Ïd was 0 16 n m 2 fig 4c table 3 it appeared that both erosion threshold and deposition threshold had been increased from summer to winter when the density of m meretrix deceased due to harvesting 5 discussions the empirical threshold curve proposed by shields 1936 was applied to predict sedimentation thresholds for non cohesive sediments guo 2020 jiang 2019 the sediments found in the study area were mainly silt sand falling into the non cohesive category in contrast to findings that the presence of biota on the bare tidal flat increases the erosion threshold of natural sediments chen et al 2012 friend et al 2005 madsen et al 1993 it has been identified in this study that the presence of m meretrix can cause a 23 5 drop in critical shear stress for erosion here we further validate this contribution using the shields curve using the grain size d 50 of the bottom sediments then shield s parameter Ï can be calculated as Ï e g Ï s Ï w d 50 where Ïs is the density of sediment in this study we put the value of Ïe at site s1 and s2 into the empirical threshold curve and its results were shown in fig 5 at site s2 Ï 0 075 was obtained which was also close to the estimated value of Ï 0 078 based on shield s curve these results further supported our findings the mean erosion threshold found by this study at the site s2 was close to the shields curve and the results appeared to be robust at site s1 we obtained a mean Ï 0 075 in summer which was 27 18 smaller than the typical value of Ï 0 103 using grain size of sediment d50 only based empirical shield s curve whereas we also obtained the mean Ï 0 12 in winter which was close to the typical value of Ï 0 115 based on the calculation of shield s curve therefore the estimates at the site s1 in summer turned to be consistent with our finding of the quantitative contribution of m meretrix on erosion threshold approximately 27 of decrease calculated from both direct field observations and empirical estimates on the contrary field observations and empirical estimates yield similar results in the winter that is the effect of bioturbation on sediment erodibility becomes weaker due to low biomass and low metabolism of clams in winter it is important to notice that the erodibility of sediments is highly variable due to a variety of environmental variables e g size distribution bartzke and huhn 2015 le hir et al 2011 macrofaunal communities for example joensuu et al 2018 suggested that biota accounted for 12 26 and 6 24 to the total variation on sediment erodibility in cohesive and non cohesive sediment in this study the clay contents were low at two sites with the same sediment types cohesive sediment had little effect on sed bed erodibility at both sites furthermore differences in benthic community composition have different influences over sediment erodibility in time and space harris et al 2020 therefore the positive and negative effect of biota on Ïe should be considered when modeling the long term geomorphologic evolution of the region to improve sediment transport models accuracy after the validation of the contribution of benthic m meretrix to a critical shear stress of erosion it is necessary to identify the underlying mechanism m meretrix living on intertidal flat usually emerges from the bottom sediments to surface during periods of tidal immersion and bury themselves again before the exposure of tidal flat lee et al 2007 santhanam 2018 anguo et al 2015 as illustrated in fig 6 the burrowing motion can physically loosen the surface sediments sgro et al 2005 and graze on microphytobenthos which secrete the eps andersen et al 2010 austen et al 1999 orvain de crignis et al 2014 orvain et al 2014 leading to lower critical shear stress for erosion and increasing sediment erodibility in this study the estimated value of Ïe at site s1 is lower than that at site s2 suggesting that this difference in Ïe is attributable to the presence and activity of abundant m meretrix at site s1 previous studies have similar findings for example the bivalve cockles cerastoderma edule reduce the erosion threshold because the locomotion and burrowing resulting in less consolidated sediment neumeier et al 2006 and the loose layer of fecal pellets pseudo feces and other sediment aggregates associated with the activities of suspension feeders are fragile and easily eroded andersen 2001 leading to a decrease in the critical shear stresses for erosion andersen et al 2002 in addition the organic matter and eps on the surface sediments at site s1 is lower than that at site s2 also leading to a decrease in sediment stability and erosion thresholds in contrast to site s2 in bare tidal flat thus it is reasonable that the value of Ïe at site s1 with abundant m meretrix was less than that at site s2 without m meretrix bare flat in terms of deposition processes the values of Ïd were obtained by previous studies and were shown in table 4 for example shi et al 2015 determined a Ïd value of 0 08 n m 2 for natural sediments composed of sand silt mixtures based on in situ measurements on an intertidal flat close to our study area in this study the values of Ïd at site s1 0 13 n m2 were higher than those at site s2 table 4 the higher values at site s1 indicate that the suspended particles at site s1 were more easily deposited compared with the suspended particles at site s2 a previous study has shown that seabed of suspension feeding bivalve mytilus edulis had bio deposition rates that were up to 40 times the natural sedimentation rates widdows brinsley salkeld et al 1998 the clam ruditapes philippinarum can egest fecal pellets or mucous bound pseudo fecal strings and excrete mucopolysaccharides leading to coarser fecal pellets and bio flocculation which can increase in bio deposition flux jie et al 2001 previous studies had shown that the coarser grained fecal pellets or flocs related to bio flocculation can increase the sediment settling velocity by almost one or two orders of magnitude in comparison with the other suspended particles andersen 2000 andersen and pejrup 2002 2011 graham and manning 2007 kumar et al 2010 for example a study reported that the higher settling velocity of resuspended fecal pellets produced by the snail hydrobia ulvae can enhance sediment aggregation by trapping suspended materials resulting in higher deposition flux on the seabed with mean sediment grain size is approximately 10 Î¼m andersen and pejrup 2002 our results revealed that m meretrix was able to increase the seabed erodibility decrease the erosion thresholds of surface sediment and have an effect on the deposition thresholds of suspended sediment therefore bioturbation may lead to enhanced sediment resuspension and change the sediment dynamics on tidal flats these biological effects can independently affect the direction of net sediment transport and impact the short term and long term development of morphology friedrichs 2011 to increase our understanding of the erodibility of tidal flats mediated by bioturbators more fieldwork on abiotic factors e g waves tides sediment type and ssc and biological factors e g macrobenthos densities benthic microalgae are needed in addition the temporal and spatial variation of biotic influence should be studied to determine the net effect of different bioturbators with respect to morphodynamics and dynamic equilibria of a tidal flat finally field studies should be compared with a controlled experiment to assess the biotic contribution to sediment resuspension and deposition 6 conclusions this study examined the influence of bioturbation on sediment dynamics based on a comprehensive field survey of hydrodynamics bed level changes and macrobenthos on an intertidal flat jiangsu coast china the results show that the value of Ïe was 0 13 n m 2 at site s1 with abundant m meretrix and 0 17 n m 2 at site s2 without m meretrix in summer whereas the value of Ïe at site s1 increased to 0 20 n m 2 when the density of m meretrix become lower in winter suggesting that m meretrix can enhance the erodibility of seabed sediments intense activities of m meretrix can loosen sediments and can increase the erosion rate of bed sediments leading to a lower value of Ïe a comparison between the field measurement and empirical estimation based on shields 1936 suggests that the effect of biota should be considered in the natural sediments when modeling long term morphological evolution the value of Ïd at the site without m meretrix 0 13 n m2 is greater than that at the site with m meretrix 0 10 n m2 this difference in Ïd is most likely attributable to the presence of fecal pellets produced by m meretrix which favors flocculation in the water column especially during the feeding time of m meretrix thus greater shear stress is needed

1032,meretrix meretrix m meretrix are commonly found on tidal flats along the global coastlines they are believed to potentially affect the sedimentary processes and thus morphological dynamics on the tidal flat their effects on sediment erosion and deposition however are not well quantitatively understood to fill this gap we conducted an integrated synchronous field investigation of hydrodynamic sediment properties and macrobenthos at two nearby tidal flats one with abundant m meretrix and the other without in addition seasonal comparison between summer and winter for the m meretrix abundant site where there was much less m meretrix in winter than in summer was conducted to further examine the influence of m meretrix on critical value for the initiation of sediment entrainment the results show that the critical shear stress for erosion Ï e in the m meretrix abundant site was lower than the bare tidal flat by 23 differently for the critical shear stress for deposition Ïd the value at the m meretrix abundant site was greater than that at the bare tidal flat by 30 overall we concluded that the existence of m meretrix tends to enhance both the erodibility of the sea bed and the

2011 in addition to the physical forcings the biotic processes have been increasingly recognized to play a role in sediment erodibility and resuspension through bioturbation and modulating sediment properties cozzoli et al 2019 cozzoli et al 2020 li et al 2017 malarkey et al 2015 an in depth understanding of the critical shear stress for erosion Ïe and deposition Ïd is a prerequisite to accurately predict the geomorphologic evolution of tidal flats it is also important when parameterizing the sediment dynamics in a numerical model for sediments without biota various empirical

otsubo and muraoka 1988 at the natural water sediment interface complicate the problem when determining the critical shear stress for erosion and deposition owing to the combined effects of physical

brinsley bowley et al 1998 to determine the effect of different bioturbators with respect to morphodynamics and dynamic equilibria of a tidal flat the determination of critical shear stress associated with erosion and deposition based on in situ measurements is needed in tidal flats many benthic animals are ecological engineers and play a key role in geomorphological evolution and functions of tidal flats for example the bioturbation such as burrowing behavior of benthonic animals generally lead to an increase in bed roughness favoring sediment erosions kristensen et al 2013 li et al 2017 neumeier et al 2006 widdows brinsley salkeld et al 1998 cozzoli et al 2020 reported that bivalve cerastoderma edule was able to enhance the sediment resuspension for instance the bioturbated sediment was easily suspended when the water flow is not strong enough to overcome the abiotic sediment resistance different from the majority of the bioturbators the polychaeta hediste diversicolor was able to reduce sediment resuspension at low shear stress cozzoli et al 2019 these bioturbations by benthic animals that probably produce some secretion substance heinonen et al 2007 mckee et al 2005 affect the bottom and suspended sediment properties and eventually change sediment erosion and deposition thresholds macrobenthos may play a role in the short term and long term development of tidal flat morphology via their bioturbation effect on sediment erodibility andersen et al 2010 cozzoli et al 2019 thus in situ estimation of sediment erosion and deposition thresholds is desirable under natural context with biological effect and it is vital for numerical model parameterization to accurately predict morphological changes of tidal flats in this study the critical shear stresses of sediment erosion and deposition in the rudong tidal flat jiangsu coast were calculated based on in situ integrated field measurement of waves currents erosion and deposition processes and synchronous samplings of macrobenthos the main objectives of this study are 1 to determinate the critical shear stresses for bottom sediment erosion and suspended sediment deposition through in situ observations and 2 to investigate the effects of meretrix meretrix linnaeus1758 hereafter referred to as m meretrix on the sediment erosion and deposition by comparing the sediment processes at bare tidal flat and m meretrix site the present study will improve our understanding of the stability of bottom sediments and the settling of suspended sediments the measures reported in this study will also provide values useful for parameterization in sediment transport models 2 study area the field measurements were conducted on a tidal flat in the southern jiangsu coast facing the largest radial sand ridge system of china fig 1 the studied tidal flat spans 7 10 km perpendicular to the coastline ren 1986 and its slope is around 0 09 chen et al 2010 the study area is subject to semi diurnal tides with a mean tidal range of 4 61 m and an extreme tidal range around 8 0 m zhao and gao 2015 and bottom sediments are composed of silty sand and sandy silt wang et al 2012 the study area is characterized by highly turbid water because of strong tidal current and abundant sediments transported from the offshore radial sand ridge system wang et al 2012 xing et al 2012 this feature makes it a suitable cultivation zone for m meretrix and the farming of m meretrix aquaculture has become a major fishery in the studied area the bivalve m meretrix is the dominant intertidal macrobenthos species in the study area gosling 2003 yuan et al 2018 two observation sites s1 with an elevation of 9 86 m and s2 with an elevation of 9 73 m were located on the tidal flat 1 7 and 1 4 km away from a seawall respectively fig

located at a bare tidal flat 3 materials and methods 3 1 field measurements the first field survey was conducted over four continuous tidal cycles in 29 31 august 2016 at the two observation sites site s1 and site s2 the second field survey was conducted over three continuous tidal cycles from 30 november to 1 december 2017 at the site s1 to estimate the time series of hydrodynamic and bed level changes during field measurement integrated measurement of turbulent velocity waves and the critical shear stress of erosion and deposition were utilized acoustic doppler velocimeters advs were deployed with the down looking transducer 0 37 m above the seabed the advs were programmed in autonomous deployment mode at 16 hz for 256 s i e 4096 samples per burst at 300 s intervals to record turbulent velocity the distance from the transducer to the sediment surface was continuously recorded by adv at a rate of 1 hz with an accuracy of 0 1 cm then the accumulative bed level changes mm were obtained to study the erosion or deposition previous studies have deemed this rate accurate to measure sediment erosion and deposition salehi and strom 2012 shi et al 2015 shi et al 2012 the wave parameters were measured by sbe26 plus which was installed horizontally to obtain high frequency pressure data the pressure sensor of this wave instrument was located at the height of 0 1 m above the seabed to measure the pressure at 4 hz over 256 s for each 10 minute burst interval surficial sediment samples were collected from the uppermost 1 2 cm when the tidal flat was exposed to estimate the population density of m meretrix three sediment samples 30 cm long 30 cm wide 10 cm high in dimension were collected from the tidal flat at each site and then sifted through a 0 1 cm mesh sieve during the observation three surface sediment samples 0 5 cm were also collected to measure the organic matter contents which were then determined by loss on ignition loi after combustion at 350 iso10694 bs7755 1995 furthermore to measure the extracellular polymeric substances eps content of bottom sediment three sediment cores each core has a diameter of 0 08 m were collected at each site on 20 september 2018 the eps contents of surface sediment layer from the surface of the sea bed to 0 2 cm depth were extracted according to the method modified from orvain et al 2014 by chen et al 2017 3 2 data analysis the spikes and noise in adv data sequences were inspected and subsequently interpolated using a third order polynomial according to the phase space despiking method described in goring

stresses the time serials of accumulative bed level changes mm were determined by adv during flood ebb each tide and the entire field observation period positive accumulative values indicate net deposition and negative accumulative values indicate net erosion the critical shear stress for erosion and deposition is determined by examining the accumulative bed level changes and corresponding total bed shear stress Ïcw andersen et al 2007 the critical shear stress for erosion Ïe is defined as the value of Ïcw at the point when the seabed sedimentation regime switches from deposition to erosion with increasing Ïcw the critical shear stress for deposition Ïd is the value of Ïcw at the point when the seabed begins to accrete when with a decreasing Ïcw 4 results 4 1 density of m meretrix organic content and eps the density of m meretrix was significantly different between the two sites with the density of individuals of 137 26 ind m 2 in the summer and 22 11 ind m 2 in the winter at site s1 table 1 the density of individuals was 3 7 7 ind m 2 at site s2 and thus the m meretrix impact at this site was negligible treated as without m meretrix at site s1 the mean individual wet weight was 8 4 4 4 g the values of organic content and eps contents at site s1 were smaller than those at site s2 in the summer table 1 in the winter november 2017 the density of m meretrix at site s1 decreased to 22 0 9 ind m 2 after harvesting the bottom sediment was composed mainly of sand and silt at two sites the sand silt and clay contents for site s1 were 90 09 9 08 and 0 83 respectively the corresponding values for site s2 were 97 21 2 79 and 0 4 2 hydrodynamics in the summer the maximum water depth ranged between 3 13 and 3 58 m at site s1 fig 2 a the significant wave height ranged from 0 02 to 1 45 m with an average value of 0 43 m the near bed current speed ranged between 0 09 and 0 38 m s 1 whereas at site s2 the maximum water depth ranged between 3 34 and 3 79 m the maximum significant wave height was higher than that at site s1 ranging from 0 02 to 2 46 m with an average value of 0 77 m the current speed ranged between 0 08 and 0 36 m s 1 similar to that at site s1 the near bed current 0 15 m above the seabed rotated in an anticlockwise direction at each site overall in summer the two sites had similar hydrodynamic conditions in terms of mean water depth 2 0 m for site s1 and 2 1 m for site s2 and mean current speeds 0 22 m s 1 for site s1 and 0 23 m s 1 for site s2 the significant wave height increased with water depth and peaked at high tide at both sites the mean significant wave height of site s2 was greater than that of site s1 s1 mean 0 43 m s2 mean 0 77 m values of Ïw varied between 0 03 and 0 41 n m 2 0 20 n m 2 on average for site s1 and between 0 04 and 0 38 n m 2 0 16 n m 2 on average for site s2 fig 2e and 3 e the greater wave heights in tide 3 resulted in increased Ïw values the values of Ïc calculated using the lp tke and tkew methods were similar in terms of magnitude and temporal trend at both sites fig 2 and 3 Ïc increased during the initial flood tide and mid ebb and reached its minimum value at the high water slack period overall the temporal variation in Ïc followed the same trend as the current velocities and Ïc values were of the same order of magnitude as Ïw the mean values of Ïc generated by the lp tke and tkew methods are regarded as being a reliable proxy for the actual current induced bed shear stress compared with mean Ïc values 0 12 n m 2 at both sites the values of Ïcw 0 15 at site s1 and 0 14 n m 2 at site s2 were slightly larger similar to Ïc Ïcw reached minimum values in conjunction with the minimum current speeds and peaked at the same time as current velocities became maximum as shown in fig 2g and 3g Ïcw usually peaked at the initial stage of the flood tide decreased gradually until high tide and increased again during the ebb tide in the winter the maximum water depth ranged between 2 5 and 3 09 m at site s1 fig 4 the mean current speed was 0 19 m s 1 the mean wave height was 0 47 m the averaged value of Ïcw at site s1 was 0 15 n m 2 equal to that in summer at s1 and had similar variation tendencies with that in the summer fig 4c 4 3 measured bed level changes in the summer at site s1 strong erosion of the seabed usually occurred with the early ebb tide as Ïcw increased phases e2 e4 and e6 marked in fig 2h depositional periods were evident during the late flood tide phases d1 d4 and d5 in fig 2h and the final stage of the ebb tide except during tide 3 phases d2 d3 and d6 in fig 2h at site s2 deposition usually occurred during flood tide with erosion being the dominant process during the ebb tide table 2 net deposition appeared during the early flood tide except during tide 4 phases d1 d3 and d4 in fig 3h the bare flats at site s2 underwent net deposition upon the seabed 2 3 14 7 mm during the flood tide for tides 1 4 and net erosion approximately 5 8 to 13 3 mm during the ebb tide for tides 1 3 in contrast site s1 underwent net erosion during the flood tide during tides 2 and 3 table 2 overall during the observation period the seabed at site s1 shows a total net erosion of 16 mm with an average of 4 0 mm of erosion per tide conversely the seabed at site s2 shows a total net sediment accumulation of 8 6 mm with an average of 2 2 mm per tidal cycle in the winter the tidal changes in bed elevation at s1 were not obvious with the tidally accumulative values varying between 0 3 and 3 9 mm 4 4 critical shear stress for erosion Ïe and deposition Ïd in the summer the estimated critical shear stresses for erosion Ïe ranged between 0 08 and 0 17 n m 2 at site s1 and between 0 13 and 0 22 n m 2 at site s2 the mean value of estimated Ïe at s1 was 0 13 n m 2 table 3 lower than the mean estimated Ïe at site s2 of 0 17 n m 2 the value of Ïd varied between 0 08 and 0 18 n m 2 with a mean value of 0 13 n m 2 at s1 this value ranged between 0 06 and 0 15 n m 2 with a mean value of 0 10 n m 2 at site s2 table 3 the mean critical shear stress for deposition at site s1 was 30 greater than that at s2 in the winter the determined mean value of Ïe at site s1 was 0 2 n m 2 whilst the value of Ïd was 0 16 n m 2 fig 4c table 3 it appeared that both erosion threshold and deposition threshold had been increased from summer to winter when the density of m meretrix deceased due to harvesting 5 discussions the empirical threshold curve proposed by shields 1936 was applied to predict sedimentation thresholds for non cohesive sediments guo 2020 jiang 2019 the sediments found in the study area were mainly silt sand falling into the non cohesive category in contrast to findings that the presence of biota on the bare tidal flat increases the erosion threshold of natural sediments chen et al 2012 friend et al 2005 madsen et al 1993 it has been identified in this study that the presence of m meretrix can cause a 23 5 drop in critical shear stress for erosion here we further validate this contribution using the shields curve using the grain size d 50 of the bottom sediments then shield s parameter Ï can be calculated as Ï e g Ï s Ï w d 50 where Ïs is the density of sediment in this study we put the value of Ïe at site s1 and s2 into the empirical threshold curve and its results were shown in fig 5 at site s2 Ï 0 075 was obtained which was also close to the estimated value of Ï 0 078 based on shield s curve these results further supported our findings the mean erosion threshold found by this study at the site s2 was close to the shields curve and the results appeared to be robust at site s1 we obtained a mean Ï 0 075 in summer which was 27 18 smaller than the typical value of Ï 0 103 using grain size of sediment d50 only based empirical shield s curve whereas we also obtained the mean Ï 0 12 in winter which was close to the typical value of Ï 0 115 based on the calculation of shield s curve therefore the estimates at the site s1 in summer turned to be consistent with our finding of the quantitative contribution of m meretrix on erosion threshold approximately 27 of decrease calculated from both direct field observations and empirical estimates on the contrary field observations and empirical estimates yield similar results in the winter that is the effect of bioturbation on sediment erodibility becomes weaker due to low biomass and low metabolism of clams in winter it is important to notice that the erodibility of sediments is highly variable due to a variety of environmental variables e g size distribution bartzke and huhn 2015 le hir et al 2011 macrofaunal communities for example joensuu et al 2018 suggested that biota accounted for 12 26 and 6 24 to the total variation on sediment erodibility in cohesive and non cohesive sediment in this study the clay contents were low at two sites with the same sediment types cohesive sediment had little effect on sed bed erodibility at both sites furthermore differences in benthic community composition have different influences over sediment erodibility in time and space harris et al 2020 therefore the positive and negative effect of biota on Ïe should be considered when modeling the long term geomorphologic evolution of the region to improve sediment transport models accuracy after the validation of the contribution of benthic m meretrix to a critical shear stress of erosion it is necessary to identify the underlying mechanism m meretrix living on intertidal flat usually emerges from the bottom sediments to surface during periods of tidal immersion and bury themselves again before the exposure of tidal flat lee et al 2007 santhanam 2018 anguo et al 2015 as illustrated in fig 6 the burrowing motion can physically loosen the surface sediments sgro et al 2005 and graze on microphytobenthos which secrete the eps andersen et al 2010 austen et al 1999 orvain de crignis et al 2014 orvain et al 2014 leading to lower critical shear stress for erosion and increasing sediment erodibility in this study the estimated value of Ïe at site s1 is lower than that at site s2 suggesting that this difference in Ïe is attributable to the presence and activity of abundant m meretrix at site s1 previous studies have similar findings for example the bivalve cockles cerastoderma edule reduce the erosion threshold because the locomotion and burrowing resulting in less consolidated sediment neumeier et al 2006 and the loose layer of fecal pellets pseudo feces and other sediment aggregates associated with the activities of suspension feeders are fragile and easily eroded andersen 2001 leading to a decrease in the critical shear stresses for erosion andersen et al 2002 in addition the organic matter and eps on the surface sediments at site s1 is lower than that at site s2 also leading to a decrease in sediment stability and erosion thresholds in contrast to site s2 in bare tidal flat thus it is reasonable that the value of Ïe at site s1 with abundant m meretrix was less than that at site s2 without m meretrix bare flat in terms of deposition processes the values of Ïd were obtained by previous studies and were shown in table 4 for example shi et al 2015 determined a Ïd value of 0 08 n m 2 for natural sediments composed of sand silt mixtures based on in situ measurements on an intertidal flat close to our study area in this study the values of Ïd at site s1 0 13 n m2 were higher than those at site s2 table 4 the higher values at site s1 indicate that the suspended particles at site s1 were more easily deposited compared with the suspended particles at site s2 a previous study has shown that seabed of suspension feeding bivalve mytilus edulis had bio deposition rates that were up to 40 times the natural sedimentation rates widdows brinsley salkeld et al 1998 the clam ruditapes philippinarum can egest fecal pellets or mucous bound pseudo fecal strings and excrete mucopolysaccharides leading to coarser fecal pellets and bio flocculation which can increase in bio deposition flux jie et al 2001 previous studies had shown that the coarser grained fecal pellets or flocs related to bio flocculation can increase the sediment settling velocity by almost one or two orders of magnitude in comparison with the other suspended particles andersen 2000 andersen and pejrup 2002 2011 graham and manning 2007 kumar et al 2010 for example a study reported that the higher settling velocity of resuspended fecal pellets produced by the snail hydrobia ulvae can enhance sediment aggregation by trapping suspended materials resulting in higher deposition flux on the seabed with mean sediment grain size is approximately 10 Î¼m andersen and pejrup 2002 our results revealed that m meretrix was able to increase the seabed erodibility decrease the erosion thresholds of surface sediment and have an effect on the deposition thresholds of suspended sediment therefore bioturbation may lead to enhanced sediment resuspension and change the sediment dynamics on tidal flats these biological effects can independently affect the direction of net sediment transport and impact the short term and long term development of morphology friedrichs 2011 to increase our understanding of the erodibility of tidal flats mediated by bioturbators more fieldwork on abiotic factors e g waves tides sediment type and ssc and biological factors e g macrobenthos densities benthic microalgae are needed in addition the temporal and spatial variation of biotic influence should be studied to determine the net effect of different bioturbators with respect to morphodynamics and dynamic equilibria of a tidal flat finally field studies should be compared with a controlled experiment to assess the biotic contribution to sediment resuspension and deposition 6 conclusions this study examined the influence of bioturbation on sediment dynamics based on a comprehensive field survey of hydrodynamics bed level changes and macrobenthos on an intertidal flat jiangsu coast china the results show that the value of Ïe was 0 13 n m 2 at site s1 with abundant m meretrix and 0 17 n m 2 at site s2 without m meretrix in summer whereas the value of Ïe at site s1 increased to 0 20 n m 2 when the density of m meretrix become lower in winter suggesting that m meretrix can enhance the erodibility of seabed sediments intense activities of m meretrix can loosen sediments and can increase the erosion rate of bed sediments leading to a lower value of Ïe a comparison between the field measurement and empirical estimation based on shields 1936 suggests that the effect of biota should be considered in the natural sediments when modeling long term morphological evolution the value of Ïd at the site without m meretrix 0 13 n m2 is greater than that at the site with m meretrix 0 10 n m2 this difference in Ïd is most likely attributable to the presence of fecal pellets produced by m meretrix which favors flocculation in the water column especially during the feeding time of m meretrix thus greater shear stress is needed

1033,macrophytes sometimes become a nuisance interfering with navigation fishing and aesthetic purposes therefore in many water bodies the macrophytes are periodically removed however with the removal of macrophytes changes occur in the physico chemical properties of water and the plankton associated with them here we describe the zooplankton community composition using functional traits feeding guilds and habitat type from littoral and open water zones in the central mexican waterbody benito juÃ¡rez reservoir for one year in two sites the macrophyte egeria densa was removed by the local administration which resulted in an increase of turbidity chlorophyll a and phycocyanin levels among rotifers polyarthra trichocerca lecane lepadella and keratella were the dominant genera while for microcrustaceans copepods alona ceriodaphnia chydorus and simocephalus were the dominant genera littoral sites had a higher number of microphagous and raptorial species than open water however after macrophyte removal microphagous species were more reduced than raptorial species moreover a decrease in semi planktonic and benthic periphytic species as well as an increase in planktonic organisms was observed after macrophyte removal nonmetric multidimensional scaling showed that before the removal of egeria macrophyte sites were different from open water however after the removal the zooplankton community was similar in all sites canonical correspondence analysis cca showed that carbonates nitrates oxygen and turbidity were the strongest predictors determining zooplankton

region and two other sites with the macrophytes typha latifolia and nymphoides fallax during an annual cycle this would give us a better understanding of how different macrophytes modify environmental

native water lily nymphoides fallax 5 macrophyte beds were single species stands separated from one another since this reservoir is used for irrigation and touristic activities e densa represents a problem for the local population due to this e densa was partially site 1 and totally site 3 removed by the local administration after eight months of sampling it was mechanically removed by throwing hooks attached to ropes from the shoreline and then pulling them out with the macrophyte at site 1 the macrophyte was not completely removed around 60 removal while at site 3 it was totally removed the rest of the macrophytes in the reservoir were not removed 2 2 environmental variables effects of different macrophyte species on environmental characteristics and zooplankton community composition were evaluated in relation to the macrophyte species and the removal of the submerged egeria densa five sampling sites were selected based on the presence of dominant macrophytes four littoral two sites with e densa but at different sites of the reservoir one with typha latifolia and one with nymphoides fallax and one in the open water for comparing zooplankton communities and water quality at each station we selected two sites with e densa since it was the dominant macrophyte water and zooplankton samples were collected monthly from these sites for one year september 2012 to august 2013 at

for further use in canonical correspondence analysis cca 2 3 zooplankton sampling a total of 60 zooplankton samples over a year 12 per sampling point was monthly obtained by filtering 80 l of surface water using a zooplankton net of 50 Âµm mesh size later it was concentrated to 180 ml and fixed in 4 formalin all samples were taken in the same way in the different macrophyte beds and the open water zone in all we obtained 8 zooplankton samples from site 1 and 8 from site 3 egeria densa sites before partial and total removal and 8 samples 4 per site from the same sites after partial site 1 and total removal site 3 respectively 12 samples were taken from the emergent typha latifolia site 2 12 samples from the attached floating nymphoides fallax site 4 and 12 samples from open water site 5 2

temperature ranged from 12 8 to 28 3 c and do from 3 9 to 14 8 mg l depending on the site and month fig 2b the ph ranged from 6 1 to 10 0 fig 1c and conductivity from 53 to 86 Âµs cm fig 2d figures 1e and 1f show that carbonates and bicarbonates ranged from undetectable levels to as high as 36 mg l turbidity levels fig 3a ranged from 1 to 59 ntu where lower values were recorded from october to april and highest during the wet season from may to september secchi disk transparency measured at site 5 fig 3b ranged from 33 to 283 cm after e densa was removed the turbidity increased in all sites ammonium levels were below detection limit 0 01 mg l and hence are not presented nitrate levels showed high variation from 0 01 to 4 mg l while phosphates fig 3d ranged from 0 3 to 1 16 mg l without any clear trend among sites we measured pigments as a proxy of phytoplankton productivity total chlorophyll a fig 3e was highest after e densa removal in may and august with values of 3 98 and 6 30 Âµg l respectively and the lowest in january of 1 5 0 06 Âµg l phycocyanins ranged from 0 15 to 4 2 fu with the highest being in august fig 3f in the dry season 1 fu was recorded with the removal of macrophytes an increase in phycocyanin concentrations was observed 3 2 richness frequency and species distribution we recorded a total of 92 zooplankton species details in the electronic appendix 1 but only 82 were used in the quantification process there were 77 species of rotifers from 23 families and 40 genera 12 cladoceran species five families and 12 genera and three copepods two families and three genera families of rotifers with high abundances were synchaetidae followed by trichocercidae and brachionidae for cladocerans it was chydoridae and daphniidae and for copepods it was cyclopidae floscularia ringens lindia janickii and proales globulifera were new records of rotifers to mexico lecanidae had the highest species richness 17 species followed by trichocercidae lepadellidae and notommatidae 7 species each for cladocerans the most diverse families were chydoridae 5 species and daphniidae 4 species and for copepods cyclopidae 2 species the number of species recorded per site was 70 species for site 1 egeria densa 75 for site 2 typha latifolia 72 site 3 e densa 75 site 4 nymphoides fallax and 24 species in open water 3 3 biological diversity shannon wiener diversity index of zooplankton ranged from 0 27 to 4 36 bits ind depending on the site and month table 1 however in most cases site 5 showed the lowest value while the rest of sites maintained similar values until egeria densa was removed from this point a strong reduction in the diversity index was observed especially at sites 1 3 and 4 before e densa removal sites 1 2 and 4 had the highest mean diversity values 3 53 3 53 and 3 68 bits ind respectively but after partial macrophyte removal site 1 maintained a high diversity 3 85 bits ind while at site 3 where macrophyte removal was total the diversity decreased to values similar to those observed in open water 3 4 zooplankton functional groups the olmstead tukey analysis indicated that polyarthra trichocerca lecane lepadella and keratella were the dominant rotifer genera while copepods alona ceriodaphnia chydorus and simocephalus were dominant microcrustaceans in the zooplankton community we recorded 66 microphagous and 26 raptorial species throughout the year from all sites before egeria densa removal littoral sites showed a similar number of microphagous between 13 and 27 species and open water showed much lower number of species 6 however after macrophyte removal sites e densa 1 and e densa 2 showed a strong decrease in the number of species but not for sites typha latifolia and nymphoides fallax where macrophytes were not removed for raptorial species littoral sites showed a higher number of species without any strong reduction in the number of species after macrophyte removal fig 4 we recorded 14 planktonic 16 semi planktonic and 62 benthic periphytic species throughout the year from all sites open water had higher abundances of planktonic taxa before macrophyte removal however after the removal of plants planktonic abundance increased only at sites e densa 1 e densa 2 and n fallax while semi planktonic and benthic periphytic taxa showed an inverse trend fig 5 3 5 nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds we compared similarity among sites in terms of community composition using nmds ordination before the removal of egeria densa from september to april littoral communities e d 1 e d 2 t l and n f were similar and thus formed a group fig 6 a which differed from site 5 open water however after the removal of the macrophytes the zooplankton community composition from the sites 1 e densa 1 and 3 e densa 2 resembled that in the open water fig 6b statistically significant differences were found between open water and littoral sites anosim p 0 001 r 0 38 before macrophyte removal however after this all sites did not differ significantly 3 6 canonical correspondence analysis cca the significant environmental factors explaining the variations in the zooplankton genera from the five sampling sites of the benito juÃ¡rez reservoir were carbonates nitrates oxygen and turbidity many environmental variables explained large part of the variability Î»1 however following the inclusion of carbonates the remaining variables explained very little Î»a of the additional variability indicating that there was a good amount of co variability among the variables table 2 the first and second axis of cca explained 45 and 17 respectively of the variability many semi planktonic and benthic periphytic genera were positively related to the most important factors explaining variability and negatively related to photosynthetic pigments and nutrients on the other hand planktonic species are separated from most semi pelagic and benthic periphytic genera and positively related to turbidity chlorophyll a phycocyanins and nutrients copepodites nauplii lecane and trichocerca were close to the center where they did not show any clear relation with any of the environmental variables fig 7 a samples taken from the open waters were grouped in the positive part of axis 1 and 2 while most of the samples taken from e densa 1 and e densa 2 before macrophyte removal were grouped in the negative part of axis 1 with most of littoral samples and positively related with carbonates biomass and ph fig 7b 4 discussion the effects of different macrophyte species on the zooplankton community composition were described with an emphasis on the removal of egeria densa our results showed that before macrophyte removal all littoral sites did not show significant differences in community composition with dominance of benthic periphytic and semi planktonic species on the other hand the open water community was statistically different with considerably fewer species dominated by planktonic forms most studies on zooplankton distribution comparing littoral vs open water have reported higher species richness in the littoral kuczyÅska kippen and nagengast 2006 cazanelli et al 2008 it is well known that macrophytes produce changes in the environment with repercussions on other species moss 2018 higher species richness in the littoral regions reflects more habitat heterogeneity and consequently greater niche diversity duggan 2001 in contrast open water is a less heterogeneous habitat where some planktonic species have developed behavioral strategies to avoid the shading produced by macrophytes preissler 1980 fontanarrosa et al 2010 some studies suggest that macrophytes with higher morphological complexity e g dissected leaves have a greater area to colonize and provide more effective refuge against predation in comparison with less complex undissected plants thus it is also expected that macrophytes with higher complexity host greater diversity cazanelli et al 2008 lucena moya and duggan 2011 in our investigation we compared zooplankton composition in three macrophytes with different morphological complexity egeria densa the most complex nymphoides fallax with intermediate level and typha latifolia with less complexity however the zooplankton community composition did not show differences among these habitats therefore zooplankton distribution in benito juÃ¡rez reservoir is related to other effects produced by macrophytes differences in density and age of macrophytes food availability chemical factors and effects on prey predator interactions have also been recognized as determinant factors on zooplankton community composition in the littoral jersabek 1995 duggan 2001 viveros legorreta et al 2020 even though no statistical differences were found among littoral sites some zooplankton species did change depending on the macrophyte for example trichocerca porcellus t elongata and monommata actices were more abundant at the site with egeria densa while ceriodaphnia cf dubia simocephalus serrulatus and nauplii were more abundant at the site with nymphoides fallax polyarthra vulgaris and keratella cochlearis dominated in the open water rotifers have habitat preferences for some macrophyte species for example pejler 1962 found that some species of trichocerca had a marked preference on periphytic environments while some planktonic species swim away from the shore as a result of optical orientation to avoid shading duggan et al 2001 also found no differences in rotifer abundances among macrophytes with different morphological complexity but they found that some species such as euchlanis dilatata lecane closterocerca and l lunaris had strong a habitat preference a few studies in different latitudes have also shown that zooplankton communities inhabiting different macrophyte species can be similar for example in temperate areas kuczyÅska kippen and nagengast 2006 reported that zooplankton composition was similar between communities inhabiting the submerged macrophytes chara and myriophyllum but different from emergent typha and floating nymphaea josÃ© de paggi et al 2012 also found similarities in rotifer community composition between free floating eichhornia crassipes and emergent macrophytes panicum elephantipes in a subtropical lake according to cca carbonates nitrates oxygen and turbidity were the main factors determining zooplankton composition and as we described these variables were strongly affected by the macrophyte density determining a high level of co variability among environmental variables other studies have also shown how variables associated with macrophytes affect the zooplankton community kuczyÅska kippen and nagengast 2006 reported that zooplankton distribution was mainly determined by macrophyte stem length and total phosphorus more recently kuczyÅska kippen 2018 found that overshading created by macrophyte cover and plant length as an indicator of habitat heterogeneity was the strongest factor that explained zooplankton variation while chlorophyll a had negative effects on littoral rotifers and bdelloids moreover we also observed in cca that carbonates ph oxygen and biomass of egeria were positively related to benthic periphytic organisms after partial and total removal of egeria densa zooplankton composition inhabiting these sites resembled that in the open water we recorded a change in dominance from microphagous semi planktonic and benthic periphytic species to planktonic organisms as in this study jersabek 1995 reported that reduction of habitat complexity was related to a decrease in the number of benthic and periphytic species in high altitude alpine lakes it has also been demonstrated that changes in the dominance of rotifers are associated with changes in the macrophyte dominance from submerged to emergent plants irvine et al 1990 in addition gebrehiwot et al 2017 found a reduction in the density of cladocerans in the littoral after the decaying of macrophytes analysis of functional groups can insight into diversity changes hence the homogenization of functional groups has been remarked as a threat to ecosystem services barnett et al 2007 obertegger and flaim 2018 it is also important to comment on the differences between total and partial removal of aquatic vegetation torn et al 2010 described the effects of different types of mechanical disturbances on a macrophyte community dominated by characeans they mentioned that mechanical removal of vegetation or sediments had the largest impact on the macrophyte community these effects were similar to our findings where partial removal of egeria densa caused lower effects on zooplankton composition and environmental variables than total macrophyte removal our data showed that changes in macrophyte biomass differentially affected many characteristics of the abiotic environment therefore during daylight submerged macrophyte biomass with high photosynthetic rates modifies water ph and affect the degree of dissociation of inorganic dissolved carbon species peÅechaty et al 2013 in our data we observed that after egeria partial and total removal carbonates concentrations decreased but the effect was stronger when the macrophyte removal was total on the other hand turbidity increased at all sites after the removal of egeria possibly due to a reduction of the macrophyte structure and the increase of mixing because of wind and rain as well as an increase in the phytoplankton density due to greater availability of nutrients scheffer and carpenter 2003 in this work zooplankton was chiefly composed of rotifers small cladocerans and cyclopoid copepods most of the subtropical and tropical freshwater bodies are dominated by small size zooplankton as year round fish predation selectively eliminates larger crustaceans iglesias 2007 nandini et al 2016 predation also affects zooplankton body size vertebrate predation leads to smaller body sized zooplankton while the invertebrate predators cause the opposite effect brooks and dodson 1965 meerhoff et al 2007 reported that the refuge effect of macrophytes against zooplankton predation is weaker in tropical and subtropical than in temperate freshwater environments 5 conclusions our study suggests that removal of macrophytes reduces environmental heterogeneity causing changes in ecosystem processes by reducing the biodiversity of zooplankton and in turn decreasing their functional groups these changes may affect secondary productivity reducing fish availability and accelerating eutrophication processes which in turn influence the ecosystem services as fishing and recreating activities therefore it is important to

1033,macrophytes sometimes become a nuisance interfering with navigation fishing and aesthetic purposes therefore in many water bodies the macrophytes are periodically removed however with the removal of macrophytes changes occur in the physico chemical properties of water and the plankton associated with them here we describe the zooplankton community composition using functional traits feeding guilds and habitat type from littoral and open water zones in the central mexican waterbody benito juÃ¡rez reservoir for one year in two sites the macrophyte egeria densa was removed by the local administration which resulted in an increase of turbidity chlorophyll a and phycocyanin levels among rotifers polyarthra trichocerca lecane lepadella and keratella were the dominant genera while for microcrustaceans copepods alona ceriodaphnia chydorus and simocephalus were the dominant genera littoral sites had a higher number of microphagous and raptorial species than open water however after macrophyte removal microphagous species were more reduced than raptorial species moreover a decrease in semi planktonic and benthic periphytic species as well as an increase in planktonic organisms was observed after macrophyte removal nonmetric multidimensional scaling showed that before the removal of egeria macrophyte sites were different from open water however after the removal the zooplankton community was similar in all sites canonical correspondence analysis cca showed that carbonates nitrates oxygen and turbidity were the strongest predictors determining zooplankton composition our study showed that macrophyte removal caused habitat modification and zooplankton community shifts that reduce diversity and functional groups key words cladocera egeria densa

any clear trend among sites we measured pigments as a proxy of phytoplankton productivity total chlorophyll a fig 3e was highest after e densa removal in may and august with values of 3 98 and 6 30 Âµg l respectively and the lowest in january of 1 5 0 06 Âµg l phycocyanins ranged from 0 15 to 4 2 fu with the highest being in august fig 3f in the dry season 1 fu was recorded with the removal of macrophytes an increase in phycocyanin concentrations was observed 3 2 richness frequency and species distribution we recorded a total of 92 zooplankton species details in the electronic appendix 1 but only 82 were used in the quantification process there were 77 species of rotifers from 23 families and 40 genera 12 cladoceran species five families and 12 genera and three copepods two families and three genera families of rotifers with high abundances were synchaetidae followed by trichocercidae and brachionidae for cladocerans it was chydoridae and daphniidae and for copepods it was cyclopidae floscularia ringens lindia janickii and proales globulifera were new records of rotifers to mexico lecanidae had the highest species richness 17 species followed by trichocercidae lepadellidae and notommatidae 7 species each for cladocerans the most diverse families were chydoridae 5 species and daphniidae 4 species and for copepods cyclopidae 2 species the number of species recorded per site was 70 species for site 1 egeria densa 75 for site 2 typha latifolia 72 site 3 e densa 75 site 4 nymphoides fallax and 24 species in open water 3 3 biological diversity shannon wiener diversity index of zooplankton ranged from 0 27 to 4 36 bits ind depending on the site and month table 1 however in most cases site 5 showed the lowest value while the rest of sites maintained similar values until egeria densa was removed from this point a strong reduction in the diversity index was observed especially at sites 1 3 and 4 before e densa removal sites 1 2 and 4 had the highest mean diversity values 3 53 3 53 and 3 68 bits ind respectively but after partial macrophyte removal site 1 maintained a high diversity 3 85 bits ind while at site 3 where macrophyte removal was total the diversity decreased to values similar to those observed in open water 3 4 zooplankton functional groups the olmstead tukey analysis indicated that polyarthra trichocerca lecane lepadella and keratella were the dominant rotifer genera while copepods alona ceriodaphnia chydorus and simocephalus were dominant microcrustaceans in the zooplankton community we recorded 66 microphagous and 26 raptorial species throughout the year from all sites before egeria densa removal littoral sites showed a similar number of microphagous between 13 and 27 species and open water showed much lower number of species 6 however after macrophyte removal sites e densa 1 and e densa 2 showed a strong decrease in the number of species but not for sites typha latifolia and nymphoides fallax where macrophytes were not removed for raptorial species littoral sites showed a higher number of species without any strong reduction in the number of species after macrophyte removal fig 4 we recorded 14 planktonic 16 semi planktonic and 62 benthic periphytic species throughout the year from all sites open water had higher abundances of planktonic taxa before macrophyte removal however after the removal of plants planktonic abundance increased only at sites e densa 1 e densa 2 and n fallax while semi planktonic and benthic periphytic taxa showed an inverse trend fig 5 3 5 nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds we compared similarity among sites in terms of community composition using nmds ordination before the removal of egeria densa from september to april littoral communities e d 1 e d 2 t l and n f were similar and thus formed a group fig 6 a which differed from site 5 open water however after the removal of the macrophytes the zooplankton community composition from the sites 1 e densa 1 and 3 e densa 2 resembled that in the open water fig 6b statistically significant differences were found between open water and littoral sites anosim p 0 001 r 0 38 before macrophyte removal however after this all sites did not differ significantly 3 6 canonical correspondence analysis cca the significant environmental factors explaining the variations in the zooplankton genera from the five sampling sites of the benito juÃ¡rez reservoir were carbonates nitrates oxygen and turbidity many environmental variables explained large part of the variability Î»1 however following the inclusion of carbonates the remaining variables explained very little Î»a of the additional variability indicating that there was a good amount of co variability among the variables table 2 the first and second axis of cca explained 45 and 17 respectively of the variability many semi planktonic and benthic periphytic genera were positively related to the most important factors explaining variability and negatively related to photosynthetic pigments and nutrients on the other hand planktonic species are separated from most semi pelagic and benthic periphytic genera and positively related to turbidity chlorophyll a phycocyanins and nutrients copepodites nauplii lecane and trichocerca were close to the center where they did not show any clear relation with any of the environmental variables fig 7 a samples taken from the open waters were grouped in the positive part of axis 1 and 2 while most of the samples taken from e densa 1 and e densa 2 before macrophyte removal were grouped in the negative part of axis 1 with most of littoral samples and positively related with carbonates biomass and ph fig 7b 4 discussion the effects of different macrophyte species on the zooplankton community composition were described with an emphasis on the removal of egeria densa our results showed that before macrophyte removal all littoral sites did not show significant differences in community composition with dominance of benthic periphytic and semi planktonic species on the other hand the open water community was statistically different with considerably fewer species dominated by planktonic forms most studies on zooplankton distribution comparing littoral vs open water have reported higher species richness in the littoral kuczyÅska kippen and nagengast 2006 cazanelli et al 2008 it is well known that macrophytes produce changes in the environment with repercussions on other species moss 2018 higher species richness in the littoral regions reflects more habitat heterogeneity and consequently greater niche diversity duggan 2001 in contrast open water is a less heterogeneous habitat where some planktonic species have developed behavioral strategies to avoid the shading produced by macrophytes preissler 1980 fontanarrosa et al 2010 some studies suggest that macrophytes with higher morphological complexity e g dissected leaves have a greater area to colonize and provide more effective refuge against predation in comparison with less complex undissected plants thus it is also expected that macrophytes with higher complexity host greater diversity cazanelli et al 2008 lucena moya and duggan 2011 in our investigation we compared zooplankton composition in three macrophytes with different morphological complexity egeria densa the most complex nymphoides fallax with intermediate level and typha latifolia with less complexity however the zooplankton community composition did not show differences among these habitats therefore zooplankton distribution in benito juÃ¡rez reservoir is related to other effects produced by macrophytes differences in density and age of macrophytes food availability chemical factors and effects on prey predator interactions have also been recognized as determinant factors on zooplankton community composition in the littoral jersabek 1995 duggan 2001 viveros legorreta et al 2020 even though no statistical differences were found among littoral sites some zooplankton species did change depending on the macrophyte for example trichocerca porcellus t elongata and monommata actices were more abundant at the site with egeria densa while ceriodaphnia cf dubia simocephalus serrulatus and nauplii were more abundant at the site with nymphoides fallax polyarthra vulgaris and keratella cochlearis dominated in the open water rotifers have habitat preferences for some macrophyte species for example pejler 1962 found that some species of trichocerca had a marked preference on periphytic environments while some planktonic species swim away from the shore as a result of optical orientation to avoid shading duggan et al 2001 also found no differences in rotifer abundances among macrophytes with different morphological complexity but they found that some species such as euchlanis dilatata lecane closterocerca and l lunaris had strong a habitat preference a few studies in different latitudes have also shown that zooplankton communities inhabiting different macrophyte species can be similar for example in temperate areas kuczyÅska kippen and nagengast 2006 reported that zooplankton composition was similar between communities inhabiting the submerged macrophytes chara and myriophyllum but different from emergent typha and floating nymphaea josÃ© de paggi et al 2012 also found similarities in rotifer community composition between free floating eichhornia crassipes and emergent macrophytes panicum elephantipes in a subtropical lake according to cca carbonates nitrates oxygen and turbidity were the main factors determining zooplankton composition and as we described these variables were strongly affected by the macrophyte density determining a high level of co variability among environmental variables other studies have also shown how variables associated with macrophytes affect the zooplankton community kuczyÅska kippen and nagengast 2006 reported that zooplankton distribution was mainly determined by macrophyte stem length and total phosphorus more recently kuczyÅska kippen 2018 found that overshading created by macrophyte cover and plant length as an indicator of habitat heterogeneity was the strongest factor that explained zooplankton variation while chlorophyll a had negative effects on littoral rotifers and bdelloids moreover we also observed in cca that carbonates ph oxygen and biomass of egeria were positively related to benthic periphytic organisms after partial and total removal of egeria densa zooplankton composition inhabiting these sites resembled that in the open water we recorded a change in dominance from microphagous semi planktonic and benthic periphytic species to planktonic organisms as in this study jersabek 1995 reported that reduction of habitat complexity was related to a decrease in the number of benthic and periphytic species in high altitude alpine lakes it has also been demonstrated that changes in the dominance of rotifers are associated with changes in the macrophyte dominance from submerged to emergent plants irvine et al 1990 in addition gebrehiwot et al 2017 found a reduction in the density of cladocerans in the littoral after the decaying of macrophytes analysis of functional groups can insight into diversity changes hence the homogenization of functional groups has been remarked as a threat to ecosystem services barnett et al 2007 obertegger and flaim 2018 it is also important to comment on the differences between total and partial removal of aquatic vegetation torn et al 2010 described the effects of different types of mechanical disturbances on a macrophyte community dominated by characeans they mentioned that mechanical removal of vegetation or sediments had the largest impact on the macrophyte community these effects were similar to our findings where partial removal of egeria densa caused lower effects on zooplankton composition and environmental variables than total macrophyte removal our data showed that changes in macrophyte biomass differentially affected many characteristics of the abiotic environment therefore during daylight submerged macrophyte biomass with high photosynthetic rates modifies water ph and affect the degree of dissociation of inorganic dissolved carbon species peÅechaty et al 2013 in our data we observed that after egeria partial and total removal carbonates concentrations decreased but the effect was stronger when the macrophyte removal was total on the other hand turbidity increased at all sites after the removal of egeria possibly due to a reduction of the macrophyte structure and the increase of mixing because of wind and rain as well as an increase in the phytoplankton density due to greater availability of nutrients scheffer and carpenter 2003 in this work zooplankton was chiefly composed of rotifers small cladocerans and cyclopoid copepods most of the subtropical and tropical freshwater bodies are dominated by small size zooplankton as year round fish predation selectively eliminates larger crustaceans iglesias 2007 nandini et al 2016 predation also affects zooplankton body size vertebrate predation leads to smaller body sized zooplankton while the invertebrate predators cause the opposite effect brooks and dodson 1965 meerhoff et al 2007 reported that the refuge effect of macrophytes against zooplankton predation is weaker in tropical and subtropical than in temperate freshwater environments 5 conclusions our study suggests that removal of macrophytes reduces environmental heterogeneity causing changes in ecosystem processes by reducing the biodiversity of zooplankton and in turn decreasing their functional groups these changes may affect secondary productivity reducing fish availability and accelerating eutrophication processes which in turn influence the ecosystem services as fishing and recreating activities therefore it is important to design management strategies to deal with macrophyte nuisance and ecosystem services declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

1034,rivers and streams possess many characteristics that result from features of their surrounding landscape e g from climate conditions superficial lithology soil profile topography vegetation cover and human activities as well in this study we determined the impact of superficial geology and catchment land use as the key landscape drivers affecting the physico chemical and biological conditions in stream ecosystems on the structure and values of selected ecological metrics relating to stonefly assemblages in order to achieve this goal we sampled 10 mid sized submountain carpathian streams flowing through two different geological bedrocks and draining the catchment areas with different dominant land use as a consequence these differences we analyzed together 16 physico chemical and biological parameters of stream environment our results demonstrate that 4 environmental parameter particulate organic matter transported inorganic matter phosphorus and silicon ions reflecting difference in superficial geology and landuse of the catchment area played a significant role in the structuring of stonefly assemblages we also found that catchment land use had an impact on values of the sas and saprobic indices as well as on the proportion of leuctridae nemouridae and brachyptera species in stonefly assemblages the difference in catchment geology were reflected in values of total species richness and in the proportion of leuctridae nemouridae and brachyptera species as well key words plecoptera slovakia landuse geology ecological metrics 1 introduction according to hynes s paradigm 1975 a river ecosystem integrates itself through a complex of elements and processes which occur in the surrounding riverine landscape catchment land use and superficial geology are considered the two primary extrinsic impacts shaping the structure and processes inside stream ecosystems hynes 1975 vannote et al 1980 richards et al 1996 davies et al 2000 schomberg et al 2005 shearer and young 2011 superficial geology affects the hydrological dynamics and channel morphology of streams as well as the water chemistry the nutrient flux and sedimentation processes within an aquatic environment hughes et al 1994 johnson et al 1997 mcdowell et al 2002 catchment land use influences the intrinsic stream environment through chemical additions from terrestrial runoff as well as through hydrological and hydromorphological modifications e g changes of discharge regime sediment inputs and microhabitat proportions pekarova and pekar 1996 richards et al 1996 johnson et al 1997 armitage and blackburn 2010 in community ecology a conceptual view characterizes organismal assemblages at a given site as the product of interaction between dispersal capacity of species and series of hierarchical environmental filters i e continental regional basin reach channel unit and microhabitat tonn 1990 poff 1997 both superficial geology and landuse belong to these filters through that species needed to pass if they occur in species assemblage at a site geology act at the regional basin scale by filtering species through stream characteristics and it belongs among the major factors that affects the species composition of aquatic invertebrates sandin and johnson 2004 in particular olson 2012 defined 4 different mechanisms through which superficial geology affects the community composition of aquatic invertebrates first geology may indirectly affect organisms through the water chemistry which impacts on the quantity and quality of food resources for example the concentration of calcium ions determines the rate of detritus decomposition chamier and dixon 1983 ph also controls the removal of dissolved organic matter via the flocculation process walsh et al 2009 and stream bedrock is the principal source of phosphorus in an aquatic environment garcia et al 2011 second geology may directly affect organisms through the process of osmoregulation when values of total dissolved solids limit the occurrence and survival of some macroinvertebrate taxa via their osmoregulatory ability minshall and minshall 1978 mcculloch et al 1993 hassell et al 2006 third geology may indirectly affect organisms through the hydrological conditions and temperature regime of the stream streams with higher porosity of the underlying geological layer have more stable groundwater intake and therefore less hydrologic and temperature fluctuation wang et al 2006 a reduction in temperature differences between seasons can be reflected in the change of production and biomass turnover of some taxa huryn et al 1995 beracko and revajovÃ¡ 2019 fourth geology may indirectly affect organisms through meso microhabitat characteristics some geological formations e g having magmatic or volcanic lithology create coarser substrates due to lower erosion while others e g sandstone or flysh produce finer substrate particles according to minshall 1984 substrate coarseness significantly determines the taxonomical composition of benthic invertebrates at the site a human altered riverscape also represents a key regional catchment filter that determines the biodiversity in running waters via changes of hydrological physico chemical and biological conditions in aquatic ecosystems stendera et al 2012 at the regional catchment level the most common negative human impact on a stream ecosystem is considered the modification of the original landscape to urban or agricultural areas roth et al 1996 allan 2004 degradation of stream communities is clearly visible when native forests are converted into fields and pastures quinn and hickey 1990 huryn et al 2002 recently the linkage between underlying geology and land use impact has become a central topic of many scientific articles that relate to the evaluation of aquatic ecosystems especially in connection with increasing intensification of land use worldwide in this sense many of these researches e g allan and johnson 1997 shearer and young 2011 documented that the impact of landuse on an aquatic environment may differ depending on the underlying geology on one hand change from a naturally forested to an agricultural landscape may affect invertebrate communities in a stream regardless of geology type for example through higher solar input change of temperature regime and a higher quantity of flushed nutrient on the other hand potential sedimentation impacts would be expected to be less severe in an agricultural stream that flows through hardly erodable rocks rather than one which drains unstable or highly erodible rocks allan and johnson 1997 stoneflies represent ideal model organisms as they are highly sensitive to any changes in the environment where they live afnor 2007 due to the generally poor dispersion of stoneflies for longer distances allows us to analyze the effect of environmental filters in structuring of the community without including factors relate to dispersal ability of stonefly species the stonefly diversity and community composition well reflect both natural and man induced disturbance and change of aquatic environment resh et al 1988 the structure of stonefly assemblages are also mirrored in some ecological metrics e g ln index krno et al 2015a perlidae index krno and Å¾iak 2012 and brachyptera sp proportion krno and Å¾iak 2012 which react on the human activities in river basins and on the hydromorphological degradation of streams lorenz et al 2004 based on these knowledges we investigate in this study how biotic and abiotic factors following from natural superficial geology and human induced catchment land use conditions are reflected in the environmental differences of streams of the southern slopes of the western carpathians including their stonefly assemblages more exactly the aims of this study were to identify the key environmental drivers that influence species composition and ecological metrics of plecoptera assemblages in submountain streams on the border of the carpathian and pannonian ecoregion 2 methods 2 1 study sites the study area is located on the southern slopes of the western carpathians south western slovakia in the catchment area of the hron ipeÄ¾ and slanÃ¡ rivers we selected 10 submountain streams fig 1 located between 165 and 443 m a s l differing in their lithological substrate table 1 the catchment area of the five streams podluÅ¾ianka sikenica litava madaÄka and tisovnÃ­k situated in the western part of the study area is composed by acid to intermediate neogene volcanic and volcanic

complete description of the study area streams and lithological and physico chemical characteristics see table 1 and table 2 2 2 field sampling and data processing quantitative samples of benthic invertebrates were taken seasonally i e in spring and autumn of 2011 and in summer of 2012 the samples were collected using hess s sampler sampled area of 0 8 m2 0 3 mm mesh size from all dominant microhabitats with coverage 5 according to their proportion at the sites in each sampling a total of 20 sub samples were taken at the site aqem consortium 2002 in the field samples were stored in plastic bottles and preserved in a 4 formaldehyde solution in the laboratory stonefly nymphs were separated from detritus and other benthic taxa and identified to the species level according to rauÅ¡er 1980 zwick 2006 fochetti and tierno de figueroa 2008 lubini et al 2012 krno 2013 at each sampling site stonefly adults were collected with an entomological net by sweeping the riparian vegetation in each sampling occasion the adults were identified according to kis 1974 and they were used only for verification of right determination of the stonefly larvae i e their quantities weren t included to the statistical analyses in stonefly larvae the total number of individuals and number of individuals in each species were expressed per 1 m2 of sampling area reflecting current microhabitat proportions substrate proportion was estimated based on the percentage of boulders cobbles pebbles gravel and sand in five random transects through the stream channel at the sampling site at each sampling site water temperature was measured using vemco minilog 8 bit tr temperature dataloggers in one hour intervals during the whole study period annual degree days were calculated as the sum of mean daily temperature during one year stream discharge was measured seasonally with the fp111 handheld water velocity meter stream discharge was calculated based on mean velocities and depths in cells specified across the distance of the channel cross section during fieldwork several hydrochemical parameters ph total dissolved solids dissolved oxygen content were measured with wtw and hach lange portable devices in situ the water samples were filtered using microfilters 0 45 Âµm mesh size the same day the concentration measurements of k ca2 mg2 fe3 si sio2 p po4 3 n no3 were performed using the spectroquant multy portable photocolorimeter device molar concentration of dissolved free co2 was measured by titration with a 0 1m naoh solution and phenolphthalein as an indicator molar concentration of hco3 was measured by titration with a 0 1m hcl solution with a mixed indicator methyl red and bromocresol green five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 was determined in standard 300 ml bod bottles using standard methods delzer and mckenzie 2003 in each sampling occasion we collected additional data referring to trophic resources namely values of the periphyton transported organic matter tom transported inorganic matter tam and particulate organic matter pom tom and tam were taken to the 1 5 liter plastic bottle from the water column pom was sampled with plastic bottles 100 ml using a plastic tube with a diameter of 15 5 cm periphyton was removed from 5 to 7 stones of which we measured the surface area by scrubbing with a plastic bristle brush pom was separated into coarse fine pom 0 001mm and ultrafine ufpom 0 001mm fractions through nested sieves and eventually through a microfiber filter tom and periphyton samples were filtered through a whatman gf c microfiber filter subsequently filtered samples of pom tom and periphyton were dried at 60 c weighed to the nearest 0 1 mg and re weighed after ashing for 3 hours at 500 c the quantity of each particulate organic fraction was expressed as ash free dry matter in g m 2 the quantity of tom and tam was expressed in mg l 1 the amount of periphyton was standardized at 1 m2 of surface area of stones for each site the data collected from the different sampling occasions were pooled together and expressed as mean values calculated from three seasonal replicates in forested and agricultural catchments the percentage of areas covered by particular landuse categories was expressed based on the corine land cover layers these measurements were for computational reasons based on digital elevation models of the terrain the computations were performed in the grass gis environment grass development team 2012 forested basins had a higher than 80 catchment area cover by forest shrubs and fields and pastures covered less than 10 of the area in agricultural basins fields and pasture covered more than 22 of the catchment area and a proportion of forest and shrubs reached maximally 65 there 2 3 statistical analyses in a first step we analysed the response of the stonefly assemblages to the superficial geology land use in the catchments and physico chemical variables with a multivariate approach multivariate analysis was performed with canoco 5 software ter braak and Å¡milauer 2012 first direct gradient analysis with forward selection of environmental variables cca canonical correspondence analysis was used the statistical significance of each variable selected was judged using a monte carlo permutation test prior to this analysis individual densities of species were log transformed and variance inflation factors vifs were inspected in environmental data high values for the vif 20 indicated multicollinearity between some variables and this should be avoided from set of the environmental variables lepÅ¡ and Å¡milauer 1999 the vif values were re calculated in process of the step by step removing the variables and the variables with vif 20 were omitted from further multivariate analyses second geology was added as a covariable to the previous cca for identification of environmental variables which are associated with the type of superficial geology third landuse was added as a covariable to the previous cca for identification of environmental variables which are associated with the type of catchment land use fourth the relative importance of each set of environmental parameters geology landuse others and spatial distribution of sites on stonefly assemblages was evaluated in variation partitioning analysis and variation partitioning analysis with pcnm principal coordinates of neighbor matrices template this method allowed for the decomposition of the variance of the species matrix among the sets of explanatory variables in order to identify their pure and shared contributions to the total variance borcard et al 1992 legendre and legendre 1998 spatial parameter was represented by matrix of air distances which was calculated in the grass gis environment grass development team 2012 in a second step we performed regression analyses generalized linear model with an assumed gaussian or poisson distribution generalized mixed model with an assumed gaussian or poisson distribution to test whether the metrics related to stoneflies are affected by geology type of the studied area and catchment land use assumptions of univariate normal distribution of the data were assessed using bartlett test of variance homogeneity and shapiro wilk normality test as well as based on the diagnostic plots the relevance of including stream as random effect to the created models were based on the akaike information criterion that compares the quality of a set of statistical models univariate statistical analyses were performed in the r 3 6 3 r coreteam 2014 software environment using libraries nlme pinheiro et al 2020 lme4 bates et al 2015 car fox and weisberg 2019 as the stonefly metrics reflecting geology and landuse impacts were used

slopes of the western carpathians all identified taxa are listed in table 3 the observed species belong to six families teniopterygidae nemouridae leuctridae capniidae perlodidae and perliidae after performing the cca we retained the first two axes that explained 59 4 of the total variation based on the position of sampling sites in the ordination space we can deduce that the first axis summarizes differences in the superficial geology while the second axis represent differences in the land cover within geological areas according to the results of the monte carlo test only six variables were retained as they significantly explain the species composition of stoneflies in the study area more in detail streams flowing on volcanic rocks compared to streams that flowed over magmatic metamorphic rocks had higher concentrations of silicon and phosphate ions as well as a higher value of transported inorganic matter on the other hand higher values of particulate organic matter were found in streams flowing over magmatic metamorphic rocks fig 2 on one hand the most of the found leuctridae species inhabited streams that flowed on magmatic metamorphic bedrocks and though forested landscape on the other hand most of found species of the family taeniopterygidae occurred in streams draining forested catchment area of the volcanic mountain range fig 3 a after adding the type of geological bedrock as a covariate to the cca model three environmental variables pom si sio2 and p po4 3 became insignificant fig 3b after fitting this covariate explained variation by variables remaining in the model represented 26 4 four environmental variables explaining 38 of variation in species composition remained significant in cca model explaining when the catchment land use as a covariate was included to this multivariate analysis fig 3c based on the results of previous analyses variation partitioning analysis was used for identifying the unique and shared effect of three groups of environmental variables the first group of parameters relating to lithology consisted of pom and si sio2 the second group of parameters relating to land use consisted of tam and p po4 3 the third group of parameters relating to land use consisted of the annual degree days and tom all unique effects had similar proportions on explained variation in species composition of the stonefly assemblages fig 4 a relative high proportion of shared effect of the lithology and land use was the result of p po4 3 which was associated with geological bedrock as well as with catchment land use geographical position of sites explained about 12 of the total variation in taxonomical composition of the stonefly community while testing the relevant ecological metrics of stonefly to the type of geological bedrock we found that streams on magmatic metamorphic bedrock had significantly higher values of species richness and proportion of brachyptera species as well as lower values of ln index fig 5 one more significant differences in the studied ecological metrics were found in the effect of land use type forested catchment had significantly higher values of stonefly average score and ln index as well as a higher proportion of brachyptera species fig 6 on the other hand significantly lower values were measured in the saprobic index of stonefly assemblages in streams flowing through an agricultural landscape 4 discussion the results of the present study clearly confirm the fact that geology and landuse of the catchment area are two key environmental proxies responsible for the state of aquatic ecosystems as well as the processes inside these multidimensional structures hynes 1975 vannote et al 1980 leland 1995 shearer and young 2011 in the submountain streams of the southern slopes of the western carpathians we demonstrated that geology and landuse through primary environmental variables acting in a stream environment influenced the taxonomical composition of stonefly assemblages our results showed that alternations in stonefly assemblages were linked with changes in sio2 and p po4 3 concentrations as well as in amounts of pom which are a consequence of two different geological bedrocks of the study area on the volcanic bedrock higher concentrations of sio2 and p po4 3 and lower amounts of pom were found the volcanic mountain range of the studied area consists mostly of pyroxene bearing andesites geologickÃ¡ mapa slovenska m 1 50 000 2013 in general soils and waters on these acid volcanic bedrocks have a higher concentrations of silicon than those on other parent rocks including shale quartz granite imaizumi and yoshida 1958 in surface waters of acid to intermediate volcanic bedrocks sio2 originate mostly from dissolution of alumosilicate minerals such as pyroxenes and feldspars bedrock is also the primary source for all phosphorus in a catchment and in some circumstances it can also contribute to the nitrogen concentration in streams holloway et al 1998 in comparison of several geological bedrocks porder and ramachandran 2013 found that within igneous rocks total phosphorus increases from silica rich iron poor rocks such as granite and rhyolite to intermediate rocks such as andesite and iron rich silica poor rocks such as basalt water denudation of phosphorus cations from these igneous lithologies is also slightly higher in acid volcanic rocks than in metamorphic rocks zaharecsu et al 2019 parent bedrock can also influence concentration of phosphorus in streams indirectly through the contain of the other elements notably iron and aluminum which interact with phosphorus sanchez 1976 chacon et al 2006 silicon is an essential element for plant growth because its concentration in the environment significantly affects the nutrient cellulose and phenol content in aboveground plant parts schaller et al 2012a schaller et al 2012b silicon availability for plants can be mirrored in leafs quality and consequently also in quality of detritus according to schaller and struyf 2013 the quality of leafs litter has impact especially on microbial decay whereas the degradation ability of invertebrate shredders is affected only slightly massey and hartley 2009 documented the negative impacts of silicon on digestibility and wear of mandibles in some herbivores in aquatic environment silicon concentration can

1034,rivers and streams possess many characteristics that result from features of their surrounding landscape e g from climate conditions superficial lithology soil profile topography vegetation cover and human activities as well in this study we determined the impact of superficial geology and catchment land use as the key landscape drivers affecting the physico chemical and biological conditions in stream ecosystems on the structure and values of selected ecological metrics relating to stonefly assemblages in order to achieve this goal we sampled 10 mid sized submountain carpathian streams flowing through two different geological bedrocks and draining the catchment areas with different dominant land use as a consequence these differences we analyzed together 16 physico chemical and biological parameters of stream environment our results demonstrate that 4 environmental parameter particulate organic matter transported inorganic matter phosphorus and silicon ions reflecting difference in superficial geology and landuse of the catchment area played a significant role in the structuring of stonefly assemblages we also found that catchment land use had an impact on values of the sas and saprobic indices as well as on the proportion of leuctridae nemouridae and brachyptera species in stonefly assemblages the difference in catchment geology were reflected in values of total species richness and in the proportion of leuctridae nemouridae and brachyptera species as well key words plecoptera slovakia landuse geology ecological metrics 1 introduction according to hynes s paradigm 1975 a river ecosystem integrates itself through a complex of elements and processes which occur in the surrounding riverine landscape catchment land use and superficial geology are considered the two primary extrinsic impacts shaping the structure and processes inside stream ecosystems hynes 1975 vannote et al 1980 richards et al 1996 davies et al 2000 schomberg et al 2005 shearer and young 2011 superficial geology affects the hydrological dynamics and channel morphology of streams as well as the water chemistry the nutrient flux and sedimentation processes within an aquatic environment hughes et al 1994 johnson et al 1997 mcdowell et al 2002 catchment land use influences the intrinsic stream environment through chemical additions from terrestrial runoff as well as through hydrological and hydromorphological modifications e g changes of discharge regime sediment inputs and microhabitat proportions pekarova and pekar 1996 richards et al 1996 johnson et al 1997 armitage and blackburn 2010 in community ecology a conceptual view characterizes organismal assemblages at a given site as the product of interaction between dispersal capacity of species and series of hierarchical environmental filters i e continental regional basin reach channel unit and microhabitat tonn 1990 poff 1997 both superficial geology and landuse belong to these filters through that species needed to pass if they occur in species assemblage at a site geology act at the regional basin scale by filtering species through stream characteristics and it belongs among the major factors that affects the species composition of aquatic invertebrates sandin and johnson 2004 in particular olson 2012 defined 4 different mechanisms through which superficial geology affects the community composition of aquatic invertebrates first geology may indirectly affect organisms through the water chemistry which impacts on the quantity and quality of food resources for example the concentration of calcium ions determines the rate of detritus decomposition chamier and dixon 1983 ph also controls the removal of dissolved organic matter via the flocculation process walsh et al 2009 and stream bedrock is the principal source of phosphorus in an aquatic environment garcia et al 2011 second geology may directly affect organisms through the process of osmoregulation when values of total dissolved solids limit the occurrence and survival of some macroinvertebrate taxa via their osmoregulatory ability minshall and minshall 1978 mcculloch et al 1993 hassell et al 2006 third geology may indirectly affect organisms through the hydrological conditions and temperature regime of the stream streams with higher porosity of the underlying geological layer have more stable groundwater intake and therefore less hydrologic and temperature fluctuation wang et al 2006 a reduction in temperature differences between seasons can be reflected in the change of production and biomass turnover of some taxa huryn et al 1995 beracko and revajovÃ¡ 2019 fourth geology may indirectly affect organisms through meso microhabitat characteristics some geological formations e g having magmatic or volcanic lithology create coarser substrates due to lower erosion while others e g sandstone or flysh produce finer substrate particles according to minshall 1984 substrate coarseness significantly determines the taxonomical composition of benthic invertebrates at the site a human altered riverscape also represents a key regional catchment filter that determines the biodiversity in running waters via changes of hydrological physico chemical and biological conditions in aquatic ecosystems stendera et al 2012 at the regional catchment level the most common negative human impact on a stream ecosystem is considered the modification of the original landscape to urban or agricultural areas roth et al 1996 allan 2004 degradation of stream communities is clearly visible when native forests are converted into fields and pastures quinn and hickey 1990 huryn et al 2002 recently the linkage between underlying geology and land use impact has become a central topic of many scientific articles that relate to the evaluation of aquatic ecosystems especially in connection with increasing intensification of land use worldwide in this sense many of these researches e g allan and johnson 1997 shearer and young 2011 documented that the impact of landuse on an aquatic environment may differ depending on the underlying geology on one hand change from a naturally forested to an agricultural landscape may affect invertebrate communities in a stream regardless of geology type for example through higher solar input change of temperature regime and a higher quantity of flushed nutrient on the other hand potential sedimentation impacts would be expected to be less severe in an agricultural stream that flows through hardly erodable rocks rather than one which drains unstable or highly erodible rocks allan and johnson 1997 stoneflies represent ideal model organisms as they are highly sensitive to any changes in the environment where they live afnor 2007 due to the generally poor dispersion of stoneflies for longer distances allows us to analyze the effect of environmental filters in structuring of the community without including factors relate to dispersal ability of stonefly species the stonefly diversity and community composition well reflect both natural and man induced disturbance and change of aquatic environment resh et al 1988 the structure of stonefly assemblages are also mirrored in some ecological metrics e g ln index krno et al 2015a perlidae index krno and Å¾iak 2012 and brachyptera sp proportion krno and Å¾iak 2012 which react on the human activities in river basins and on the hydromorphological degradation of streams lorenz et al 2004 based on these knowledges we investigate in this study how biotic and abiotic factors following from natural superficial geology and human induced catchment land use conditions are reflected in the environmental differences of streams of the southern slopes of the western carpathians including their stonefly assemblages more exactly the aims of this study were to identify the key environmental drivers that influence species composition and ecological metrics of plecoptera assemblages in submountain streams on the border of the carpathian and pannonian ecoregion 2 methods 2 1 study sites the study area is located on the southern slopes of the western carpathians south western slovakia in the catchment area of the hron ipeÄ¾ and slanÃ¡ rivers we selected 10 submountain streams fig 1 located between 165 and 443 m a s l differing in their lithological substrate table 1 the catchment

complete description of the study area streams and lithological and physico chemical characteristics see table 1 and table 2 2 2 field sampling and data processing quantitative samples of benthic invertebrates were taken seasonally i e in spring and autumn of 2011 and in summer of 2012 the samples were collected using hess s sampler sampled area of 0 8 m2 0 3 mm mesh size from all dominant microhabitats with coverage 5 according to their proportion at the sites in each sampling a total of 20 sub samples were taken at the site aqem consortium 2002 in the field samples were stored in plastic bottles and preserved in a 4 formaldehyde solution in the laboratory stonefly nymphs were separated from detritus and other benthic taxa and identified to the species level according to rauÅ¡er 1980 zwick 2006 fochetti and tierno de figueroa 2008 lubini et al 2012 krno 2013 at each sampling site stonefly adults were collected with an entomological net by sweeping the riparian vegetation in each sampling occasion the adults were identified according to kis 1974 and they were used only for verification of right determination of the stonefly larvae i e their quantities weren t included to the statistical analyses in stonefly larvae the total number of individuals and number of individuals in each species were expressed per 1 m2 of sampling area reflecting current microhabitat proportions substrate proportion was estimated based on the percentage of boulders cobbles pebbles gravel and sand in five random transects through the stream channel at the sampling site at each sampling site water temperature was measured using vemco minilog 8 bit tr temperature dataloggers in one hour intervals during the whole study period annual degree days were calculated as the sum of mean daily temperature during one year stream discharge was measured seasonally with the fp111 handheld water velocity meter stream discharge was calculated based on mean velocities and depths in cells specified across the distance of the channel cross section during fieldwork several hydrochemical parameters ph total dissolved solids dissolved oxygen content were measured with wtw and hach lange portable devices in situ the water samples were filtered using microfilters 0 45 Âµm mesh size the same day the concentration measurements of k ca2 mg2 fe3 si sio2 p po4 3 n no3 were performed using the spectroquant multy portable photocolorimeter device molar concentration of dissolved free co2 was measured by titration with a 0 1m naoh solution and phenolphthalein as an indicator molar concentration of hco3 was measured by titration with a 0 1m hcl solution with a mixed indicator methyl red and bromocresol green five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 was determined in standard 300 ml bod bottles using standard methods delzer and mckenzie 2003 in each sampling occasion we collected additional data referring to trophic resources namely values of the periphyton transported organic matter tom transported inorganic matter tam and particulate organic matter pom tom and tam were taken to the 1 5 liter plastic bottle from the water column pom was sampled with plastic bottles 100 ml using a plastic tube with a diameter of 15 5 cm periphyton was removed from 5 to 7 stones of which we measured the surface area by scrubbing with a plastic bristle brush pom was separated into coarse fine pom 0 001mm and ultrafine ufpom 0 001mm fractions through nested sieves and eventually through a microfiber filter tom and periphyton samples were filtered through a whatman gf c microfiber filter subsequently filtered samples of pom tom and periphyton were dried at 60 c weighed to the nearest 0 1 mg and re weighed after ashing for 3 hours at 500 c the quantity of each particulate organic fraction was expressed as ash free dry matter in g m 2 the quantity of tom and tam was expressed in mg l 1 the amount of periphyton was standardized at 1 m2 of surface area of stones for each site the data collected from the different sampling occasions were pooled together and expressed as mean values calculated from three seasonal replicates in forested and agricultural catchments the percentage of areas covered by particular landuse categories was expressed based on the corine land cover layers these measurements were for computational reasons based on digital elevation models of the terrain the computations were performed in the grass gis environment grass development team 2012 forested basins had a higher than 80 catchment area cover by forest shrubs and fields and pastures covered less than 10 of the area in agricultural basins fields and pasture covered more than 22 of the catchment area and a proportion of forest and shrubs reached maximally 65 there 2 3 statistical analyses in a first step we analysed the response of the stonefly assemblages to the superficial geology land use in the catchments and physico chemical variables with a multivariate approach multivariate analysis was performed with canoco 5 software ter braak and Å¡milauer 2012 first direct gradient analysis with forward selection of environmental variables cca canonical correspondence analysis was used the statistical significance of each variable selected was judged using a monte carlo permutation test prior to this analysis individual densities of species were log transformed and variance inflation factors vifs were inspected in environmental data high values for the vif 20 indicated multicollinearity between some variables and this should be avoided from set of the environmental variables lepÅ¡ and Å¡milauer 1999 the vif values were re calculated in process of the step by step removing the variables and the variables with vif 20 were omitted from further multivariate analyses second geology was added as a covariable to the previous cca for identification of environmental variables which are associated with the type of superficial geology third landuse was added as a covariable to the previous cca for identification of environmental variables which are associated with the type of catchment land use fourth the relative importance of each set of environmental parameters geology landuse others and spatial distribution of sites on stonefly assemblages was evaluated in variation partitioning analysis and variation partitioning analysis with pcnm principal coordinates of neighbor matrices template this method allowed for the decomposition of the variance of the species matrix among the sets of explanatory variables in order to identify their pure and shared contributions to the total variance borcard et al 1992 legendre and legendre 1998 spatial parameter was represented by matrix of air distances which was calculated in the grass gis environment grass development team 2012 in a second step we performed regression analyses generalized linear model with an assumed gaussian or poisson distribution generalized mixed model with an assumed gaussian or poisson distribution to test whether the metrics related to stoneflies are affected by geology type of the studied area and catchment land use assumptions of univariate normal distribution of the data were assessed using bartlett test of variance homogeneity and shapiro wilk normality test as well as based on the diagnostic plots the relevance of including stream as random effect to the created models were based on the akaike information criterion that compares the quality of a set of statistical models univariate statistical analyses were performed in the r 3 6 3 r

slopes of the western carpathians all identified taxa are listed in table 3 the observed species belong to six families teniopterygidae nemouridae leuctridae capniidae perlodidae and perliidae after performing the cca we retained the first two axes that explained 59 4 of the total variation based on the position of sampling sites in the ordination space we can deduce that the first axis summarizes differences in the superficial geology while the second axis represent differences in the land cover within geological areas according to the results of the monte carlo test only six variables were retained as they significantly explain the species composition of stoneflies in the study area more in detail streams flowing on volcanic rocks compared to streams that flowed over magmatic metamorphic rocks had higher concentrations of silicon and phosphate ions as well as a higher value of transported inorganic matter on the other hand higher values of particulate organic matter were found in streams flowing over magmatic metamorphic rocks fig 2 on one hand the most of the found leuctridae species inhabited streams that flowed on magmatic metamorphic bedrocks and though forested landscape on the other hand most of found species of the family taeniopterygidae occurred in streams draining forested catchment area of the volcanic mountain range fig 3 a after adding the type of geological bedrock as a covariate to the cca model three environmental variables pom si sio2 and p po4 3 became insignificant fig 3b after fitting this covariate explained variation by variables remaining in the model represented 26 4 four environmental variables explaining 38 of variation in species composition remained significant in cca model explaining when the catchment land use as a covariate was included to this multivariate analysis fig 3c based on the results of previous analyses variation partitioning analysis was used for identifying the unique and shared effect of three groups of environmental variables the first group of parameters relating to lithology consisted of pom and si sio2 the second group of parameters relating to land use consisted of tam and p po4 3 the third group of parameters relating to land use consisted of the annual degree days and tom all unique effects had similar proportions on explained variation in species composition of the stonefly assemblages fig 4 a relative high proportion of shared effect of the lithology and land use was the result of p po4 3 which was associated with geological bedrock as well as with catchment land use geographical position of sites explained about 12 of the total variation in taxonomical composition of the stonefly community while testing the relevant ecological metrics of stonefly to the type of geological bedrock we found that streams on magmatic metamorphic bedrock had significantly higher values of species richness and proportion of brachyptera species as well as lower values of ln index fig 5 one more significant differences in the studied ecological metrics were found in the effect of land use type forested catchment had significantly higher values of stonefly average score and ln index as well as a higher proportion of brachyptera species fig 6 on the other hand significantly lower values were measured in the saprobic index of stonefly assemblages in streams flowing through an agricultural landscape 4 discussion the results of the present study clearly confirm the fact that geology and landuse of the catchment area are two key environmental proxies responsible for the state of aquatic ecosystems as well as the processes inside these multidimensional structures hynes 1975 vannote et al 1980 leland 1995 shearer and young 2011 in the submountain streams of the southern slopes of the western carpathians we demonstrated that geology and landuse through primary environmental variables acting in a stream environment influenced the taxonomical composition of stonefly assemblages our results showed that alternations in stonefly assemblages were linked with changes in sio2 and p po4 3 concentrations as well as in amounts of pom which are a consequence of two different geological bedrocks of the study area on the volcanic bedrock higher concentrations of sio2 and p po4 3 and lower amounts of pom were found the volcanic mountain range of the studied area consists mostly of pyroxene bearing andesites geologickÃ¡ mapa slovenska m 1 50 000 2013 in general soils and waters on these acid volcanic bedrocks have a higher concentrations of silicon than those on other parent rocks including shale quartz granite imaizumi and yoshida 1958 in surface waters of acid to intermediate volcanic bedrocks sio2 originate mostly from dissolution of alumosilicate minerals such as pyroxenes and feldspars bedrock is also the primary source for all phosphorus in a catchment and in some circumstances it can also contribute to the nitrogen concentration in streams holloway et al 1998 in comparison of several geological bedrocks porder and ramachandran 2013 found that within igneous rocks total phosphorus increases from silica rich iron poor rocks such as granite and rhyolite to intermediate rocks such as andesite and iron rich silica poor rocks such as basalt water denudation of phosphorus cations from these igneous lithologies is also slightly higher in acid volcanic rocks than in metamorphic rocks zaharecsu et al 2019 parent bedrock can also influence concentration of phosphorus in streams indirectly through the contain of the other elements notably iron and aluminum which interact with phosphorus sanchez 1976 chacon et al 2006 silicon is an essential element for plant growth because its concentration in the environment significantly affects the nutrient cellulose and phenol content in aboveground plant parts schaller et al 2012a schaller et al 2012b silicon availability for plants can be mirrored in leafs quality and consequently also in quality of detritus according to schaller and struyf 2013 the quality of leafs litter has impact especially on microbial decay whereas the degradation ability of invertebrate shredders is affected only slightly massey and hartley 2009 documented the negative impacts of silicon on digestibility and wear of mandibles in some herbivores in aquatic environment silicon concentration can limit the occurrence of some benthic invertebrates in this way especially some shredders and grazers in stonefly assemblages of forested granite streams feeding generalists leuctridae species were
