10180,eucalyptus is widely planted in south china and has high economic and ecological values however the seasonal drought in southern china severely limits the productivity of eucalyptus plantation in this study the dry season irrigation was carried out after the conventional production and planting of eucalyptus the diurnal changes of photosynthetic characteristics of eucalyptus plantations were measured in july october 2017 and january may 2018 to explore the diurnal and seasonal variations and their responses to both dry season irrigation and environmental factors the results showed that during the first year growth of eucalyptus urophylla e grandis plantation 1 the diurnal changes of the trees under different treatments showed single peak curves with the varied occurrence time of the highest photosynthetic characteristics in different months the e urophylla e grandis without dry season irrigation ck and f had transpiration midday depression in january and that with the only dry season irrigation w exhibited both photosynthetic and transpiration midday depression in may 2 the trees of ck and f were subjected to mild drought stress in the dry season and their maximum photosynthetic and transpiration rate were lower than those of w and wf treatment respectively but they had higher maximum wue the trees of w had significantly higher daily net co2 assimilation and daily water transpiration in dry season 3 the diurnal changes of photosynthetic characteristics were mainly influenced by water vapor pressure deficit vpd at the corresponding time of the month 4 in the short term treatments dry season irrigation and fertilization significantly increased the biomass of e urophylla e grandis dry season irrigation alleviated the mild drought stress for gas exchange in the dry season and further promote the biomass of e urophylla e grandis this study provided an important practical exploration for improving the productivity of e urophylla e grandis plantation in seasonal arid areas keywords dry season irrigation eucalyptus urophylla e grandis plantation diurnal and seasonal variation photosynthetic characteristics midday depression 1 introduction in the context of global changes the precipitation pattern in south china is changing according to the 2014 comprehensive report of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc precipitation in most parts of south china has shown a decreasing trend over the past 60 years ipcc 2014 although the rainfall in south china is relatively abundant it is unevenly distributed in time the precipitation from october to march of each year is less than 20 of the whole year showing obvious dry and wet seasons zhu et al 2013 therefore plants are susceptible to drought stress in the dry season xin et al 2006 the meteorological data of guangdong province from 1962 to 2006 showed that the frequency and severity of seasonal drought increased year by year guo et al 2008 according to the data of the guangzhou meteorological bureau in 2019 the average precipitation from september to december 2019 was only 41 2 mm and the lowest area was only 4 6 mm therefore the severity and duration of seasonal drought in south china are increasing the productivity of plantation forests in south china is severely limited by this seasonal drought fu et al 2014 pima et al 2016 meanwhile air temperature ta and photosynthetically active radiation par are higher in the rainy season from april to september in south china zhou et al 2011 these environmental changes including relative air humidity rh par and ta would also have effects on leaf photosynthesis robe and griffiths 1990 bernacchi et al 2001 eucalyptus is one of the three fastest growing tree species in the world and its planting area is currently more than 3 6 million hectares in china jin et al 2015 different fertilization treatments have carried out for eucalyptus species phosphorus application could improve the leaf water content and photosynthesis of eucalyptus plants under drought stress via the enhancement of plant nitrogen nutrition tariq et al 2019 and leaf phosphorus compound content warren 2011 potassium fertilization increased plant water use efficiency in e grandis plantations asensio et al 2020 nitrogen addition increased maximum photosynthetic rate with the increase of leaf nitrogen content but had no effect on leaf specific hydraulic conductivity of e grandis trees clearwater and meinzer 2001 moreover drought stress would limit eucalyptus height growth and reduce net co2 assimilation rate stomatal conductance and transpiration rate and then increase phenols content total soluble sugars zhou et al 2014 jesus et al 2015 for hormonal dynamics drought caused an increase in abscisic acid aba and abscisic acid glucose ester aba ge levels in all plant parts of e globulus correia et al 2014 in addition the phenotypic plasticity of eucalyptus species under drought conditions had been extensively studied white et al 2000 merchant et al 2007 mokotedi 2010 warren et al 2011 water supply helped eucalyptus species recover from drought stress and increased growth rate stape et al 2010 salicylic acid application also could improve water deficit tolerance of e globulus by improving water potential with a positive impact in photosynthetic rate soluble sugars total phenols and less lipid peroxidation gindaba et al 2005 there were also other works studying eucalyptus species to find how leaf photosynthesis and productivity changed under dynamic temperature ghannoum et al 2010 and rainfall gradient cernusak et al 2011 however dynamic changes in the diurnal variation of photosynthesis under fertilization and dry season irrigation were rarely been reported in addition the diurnal variation of photosynthetic characteristics of eucalyptus leaves can further elucidate the resource utilization strategies and response mechanisms the results can provide a theoretical basis for rational and scientific application of fertilization and irrigation in eucalyptus plantation this experiment selected the commercial production of e urophylla e grandis studying leaf diurnal variation of photosynthesis under different treatments of dry season irrigation and fertilization leaf photosynthetic and transpiration midday depression was associated with high leaf water deficit caused by high atmospheric evaporative demand and or soil water limitation franco and lüttge 2002 valladares and pearcy 1997 stomatal closure and photoinhibitory damage were the major physiological factors responsible for the midday depression muraoka et al 2000 many studies had showed that the size of plant fruits and crop yields were significantly increased under the effect of water supplement in the dry season and or arid area pierantozzi et al 2020 soliman et al 2020 meanwhile changes in soil moisture throughout the day and in different seasons as well as changes in the environment light intensity and water vapor pressure deficit all would affect the photosynthetic rate researches have showed that there was a peak shape change in the diurnal photosynthetic variations of other eucalyptus plant leaves eamus and cole 1997 prior et al 1997 which rose first and then decreased with time therefore the following hypothesis is proposed in this paper i the diurnal photosynthetic variation is also a peak shape curve and e urophylla e grandis may have photosynthetic midday depression in the dry season for its high transpiration ii the diurnal variations of photosynthetic characteristics are more influenced by daily environmental changes than by dry season irrigation and fertilization iii dry season irrigation can alleviate seasonal drought and increase photosynthetic and transpiration rate thus increasing the daily net assimilation in dry season iv dry season irrigation and fertilization would promote the growth of e urophylla e grandis by affecting the diurnal and seasonal variation of photosynthetic characteristics the aim of this experiment is to reveal the response mechanisms of dry season irrigation and fertilization on the photosynthetic dynamics of e urophylla e grandis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and plant material the test forestland was in the south china agricultural university scau teaching research base in zengcheng district guangzhou 23 14 48n 113 38 20e characterized by a typical subtropical monsoon climate with an annual average precipitation of c 1921 6 mm of which about 80 occurs in the rainy season april to september mean annual temperature is 21 6 c according to the data of guangzhou weather during the dry season measured in 2017 2018 the monthly precipitation was from 0 8 to 304 3 mm in zengcheng district guangzhou the mean precipitation during the dry season was only 50 2 mm there were 8 out of 11 months of mean temperature above 18 c at which the maximum tree growth can be achieved queiroz et al 2020 especially in december 2017 the precipitation was only 0 8 mm fig 1 the e urophylla e grandis seedlings were all approximately 20 35 cm tall well planted with no disease or mechanical damage in april 2017 the planting density was 3 2 m 1667 plants hm2 seedlings tend to have a shallower root system and more fragile resistance so they are more susceptible to stress from the external environment than mature trees moreover water availability was considered as the most important factor for total xylem cell production during early stage of tree growth deslauriers et al 2016 therefore studying the impact of the dry season irrigation on seedlings can better provide data support for ensuring the rapid and healthy growth of seedlings during the early planting of eucalyptus plantations under seasonal drought conditions 2 2 experimental method the experiment was designed with the orthogonal design of water and fertilizer the details were described in yu et al 2019 water supplied only in the dry season of each year using drip irrigation equipment the total plot area was about 0 57 hm2 the forestland was divided into five terraces with the adoption of the horizontal terraced land preparation method each terrace had 4 treatments randomly arranged from 20 to 92 trees for different plot areas the four treatments in each terrace was 1 no water and no fertilizer ck 2 water but no fertilizer w 3 no water but fertilizer f and 4 water and fertilizer wf the measured trees were in the middle of the treated plot to avoid the impact of marginal utility as possible the dry season irrigation here ensured that the relative water content soil water content field water capacity of the soil from 40 cm depth and 40 cm away from the trees was maintained at 90 for three days the irrigation time was from october 1st 2017 to march 31st 2018 a total of 22 weeks drip irrigation was given 8 h week at 4 l h a total of 32 l week each plant was given a total of 704 l for the experiment the fertilizer additions were completely same as the added amount of eucalyptus production the base fertilizer was applied at 400 g per hole on march 25 2017 and the amount of fertilizer applied was consistent with that of production the total amount of each element was n 24 g p 72 g and k 24 g on july 29th the top dressing was applied for the f and wf treatments a total of 300 g plant the total amount of each element was n 45 g p 21 g and k 24 g the average background soil total n total p and total k were 0 34 g kg 1 0 16 g kg 1 and 8 82 g kg 1 respectively in ck and w 2 3 index measurements 2 3 1 environmental factors the soil water content swc was measured once a month with five repeats for each treatment a small aluminum box of soil samples was taken from three random places in each planting plot 40 cm away from the trees and 40 cm deep all the boxes were weighed and put in an oven at 105 until the weights were constant dry weights were recorded and calculate the soil moisture content swc fresh weight dry weight dry weight aluminum box weight 100 the field moisture capacity was measured with the ring knife method the relative soil water content swcr was calculated as swc divided the field moisture capacity we used weatherhawk weather station campbell scientific usa to collect meteorological factors every half an hour the information collected by the weather station includes air temperature ta c and air relative humidity rh the water vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated according to the formula nolan et al 2016 vpd 0 611 exp 17 27 ta ta 237 3 1 rh the meteorological data in this study were all from 7 00 to 17 00 during the daytime without any rainfall to meet the similar environment during the measurement of the diurnal change of photosynthetic characteristics 2 3 2 gas exchange traits the experiments were conducted in july october 2017 and january may 2018 with 2 days of clear and rainless weather every month and 5 sample trees with the same growth trend were selected from each treatment taking three mature leaves in the middle and upper part of the south to measure with the li 6400 portable photosynthesis analysis system the transparent leaf chamber was used for measuring the instantaneous photosynthetic diurnal changes of the leaves the temperature was set to the leaf temperature at the time of the measurement the external buffer bottle regulated the co2 concentration to ensure that it is consistent with the external environment co2 concentration daytime measurements were taken at 7 00 9 00 11 00 13 00 and 17 00 photosynthetically active radiation par μmol m 2 s 1 net photosynthetic rate pn μmol co2 m 2 s 1 transpiration rate tr mmol h2o m 2 s 1 were measured and the instantaneous water use efficiency wue μmol co2 mmol 1 h2o was calculated as pn tr the daily net co2 assimilation p d mmol co2 m 2 d 1 was the area enclosed by the net photosynthetic rate curve with the horizontal axis of time the p d was calculated according to the following formula p d i 1 j pn i 1 pn i 2 t i 1 t i 3600 1000 the pn i μmol co2 m 2 s 1 and ti h referred to the measuring point net photosynthetic rate and time at the beginning of the measurement respectively the pn i 1 and ti 1 were the next point of the net photosynthetic rate and time respectively the number 3600 and 1000 were the unit conversion factors the daily water transpiration t d mol h2o m 2 d 1 was calculated by the same method as the p d the maximum net photosynthetic rate pn max maximum transpiration rate tr max and maximum instantaneous water use efficiency wuemax were selected from the highest values of the diurnal photosynthetic characteristics 2 3 3 growth traits the basal diameter and height of all the e urophylla e grandis were measured every month from july 2017 to june 2018 the growth rate of basal diameter and height were the differences between the following month and the previous month divided by the time between the two measurements after one year of treatment 5 trees of each treatment with average growth were selected to be cut down and their roots were dug all the aboveground and underground parts were brought back to the laboratory for drying and weighing to calculate the biomass of the trees under different treatments 2 4 statistical analysis excel 2013 computer package program and spss 18 0 statistical analysis software were used for duncan s multiple comparison analysis bivariate correlation analysis and regression analysis of the environmental factors and photosynthetic characteristics for correlation analysis the mean values of all measured data were log transformed to improve normality and heteroscedasticity the multivariate general linear model mglm including three fixed factors dry season irrigation fertilization and month along with three covariates vpd par and measured time was used to account for the diurnal variations of photosynthetic characteristics 3 results 3 1 diurnal variation of photosynthetic characteristics under different treatments most diurnal changes of photosynthetic characteristics of e urophylla e grandis showed single peak curve change patterns fig 2 however in january the treatments without dry season irrigation ck and f showed transpiration midday depressions fig 2b 3 in may treatment w had both photosynthesis and transpiration midday depressions fig 2a 4 b 4 the highest daily pn appeared between 9 00 and 13 00 in four months the highest pn 11 00 13 00 appearing in january was later than that in july 9 00 11 00 october and may 11 00 during the experiment the highest daytime tr appeared between 11 00 and 15 00 the highest tr of each treatment appeared at the same time as the highest pn did in october and may the highest pn of ck appeared before the highest tr but these two values of other treatments w f and wf were reached synchronously in july the highest pn and tr of the four treatments appeared at different time in january the highest pn appeared at the same time as the highest tr in wf the highest tr of both ck and f occurred at about 15 00 which was later than the appearance of the highest pn the highest tr in w turned up at 13 00 before the appearance of the highest pn the mean wue was higher in october and january than that in may and was lowest in july fig 2c 1 c 4 diurnal variation of the wue also showed fluctuations that first increased and then decreased among different treatments in the four months 3 2 seasonal variation of photosynthetic characteristics under different treatments the swcr was quite low in the dry season without dry season irrigation table 1 the swcr of ck and f were only 67 48 and 57 40 respectively which were lower than that of w 90 56 and wf 83 44 there was no significant difference in the swcr of the four treatments in the rainy season table 1 the swcr in four treatments were all above 80 the maximum photosynthetic characteristics also showed different changes among four treatments in dry season and rainy season table 1 the maximum net photosynthetic rate pn max of the f treatment 10 84 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 was significantly lower than that of other three treatments in the dry season there were significant differences in the maximum transpiration tr max of the four treatments and their band order was w 3 31 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 ck 2 85 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 wf 2 68 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 f 2 13 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 during the dry season however the trees of f showed significantly higher maximum instantaneous water use efficiency wuemax μmol co2 mmol h2o 1 than that of other treatments and the trees with the dry season irrigation w and wf had lowest wuemax in dry season while during the rainy season the trees with fertilization treatment f and wf had significantly higher pn max and tr max than that of ck and w but the wuemax among the four treatments had no significant differences in the rainy season moreover there were no significant differences in the range of diurnal photosynthetic characteristics the range of net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate and instantaneous water use efficiency among four treatments in both dry season and rainy season table s1 the daily net co2 assimilation p d and daily water transpiration t d also changed differently among four treatments in the dry and wet seasons table 1 in the dry season the trees without fertilization ck and w had higher p d and t d and the w treatment had highest p d 333 27 mmol co2 m 2 d 1 and t d 77 11 mol h2o m 2 d 1 however the results were just the opposite in the rainy season the wf had highest p d and t d though there were no significant differences among four treatments 3 3 relationships between environmental factors and photosynthetic characteristics the variation of ta during the daytime in the experimental area was fluctuated in different seasons fig 3a the ta was higher in may and july 26 9 33 2 c and the lowest temperature occured in january 8 6 c the daily maximum temperature occured at different time in each month it appeared at 9 00 in july at 11 00 in october and at 13 00 in january and may the daily change of vpd was a single peak curve and the mean vpd during the day was may july october january fig 3b from the measured par fig 3c it was found that the highest par in different months appeared at 11 00 the highest par during the day occurred in july 1634 9 μmol m 2 s 1 there were correlations between photosynthetic characteristics and environmental factors table 2 fig 4 in both dry and rainy seasons the diurnal variation of pn and tr showed significant correlations with the variation of ta rh vpd par p 0 05 and p 0 01 respectively table 2 the wue was also significantly correlated with rh vpd par in the two seasons but was only correlated with ta in the rainy season all data together the photosynthetic characteristics under different treatment also showed different correlations with environmental factors fig 4 the pn were all positively correlated with par fig 4a 1 and vpd figs 4a 3 respectively in the four treatments however only the pn of ck and wf had correlations with ta fig 4a 2 the tr were all positively correlated with par ta and vpd respectively in the four treatments fig 4b only the wue of the w treatment had correlations with par fig 4c 1 the wue had no relationships with ta and vpd for all treatments and together fig 4c 2 3 3 4 the multivariate general linear model mglm of the photosynthetic characteristics according to the multivariate general linear model mglm the diurnal variations of the photosynthetic characteristics were mostly influenced by the time and environmental factors but not the additional treatments table 3 dry season irrigation fertilization and their mixed effects all had no significant impacts on the photosynthetic characteristics in different months table s2 and all data table 3 the variation of month vpd par and measured time accounted for 89 and 93 of the diurnal variation of pn and wue respectively the tr was mostly influenced by the month par and measured time r 2 0 78 3 5 effects of fertilization and dry season irrigation on the growth fertilization significantly increased the growth rate of tree height and basal diameter in four measured months fig 5 dry season irrigation effectively increased the growth rate of height and basal diameter in the dry season but the performance was different between october and january fig 5 both growth rate of height and basal diameter of the trees under dry season irrigation showed a further increase of 29 and 57 respectively on the basis of fertilization treatment in october wf vs f however the two growth rates had only little increase for w compared with ck treatment in january the growth rate of height and basal diameter showed different patterns the height growth rate of wf was highest among the four treatments under the fertilized condition and the non fertilized condition the tree height of the dry season irrigation treatments increased by 32 wf vs f and 86 w vs ck respectively however the treatment w had highest basal diameter growth rate on the contrary the basal diameter growth rate of wf was lower than that of treatment f and only higher than that of ck finally compared with ck treatment the biomass of the fertilization treatment f increased by about 12 times during the experimental period with the significant increase of height 126 and basal diameter 121 table 4 under the fertilized condition and the non fertilized condition the single tree biomass of the dry season irrigation treatments increased by 11 wf vs f and 79 w vs ck respectively with the increase of both height and basal diameter 4 discussion 4 1 effects of dry season irrigation and fertilization on diurnal variations of photosynthetic characteristics most of the diurnal variations of pn tr and wue showed single peak curves under different treatments in the different months fig 2 however in the dry season january the trees of ck and f showed transpiration midday depressions different plants had different diurnal and seasonal variations of photosynthetic characteristics under same conditions chen et al 2019 and the midday depressions of leaf photosynthesis and transpiration during diurnal variation were important indicators of the degree of stress being endured pinheiro and chaves 2011 the soil of ck and f treatments were more arid than that of w and wf due to the dry season irrigation meanwhile the whole month was at the lowest level of precipitation among the whole year in january therefore drought stresses of ck and f in january were the strongest among the four observed months under extreme drought conditions leaf transpiration intensity would change with par patanè 2010 and the par at 13 00 decline rapidly in january by closing some or all of the stomata the transpiration of the leaves was reduced to maintain the water balance of the leaves to survive in extreme drought buckley 2005 this might be the reason why the e urophylla e grandis of ck and f in january had transpiration midday depression we also found that the e urophylla e grandis of w had photosynthetic and transpiration midday depression in may 2018 the e urophylla e grandis of wf grew better than that of w under fertilization fageria et al 2008 so that the former required greater transpiration to meet more carbon assimilation during the treatment therefore the soil moisture of wf would be less than that of w the photosynthesis of wf treatment e urophylla e grandis adapted this soil moisture and the leaves could keep high photosynthetic rate in midday see the results in october and january of fig 2 despite the rainy season in may rainfall was still low 144 mm therefore the e urophylla e grandis of wf that had adapted to such low soil moisture had no photosynthetic and transpiration midday depression in may moreover thanks to the onset of the rainy season in may the drought stress of ck and f was alleviated but the e urophylla e grandis still did not fully restore photosynthetic ability restricted transpiration of e urophylla e grandis of ck and f was not sufficient to cause photosynthetic and transpiration midday depression in addition the diurnal variations of the photosynthetic characteristics were not influenced by dry season irrigation and fertilization but changed with month environmental factors and time table 3 plants could adapt to their changing surroundings by regulating their functional traits and metabolic enzyme activity abley et al 2016 however this adaptation might be mostly affected by genetics for some plants laitinen and nikoloski 2018 including the e urophylla e grandis in this study all the three photosynthetic characteristics were significantly influenced by par at the measured time of the month no matter what the trees were treated with in this study moreover the stomata sensitivity to vpd was greater for eucalyptus lim et al 2020 thus the pn was also significantly affected by vpd 4 2 effects of dry season irrigation and fertilization on seasonal variations of photosynthetic characteristics during the first year of the e urophylla e grandis seedlings planting the swcr of ck and f were only 67 48 and 57 40 respectively in the dry season which were under mild drought conditions dong et al 2013 in this study the trees of f had lowest pn max and tr max in the dry season the decrease of photosynthetic rate was mainly due to the closure of leaf stomata i e stomatal limitation earl 2002 drought stress could induce stomatal closure and reduce the maximum quantum efficiency of psii resulting in reduced photosynthesis lawlor and cornic 2002 yang et al 2017 the temperature and vpd were not very high in the dry season which caused the transpiration rates in the dry season much lower than that of rainy season the stomatal sensitivity to leaf water potential and soil water status might be high for e urophylla e grandis this strategy helped plants fully open stomata when water status was well and close them when water status was unfavorable williams and ehleringer 2000 addington et al 2004 mcdowell et al 2008 while the pn was mostly influenced by par table 3 so that the decrease of pn was less than that of transpiration this might be the reason why trees of f had highest wuemax in the dry season meanwhile the pn max and tr max increased significantly under the fertilization treatment with the adequate water supply in the rainy season table 1 it has been widely accepted that the moderate nutrients addition would promote the photosynthesis and growth of the plants wu et al 2017 for example nitrogen n helped to increase carboxylation capacity during the photosynthetic process ainsworth and rogers 2007 the maximum rate of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco mediated carboxylation vcmax depended on leaf n and increasing leaf phosphorus p would affect the sensitivity of vcmax to leaf n walker et al 2014 fertilizer also changed leaf structural traits such as specific leaf area sla scalon et al 2017 the thickness of spongy tissues wang et al 2020 chlorophyll content dumroese et al 2013 and so on therefore more work on the response of the leaf structure and other functional traits of e urophylla e grandis to water and fertilizer needs to be further studied 4 3 effects of dry season irrigation and fertilization on the growth short term water and fertilizer treatments had no significant effects on the diurnal photosynthetic variations of e urophylla e grandis however the leaf area was significantly larger under the dry season irrigation and fertilization yu et al 2019 therefore the total biomass of the e urophylla e grandis was finally promoted with both water and fertilizer supply the trees with fertilization f and wf tended to allocate more nutrients to grow more leaves than to single leaf photosynthesis this strategy helped e urophylla e grandis seedlings to occupy position more quickly the changes in other leaf characteristics the number of leaves and total leaf areas yu et al 2019 distribution strategies of coarse and fine roots reubens et al 2007 and loading and transportation strategy of the phloem ryan and shinichi 2014 may be account for the changes in the productivity of e urophylla e grandis plantation after dry season irrigation the changes and adaptation of embolization regulation strategies of e urophylla e grandis during and after the dry season with the irrigation treatment could also influence the whole plant water supplement niu et al 2017 which influenced the resorption of nutrients from old leaves to new ones zhang et al 2015 5 conclusions photosynthetic characteristics play important roles for the productivity of plantations and their diurnal and seasonal dynamics influence the overall production of plantations there was a typical seasonal drought in south china and we designed a forestland drip irrigation technology for the normal production of e urophylla e grandis plantations during the dry season to try to increase its productivity in the one year of the testing we found neither dry season irrigation nor fertilization had effects on diurnal variations of photosynthetic characteristics the fluctuation of photosynthetic characteristics depended more on environmental factors especially vpd dry season irrigation alleviated the mild drought in the dry season and improved the maximum photosynthetic and transpiration rate the biomass of e urophylla e grandis under traditional fertilization conditions was further improved by dry season irrigation this research has important guiding significance for the wild cultivation and tending of eucalyptus in the seasonal drought region which provides theoretical support for the related research on the formation process of eucalyptus productivity

10180,eucalyptus is widely planted in south china and has high economic and ecological values however the seasonal drought in southern china severely limits the productivity of eucalyptus plantation in this study the dry season irrigation was carried out after the conventional production and planting of eucalyptus the diurnal changes of photosynthetic characteristics of eucalyptus plantations were measured in july october 2017 and january may 2018 to explore the diurnal and seasonal variations and their responses to both dry season irrigation and environmental factors the results showed that during the first year growth of eucalyptus urophylla e grandis plantation 1 the diurnal changes of the trees under different treatments showed single peak curves with the varied occurrence time of the highest photosynthetic characteristics in different months the e urophylla e grandis without dry season irrigation ck and f had transpiration midday depression in january and that with the only dry season irrigation w exhibited both photosynthetic and transpiration midday depression in may 2 the trees of ck and f were subjected to mild drought stress in the dry season and their maximum photosynthetic and transpiration rate were lower than those of w and wf treatment respectively but they had higher maximum wue the trees of w had significantly higher daily net co2 assimilation and daily water transpiration in dry season 3 the diurnal changes of photosynthetic characteristics were mainly influenced by water vapor pressure deficit vpd at the corresponding time of the month 4 in the short term treatments dry season irrigation and fertilization significantly increased the biomass of e urophylla e grandis dry season irrigation alleviated the mild drought stress for gas exchange in the dry season and further promote the biomass of e urophylla e grandis this study provided an important practical exploration for improving the productivity of e urophylla e grandis plantation in seasonal arid areas keywords dry season irrigation eucalyptus urophylla e grandis plantation diurnal and seasonal variation photosynthetic characteristics midday depression 1 introduction in the context of global changes the precipitation pattern in south china is changing according to the 2014 comprehensive report of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc precipitation in most parts of south china has shown a decreasing trend over the past 60 years ipcc 2014 although the rainfall in south china is relatively abundant it is unevenly distributed in time the precipitation from october to march of each year is less than 20 of the whole year showing obvious dry and wet seasons zhu et al 2013 therefore plants are susceptible to drought stress in the dry season xin et al 2006 the meteorological data of guangdong province from 1962 to 2006 showed that the frequency and severity of seasonal drought increased year by year guo et al 2008 according to the data of the guangzhou meteorological bureau in 2019 the average precipitation from september to december 2019 was only 41 2 mm and the lowest area was only 4 6 mm therefore the severity and duration of seasonal drought in south china are increasing the productivity of plantation forests in south china is severely limited by this seasonal drought fu et al 2014 pima et al 2016 meanwhile air temperature ta and photosynthetically active radiation par are higher in the rainy season from april to september in south china zhou et al 2011 these environmental changes including relative air humidity rh par and ta would also have effects on leaf photosynthesis robe and griffiths 1990 bernacchi et al 2001 eucalyptus is one of the three fastest growing tree species in the world and its planting area is currently more than 3 6 million hectares in china jin et al 2015 different fertilization treatments have carried out for eucalyptus species phosphorus application could improve the leaf water content and photosynthesis of eucalyptus plants under drought stress via the enhancement of plant nitrogen nutrition tariq et al 2019 and leaf phosphorus compound content warren 2011 potassium fertilization increased plant water use efficiency in e grandis plantations asensio et al 2020 nitrogen addition increased maximum photosynthetic rate with the increase of leaf nitrogen content but had no effect on leaf specific hydraulic conductivity of e grandis trees clearwater and meinzer 2001 moreover drought stress would limit eucalyptus height growth and reduce net co2 assimilation rate stomatal conductance and transpiration rate and then increase phenols content total soluble sugars zhou et al 2014 jesus et al 2015 for hormonal dynamics drought caused an increase in abscisic acid aba and abscisic acid glucose ester aba ge levels in all plant parts of e globulus correia et al 2014 in addition the phenotypic plasticity of eucalyptus species under drought conditions had been extensively studied white et al 2000 merchant et al 2007 mokotedi 2010 warren et al 2011 water supply helped eucalyptus species recover from drought stress and increased growth rate stape et al 2010 salicylic acid application also could improve water deficit tolerance of e globulus by improving water potential with a positive impact in photosynthetic rate soluble sugars total phenols and less lipid peroxidation gindaba et al 2005 there were also other works studying eucalyptus species to find how leaf photosynthesis and productivity changed under dynamic temperature ghannoum et al 2010 and rainfall gradient cernusak et al 2011 however dynamic changes in the diurnal variation of photosynthesis under fertilization and dry season irrigation were rarely been reported in addition the diurnal variation of photosynthetic characteristics of eucalyptus leaves can further elucidate the resource utilization strategies and response mechanisms the results can provide a theoretical basis for rational and scientific application of fertilization and irrigation in eucalyptus plantation this experiment selected the commercial production of e urophylla e grandis studying

water deficit caused by high atmospheric evaporative demand and or soil water limitation franco and lüttge 2002 valladares and pearcy 1997 stomatal closure and photoinhibitory damage were the major physiological factors responsible for the midday depression muraoka et al 2000 many studies had showed that the size of plant fruits and crop yields were significantly increased under the effect of water supplement in the dry season and or arid area pierantozzi et al 2020 soliman et al 2020 meanwhile changes in soil moisture throughout the day and in different seasons as well as changes in the environment light intensity and water vapor pressure deficit all would affect the photosynthetic rate researches have showed that there was a peak shape change in the diurnal photosynthetic variations of other eucalyptus plant leaves eamus and cole 1997 prior et al 1997 which rose first and then decreased with time therefore the following hypothesis is proposed in this paper i the diurnal photosynthetic variation is also a peak shape curve and e urophylla e grandis may have photosynthetic midday depression in the dry season for its high transpiration ii the diurnal variations of photosynthetic characteristics are more influenced by daily environmental changes than by dry season irrigation and fertilization iii dry season irrigation can alleviate seasonal drought and increase photosynthetic and transpiration rate thus increasing the daily net assimilation in dry season iv dry season irrigation and fertilization would promote the growth of e urophylla e grandis by affecting the diurnal and seasonal variation of photosynthetic characteristics the aim of this experiment is to reveal the response mechanisms of dry season irrigation and fertilization on the photosynthetic dynamics of e urophylla e grandis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and plant material the test forestland was in the south china agricultural university scau teaching research base in zengcheng district guangzhou 23 14 48n 113 38 20e characterized by a typical subtropical monsoon climate with an annual average precipitation of c 1921 6 mm of which about 80 occurs in the rainy season april to september mean annual temperature is 21 6 c according to the data of guangzhou weather during the dry season measured in 2017 2018 the monthly precipitation was from 0 8 to 304 3 mm in zengcheng district guangzhou the mean precipitation during the dry season was only 50 2 mm there were 8 out of 11 months of mean temperature above 18 c at which the maximum tree growth can be achieved queiroz et al 2020 especially in december 2017 the precipitation was only 0 8 mm fig 1 the e urophylla e grandis seedlings were all approximately 20 35 cm tall well planted with no disease or mechanical damage in april 2017 the planting density was 3 2 m 1667 plants hm2 seedlings tend to have a shallower root system and more fragile resistance so they are more susceptible to stress from the external environment than mature trees moreover water availability was considered as the most important factor for total xylem cell production during early stage of tree growth deslauriers et al 2016 therefore studying the impact of the dry season irrigation on seedlings can better provide data support for ensuring the rapid and healthy growth of seedlings during the early planting of eucalyptus plantations under seasonal drought conditions 2 2 experimental method the experiment was designed with the orthogonal design of water and fertilizer the details were described in yu et al 2019 water supplied only in the dry season of each year using drip irrigation equipment the total plot area was about 0 57 hm2 the forestland was divided into five terraces with the adoption of the horizontal terraced land preparation method each terrace had 4 treatments randomly arranged from 20 to 92 trees for different plot areas the four treatments in each terrace was 1 no water and no fertilizer ck 2 water but no fertilizer w 3 no water but fertilizer f and 4 water and fertilizer wf the measured trees were in the middle of the treated plot to avoid the impact of marginal utility as possible the dry season irrigation here ensured that the relative water content soil water content field water capacity of the soil from 40 cm depth and 40 cm away from the trees was maintained at 90 for three days the irrigation time was from october 1st 2017 to march 31st 2018 a total of 22 weeks drip irrigation was given 8 h week at 4 l h a total of 32 l week each plant was given a total of 704 l for the experiment the fertilizer additions were completely same as the added amount of eucalyptus production the base fertilizer was applied at 400 g per hole on march 25 2017 and the amount of fertilizer applied was consistent with that of production the total amount of each element was n 24 g p 72 g and k 24 g on july 29th the top dressing was applied for the f and wf treatments a total of 300 g plant the total amount of each element was n 45 g p 21 g and k 24 g the average background soil total n total p and total k were 0 34 g kg 1 0 16 g kg 1 and 8 82 g kg 1 respectively in ck and w 2 3 index measurements 2 3 1 environmental factors the soil water content swc was measured once a month with five repeats for each treatment a small aluminum box of soil samples was taken from three random places in each planting plot 40 cm away from the trees and 40 cm deep all the boxes were weighed and put in an oven at 105 until the weights were constant dry weights were recorded and calculate the soil moisture content swc fresh weight dry weight dry weight aluminum box weight 100 the field moisture capacity was measured with the ring knife method the relative soil water content swcr was calculated as swc divided the field moisture capacity we used weatherhawk weather station campbell scientific usa to collect meteorological factors every half an hour the information collected by the weather station includes air temperature ta c and air relative humidity rh the water vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated according to the formula nolan et al 2016 vpd 0 611 exp 17 27 ta ta 237 3 1 rh the meteorological data in this study were all from 7 00 to 17 00 during the daytime without any rainfall to meet the similar environment during the measurement of the diurnal change of photosynthetic characteristics 2 3 2 gas exchange traits the experiments were conducted in july october 2017 and january may 2018 with 2 days of clear and rainless weather every month and 5 sample trees with the same growth trend were selected from each treatment taking three mature leaves in the middle and upper part of the south to measure with the li 6400 portable photosynthesis analysis system the transparent leaf chamber was used for measuring the instantaneous photosynthetic diurnal changes of the leaves the temperature was set to the leaf temperature at the time of the measurement the external buffer bottle regulated the co2 concentration to ensure that it is consistent with the external environment co2 concentration daytime measurements were taken at 7 00 9 00 11 00 13 00 and 17 00 photosynthetically active radiation par μmol m 2 s 1 net photosynthetic rate pn μmol co2 m 2 s 1 transpiration rate tr mmol h2o m 2 s 1 were measured and the instantaneous water use efficiency wue μmol co2 mmol 1 h2o was calculated as pn tr the daily net co2 assimilation p d mmol co2 m 2 d 1 was the area enclosed by the net photosynthetic rate curve with the horizontal axis of time the p d was calculated according to the following formula p d i 1 j pn i 1 pn i 2 t i 1 t i 3600 1000 the pn i μmol co2 m 2 s 1 and ti h referred to the measuring point net photosynthetic rate and time at the beginning of the measurement respectively the pn i 1 and ti 1 were the next point of the net photosynthetic rate and time respectively the number 3600 and 1000 were the unit conversion factors the daily water transpiration t d mol h2o m 2 d 1 was calculated by the same method as the p d the maximum net photosynthetic rate pn max maximum transpiration rate tr max and maximum instantaneous water use efficiency wuemax were selected from the highest values of the diurnal photosynthetic characteristics 2 3 3 growth traits the basal diameter and height of all the e urophylla e grandis were measured every month from july 2017 to june 2018 the growth rate of basal diameter and height were the differences between the following month and the previous month divided by the time between the two measurements after one year of treatment 5 trees of each treatment with average growth were selected to be cut down and their roots were dug all the aboveground and underground parts were brought back to the laboratory for drying and weighing to calculate the biomass of the trees under different treatments 2 4 statistical analysis excel 2013 computer package program and spss 18 0 statistical analysis software were used for duncan s multiple comparison analysis bivariate correlation analysis and regression analysis of the environmental factors and photosynthetic characteristics for correlation analysis the mean values of all measured data were log transformed to improve normality and heteroscedasticity the multivariate general linear model mglm including three fixed factors dry season irrigation fertilization and month along with three covariates vpd par and measured time was used to account for the diurnal variations of photosynthetic characteristics 3 results 3 1 diurnal variation of photosynthetic characteristics under different treatments most diurnal changes of photosynthetic characteristics of e urophylla e grandis showed single peak curve change patterns fig 2 however in january the treatments without dry season irrigation ck and f showed transpiration midday depressions fig 2b 3 in may treatment w had both photosynthesis and transpiration midday depressions fig 2a 4 b 4 the highest daily pn appeared between 9 00 and 13 00 in four months the highest pn 11 00 13 00 appearing in january was later than that in july 9 00 11 00 october and may 11 00 during the experiment the highest daytime tr appeared between 11 00 and 15 00 the highest tr of each treatment appeared at the same time as the highest pn did in october and may the highest pn of ck appeared before the highest tr but these two values of other treatments w f and wf were reached synchronously in july the highest pn and tr of the four treatments appeared at different time in january the highest pn appeared at the same time as the highest tr in wf the highest tr of both ck and f occurred at about 15 00 which was later than the appearance of the highest pn the highest tr in w turned up at 13 00 before the appearance of the highest pn the mean wue was higher in october and january than that in may and was lowest in july fig 2c 1 c 4 diurnal variation of the wue also showed fluctuations that first increased and then decreased among different treatments in the four months 3 2 seasonal variation of photosynthetic characteristics under different treatments the swcr was quite low in the dry season without dry season irrigation table 1 the swcr of ck and f were only 67 48 and 57 40 respectively which were lower than that of w 90 56 and wf 83 44 there was no significant difference in the swcr of the four treatments in the rainy season table 1 the swcr in four treatments were all above 80 the maximum photosynthetic characteristics also showed different changes among four treatments in dry season and rainy season table 1 the maximum net photosynthetic rate pn max of the f treatment 10 84 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 was significantly lower than that of other three treatments in the dry season there were significant differences in the maximum transpiration tr max of the four treatments and their band order was w 3 31 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 ck 2 85 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 wf 2 68 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 f 2 13 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 during the dry season however the trees of f showed significantly higher maximum instantaneous water use efficiency wuemax μmol co2 mmol h2o 1 than that of other treatments and the trees with the dry season irrigation w and wf had lowest wuemax in dry season while during the rainy season the trees with fertilization treatment f and wf had significantly higher pn max and tr max than that of ck and w but the wuemax among the four treatments had no significant differences in the rainy season moreover there were no significant differences in the range of diurnal photosynthetic characteristics the range of net photosynthetic rate transpiration rate and instantaneous water use efficiency among four treatments in both dry season and rainy season table s1 the daily net co2 assimilation p d and daily water transpiration t d also changed differently among four treatments in the dry and wet seasons table 1 in the dry season the trees without fertilization ck and w had higher p d and t d and the w treatment had highest p d 333 27 mmol co2 m 2 d 1 and t d 77 11 mol h2o m 2 d 1 however the results were just the opposite in the rainy season the wf had highest p d and t d though there were no significant differences among four treatments 3 3 relationships between environmental factors and photosynthetic characteristics the variation of ta during the daytime in the experimental area was fluctuated in different seasons fig 3a the ta was higher in may and july 26 9 33 2 c and the lowest temperature occured in january 8 6 c the daily maximum temperature occured at different time in each month it appeared at 9 00 in july at 11 00 in october and at 13 00 in january and may the daily change of vpd was a single peak curve and the mean vpd during the day was may july october january fig 3b from the measured par fig 3c it was found that the highest par in different months appeared at 11 00 the highest par during the day occurred in july 1634 9 μmol m 2 s 1 there were correlations between photosynthetic characteristics and environmental factors table 2 fig 4 in both dry and rainy seasons the diurnal variation of pn and tr showed significant correlations with the variation of ta rh vpd par p 0 05 and p 0 01 respectively table 2 the wue was also significantly correlated with rh vpd par in the two seasons but was only correlated with ta in the rainy season all data together the photosynthetic characteristics under different treatment also showed different correlations with environmental factors fig 4 the pn were all positively correlated with par fig 4a 1 and vpd figs 4a 3 respectively in the four treatments however only the pn of ck and wf had correlations with ta fig 4a 2 the tr were all positively correlated with par ta and vpd respectively in the four treatments fig 4b only the wue of the w treatment had correlations with par fig 4c 1 the wue had no relationships with ta and vpd for all treatments and together fig 4c 2 3 3 4 the multivariate general linear model mglm of the photosynthetic characteristics according to the multivariate general linear model mglm the diurnal variations of the photosynthetic characteristics were mostly influenced by the time and environmental factors but not the additional treatments table 3 dry season irrigation fertilization and their mixed effects all had no significant impacts on the photosynthetic characteristics in different months table s2 and all data table 3 the variation of month vpd par and measured time accounted for 89 and 93 of the diurnal variation of pn and wue respectively the tr was mostly influenced by the month par and measured time r 2 0 78 3 5 effects of fertilization and dry season irrigation on the growth fertilization significantly increased the growth rate of tree height and basal diameter in four measured months fig 5 dry season irrigation effectively increased the growth rate of height and basal diameter in the dry season but the performance was different between october and january fig 5 both growth rate of height and basal diameter of the trees under dry season irrigation showed a further increase of 29 and 57 respectively on the basis of fertilization treatment in october wf vs f however the two growth rates had only little increase for w compared with ck treatment in january the growth rate of height and basal diameter showed different patterns the height growth rate of wf was highest among the four treatments under the fertilized condition and the non fertilized condition the tree height of the dry season irrigation treatments increased by 32 wf vs f and 86 w vs ck respectively however the treatment w had highest basal diameter growth rate on the contrary the basal diameter growth rate of wf was lower than that of treatment f and only higher than that of ck finally compared with ck treatment the biomass of the fertilization treatment f increased by about 12 times during the experimental period with the significant increase of height 126 and basal diameter 121 table 4 under the fertilized condition and the non fertilized condition the single tree biomass of the dry season irrigation treatments increased by 11 wf vs f and 79 w vs ck respectively with the increase of both height and basal diameter 4 discussion 4 1 effects of dry season irrigation and fertilization on diurnal variations of photosynthetic characteristics most of the diurnal variations of pn tr and wue showed single peak curves under different treatments in the different months fig 2 however in the dry season january the trees of ck and f showed transpiration midday depressions different plants had different diurnal and seasonal variations of photosynthetic characteristics under same conditions chen et al 2019 and the midday depressions of leaf photosynthesis and transpiration during diurnal variation were important indicators of the degree of stress being endured pinheiro and chaves 2011 the soil of ck and f treatments were more arid than that of w and wf due to the dry season irrigation meanwhile the whole month was at the lowest level of precipitation among the whole year in january therefore drought stresses of ck and f in january were the strongest among the four observed months under extreme drought conditions leaf transpiration intensity would change with par patanè 2010 and the par at 13 00 decline rapidly in january by closing some or all of the stomata the transpiration of the leaves was reduced to maintain the water balance of the leaves to survive in extreme drought buckley 2005 this might be the reason why the e urophylla e grandis of ck and f in january had transpiration midday depression we also found that the e urophylla e grandis of w had photosynthetic and transpiration midday depression in may 2018 the e urophylla e grandis of wf grew better than that of w under fertilization fageria et al 2008 so that the former required greater transpiration to meet more carbon assimilation during the treatment therefore the soil moisture of wf would be less than that of w the photosynthesis of wf treatment e urophylla e grandis adapted this soil moisture and the leaves could keep high photosynthetic rate in midday see the results in october and january of fig 2 despite the rainy season in may rainfall was still low 144 mm therefore the e urophylla e grandis of wf that had adapted to such low soil moisture had no photosynthetic and transpiration midday depression in may moreover thanks to the onset of the rainy season in may the drought stress of ck and f was alleviated but the e urophylla e grandis still did not fully restore photosynthetic ability restricted transpiration of e urophylla e grandis of ck and f was not sufficient to cause photosynthetic and transpiration midday depression in addition the diurnal variations of the photosynthetic characteristics were not influenced by dry season irrigation and fertilization but changed with month environmental factors and time table 3 plants could adapt to their changing surroundings by regulating their functional traits and metabolic enzyme activity abley et al 2016 however this adaptation might be mostly affected by genetics for some plants laitinen and nikoloski 2018 including the e urophylla e grandis in this study all the three photosynthetic characteristics were significantly influenced by par at the measured time of the month no matter what the trees were treated with in this study moreover the stomata sensitivity to vpd was greater for eucalyptus lim et al 2020 thus the pn was also significantly affected by vpd 4 2 effects of dry season irrigation and fertilization on seasonal variations of photosynthetic characteristics during the first year of the e urophylla e grandis seedlings planting the swcr of ck and f were only 67 48 and 57 40 respectively in the dry season which were under mild drought conditions dong et al 2013 in this study the trees of f had lowest pn max and tr max in the dry season the decrease of photosynthetic rate was mainly due to the closure of leaf stomata i e stomatal limitation earl 2002 drought stress could induce stomatal closure and reduce the maximum quantum efficiency of psii resulting in reduced photosynthesis lawlor and cornic 2002 yang et al 2017 the temperature and vpd were not very high in the dry season which caused the transpiration rates in the dry season much lower than that of rainy season the stomatal sensitivity to leaf water potential and soil water status might be high for e urophylla e grandis this strategy helped plants fully open stomata when water status was well and close them when water status was unfavorable williams and ehleringer 2000 addington et al 2004 mcdowell et al 2008 while the pn was mostly influenced by par table 3 so that the decrease of pn was less than that of transpiration this might be the reason why trees of f had highest wuemax in the dry season meanwhile the pn max and tr max increased significantly under the fertilization treatment with the adequate water supply in the rainy season table 1 it has been widely accepted that the moderate nutrients addition would promote the photosynthesis and growth of the plants wu et al 2017 for example nitrogen n helped to increase carboxylation capacity during the photosynthetic process ainsworth and rogers 2007 the maximum rate of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco mediated carboxylation vcmax depended on leaf n and increasing leaf phosphorus p would affect the sensitivity of vcmax to leaf n walker et al 2014 fertilizer also changed leaf structural traits such as specific leaf area sla scalon et al 2017 the thickness of spongy tissues wang et al 2020 chlorophyll content dumroese et al 2013 and so on therefore more work on the response of the leaf structure and other functional traits of e urophylla e grandis to water and fertilizer needs to be further studied 4 3 effects of dry season irrigation and fertilization on the growth short term water and fertilizer treatments had no significant effects on the diurnal photosynthetic variations of e urophylla e grandis however the leaf area was significantly larger under the dry season irrigation and fertilization yu et al 2019 therefore the total biomass of the e urophylla e grandis was finally promoted with both water and fertilizer supply the trees with fertilization f and wf tended to allocate more nutrients to grow more leaves than to single leaf photosynthesis this strategy helped e urophylla e grandis seedlings to occupy position more quickly the changes in other leaf characteristics the number of leaves and total leaf areas yu et al 2019 distribution strategies of coarse and fine roots reubens et al 2007 and loading and transportation strategy of the phloem ryan and shinichi 2014 may be account for the changes in the productivity of e urophylla e grandis plantation after dry season irrigation the changes and adaptation of embolization regulation strategies of e urophylla e grandis during and after the dry season with the irrigation treatment could also influence the whole plant water supplement niu et al 2017 which influenced the resorption of nutrients from old leaves to new ones zhang et al 2015 5 conclusions photosynthetic characteristics play important roles for the productivity of plantations and their diurnal and seasonal dynamics influence the overall production of plantations there was a typical seasonal drought in south china and we designed a forestland drip irrigation technology for the normal production of e urophylla e grandis plantations during the dry season to try to increase its productivity in the one year of the testing we found neither dry season irrigation nor fertilization had effects on diurnal variations of photosynthetic characteristics the fluctuation of photosynthetic characteristics depended more on environmental factors especially vpd dry season irrigation alleviated the mild drought in the dry season and improved the maximum photosynthetic and transpiration rate the biomass of e urophylla e grandis under traditional fertilization conditions was further improved by dry season irrigation this research has important guiding significance for the wild cultivation and tending of eucalyptus in the seasonal drought region which provides theoretical support for the related research on the formation process of eucalyptus productivity

10181,tithonia diversifolia tithonia is performed as an invasive species with a high adaptive potential that can be used for several purposes including an alternative source of forage for different animal categories the use of tithonia is growing rapidly as farmers recognize its high accumulation of biomass good nutritional value and adaptation to tropical environments however the effects of irrigation and nitrogen on the characteristics of tithonia have been poorly studied in this context the objective of this study was to identify changes in the productive characteristics and morphophysiology of tithonia under different irrigation simulations and nitrogen fertilization rates seeking to understand its adaptive potential in different water and nutritional scenarios improvements in the efficiency of the use of water and nitrogen and its potential for use in a global context field trials was a split plot design with three replicates whole plots were irrigation rate 0 25 50 75 and 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc and the subplots were the nitrogen fertilizer rate 0 50 100 and 150 kg ha 1 there were significant effects of irrigation nitrogen and their

1 introduction tithonia diversifolia hemsl a gray tithonia is a perennial shrub native to central america and widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical layer of the globe gbif 2021 fig 1 this species has been introduced as an ornamental plant in many countries and has become a rapidly proliferating invasive plant with intense changes in biodiversity and local ecosystem services dai et al 2021 obiakara fourcade 2018 tithonia is a multifunctional species adapted to diverse soils including low fertility acidic soils high aluminum and low phosphorus levels ruíz et al 2014 the main characteristics that explain its rapid expansion in the terrestrial globe are related to its rapid growth witt et al 2019 reis et al 2018 distinct reproductive strategies allowing it to adapt to different environmental conditions santos gally et al 2020 and allelopathic potential with growth inhibiting effects in a wide range of essential cultures forming large monospecific and impenetrable populations kato noguchi 2020 otusanya and ilori 2012 oyerinde et al 2009 another characteristic of the global adaptation of tithonia is its distribution in different classifications of global climate with varied populations and well distributed in a wide range of climatic types fig 1 therefore it is essential to understand the adaptation characteristics of tithonia in different edaphoclimatic conditions through simulations with water and nutritional replacement levels to maximize its potential for use comprehensively and to reduce its negative impacts on each ecosystem partially tithonia can used for several purposes including antibacterial antiviral anti inflammatory anticancer and antioxidant pharmacological functions dlamini et al 2020 farias et al 2019 kawlni et al 2017 biological

al 2019 adsorption of phenol and 2 4 dinitrophenol from water corpus supong et al 2020 phytoextraction of heavy metals from polluted soils ayesa et al 2018 use as green manure and improvement of soil fertility due to its high npk content and its rapid rate of decomposition aboyeji et al 2019 partey et al 2011 tithonia can also be used as an alternative source of forage for various categories of animals as it has a high accumulation of biomass and good nutritional value mauricio et al 2017 studies have shown that laying hens fed diets containing tithonia flour resulted in a good performance and a higher proportion of xanthophylls a pigment responsible for the color and elevation of egg yolk nutrients jáuregui et al 2019 medina et al 2009 recently studies have shown promising results for the use of tithonia as fodder for ruminant nutrition villegas et al 2020 akanmu and hassen 2017 ribeiro et al 2016 compared with the tropical forages commonly used for grazing ruminants tithonia has a higher crude protein content kept the nutritional value relatively constant throughout the dry season and has the potential as a methane reducing food additive in ruminants ribeiro et al 2016 ruíz et al 2014 however in most agricultural systems the accumulation of biomass and the quality of forage are mainly limited by the soil s characteristics such as the low availability of nutrients and water efficient irrigation systems and adequate nitrogen fertilization strategies can improve crop yield it is worth mentioning that the combined effect of water and nitrogen is complex and these strategies must be supported by information based on research excessive irrigation and nitrogen fertilization can result in low efficiency of utilizing the applied resources and lead to more nitrate accumulation and leaching in the soil therefore causing contamination of the water table liu et al 2019 also fertilizer prices and awareness of water use have increased in recent years therefore it is essential to improve nitrogen management in an irrigated production system to optimize farm profits and minimize environmental impacts nilahyane et al 2018 the effects of irrigation and nitrogen on the characteristics of tithonia have been poorly studied in this context the objective of this study was to identify changes in the productive and morphophysiological characteristics of tithonia under different irrigation simulations and nitrogen fertilization rates seeking to understand its adaptive potential in different water and nutritional scenarios improvements in the efficiency of the use of water and nitrogen and its potential for use in a global context 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design a field trial was carried out at the animal science department of

excesses should be avoided because they are finite resources and when it was misused it can cause environmental pollution by groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions nogué et al 2019 tithonia highest yields in this study do not coincide with the more significant nitrogen and water use efficiency the best results for dry biomass accumulation was observed in the enormous irrigation volume 100 etc and nitrogen dose 150 kgnitrogenha 1 however the best nitrogen use efficiency was achieved at 100 kgnitrogenha 1 and for the best water use efficiency at irrigation volume of 75 etc these efficiency results could be the recommendations for sustainable use by farmers in the tithonia cultivation in another study ramírez 2018 working with tithonia fertilized with rates of 100 up to 400 kgnitrogenha 1 and cuts at 49 days of regrowth suggests the use of 200 kgnitrogenha 1 as it resulted in high production of crude protein and did not differ from the higher doses of nitrogen fertilizer in practice agronomic recommendations for irrigation and nitrogen fertilization must be carried out considering the desired productivity and capital the more significant investment in irrigation and nitrogen fertilization for the greater biomass accumulation of tithonia may not be viable in production systems with low technological levels and low water availability in these low availability of resources tithonia can still present a good development mauricio et al 2017 understanding how intra and interrelationships of productive and morphophysiological characteristics of tithonia under different irrigation simulations and nitrogen fertilization rates can give a better view of the global spreading process of tithonia and how farmers intend to use a tithonia in their systems production can intensify their crops in a way that does not use excess nitrogen also nitrogen could function as a regulator of higher or lower production in each global region with a certain water level irrigation or rainfall this understanding can favor the expansion of this plant s use and reduce the adverse effects of being an invasive plant an important fact observed in the present study about tithonia was the relationship between productive characteristics and ambient temperature in the present study the second growth cycle showed a higher ambient temperature 16 and 20 c in growth cycle i and ii respectively positively increasing the variable responses analyzed also reis et al 2018 evaluating tithonia at 80 days of regrowth without irrigation observed dry mass accumulation of 2 09mgha 1 in the first cut and 4 01mgha 1 in the second cut the authors related the higher productivity in the second cut to higher rainfall and temperature the information found in the literature on the vigorous growth mauricio et al 2017 reis et al 2018 and the productive and physiological responses of tithonia found in the present study confirm the excellent adaptation of the species to high temperatures and good water availability these conditions are common in tropical environments which justifies the greater concentration of the species in the regions observed on the platform gbif global biodiversity information facility 2021 including its origin center in mexico fig 1 on the other hand the survival and good growth of the species under the low temperatures and water deficit observed in the present study opens up a vast possibilities of cultivation of the species in other regions of world tithonia has excellent potential for use as an alternative forage compared to the main crops used in the world based on the present study results extrapolating the productivity per year and considering four growth cycles the dry biomass accumulation is estimated at 35mgha 1 year 1 other research indicates the production of 11 55 mgha 1 year 1 and crude protein content ranging from 12 to 24 depending on planting density nitrogen fertilization and regrowth days ramírez 2018 dry biomass accumulation of tithonia is similar to that observed for several perennial forage grasses such as the panicum species brachiaria brizantha and cynodon in addition to corn and sorghum the values of the photosynthetic rate of the species under favorable conditions of water in the soil and nitrogen are high fig 9 and compared to the photosynthetic response of forage grasses c4 reis et al 2019 barros et al 2017 which reinforces the high productive potential of the species the lower chlorophyll index in tithonia leaves under the lowest irrigation and nitrogen rates is mainly related to nitrogen content in plants the lower nitrogen use efficiency caused by soil deficiency of water and nutrients directly influences chlorophylls synthesis and impairs photosynthesis taiz et al 2017 if sunlight and temperature are not limiting water and nitrogen availability can significantly increase the photosynthesis and consequently the dry biomass accumulation the increased soil moisture can also promote greater nitrogen use efficiency because soil moisture favors nitrogen mineralization making them available to plants rahman et al 2013 5 conclusions tithonia proved to be a plant adapted to the humid temperate climate and sandy loam texture soil presenting great dry biomass accumulation potential even without irrigation and nitrogen fertilization nitrogen use

1 introduction tithonia diversifolia hemsl a gray tithonia is a perennial shrub native to central america and widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical layer of the globe gbif 2021 fig 1 this species has been introduced as an ornamental plant in many countries and has become a rapidly proliferating invasive plant with intense changes in biodiversity and local ecosystem services dai et al 2021 obiakara fourcade 2018 tithonia is a multifunctional species adapted to diverse soils including low fertility acidic soils high aluminum and low phosphorus levels ruíz et al 2014 the main characteristics that explain its rapid expansion in the terrestrial globe are related to its rapid growth witt et al 2019 reis et al 2018 distinct reproductive strategies allowing it to adapt to different environmental conditions santos gally et al 2020 and allelopathic potential with growth inhibiting effects in a wide range of essential cultures forming large monospecific and impenetrable populations kato noguchi 2020 otusanya and ilori 2012 oyerinde et al 2009 another characteristic of the global adaptation of tithonia is its distribution in different classifications of global climate with varied populations and well distributed in a wide range of climatic types fig 1 therefore it is essential to understand the adaptation characteristics of tithonia in different edaphoclimatic conditions through simulations with water and nutritional replacement levels to maximize its potential for use comprehensively and to reduce its negative impacts on each ecosystem partially tithonia can used for several purposes including antibacterial antiviral anti inflammatory anticancer and antioxidant pharmacological functions dlamini et al 2020 farias et al 2019 kawlni et al 2017 biological

fertility due to its high npk content and its rapid rate of decomposition aboyeji et al 2019 partey et al 2011 tithonia can also be used as an alternative source of forage for various categories of animals as it has a high accumulation of biomass and good nutritional value mauricio et al 2017 studies have shown that laying hens fed diets containing tithonia flour resulted in a good performance and a higher proportion of xanthophylls a pigment responsible for the color and elevation of egg yolk nutrients jáuregui et al 2019 medina et al 2009 recently studies have shown promising results for the use of tithonia as fodder for ruminant nutrition villegas et al 2020 akanmu and hassen 2017 ribeiro et al 2016 compared with the tropical forages commonly used for grazing ruminants tithonia has a higher crude protein content kept the nutritional value relatively constant throughout the dry season and has the potential as a methane reducing food additive in ruminants ribeiro et al 2016 ruíz et al 2014 however in most agricultural systems the accumulation of biomass and the quality of forage are mainly limited by the soil s characteristics such as the low availability of nutrients and water efficient irrigation systems and adequate nitrogen fertilization strategies can improve crop yield it is worth mentioning that the combined effect of water and nitrogen is complex and these strategies must be supported by information based on research excessive irrigation and nitrogen fertilization can result in low efficiency of utilizing the applied resources and lead to more nitrate accumulation and leaching in the soil therefore causing contamination of the water table liu et al 2019 also fertilizer prices and awareness of water use have increased in recent years therefore it is essential to improve nitrogen management in an irrigated production system to optimize farm profits and minimize environmental impacts nilahyane et al 2018 the effects of irrigation and nitrogen on the characteristics of tithonia have been poorly studied in this context the objective of this study was to identify changes in the productive and morphophysiological characteristics of tithonia under

10182,the use of organic wastes in southern brazil is a common practice in the farms and in many of these the criterion for defining the doses of organic wastes is to meet the n demand by crops this may mean the accumulation of chemical elements in the soil especially in soils managed under no tillage systems and enhance the transfer of these elements by surface runoff the aim was evaluated how successive applications of organic and mineral sources of nutrients in a long term experiment managed under no tillage system in a subtropical environment influence the transfer of quantities and forms of n and p by surface runoff the experiment was carried out in southern brazil in a typic hapludalf soil the treatments consisted of the application of pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry mineral fertilizer and a control without nutrients the doses of organic wastes were to meet the n demand by crops were evaluated the surface runoff and the transfers of mineral n and forms of p soluble particulate and total from 2009 to 2013 period the amount of solution transferred by surface runoff decreased with fertilization and present a negative relationship with the soil organic matter som the transfers of mineral n increased with the increase in the contents of som but decreased with the runoff the transfers of p forms present a great relationship with the amounts of p applied and the contents of soil p extracted by mehlich 1 and more than 55 of total p transferred by surface runoff in the treatments that received nutrients application is on soluble form in addition the transfer of soluble particulate and total p was lower with mineral fertilizer application when compared with organic wastes this suggest that the use of n demand by crops as a criterium to meet the doses of organic wastes is not adequate in subtropical environment keywords organic fertilizer animal wastes nutrients transfer environmental contamination 1 introduction in the southern region of brazil cattle and pig farming are among the main agricultural activities favoring growth and development especially for small rural producers this region is responsible for 12 of the national cattle breeding with approximately 26 1 million head ibge instituto brasileiro de geografia e estatística 2018 and the pig herd has approximately 20 6 million head being responsible for more than 49 of the pig breeding in brazil ibge instituto brasileiro de geografia e estatística 2018 these activities generate large volumes of liquid and solid wastes that have large amounts of nutrients in their composition thus it is absolutely rational that there is a concern to use pig and cattle manure in the fertilization of annual crops and or pastures as a way to recycle the nutrients present in these residues establishing strategies for their technical environmental and economic viability that result in increased grain yield and dry matter production by crops ceretta et al 2005a ciancio et al 2014 higarashi et al 2008 lourenzi et al 2014a the continuous use of animal wastes also promotes an excessive increase in nutrient contents in the soil adeli et al 2008 brunetto et al 2012 de conti et al 2015 guardini et al 2012 in this sense in a study evaluating the effects of successive applications of pig slurry at rates of 0 20 40 and 80 m3 ha 1 in a typic hapludalf soil under no tillage system in southern brazil lourenzi et al 2013 observed increases in the total levels of nitrogen n and phosphorus p and in the contents of p and potassium k extracted by mehlich 1 especially in the soil surface layers since the applications of manure were carried out on the surface however the excessive accumulation of nutrients in the soil can potentiate their transfer by surface runoff especially n and p bertol et al 2010 ceretta et al 2010a lourenzi et al 2015 sharma and chaubey 2017 tiecher et al 2020 the mineral n present in liquid animal manure is found especially in ammoniacal form n nh4 aita et al 2019 schirmann et al 2013 however in solid manure the content of nitrate n no3 can increase in relation to n nh4 but the organic n is predominant anwar et al 2018 sweeney et al 2012 thus immediately after the application of manure in the soil the transfer of n by surface runoff occurs predominantly in ammoniacal forms and later due to the nitrification process and mineralization of organic n the transfer of n in the form of n no3 increases ceretta et al 2010a cui et al 2020 payet et al 2009 in relation to p successive applications or high rates of p applied via manure in the same area cause accumulation of this element especially in labile forms in the surface layers of the soil adeli et al 2008 ceretta et al 2010b de conti et al 2015 lourenzi et al 2016 2013 potentiating the transfers of p by surface runoff ceretta et al 2010a hua and zhu 2020 lourenzi et al 2014a 2014b 2015 vadas et al 2011 p transfers by surface runoff occur in soluble and particulate forms with soluble p or dissolved obtained in a filtered solution at 0 45 µm and particulate p obtained by the difference between the total p of the unfiltered sample and the soluble p filtered at 0 45 µm haygarth and sharpley 2000 the transfers of n and p by surface runoff from the agricultural lands to the surrounding water bodies causing eutrophication and environmental deterioration of aquatic systems worldwide kim et al 2006 yan et al 2017 in this way the transfer of n and p by surface runoff has been the subject of study in traditional pig and cattle breeding countries in the world and also in brazil anwar et al 2018 ceretta et al 2010a hua and zhu 2020 kleinman et al 2009 lourenzi et al 2014a 2014b 2015 sherman et al 2021 sweeney et al 2012 wang et al 2013 zanon et al 2020 the main results obtained by these authors show that the amounts transferred from these elements are dependent especially on i the amount of nutrient added to the soil through the manure ii the type of soil iii the content of the element in the soil iv the frequency volume and intensity of rainfall and v the cultivation system and the export capacity of the plants used in the production system according to barrow 1999 at each fertilization whether with organic wastes or mineral fertilizer the soil undergoes changes and therefore the importance of its analysis in long term experiments since the effects of these practices tend to amplify over the years the study aimed to evaluate how successive applications of organic and mineral sources of nutrients in a long term experiment managed under no tillage system in a subtropical environment influence the transfer of quantities and forms of n and p by surface runoff 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and treatments the experiment was

described by cqfs rs sc 2004 the experiment started in 2004 in an area under no tillage system and the treatments consisted of the application of pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry mineral fertilizer urea triple superphosphate and potassium chloride and a control treatment without application of nutrients organic wastes and mineral fertilizer were always applied before the sowing of the maize zea mays l until the agricultural year 2009 2010 when it was decided to apply it twice a year that is before the implantation of the winter and summer crops from 2004 2012 black oats avena strigosa schreb were grown in the winter and maize in the summer only in the summer of 2013 black beans phaseolus vulgaris l were grown and black oats were kept as the winter crop the experimental design was a randomized block with four replications and plots with 25 m2 5 5 m the evaluation period of the experiment for the present study was from november 2009 to october 2013 the chemical characteristics of the soil after 12 applications of organic wastes and mineral fertilizer are determined for this soil samples were collected in all plots at a depth of 0 10 cm in september 2012 the

and water used to clean the facilities the pig deep litter consisted of rice processing residues feces urine and food scraps before applications organic wastes was subjected to analysis of n and p on a wet basis tedesco et al 1995 the percentage of dry matter of the organic wastes was obtained by drying the samples at 65 c in an oven with forced air circulation until constant mass the characteristics of organic wastes and the total amounts of nutrients applied before the implantation of each crop are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively the rate of organic wastes was determined based on the n requirement of each crop and the efficiency index of each residue as recommended by cqfs rs sc 2004 the organic wastes and mineral fertilizer were evenly distributed on the soil surface over the cultural residues one day before the sowing of each species without incorporation as usually done by producers in southern brazil in the 12 applications carried out from 2004 to 2013 were applied 1151 8 kg n ha 1 and 457 2 kg p ha 1 via pig slurry 1689 8 kg n ha 1 and 1102 1 kg p ha 1 via pig deep litter 1695 8 kg n ha 1 and 497 8 kg p ha 1 via cattle slurry and 920 kg n ha 1 and 436 5 kg p ha 1 via mineral fertilizer 2 3 collection and analysis of runoff solution for the evaluation of the runoff solution polyvinyl chloride boxes 0 75 m 0 50 m were installed on each plot the slope of the experimental area around 3 the polyvinyl chloride structure was inserted into the soil to a depth of 5 cm the surface runoff was assessed with a hard wired collecting gutter connected to a hose coupled to a collection container 20 l more details about the boxes can be obtained at lourenzi et al 2015 after each natural rainfall not simulated with sufficient runoff volume for analysis the stored runoff volume was removed from the collectors the volume measured and a sample 500 ml taken to the laboratory for analysis to determine the content of ammonium n nh4 20 ml of solution were used with the addition of 0 2 g of mgo and subsequent steam distillation in a kjeldahl half micron vapor distiller and the distilled material being collected in boric acid and the titration of the extract carried out with diluted h2so4 tedesco et al 1995 after distillation 0 2 g of devarda s alloy was added to the same sample and distilled again to determine the levels of nitrate n no3 tedesco et al 1995 the n mineral was obtained by adding the contents of n nh4 n no3 to determine the content of p the samples were separated in two fractions one approximately 50 ml was immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and another fraction was not filtered in the filtered fraction the soluble p concentrations and the unfiltered fraction the concentrations of total p were determined concentrations of soluble p in the runoff water were determined directly in the solution filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane by colorimetry murphy and riley 1962 the total p of the runoff water was determined by acid digestion h2so4 h2o2 in the presence of saturated mgcl2 according to the method of brookes and powlson 1981 the concentrations of particulate p were determined as the difference between the amounts of total p and soluble p haygarth and sharpley 2000 the amounts of total p were determined by colorimetry murphy and riley 1962 2 4 statistical treatment of the data analysis of variance anova was performed to determine treatment effects on runoff and forms of n and p losses in runoff differences between treatment effects were determined by the scott knott test α 0 05 regression analysis were performed to test correlations between amount of n applied soil organic matter runoff nitrogen mineral loss phosphorus applied soil phosphorus extracted by mehlich 1 soluble phosphorus loss particulate phosphorus loss and total phosphorus loss in agricultural years 2009 2010 2012 2013 all statistical analyses were performed using sisvar ferreira 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 solution transfer by surface runoff the solution transfer by surface runoff was greater in the control treatment in six of the eight evaluated crops fig 2 in absolute terms the highest volumes of runoff solution were in the cultivation of black oats 2010 fig 2b due to the significant rainfall that occurred in the months of july and september of that year in addition to the fact that the previous summer season was marked by above average rainfall fig 1 it is known that several factors can affect surface runoff such as rainfall intensity and soil moisture at the time of rainfall among others on the other hand there is a great relationship between the amounts of n applied and content of som and between the content of som and the solution transfer by runoff table 4 and fig 3a b the highest amounts of n applied in the treatments that received the addition of organic wastes or mineral fertilizers increased the som and reduction the solution volumes transfer by surface runoff this may be a consequence of the greater production of dry matter from the crops that received nutrient applications and consequently greater deposition and maintenance of vegetal residues on the soil favored by the fact that the use of organic wastes for long periods increases the total organic carbon content of the soil adeyemo et al 2019 brunetto et al 2012 lin et al 2019 lourenzi et al 2016 2011 the transfer of solution by surface runoff in most of the eight crops showed no differences when using organic wastes or mineral fertilizer fig 2 on average during the eight crops the solution transfer by surface runoff was 29 8 15 8 13 3 15 0 and 15 4 of the total rainfall at control pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer treatments respectively this shows that in the treatments where the cultures were fertilized compared to the control there was an average decrease in transfers by surface runoff by 14 9 equivalent to 1078 m3 ha 1 considering the average annual rainfall at the site some authors observed an even greater decrease in runoff after the application of organic wastes and or crop rotation wortmann and walters 2006 used cattle manure compost for three years in corn and soybean crops which resulted in a 41 reduction in surface runoff compared to the control in this way jiao et al 2011 observed a 50 reduction in the volume of solution transfer by surface runoff with the use of a crop rotation system which was justified by the increase in water infiltration in the soil these results show the importance of the production of large amounts of dry matter by crops and the subsequent maintenance of plant residues on the soil surface in this sense the supply of nutrients whether from an organic or mineral source is essential for greater biomass production by crops adeyemo et al 2019 ceretta et al 2005a ciancio et al 2014 lourenzi et al 2014a throughout the cycles of the different plant species used in the crop rotation system this supply of biomass on the soil surface will contribute to an increase in soil organic matter content adeyemo et al 2019 lin et al 2019 lourenzi et al 2016 this provides improvements in the physical chemical and biological properties of the soil leading to better structuring water infiltration and reduced solution transfer by surface runoff krutz et al 2009 mellek et al 2010 spargo et al 2006 as shown in fig 4a which shows the average volume transfer by surface runoff in the eight crops in addition the maintenance of residues on the soil surface when adopting the no tillage system with crop rotation contributes to the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the raindrop on the soil surface and provides greater efficiency in reducing the transfer of solution by surface runoff bertol et al 2007 tomer et al 2016 wortmann and walters 2006 and the effects of adopting this system are maximized in a long time 3 2 nitrogen transfer by surface runoff the transfers of mineral n in the treatments that received nutrient applications were equal to or less than the control treatment in five of the eight evaluated crops fig 5 this is a positive aspect of the n recommendation system used in the states of rio grande do sul and santa catarina cqfs rs sc 2004 since it shows that most of the n applied via organic wastes or mineral fertilizer is effectively being absorbed by the crops or retained in organic forms at som in addition the greater transfer of solution by surface runoff in the control treatment in most of the evaluated crops fig 2 explains the results obtained since the amount of mineral n losses is closely related to the volume of solution transferred by surface runoff table 4 and fig 3c ceretta et al 2010a zhang et al 2020 as an example of this in the black oats 2010 a greater transfer of solution by surface runoff was observed in the control treatment fig 2b but there was no difference between the treatments for the transfer of mineral n fig 5b showing that the greater volume of solution runoff was a determining factor for the quantities transferred to be similar similar results can be observed in maize in 2010 11 figs 2c and 5c black oats in 2011 figs 2d and 5d black beans in 2012 2013 figs 2g and 5g and black oats in 2013 figs 2h and 5h in this way in a study evaluating the transfer of nutrients by runoff in a typic hapludalf soil with pig slurry rates 0 20 40 and 80 m3 ha 1 in an experiment conducted close to the experiment of this study ceretta et al 2010a found a close relationship between the volume of solution and the amount of mineral n transferred by surface runoff zhang et al 2020 evaluating the influence of climate change and planting structures on solution and nitrogen transfer by surface runoff in a watershed found that the increase in solution transfers due to climate change also reflected in increased losses of nitrogen by surface runoff on average of n transfers by runoff in the eight crops there was no difference between the use of pig deep litter and mineral fertilizer with these treatments providing the highest n transfers fig 4b however when compared to the mineral fertilizer treatment organic wastes such as pig slurry and cattle slurry have approximately 50 of n in ammoniacal forms n nh4 and n nh3 which after application to the soil are quickly transformed into nitrate in the nitrification process aita et al 2006 joshi et al 1994 scherer et al 2007 schirmann et al 2013 which is very mobile in the soil however the presence of organic forms of n in these organic wastes requires the action of microorganisms for mineralization which can decrease n transfers by surface runoff when compared to mineral fertilization where n normally is completely solubilized after application to the soil and this explains why there is no correlation between the amounts of n applied and the losses of mineral n by runoff table 4 organic wastes can also be analyzed according to its physical characteristics in this case it is possible that liquid wastes promote greater transfer of mineral n by surface runoff when compared to solid wastes smith et al 2001 this was observed only in the black beans in 2012 2013 fig 5g while in the maize in 2011 12 fig 5e and black oats in 2012 fig 5f only the cattle slurry showed greater transfers of n compared to the pig deep litter a justification for this is the possibility of liquid wastes causing a superficial sealing of the soil due to the presence of small particles present in the pig and cattle slurry silveira et al 2011 in addition liquid sources of organic wastes increase the moisture content of the soil soon after application reducing the rate of water infiltration of the soil especially if the rainfall event takes place soon after the manure application this contributes to the increase in runoff and nutrient transfers in the first pluviometric events after the application of residues considering that in these events occur the greatest transfers of nutrients by runoff anwar et al 2018 ceretta et al 2010a cui et al 2020 kaufmann et al 2019 smith et al 2007 this shows the importance of planning prior to the application of organic wastes considering soil and climate conditions and how these factors interact with residues of different chemical and physical characteristics giacomini et al 2009 however considering the average of the period evaluated the pig deep litter showed greater transfers of n by surface runoff when compared to the pig and cattle slurry fig 4b this occurred due to the results obtained during the cultivation of corn 2009 2010 fig 5a where the transfer of mineral n was 25 7 kg ha 1 with pig deep litter application reflecting in transfers of mineral n higher by 79 and 244 compared to the pig slurry 14 3 kg ha 1 and cattle slurry 7 5 kg ha 1 respectively in the other crops the transfers of mineral n with pig deep litter were much lower than these values fig 5 justifying the fact that the transfers of only one crop influenced the average data of the evaluated period in the state of rio grande do sul southern brazil there are marked differences in temperature and volume of precipitation depending on the season in autumn winter when black oats are grown temperatures are normally lower and there is higher soil moisture compared to spring summer when corn and beans were grown fig 1 this justifies the fact that in the autumn winter the transfers of mineral n by runoff were on average 5 58 9 35 13 33 and 14 85 of the n applied with the pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer respectively while in the spring summer were 5 14 4 49 2 50 and 8 26 respectively the lower water infiltration in the soil and the lower microbial activity in the autumn winter decrease the n mineralization of organic wastes and the absorption by plants as well as the n losses through volatilization basso et al 2004 the which favors the accumulation of n on the soil surface and increases the transfer of mineral n by surface runoff gilles et al 2009 sweeney et al 2012 these results demonstrate that soil conservation practices are even more important in autumn winter aiming to decrease runoff because there are other reports in the literature that show greater transfers of mineral n by surface runoff in these seasons this is the case of miller et al 2006 who observed in southern alberta canada that in areas with the application of organic wastes the losses of n by surface runoff are dependent of the season being higher in the autumn winter likewise udawatta et al 2006 found greater losses of total n in the period when the soil was with the highest moisture in southern brazil ceretta et al 2005b also observed greater transfers of n mineral in the autumn winter seasons in a study that evaluated the transfer of nutrients by surface runoff in typic hapludalf soil with applications of rates of 0 20 40 and 80 m3 ha 1 of pig slurry in an experiment conducted close to the experiment of this study 3 3 phosphorus transfer by surface runoff the greatest transfers of p especially soluble and total p forms occurred with the use of organic wastes when compared with mineral fertilizer and control in most crops figs 6 and 7 in part this can be justified because with the use of pig slurry pig deep litter and cattle slurry 5 152 and 14 higher amounts of p were added to the soil respectively in relation to the total p applied in the mineral fertilizer treatment table 3 this occurred mainly because the amounts of applied organic wastes were defined to meet the need for n by plants according to official recommendations cqfs rs sc 2004 for this the correlations between soluble p and total p transfers by surface runoff were also significant with the amount of p applied table 4 and fig 3d the fact that the criterion used to determine the dose of organic wastes is based on the need for n in cultures is usual in the states of rio grande do sul and santa catarina in the south of brazil cqfs rs sc 2004 however this usually means adding greater amounts of p via organic wastes in relation to the need for crops this was also demonstrated in the work of ceretta et al 2010a who observed a close correlation between the amounts of p applied via pig slurry and the amounts of p transferred by surface runoff after 19 applications of rates of 0 20 40 and 80 m3 ha 1 of pig slurry in a rotation of cultures in a typic hapludalf soil hahn et al 2012 also observed high levels of p in the soil and increased transfers of p by surface runoff after the use of swine manure for a long period in a study carried out in switzerland however the potential for greater transfers of p by surface runoff is influenced not only by the amount of p applied but also by other factors such as fertilization rate amount of p in the soil demand by crops topography temperature use of soil and precipitation intensity and duration liu et al 2012 mcdowell et al 2011 sweeney et al 2012 tomer et al 2016 wang et al 2013 the soluble p was the form that was most sensitive to the variation in surface runoff due to the sources and there is a great relationship with the runoff amounts of p applied and the contents of soil p extracted by mehlich 1 table 4 and fig 3c e during the eight crops evaluated were transferred 6 4 18 0 25 1 12 6 and 9 9 kg ha 1 of soluble p for the control pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer treatments respectively figs 6 and 7 this represents the transfer of 5 8 7 0 4 8 and 7 0 of the p applied in the crops in the pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer treatments respectively the greatest soluble p transfers when organic fertilization was applied possibly occur due to the increase in the concentration of p in the soil solution as observed by de conti et al 2015 in a typic hapludalf soil with 19 applications of 0 20 40 and 80 m3 ha 1 pig slurry applications rates in an experiment conducted close to the experiment of this study the transfer of particulate p was not shown to be a form of p that would be useful to differentiate between organic wastes and mineral fertilizer if we analyzed the individual crops figs 6 and 7 however on average the transfer of particulate p was greater in the organic wastes when compared with the control and mineral fertilizer treatments fig 4c in this form 6 0 10 0 17 1 9 8 and 5 6 kg ha 1 were transferred by runoff during the eight crops evaluated for the control pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer treatments respectively this represents the transfer of 3 2 4 8 3 8 and 4 0 of the p applied with the pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer treatments respectively the transfer of particulate p has a great relationship with the amount of p applied and soil p extracted by mehlich 1 table 4 and fig 3d e and this may explain the greatest transfers observed with the application of pig deep litter the treatment that received the highest additions of p due to the fact that the doses of the treatments were defined to supply n demand for crops the fact that more particulate p was transfer in the control treatment when compared with mineral fertilizer may be explained by the lower deposition of cultural residues on the soil due to the lower production of dry matter by the cultures of this treatment during the eight crops in which total p transfers in the surface runoff were evaluated 12 4 27 4 42 4 22 4 and 15 4 kg ha 1 were transferred in the control pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer treatments respectively which represent the transfer of 8 9 11 8 8 6 and 10 9 of the total amount of p applied respectively in the treatments that received nutrients applications in this sense bertol et al 2010 also found transfers of p by surface runoff less than 15 of the total p applied via pig slurry which suggests that these are insignificant values for plant nutrition sharpley et al 2001 however it is important to note that successive applications or excessive rates of nutrient sources over time result in application of p above the demand of the crops which can promote the accumulation of p on the soil surface layers and can increase the p transfers by surface runoff and potentiate the eutrophication processes in surface water sources ceretta et al 2010a kim et al 2006 yan et al 2017 yin et al 2018 in relation to transfers of total p approximately 51 66 60 56 and 64 of the total p are in soluble form for the control pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer treatments respectively these forms soluble and total present a great relationship with the amounts of p applied and the contents of soil p extracted by mehlich 1 table 4 and fig 3d e in this sense it is important to highlight that after 12 applications of the nutrient sources there were increases in the contents of p extracted by mehlich 1 in the soil of 86 321 386 and 649 with mineral fertilizer pig slurry cattle slurry and pig deep litter respectively when compared with the control table 1 and 42 222 271 and 472 respectively when compared with the initial content of p in the experiment 2004 year the fact that there are large increments of p in the soil with the use of organic wastes shows that care must be taken in the use of these residues especially when determining the amount to be applied using the n requirement of the crops as a criterion in addition it is important to note that a large part of the p present in organic wastes is found in mineral forms as observed by cassol et al 2001 and li et al 2020 who found more than 60 of the p in inorganic forms in the evaluated organic wastes inorganic forms of p are readily available to plants and are also the main form of p accumulation in the soil especially in the superficial layers adeli et al 2008 ceretta et al 2010b chardon et al 2007 gatiboni et al 2008 guardini et al 2012 lourenzi et al 2016 as observed in the present study there is a great relationship between the amounts of p applied with organic wastes and contents of p extracted by mehlich 1 in the soil and these factors with the forms of p transfers by surface runoff hahn et al 2012 lourenzi et al 2015 sweeney et al 2012 wang et al 2013 this is due to the fact that with successive applications of p amounts above the demand of the crops there is a saturation of the adsorption sites of the reactive soil particles thus the p will be more susceptible to migration in the soil profile especially in soils with low clay contents as a typic hapludalf soil of this study increasing the risk of contamination of subsurface waters de conti et al 2015 liu et al 2019 lourenzi et al 2013 or be transferred by surface runoff ceretta et al 2010a lourenzi et al 2015 2014b 4 conclusions in this study we evaluated the transfers of n and p by surface runoff in a typic hapludalf soil with organic wastes and mineral fertilizer application the doses of organic wastes were defined to supply n demand for crops and the amounts of p applied were greater than mineral fertilizer and that influenced the results obtained the amount of solution transferred by surface runoff decreased with fertilization in relation to control the transfers of mineral n increased with the increase in the contents of som but decreased with the runoff the transfers of p forms present a great relationship with the amounts of p applied and the contents of soil p extracted by mehlich 1 and more than 55 of total p transferred by surface runoff in the treatments that received nutrients application is on soluble form in addition the transfer of soluble particulate and total p was lower with mineral fertilizer application when compared with organic wastes this suggest that the use of n demand by crops as a criterium to meet the doses of organic wastes is not adequate in subtropical

10182,the use of organic wastes in southern brazil is a common practice in the farms and in many of these the criterion for defining the doses of organic wastes is to meet the n demand by crops this may mean the accumulation of chemical elements in the soil especially in soils managed under no tillage systems and enhance the transfer of these elements by surface runoff the aim was evaluated how successive applications of organic and mineral sources of nutrients in a long term experiment managed under no tillage system in a subtropical environment influence the transfer of quantities and forms of n and p by surface runoff the experiment was carried out in southern brazil in a typic hapludalf soil the treatments consisted of the application of pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry mineral fertilizer and a control without nutrients the doses of organic wastes were to meet the n demand by crops were evaluated the surface runoff and the transfers of mineral n and forms of p soluble particulate and total from 2009 to 2013 period the amount of solution transferred by surface runoff decreased with fertilization and present a negative relationship with the soil organic matter som the transfers of mineral n increased with the increase in the contents of som but decreased with the runoff the transfers of p forms present a great relationship with the amounts of p applied and the contents of soil p extracted by mehlich 1 and more than 55 of total p transferred by surface runoff in the treatments that received nutrients application is on soluble form in addition the transfer of soluble particulate and total p was lower with mineral fertilizer application when compared with organic wastes this suggest that the use of n demand by crops as a criterium to meet the doses of organic wastes is not adequate in subtropical environment keywords organic fertilizer animal wastes nutrients transfer environmental contamination 1 introduction in the southern region of brazil cattle and pig farming are among the main agricultural activities favoring growth and development especially for small rural producers this region is responsible for 12 of the national cattle breeding with approximately 26 1 million head ibge instituto brasileiro de geografia e estatística 2018 and the pig herd has approximately 20 6 million head being responsible for more than 49 of the pig breeding in brazil ibge instituto brasileiro de geografia e estatística 2018 these activities generate large volumes of liquid and solid wastes that have large amounts of nutrients in their composition thus it is absolutely rational that there is a concern to use pig and cattle manure in the fertilization of annual crops and or pastures as a way to recycle the nutrients present in these residues establishing strategies for their technical environmental and economic viability that result in increased grain yield and dry matter production by crops ceretta et al 2005a ciancio et al 2014 higarashi et al 2008 lourenzi et al 2014a the continuous use of animal wastes also promotes an excessive increase in nutrient contents in the soil adeli et al 2008 brunetto et al 2012 de conti et al 2015 guardini et al 2012 in this sense in a study evaluating the effects of successive applications of pig slurry at rates of 0 20 40 and 80 m3 ha 1 in a typic hapludalf soil under no tillage system in southern brazil lourenzi et al 2013 observed increases in the total levels of nitrogen n and phosphorus p and in the contents of p and potassium k extracted by mehlich 1 especially in the soil surface layers since the applications of manure were carried out on the surface however the excessive accumulation of nutrients in the soil can potentiate their transfer by surface runoff especially n and p bertol et al 2010 ceretta et al 2010a lourenzi et al 2015 sharma and chaubey 2017 tiecher et al 2020 the mineral n present in liquid animal manure is found especially in ammoniacal form n nh4 aita et al 2019 schirmann et al 2013 however in solid manure the content of nitrate n no3 can increase in relation to n nh4 but the organic n is predominant anwar et al 2018 sweeney et al 2012 thus immediately after the application of manure in the soil the transfer of n by surface runoff occurs predominantly in ammoniacal forms and later due to the nitrification process and mineralization of organic n the transfer of n in the form of n no3 increases ceretta et al 2010a cui et al 2020 payet et al 2009 in relation to p successive applications or high rates of p applied via manure in the same area cause accumulation of this element especially in labile forms in the surface layers of the soil adeli et al 2008 ceretta et al 2010b de conti et al 2015 lourenzi et al 2016 2013 potentiating the transfers of p by surface runoff ceretta et al 2010a hua and zhu 2020 lourenzi et al 2014a 2014b 2015 vadas et al 2011 p transfers by surface runoff occur in soluble and particulate forms with soluble p or dissolved obtained in a filtered solution at 0 45 µm and particulate p obtained by the difference between the total p of the unfiltered sample and the soluble p filtered at 0 45 µm haygarth and sharpley 2000 the transfers of n and p by surface runoff from the agricultural lands to the surrounding water bodies causing eutrophication and environmental deterioration of aquatic systems worldwide kim et al 2006 yan et al 2017 in this way the transfer of n and p by surface runoff has been the subject of study in traditional pig and cattle breeding countries in the world and also in brazil anwar et al 2018 ceretta et al 2010a hua and zhu 2020 kleinman et al 2009 lourenzi et al 2014a 2014b 2015 sherman et al 2021 sweeney et al 2012 wang et al 2013 zanon et al 2020 the main results obtained by these authors show that the amounts transferred from these elements are dependent especially on i the amount of nutrient added to the soil through the manure ii the type of soil iii the content of the element in the soil iv the frequency volume and intensity of rainfall and v the cultivation system and the export capacity of the plants used in the production system according to barrow 1999 at each fertilization whether with organic wastes or mineral fertilizer the soil undergoes changes and therefore the importance of its analysis in long term experiments since the effects of these practices tend to amplify over the years the study aimed to evaluate how successive applications of organic and mineral sources of nutrients in a long term experiment managed under no tillage system in a subtropical environment influence the transfer of quantities and forms of n and p by surface runoff 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and treatments the experiment was

described by cqfs rs sc 2004 the experiment started in 2004 in an area under no tillage system and the treatments consisted of the application of pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry mineral fertilizer urea triple superphosphate and potassium chloride and a control treatment without application of nutrients organic wastes and mineral fertilizer were always applied before the sowing of the maize zea mays l until the agricultural year 2009 2010 when it was decided to apply it twice a year that is before the implantation of the winter and summer crops from 2004 2012 black oats avena strigosa schreb were grown in the winter and maize in the summer only in the summer of 2013 black beans phaseolus vulgaris l were grown and black oats were kept as the winter crop the experimental design was a randomized block with four replications and plots with 25 m2 5 5 m the evaluation period of the experiment for the present study was from november 2009 to october 2013 the chemical characteristics of the soil after 12 applications of organic wastes and mineral fertilizer are determined for this soil samples were collected in all plots at a depth of 0 10 cm in september 2012 the

and water used to clean the facilities the pig deep litter consisted of rice processing residues feces urine and food scraps before applications organic wastes was subjected to analysis of n and p on a wet basis tedesco et al 1995 the percentage of dry matter of the organic wastes was obtained by drying the samples at 65 c in an oven with forced air circulation until constant mass the characteristics of organic wastes and the total amounts of nutrients applied before the implantation of each crop are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively the rate of organic wastes was determined based on the n requirement of each crop and the efficiency index of each residue as recommended by cqfs rs sc 2004 the organic wastes and mineral fertilizer were evenly distributed on the soil surface over the cultural residues one day before the sowing of each species without incorporation as usually done by producers in southern brazil in the 12 applications carried out from 2004 to 2013 were applied 1151 8 kg n ha 1 and 457 2 kg p ha 1 via pig slurry 1689 8 kg n ha 1 and 1102 1 kg p ha 1 via pig deep litter 1695 8 kg n ha 1 and 497 8 kg p ha 1 via cattle slurry and 920 kg n ha 1 and 436 5 kg p ha 1 via mineral fertilizer 2 3 collection and analysis of runoff solution for the evaluation of the runoff solution polyvinyl chloride boxes 0 75 m 0 50 m were installed on each plot the slope of the experimental area around 3 the polyvinyl chloride structure was inserted into the soil to a depth of 5 cm the surface runoff was assessed with a hard wired collecting gutter connected to a hose coupled to a collection container 20 l more details about the boxes can be obtained at lourenzi et al 2015 after each natural rainfall not simulated with sufficient runoff volume for analysis the stored runoff volume was removed from the collectors the volume measured and a sample 500 ml taken to the laboratory for analysis to determine the content of ammonium n nh4 20 ml of solution were used with the addition of 0 2 g of mgo and subsequent steam distillation in a kjeldahl half micron vapor distiller and the distilled material being collected in boric acid and the titration of the extract carried out with diluted h2so4 tedesco et al 1995 after distillation 0 2 g of devarda s alloy was added to the same sample and distilled again to determine the levels of nitrate n no3 tedesco et al 1995 the n mineral was obtained by adding the contents of n nh4 n no3 to determine the content of p the samples were separated in two fractions one approximately 50 ml was immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and another fraction was not filtered in the filtered fraction the soluble p concentrations and the unfiltered fraction the concentrations of total p were determined concentrations of soluble p in the runoff water were determined directly in the solution filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane by colorimetry murphy and riley 1962 the total p of the runoff water was determined by acid digestion h2so4 h2o2 in the presence of saturated mgcl2 according to the method of brookes and powlson 1981 the concentrations of particulate p were determined as the difference between the amounts of total p and soluble p haygarth and sharpley 2000 the amounts of total p were determined by colorimetry murphy and riley 1962 2 4 statistical treatment of the data analysis of variance anova was performed to determine treatment effects on runoff and forms of n and p losses in runoff differences between treatment effects were determined by the scott knott test α 0 05 regression analysis were performed to test correlations between amount of n applied soil organic matter runoff nitrogen mineral loss phosphorus applied soil phosphorus extracted by mehlich 1 soluble phosphorus loss particulate phosphorus loss and total phosphorus loss in agricultural years 2009 2010 2012 2013 all statistical analyses were performed using sisvar ferreira 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 solution transfer by surface runoff the solution transfer by surface runoff was greater in the control treatment in six of the eight evaluated crops fig 2 in absolute terms the highest volumes of runoff solution were in the cultivation of black oats 2010 fig 2b due to the significant rainfall that occurred in the months of july and september of that year in addition to the fact that the previous summer season was marked by above average rainfall fig 1 it is known that several factors can affect surface runoff such as rainfall intensity and soil moisture at the time of rainfall among others on the other hand there is a great relationship between the amounts of n applied and content of som and between the content of som and the solution transfer by runoff table 4 and fig 3a b the highest amounts of n applied in the treatments that received the addition of organic wastes or mineral fertilizers increased the som and reduction the solution volumes transfer by surface runoff this may be a consequence of the greater production of dry matter from the crops that received nutrient applications and consequently greater deposition and maintenance of vegetal residues on the soil favored by the fact that the use of organic wastes for long periods increases the total organic carbon content of the soil adeyemo et al 2019 brunetto et al 2012 lin et al 2019 lourenzi et al 2016 2011 the transfer of solution by surface runoff in most of the eight crops showed no differences when using organic wastes or mineral fertilizer fig 2 on average during the eight crops the solution transfer by surface runoff was 29 8 15 8 13 3 15 0 and 15 4 of the total rainfall at control pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer treatments respectively this shows that in the treatments where the cultures were fertilized compared to the control there was an average decrease in transfers by surface runoff by 14 9 equivalent to 1078 m3 ha 1 considering the average annual rainfall at the site some authors observed an even greater decrease in runoff after the application of organic wastes and or crop rotation wortmann and walters 2006 used cattle manure compost for three years in corn and soybean crops which resulted in a 41 reduction in surface runoff compared to the control in this way jiao et al 2011 observed a 50 reduction in the volume of solution transfer by surface runoff with the use of a crop rotation system which was justified by the increase in water infiltration in the soil these results show the importance of the production of large amounts of dry matter by crops and the subsequent maintenance of plant residues on the soil surface in this sense the supply of nutrients whether from an organic or mineral source is essential for greater biomass production by crops adeyemo et al 2019 ceretta et al 2005a ciancio et al 2014 lourenzi et al 2014a throughout the cycles of the different plant species used in the crop rotation system this supply of biomass on the soil surface will contribute to an increase in soil organic matter content adeyemo et al 2019 lin et al 2019 lourenzi et al 2016 this provides improvements in the physical chemical and biological properties of the soil leading to better structuring water infiltration and reduced solution transfer by surface runoff krutz et al 2009 mellek et al 2010 spargo et al 2006 as shown in fig 4a which shows the average volume transfer by surface runoff in the eight crops in addition the maintenance of residues on the soil surface when adopting the no tillage system with crop rotation contributes to the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the raindrop on the soil surface and provides greater efficiency in reducing the transfer of solution by surface runoff bertol et al 2007 tomer et al 2016 wortmann and walters 2006 and the effects of adopting this system are maximized in a long time 3 2 nitrogen transfer by surface runoff the transfers of mineral n in the treatments that received nutrient applications were equal to or less than the control treatment in five of the eight evaluated crops fig 5 this is a positive aspect of the n recommendation system used in the states of rio grande do sul and santa catarina cqfs rs sc 2004 since it shows that most of the n applied via organic wastes or mineral fertilizer is effectively being absorbed by the crops or retained in organic forms at som in addition the greater transfer of solution by surface runoff in the control treatment in most of the evaluated crops fig 2 explains the results obtained since the amount of mineral n losses is closely related to the volume of solution transferred by surface runoff table 4 and fig 3c ceretta et al 2010a zhang et al 2020 as an example of this in the black oats 2010 a greater transfer of solution by surface runoff was observed in the control treatment fig 2b but there was no difference between the treatments for the transfer of mineral n fig 5b showing that the greater volume of solution runoff was a determining factor for the quantities transferred to be similar similar results can be observed in maize in 2010 11 figs 2c and 5c black oats in 2011 figs 2d and 5d black beans in 2012 2013 figs 2g and 5g and black oats in 2013 figs 2h and 5h in this way in a study evaluating the transfer of nutrients by runoff in a typic hapludalf soil with pig slurry rates 0 20 40 and 80 m3 ha 1 in an experiment conducted close to the experiment of this study ceretta et al 2010a found a close relationship between the volume of solution and the amount of mineral n transferred by surface runoff zhang et al 2020 evaluating the influence of climate change and planting structures on solution and nitrogen transfer by surface runoff in a watershed found that the increase in solution transfers due to climate change also reflected in increased losses of nitrogen by surface runoff on average of n transfers by runoff in the eight crops there was no difference between the use of pig deep litter and mineral fertilizer with these treatments providing the highest n transfers fig 4b however when compared to the mineral fertilizer treatment organic wastes such as pig slurry and cattle slurry have approximately 50 of n in ammoniacal forms n nh4 and n nh3 which after application to the soil are quickly transformed into nitrate in the nitrification process aita et al 2006 joshi et al 1994 scherer et al 2007 schirmann et al 2013 which is very mobile in the soil however the presence of organic forms of n in these organic wastes requires the action of microorganisms for mineralization which can decrease n transfers by surface runoff when compared to mineral fertilization where n normally is completely solubilized after application to the soil and this explains why there is no correlation between the amounts of n applied and the losses of mineral n by runoff table 4 organic wastes can also be analyzed according to its physical characteristics in this case it is possible that liquid wastes promote greater transfer of mineral n by surface runoff when compared to solid wastes smith et al 2001 this was observed only in the black beans in 2012 2013 fig 5g while in the maize in 2011 12 fig 5e and black oats in 2012 fig 5f only the cattle slurry showed greater transfers of n compared to the pig deep litter a justification for this is the possibility of liquid wastes causing a superficial sealing of the soil due to the presence of small particles present in the pig and cattle slurry silveira et al 2011 in addition liquid sources of organic wastes increase the moisture content of the soil soon after application reducing the rate of water infiltration of the soil especially if the rainfall event takes place soon after the manure application this contributes to the increase in runoff and nutrient transfers in the first pluviometric events after the application of residues considering that in these events occur the greatest transfers of nutrients by runoff anwar et al 2018 ceretta et al 2010a cui et al 2020 kaufmann et al 2019 smith et al 2007 this shows the importance of planning prior to the application of organic wastes considering soil and climate conditions and how these factors interact with residues of different chemical and physical characteristics giacomini et al 2009 however considering the average of the period evaluated the pig deep litter showed greater transfers of n by surface runoff when compared to the pig and cattle slurry fig 4b this occurred due to the results obtained during the cultivation of corn 2009 2010 fig 5a where the transfer of mineral n was 25 7 kg ha 1 with pig deep litter application reflecting in transfers of mineral n higher by 79 and 244 compared to the pig slurry 14 3 kg ha 1 and cattle slurry 7 5 kg ha 1 respectively in the other crops the transfers of mineral n with pig deep litter were much lower than these values fig 5 justifying the fact that the transfers of only one crop influenced the average data of the evaluated period in the state of rio grande do sul southern brazil there are marked differences in temperature and volume of precipitation depending on the season in autumn winter when black oats are grown temperatures are normally lower and there is higher soil moisture compared to spring summer when corn and beans were grown fig 1 this justifies the fact that in the autumn winter the transfers of mineral n by runoff were on average 5 58 9 35 13 33 and 14 85 of the n applied with the pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer respectively while in the spring summer were 5 14 4 49 2 50 and 8 26 respectively the lower water infiltration in the soil and the lower microbial activity in the autumn winter decrease the n mineralization of organic wastes and the absorption by plants as well as the n losses through volatilization basso et al 2004 the which favors the accumulation of n on the soil surface and increases the transfer of mineral n by surface runoff gilles et al 2009 sweeney et al 2012 these results demonstrate that soil conservation practices are even more important in autumn winter aiming to decrease runoff because there are other reports in the literature that show greater transfers of mineral n by surface runoff in these seasons this is the case of miller et al 2006 who observed in southern alberta canada that in areas with the application of organic wastes the losses of n by surface runoff are dependent of the season being higher in the autumn winter likewise udawatta et al 2006 found greater losses of total n in the period when the soil was with the highest moisture in southern brazil ceretta et al 2005b also observed greater transfers of n mineral in the autumn winter seasons in a study that evaluated the transfer of nutrients by surface runoff in typic hapludalf soil with applications of rates of 0 20 40 and 80 m3 ha 1 of pig slurry in an experiment conducted close to the experiment of this study 3 3 phosphorus transfer by surface runoff the greatest transfers of p especially soluble and total p forms occurred with the use of organic wastes when compared with mineral fertilizer and control in most crops figs 6 and 7 in part this can be justified because with the use of pig slurry pig deep litter and cattle slurry 5 152 and 14 higher amounts of p were added to the soil respectively in relation to the total p applied in the mineral fertilizer treatment table 3 this occurred mainly because the amounts of applied organic wastes were defined to meet the need for n by plants according to official recommendations cqfs rs sc 2004 for this the correlations between soluble p and total p transfers by surface runoff were also significant with the amount of p applied table 4 and fig 3d the fact that the criterion used to determine the dose of organic wastes is based on the need for n in cultures is usual in the states of rio grande do sul and santa catarina in the south of brazil cqfs rs sc 2004 however this usually means adding greater amounts of p via organic wastes in relation to the need for crops this was also demonstrated in the work of ceretta et al 2010a who observed a close correlation between the amounts of p applied via pig slurry and the amounts of p transferred by surface runoff after 19 applications of rates of 0 20 40 and 80 m3 ha 1 of pig slurry in a rotation of cultures in a typic hapludalf soil hahn et al 2012 also observed high levels of p in the soil and increased transfers of p by surface runoff after the use of swine manure for a long period in a study carried out in switzerland however the potential for greater transfers of p by surface runoff is influenced not only by the amount of p applied but also by other factors such as fertilization rate amount of p in the soil demand by crops topography temperature use of soil and precipitation intensity and duration liu et al 2012 mcdowell et al 2011 sweeney et al 2012 tomer et al 2016 wang et al 2013 the soluble p was the form that was most sensitive to the variation in surface runoff due to the sources and there is a great relationship with the runoff amounts of p applied and the contents of soil p extracted by mehlich 1 table 4 and fig 3c e during the eight crops evaluated were transferred 6 4 18 0 25 1 12 6 and 9 9 kg ha 1 of soluble p for the control pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer treatments respectively figs 6 and 7 this represents the transfer of 5 8 7 0 4 8 and 7 0 of the p applied in the crops in the pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer treatments respectively the greatest soluble p transfers when organic fertilization was applied possibly occur due to the increase in the concentration of p in the soil solution as observed by de conti et al 2015 in a typic hapludalf soil with 19 applications of 0 20 40 and 80 m3 ha 1 pig slurry applications rates in an experiment conducted close to the experiment of this study the transfer of particulate p was not shown to be a form of p that would be useful to differentiate between organic wastes and mineral fertilizer if we analyzed the individual crops figs 6 and 7 however on average the transfer of particulate p was greater in the organic wastes when compared with the control and mineral fertilizer treatments fig 4c in this form 6 0 10 0 17 1 9 8 and 5 6 kg ha 1 were transferred by runoff during the eight crops evaluated for the control pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer treatments respectively this represents the transfer of 3 2 4 8 3 8 and 4 0 of the p applied with the pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer treatments respectively the transfer of particulate p has a great relationship with the amount of p applied and soil p extracted by mehlich 1 table 4 and fig 3d e and this may explain the greatest transfers observed with the application of pig deep litter the treatment that received the highest additions of p due to the fact that the doses of the treatments were defined to supply n demand for crops the fact that more particulate p was transfer in the control treatment when compared with mineral fertilizer may be explained by the lower deposition of cultural residues on the soil due to the lower production of dry matter by the cultures of this treatment during the eight crops in which total p transfers in the surface runoff were evaluated 12 4 27 4 42 4 22 4 and 15 4 kg ha 1 were transferred in the control pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer treatments respectively which represent the transfer of 8 9 11 8 8 6 and 10 9 of the total amount of p applied respectively in the treatments that received nutrients applications in this sense bertol et al 2010 also found transfers of p by surface runoff less than 15 of the total p applied via pig slurry which suggests that these are insignificant values for plant nutrition sharpley et al 2001 however it is important to note that successive applications or excessive rates of nutrient sources over time result in application of p above the demand of the crops which can promote the accumulation of p on the soil surface layers and can increase the p transfers by surface runoff and potentiate the eutrophication processes in surface water sources ceretta et al 2010a kim et al 2006 yan et al 2017 yin et al 2018 in relation to transfers of total p approximately 51 66 60 56 and 64 of the total p are in soluble form for the control pig slurry pig deep litter cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer treatments respectively these forms soluble and total present a great relationship with the amounts of p applied and the contents of soil p extracted by mehlich 1 table 4 and fig 3d e in this sense it is important to highlight that after 12 applications of the nutrient sources there were increases in the contents of p extracted by mehlich 1 in the soil of 86 321 386 and 649 with mineral fertilizer pig slurry cattle slurry and pig deep litter respectively when compared with the control table 1 and 42 222 271 and 472 respectively when compared with the initial content of p in the experiment 2004 year the fact that there are large increments of p in the soil with the use of organic wastes shows that care must be taken in the use of these residues especially when determining the amount to be applied using the n requirement of the crops as a criterion in addition it is important to note that a large part of the p present in organic wastes is found in mineral forms as observed by cassol et al 2001 and li et al 2020 who found more than 60 of the p in inorganic forms in the evaluated organic wastes inorganic forms of p are readily available to plants and are also the main form of p accumulation in the soil especially in the superficial layers adeli et al 2008 ceretta et al 2010b chardon et al 2007 gatiboni et al 2008 guardini et al 2012 lourenzi et al 2016 as observed in the present study there is a great relationship between the amounts of p applied with organic wastes and contents of p extracted by mehlich 1 in the soil and these factors with the forms of p transfers by surface runoff hahn et al 2012 lourenzi et al 2015 sweeney et al 2012 wang et al 2013 this is due to the fact that with successive applications of p amounts above the demand of the crops there is a saturation of the adsorption sites of the reactive soil particles thus the p will be more susceptible to migration in the soil profile especially in soils with low clay contents as a typic hapludalf soil of this study increasing the risk of contamination of subsurface waters de conti et al 2015 liu et al 2019 lourenzi et al 2013 or be transferred by surface runoff ceretta et al 2010a lourenzi et al 2015 2014b 4 conclusions in this study we evaluated the transfers of n and p by surface runoff in a typic hapludalf soil with organic wastes and mineral fertilizer application the doses of organic wastes were defined to supply n demand for crops and the amounts of p applied were greater than mineral fertilizer and that influenced the results obtained the amount of solution transferred by surface runoff decreased with fertilization in relation to control the transfers of mineral n increased with the increase in the contents of som but decreased with the runoff the transfers of p forms present a great relationship with the amounts of p applied and the contents of soil p extracted by mehlich 1 and more than 55 of total p transferred by surface runoff in the treatments that received nutrients application is on soluble form in addition the transfer of soluble particulate and total p was lower with mineral fertilizer application when compared with organic wastes this suggest that the use of n demand by crops as a criterium to meet the doses of organic wastes is not adequate in subtropical

10183,the effects of water distribution patterns in drip irrigation on fruit production and fruit quality were evaluated during two seasons in two commercial orchards of gala brookfield apple trees grafted on m 9 dwarf rootstock research was conducted at el manzano farm with a clay loam soil irrigated three times per week and in santa mercedes farm with a stony loam soil irrigated daily both farms are located in the central valley of chile the farm irrigation system was modified to establish three treatments which differed in the number of drip laterals per row one two and four with 4 0 2 0 and 1 0 l h 1 emitters spaced at 50 cm in both farms respectively all treatments received the same amount of water per week in each farm based on the technical criteria of the farm advisor applied water in each farm was compared against the water use estimated by the aquasat platform in the clay loam soil the volume of applied water was similar to the aquasat estimate however in the stony loam soil applied water was less than that estimated by aquasat the results showed significant differences in production among treatments which varied only in the volume of wetted soil the best results pooled over the two years were obtained with one lateral per row t1 in the clay loam soil yield of 59 3 t ha 1 and with four laterals per row t3 in the stony loam soil which yielded 50 8 t ha 1 higher yields were associated with a tendency of greater fruit numbers per tree in both farms fruit quality requirements for export equatorial diameter 60 mm weight 90 g were achieved but not the firmness in the second season at the stony loam soil due to an irrigation deficit our results in apple emphasize the need to wet sufficient soil volume under drip irrigation regardless of irrigation amounts in light textured soils in particular keywords aquasat drip irrigation soil water content brookfield gala apple 1 introduction apples are an important fruit crop grown in chile for export and they are the second most exported fruit in the country in the maule region the red apple production area is 18 706 ha and nationally it is estimated to be 29 168 ha the area of red apple grown with drip irrigation is 4863 ha and of gala brookfield baigent apple brookfield gala is 1443 ha where nearly 80 of apples grown are intended for export odepa ciren 2016 among the strategies to compete in world markets the availability of new apple varieties is critical as it places the country in a privileged position in terms of export as compared to its competitors grau 2015 the gala brookfield apple is known for being of good quality and having an attractive red color and uniformly distributed grooves furthermore at present the high density crops systems grafted in the m 9 dwarfing pattern where the greatest root activity is found in the superficial layers are being promoted foster et al 2016 yuri et al 2011 kviklys et al 2012 this results in smaller trees better management greater production and easier harvest the reduction in root system size by using dwarfing rootstocks has implications when drip irrigation is used under high evaporative demand as there must be a minimum wetted soil volume below which water stress will develop despite supplying full amounts of water girona et al 2010 found that the yield in apple trees grafted onto dwarfing m 9 rootstock growing in loam soil was greater with one dripper per tree due to less evaporation from soil and to deeper infiltration in the soil profile than with two drippers per tree however the positive effects of increasing the wetted volume of soil in almond trees were shown by espadafor et al 2018 in their work even when water supply was not limiting almond trees exhibited an enhanced growth and transpiration response when the volume of wetted soil was increased garcía tejera et al 2017 have shown with a simulation model of olive that in drip irrigated trees transpiration can be limited by the wetted soil volume in addition they established that the irrigation design should consider that under conditions of low availability of irrigation water the wetted area of soil should be limited to minimize evaporation losses on the other hand there is some evidence that increased soil wetting volume results in higher yields morales et al 2010 in peach garcia petillo and castel 2004 in citrus holzapfel et al 2015 studied the effect of the number of laterals per row and irrigation frequency in drip irrigated blueberries where the use of four laterals per row in a sandy soil resulted in higher production and fruit quality than two and six laterals per row all applying the same amount of water per bush as all fresh fruits apples are primarily composed by water and fruit growth is most affected when trees are subjected to water deficits which can significantly reduce fruit size mpelasoka et al 2001a 2001b leib et al 2006 due to the shortage of water resources available for agriculture more efficient irrigation strategies are needed to optimize the use of water in apple trees leib et al 2006 talluto et al 2008 girona et al 2010 naor 2014 zhong et al 2019 considering that water stress is an important factor that can limit plant performance during the initial phases of growth and orchard establishment psarras and merwin 2000 as for apple quality water deficits can increase the concentration of soluble solids mpelasoka et al 2001a 2001b leib et al 2006 also pulp firmness increases as the amount of water applied is reduced fallahi et al 2010 additionally pre harvest climatic conditions may affect fruit diameter but this is not necessarily correlated with appropriate fruit maturity feippe 1993 drip irrigation in high density apple tree orchards generally uses one to two emitter laterals per row li et al 2002 naor et al 1999 therefore an analysis of the relationship between production and fruit quality with respect to the soil wetting pattern for the same volume of water applied is an important and necessary factor to evaluate especially given the importance of root distribution in apples the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of water distribution in drip irrigation on fruit production and fruit quality of gala brookfield apple grafted on m 9 dwarf rootstock in two locations with different soil conditions el manzano farm clay loam soil and santa mercedes farm stony loam soil 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was performed in a commercial orchard at el manzano clay loam soil and santa mercedes stony loam soil farms both farms have cv gala brookfield grafted on m 9 dwarf rootstock with cv granny smith as pollinator and were planted in 2012 in an area of 17 ha in el manzano farm and 8 ha in santa mercedes farm in río claro and molina county located in the central valley of chile fig 1 el manzano farm is located at the latitude 35 14 19 01 s and longitude 71 16 43 84 w altitude 267 m a s l santa mercedes farm is located at latitude 35 8 18 33 s and longitude 71 15 16 91 w altitude 277 m a s l and they are located 11 km apart both farms have a mediterranean marine climate with an average annual temperature of 14 9 c an average maximum temperature of 30 8 c in the warmest month january and a minimum average of 3 8 c in the coldest month july the frost free growing period is 7 months from october to april the annual sum of temperatures with a base of 5 c is 3598 day and 1854 day with a base temperature of 10 c the cold hours from march to november are 1018 average annual precipitation is 735 mm with june being the rainiest month with an average of 189 mm pan evaporation reaches 1108 mm per year with a maximum of 215 mm month in january and a minimum of 19 mm month in june the dry season is approximately 4 months long and lasts from december to march del pozo and del canto 1999 2 2 experimental orchard apple trees were spaced 1 m apart in the row and 3 5 m between rows with an east west orientation the agronomic management was provided by copefrut company www copefrut cl following the standards of high density orchards winter pruning fertilization weed control pest management and chemical and manual fruit thinning in order to leave a fruit load of 100 120 fruits tree fertigation was used in both orchards throughout the two irrigation seasons october march in weekly applications for a total annual

days from october to december and 9 kg ha 1 co nh2 2 plus 15 kg ha 1 mgso4 with three applications every 7 10 days from november to march the training system was the tall spindle position and winter pruning in the high density orchards took place during the third or fourth year for precocity and productive centers near the trunk where the height of the tree was limited to 3 2 m the soil physical parameters were determined by the pressure plate method klute 1986 on soil dry mass basis at pressures of 0 03 and 1 5 mpa el manzano farm has soil with a clay loam texture fluventic humic dystroxerepts surface slope about 0 5 to the west and a field capacity ranging from 0 24 g g 1 on the surface to 0 23 g g 1 at the 0 9 m depth and a permanent wilting point of 0 13 g g 1 throughout the profile santa mercedes farm has a homogeneous soil profile of loamy texture aquic durixerolls with a field capacity of 0 24 g g 1 and permanent wilting point of 0 10 g g 1 a surface slope about 0 4 to the south with 50 stones in the soil matrix that greatly reduces the water holding capacity no water table was observed down to 2 0 m at both farms during the two irrigation seasons 2 3 experimental design prior to this study both farms used drip irrigation with two laterals per row and 4 non pressure compensating emitters of 2 l h 1 per tree the 2014 2015 season was used as an adjustment period to avoid carry over effects as the irrigation system was modified in the spring of 2014 experimental seasons were 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 for each type of soil a completely randomized block experimental design was established with three treatments and four replicates each individual block consisted of 9 rows of trees the experimental unit per treatment consisted of three contiguous rows of 40 trees each with a central measuring row and two guard rows ten trees in each central row per plot were identified for the two seasons of analysis for a total of 30 trees sampled per block three treatments and a total of 120 trees measured in each orchard the 12 experimental plots were located in a 0 5 ha area within the commercial orchard at both farms blocks were established across rows with irrigation treatments randomly assigned within each block the three irrigation treatments were one lateral per tree row with drippers spaced 50 cm two emitters per tree and flow rate of 4 l h 1 t1 two laterals per tree row with drippers spaced 50 cm four emitters per tree and flow of 2 l h 1 t2 and four laterals per tree row with drippers spaced 50 cm eight emitters per tree and flow rate of 1 l h 1 t3 this design allows maintaining the same volume of applied water in each treatment but achieving differential wetting patterns 2 4 irrigation management in the clay loam soil el manzano farm irrigation was applied three times a week during the season in the stony loam soil santa mercedes farm irrigation took place three times a week in october and november and daily from monday to saturday for the rest of the season december to march the volume of applied water and the irrigation frequency were determined following the criteria of the technical advisor in both farms the theoretical volume of irrigation water required by each orchard management unit on each farm was estimated using an online computational platform called aquasat 2016 the aquasat platform is a decision support system that allows estimating actual crop evapotranspiration determined from a spatially distributed evapotranspiration map using a surface energy balance model and internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 and the landsat 7 and 8 satellite images with a spatial resolution of 30 by 30 m with this information of actual crop evapotranspiration aquasat performed a weekly forecast of orchard water demand based on the hargreaves and samani model samani 2000 even though remote sensing estimates of evapotranspiration for orchards could be less precise it is important to note that the estimates from aquasat are upper limit values indeed gonzalo martín et al 2017 showed that root mean square errors for evapotranspiration estimates are around 1 5 mm day 1 after assessing the performance of surface energy balance models using satellite images in the central valley of chile thus aquasat has shown to be a reliable and useful tool to tailor irrigation management practices by providing for next days estimates ex ante estimates or for ex post assessment holzapfel et al 2020 gavilán et al 2019 it must be stressed that aquasat evapotranspiration estimates are used as guiding values instead of error free values of actual crop evapotranspiration in a review about estimates of actual et using remote sensing methods zhang et al 2016 discusses the sources and approaches to reduce uncertainties in time and space they conclude that merging multiple sources would increase accuracy but not necessarily the understanding of underlying physical process also it is important to note that uncertainty coming from field data at the point scale may not be representative of what is occurring at the field scale weather data were obtained from the tres esquinas meteorological station inia 2017 located 3 km east from santa mercedes farm and 14 km northeast from el manzano farm daily precipitation and minimum and maximum air temperatures for the two experimental seasons are shown in fig 2 2 5 soil moisture measurements the soil moisture content was determined twice a week with a neutron probe troxler model 4300 nc usa that was calibrated at the site r2 of 0 88 in the clay loam soil el manzano farm during the first season three access tubes were installed at the treatment sites of one lateral t1 five access tubes in the treatment of two lateral t2 and the treatment of four lateral t3 had seven access tubes distributed around the trunk perpendicular to the plantation row fig 3 a moisture was measured in soil layers of 0 30 30 60 60 90 cm each block of the experimental design had a similar access tube arrangement for each treatment with a total of 12 trees in the second season soil moisture content was measured with a set of seven watermark sensors for depths comprising layers of 0 30 30 60 60 90 cm around the root system of a representative tree fig 3b and in a single experimental unit per treatment the soil moisture content in the santa mercedes farm due to its 50 stone content was measured with a set of seven watermark sensors irrometer company inc ca usa for depths comprising layers of 0 30 30 60 60 90 cm around the root system of a representative tree fig 3b and in a single experimental unit per treatment a datalogger measured the voltage readings of the seven sensors every 30 min the soil water tension readings were converted to soil water content values through the individual laboratory calibration of the watermark sensors the sensors were placed in a water container for 12 h in order to reach a saturation tension of 0 centibar soil samples were sieved at 2 mm mesh and taken to a container where the sensors were positioned at 15 cm depth and 25 cm apart in saturated soil recording the water tension after sensor voltage readings were stabilized the extracted soil samples were then placed in an oven at 105 c temperature for 48 h to obtain the gravimetric moisture content at the respective tensions finally the relation between gravimetric moisture content and soil water tension was determined using a quadratic adjustment the soil moisture content for both farms was depicted using the kriging interpolation method oliver and webster 1990 implemented in matlab 2 6 fruit yield and statistical analysis the harvest took place in mid february in both seasons when all the fruits of the 10 trees in the central row of each experimental unit 40 trees per treatment were harvested the total harvest weight was obtained using a digital scale with a precision of 0 5 kg for fruit quality parameters 30 fruits from each experimental unit were randomly selected and the weight of each fruit was measured with a precision of 1 0 g the equatorial diameter was measured for each of the selected fruits using a vernier caliper fruit flesh firmness was measured at the equator of each fruit after removing the exocarp peel using a manual pressure meter effegi ft 327 italy with an 11 mm strut at the time of fruit firmness evaluation total soluble solids brix were measured with a refractometer atago model master t japan in january 2017 trunk diameters were measured in 40 trees per treatment at both farms 15 cm above the graft union for both seasons and farms the fraction of soil surface covered by the green canopy was 70 in january for each farm independently an analysis of variance anova was conducted considering separately irrigation treatments and season the means were compared with tukey s multiple test p 0 05 using r project software 3 results and discussion 3 1 applied water in the 2015 2016 irrigation season at the farm of clay loam soil the applied water was very similar to that estimated by aquasat fig 4 a the water volume estimated by aquasat was 3187 m3 ha 1 while applied water was 3080 m3 ha 1 a difference of ca 3 for the 2016 january to early march period similarly in the 2016 2017 irrigation season fig 4 c the water volume estimated by aquasat was 5066 m3 ha 1 and the water volume applied was 4851 m3 ha 1 a difference of ca 4 for the october 2016 february 2017 period while there were minor variations along the irrigation season in el manzano farm there was general agreement between the applied water and aquasat estimates of seasonal water requirements for the stony loam soil in the 2015 2016 irrigation season fig 4 b the volume estimated by aquasat was 3422 m3 ha 1 while the volume of applied water was 14 less 2945 m3 ha 1 for the 2016 january to march period for most of that period there was an irrigation deficit even though in february there was an excess of applied water in the second season october 2016 to end of february 2017 fig 4 d the water requirements estimated by aquasat were 4375 m3 ha 1 while the applied water was 3035 m3 ha 1 a deficit of ca 30 from october until the middle of december water application was less than that calculated by aquasat and thereafter amounts were similar thus in the santa mercedes farm the volume of applied water was insufficient to meet the demand estimated by aquasat particularly in the second season despite the missing data from october to december 2015 2016 season and given the climatic conditions that concentrate the irrigation season in summer our irrigation study encompasses the main season in both years and farms and it is highly probable that the picture that emerges from this research will not change in fact in spring the soil is still wet from the winter rains and the orchard water requirements are still low furthermore two rains of 20 mm each occurred in december 2015 fig 2a so the irrigation requirements decreased even more it is well known that the timing extend and magnitude of water deficits excesses could affect yield and quality at harvest kuschel otárola et al 2020a even though weekly values are shown in fig 4 it must be emphasized that the experimental design was set to assess differences between seasonal applied water and fruit quality at harvest even with the detailed data collected it is extremely difficult to disentangle water stress variations at weekly time scale as shown in fig 4 at santa mercedes farm where there were periods on excess stress however in this regard aquasat provides guidance raising flags when applied water is outside the predefined ranges leading to water excess stress 3 2 soil water content fig 5 presents representative data on soil water content prior to an irrigation event in the 2015 2016 season for both farms for the clay loam soil t2 and t3 exhibited a gradual decrease in soil water content vertically and a horizontal variation with maximum depletion at the deeper depths fig 5 under the tree trunk the low soil water content values observed close to the permanent wilting point in these two treatments would indicate a situation of low water availability however t1 treatment showed water uptake just in the first 45 cm of depth around the trunk indicating a shallower water extraction pattern in the stony loam soil there was increased depletion with depth as the number of laterals increased from t1 to t3 as indicated by the lower water content in t3 the seasonal trend during 2016 2017 of soil water content at two soil depths for the three treatments is presented in fig 6 in the case of clay loam soil the effects of the different treatments on soil moisture content are clear for the case of t1 the first two strata in the area near the trunk remained close to field capacity indicating the expansion of the wet bulb in this type of soil by contrast 54 cm away from the trunk the soil moisture content is monotonically decreasing down to the permanent wilting point this was probably caused by the combination of root water extraction outside the emitter zone and of evaporation from the unshaded soil for the t2 treatment and 0 30 cm of soil depth it is observed that the zone closest to the trunk was maintained at high soil water content decreasing soil water content occurred at a distance of 27 cm from the trunk since the end of december and at a distance of 54 cm from the trunk since the end of november at the 30 60 cm of soil depth the soil water content decreased only at a distance of 54 cm from the trunk for the t3 treatment the total soil profile remained with high soil water content due to the pattern of tree water uptake and the extracting capacity of the root system under a very shallow and wide wetted surface area the stony loam soil showed in general soil water content variability both vertical and horizontally during october through november fig 6 with high soil water content near the trunk for all treatments in the upper layer however since the beginning of december a change of irrigation frequency from three times a week to daily irrigation produced an effect on the soil wetting pattern too in t1 the soil water content at 27 cm distance remained in the range between field capacity and permanent wilting point a situation attributed to root water extraction also at 54 cm away from the trunk the soil water content remained practically at permanent wilting point during the entire season showing that irrigation water did not reach that zone in the 30 60 cm depth close to the trunk and 27 cm away the soil water content was close to field capacity however at 54 cm away from the trunk the soil water content approached permanent wilting point values throughout the irrigation season in t2 it was observed constant high soil water content near the trunk as well as at 27 cm from it in the upper layer while at 54 cm away from the trunk the soil water content remained between field capacity and permanent wilting point probably due to lack of wetting by the emitters and to soil water evaporation for the 30 60 cm depth the soil water content remained practically near field capacity for all distances from the trunk through the entire irrigation season finally in the t3 treatment the soil water content at all distances away from the trunk at all depths stayed near field capacity since the beginning of december girona 2007 found for mature apple trees grafted on m 9 rootstock growing in a loam texture soil little water extraction below 40 cm of depth in addition girona et al 2008 2010 determined that under extreme drought conditions reducing the number of emitters per tree from two to one drastically reduced the wetted area decreasing soil evaporation thus leaving more water available in the soil profile with a positive effect on yields then it can be concluded that the volume of soil water content in clay loam soil under t1 would allow adequate soil water content up to a distance of 27 cm from the trunk in the first two layers of soil 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm on the other hand in t3 there was high soil water content in the profile fig 6 which is not recommended for the m 9 dwarf rootstock it is known that m 9 rootstock requires a well drained soil crassweller and schupp 2018 in fact olien and lakso 1986 observed under warm and sunny conditions and high soil moisture lower midday stem water potential of apple trees grafted on m 9 than in trees grafted on other rootstocks in the case of a stony loam soil the volume of soil wetted in the first 60 cm of depth and up to a distance of 54 cm from the trunk was largely suitable in the t3 treatment since december associated with the change in irrigation frequency from three times a week in october and november to daily irrigation for the rest of the season however it was insufficient for the t1 and t2 treatments paltineanu et al 2017 determined an intense concentration of roots near the tree with an 80 of roots in the first 60 cm of soil depth and to a horizontal distance of 40 cm on the row and 70 cm between rows in mature apple trees grafted on m 9 growing in a loamy sand soil under drip irrigation tanasescu and paltineanu 2004 found in a loamy sand texture and under various irrigation methods maximum values of active roots within the first 40 cm of depth in golden delicious apple grafted on m m 106 rootstock semi dwarfing for this reason soils with low water storage capacity tend to have the highest root concentration in the superficial layers of soils when there is an adequate level of water in such strata in addition it is important to point out that the root system requires to obtain the water from an adequate volume of soil that has the capability to provide the water in periods of highest evaporative demand fernandez and perry 1995 in a research with several apple rootstocks including m 9 in two type of soils found that around 91 94 of roots were localized in the first 60 cm depth in silt loam soil with a fragipan at 60 and 70 cm below the soil surface however in soil without any restriction fine sandy loam only an average of 60 of roots were in the first 60 cm depth showing that the root system growth is greatly affected by soil conditions the soil moisture data fig 6 confirmed that water deficits developed in the santa mercedes farm due to the water applied being less than that predicted by aquasat to compensate for this irrigation deficit in the october to december period fig 4 an active root water uptake was observed which is reflected in the decrease of soil moisture at t2 and t3 in all distances from the trunk in that period in the case of t1 this situation was less noticeable 3 3 production the total fruit production shown in table 1 indicates that in both seasons at the clay loam soil site the highest yield was obtained in the t1 treatment this response indicates that sufficient soil volume was wetted with one lateral probably in the zone of the largest amount of roots water extraction fig 5 showed in t1 that in this soil it was possible to wet with one lateral an adequate density of active roots in approximately 60 cm in depth and a horizontal diameter of 54 cm the two other treatments t2 and t3 also wetted more horizontally but also more superficially than in t1 causing more evaporation from soil for this clay loam soil one lateral per row with emitters of 4 l h 1 spaced at 50 cm allowed for an application of water that wetted the root water extraction zone in an appropriate way the fruit production in the stony loam soil was significantly higher in t3 for both seasons table 1 this would indicate that wetting a greater soil volume resulted in more effective irrigation due to the low soil water storage capacity as affected by the presence of stones 50 in the soil matrix conversely in t1 and t2 the soil water content mostly increased in depth but the surface layers with the highest density of active roots did not get sufficient water thus t3 wetted a greater soil volume than the other two treatments in the first two layers where the highest root densities occur girona 2007 in the second season there was an increase in production on both farms even though at santa mercedes the water applied was less than what aquasat estimated fig 4 possibly increased tree growth from the fourth to the fifth year led to greater estimated water requirements as a comparison yuri et al 2011 obtained average yields around 24 9 ton ha in a 4 year old apple tree grafted on m m 106 semi dwarfing and 42 5 ton ha in a 5 year old brookfield gala on rootstock m 9 emla dwarfing in a commercial orchard on a silty clay loam soil ortega et al 2014 in a zone with the same climatic conditions as those of our study obtained similar yields 58 5 ton ha with 6 year old royal gala grafted on rootstock m 26 dwarfing in clay loam soil drip irrigated two laterals and four emitters per tree with a 100 reposition of crop evapotranspiration however with a 125 reposition of crop evapotranspiration yield was only 38 70 ton ha on the other hand yildirim et al 2016 showed lower yields 42 9 ton ha for a 5 year old royal gala grafted on rootstock m 9 in a medium light textured soil in isparta turkey with very heavy crop load and excess water application using a kp of 1 25 of class a pan evaporation under drip irrigation with two laterals and four emitters per tree these reports and our results show the importance of maintaining adequate soil moisture distribution conditions of apple trees grafted on rootstock m 9 thus soil type and wetting patterns under drip irrigation have an important influence on the yield and performance of trees under different irrigation strategies as it provides a significant storage and buffer for plants making it possible to produce more crop per drop kuschel otárola et al 2020b 3 4 fruit quality for both seasons and soil types tables 2 and 3 the fruit equatorial diameters were above the 60 mm minimum required by the standard codex stan 299 2010 fao 2010 for apples without significant differences between treatments at each farm however there was a trend to higher equatorial diameter values in the stony soil in both seasons probably due to a reduction of fruit numbers as found by yildirim et al 2016 the weight of the fruit was higher than the 90 g minimum required for export fao 2010 in both seasons and soil types tables 2 and 3 significant differences in fruit weight were not recorded between treatments at each farm but the fruit weight was significant higher at both farms in the second season it is important to mention that the number of fruits is directly related to yield and this variable is highly relevant in commercial production yildirim et al 2016 furthermore with optimal pruning as well as agronomic management larger fruit sizes can be obtained parra quezada et al 2008 the trunk diameter is associated with the climatic conditions of the area yuri et al 2011 and the fruit load in the management of the orchards barden and marini 2001 yildirim et al 2016 in january 2017 el manzano farm recorded a trunk diameter of 5 7 cm t1 and t2 and 5 5 cm t3 while santa mercedes farm recorded a trunk diameter of 4 3 cm t1 and 4 6 cm t2 and t3 without significant differences between treatments at each farm on the other hand this average difference of 1 1 cm between the two farms may be an indication of differences in irrigation management that are expressed in fruit number per tree in our case the number of fruits per tree at harvest was lower in stony loam soil in both seasons table 3 likewise the tendency of a greater number of fruits in the t3 treatment for both seasons would explain the greater yield in the stony loam soil when irrigated with four laterals per row also the tendency of the t1 treatment in clay loam soil towards a higher number of fruits would explain its higher yield table 2 as for fruit firmness this variable was higher than 76 n cm2 17 lb cm2 in the clay loam soil table 2 while the firmness values in the second season in the stony loam soil were below the minimum required for export table 3 these results could be related to the deficit irrigation situation that occurred in the stony loam soil as detected by aquasat fig 4 d especially during initial fruit development stage on the other hand mpelasoka et al 2001a reported that late season deficit irrigation increased firmness in 7 year old braeburn apple grown in lysimeters and irrigated at 40 of well irrigated control treatment on the other hand fallahi et al 2010 with 5 year old autumn rose fuji apple fruits and talluto et al 2008 with 5 year old lady pink apple fruits shown that fruit firmness at harvest was unaffected by irrigation regimes low firmness at harvest and low calcium uptake into the plant is associated to low soil water content and high temperatures during the growing cycle milosevic and milosevic 2015 also several postharvest disorders are related to calcium in apple fruits doryanizadeh et al 2017 and fruit with higher firmness at harvest tend to maintain better conditions after storage than fruit with lower firmness johnston et al 2002 the total soluble solids showed a higher concentration of sugars in the fruit grown during the second season for both soils considering that the minimum acceptable value is 10 5 brix fao 2010 all treatments would comply with this requirement tables 2 and 3 however yuri et al 2019 mention that 12 brix is required to export from chile in such case t2 and t3 treatments in clay loam soil table 2 and t1 treatment in stony loam soil table 3 did not reach this minimum value in the first season 3 5 analysis of number of laterals per row costs and production based on the results herein and from an economic point of view the annual equivalent marginal income gained by investing in two additional drip laterals per row t3 at santa mercedes farm annual interest rate of 8 is profitable considering that drip tubing costs approximately us 0 20 m and fruit prices average us 0 3 kg odepa 2020 the investment required for adding two extra laterals per row would be paid in one year even at a marginal increase of annual fruit production near 4 0 t ha 1 with all other variables constant thus the observed increase in yield in one year 8 0 t ha 1 would pay twice for the investment necessary to irrigate with four laterals t3 apples in santa mercedes farm another option to be explored in low soil water storage situations is to use micro sprinklers that would wet a larger surface area instead of drippers this would be strictly an engineering and economic decision by contrast at the el manzano farm given our experimental results the expected increase in marginal revenue by reducing the standard two laterals per tree row installation to one lateral per row does not make economic sense however for new projects in this type of soil one lateral per row reduces the initial costs of the irrigation system in the first years of the orchard 4 conclusions this study shows that variations in the wetting patterns under drip irrigation caused significant differences in fruit yield and quality on two different soil types in the production of gala brookfield apple orchards grafted on m 9 dwarf rootstock the best results varied with soil type emphasizing the need to consider availability of stored soil water in drip irrigation design in the clay loam soil yields were higher with a one lateral per row and two 4 l h 1 emitters per tree t1 59 29 t ha 1 while in a stony loam soil the highest production was obtained with four laterals per row and eight 1 l h 1 emitters per tree t3 50 82 t ha 1 pooled over the two growing seasons the research showed that there was a positive response to increasing the number of emitters in santa mercedes farm beyond the normal two drip lines that farmers use due to its stony loam soil type soil water monitoring confirmed that the different irrigation treatments induced different soil wetted volumes and extraction patterns in the clay loam soil t1 provided the most adequate wet volume for deeper extraction however in the stony loam soil with four laterals per row t3 and daily irrigation frequency the volume of soil wetted in the first 45 cm of soil depth in t3 was greater than in the other two treatments applied water in the clay loam soil was similar to the estimated volume by aquasat in both seasons by contrast in the stony loam soil especially for the second season there was an irrigation deficit relative to that estimated by aquasat this may explain the greater fruit production in the farm with clay loam soil in both seasons but emphasizes the need to wet an adequate soil volume under deficit irrigation as well based on the results obtained in mature gala brookfield apple trees grafted on m 9 dwarf rootstock it was established that the treatment of one lateral per row with two 4 0 l h 1 emitters per tree and irrigated three times a week would be appropriate for clay loam

10183,the effects of water distribution patterns in drip irrigation on fruit production and fruit quality were evaluated during two seasons in two commercial orchards of gala brookfield apple trees grafted on m 9 dwarf rootstock research was conducted at el manzano farm with a clay loam soil irrigated three times per week and in santa mercedes farm with a stony loam soil irrigated daily both farms are located in the central valley of chile the farm irrigation system was modified to establish three treatments which differed in the number of drip laterals per row one two and four with 4 0 2 0 and 1 0 l h 1 emitters spaced at 50 cm in both farms respectively all treatments received the same amount of water per week in each farm based on the technical criteria of the farm advisor applied water in each farm was compared against the water use estimated by the aquasat platform in the clay loam soil the volume of applied water was similar to the aquasat estimate however in the stony loam soil applied water was less than that estimated by aquasat the results showed significant differences in production among treatments which varied only in the volume of wetted soil the best results pooled over the two years were obtained with one lateral per row t1 in the clay loam soil yield of 59 3 t ha 1 and with four laterals per row t3 in the stony loam soil which yielded 50 8 t ha 1 higher yields were associated with a tendency of greater fruit numbers per tree in both farms fruit quality requirements for export equatorial diameter 60 mm weight 90 g were achieved but not the firmness in the second season at the stony loam soil due to an irrigation deficit our results in apple emphasize the need to wet sufficient soil volume under drip irrigation regardless of irrigation amounts in light textured soils in particular keywords aquasat drip irrigation soil water content brookfield gala apple 1 introduction apples are an important fruit crop grown in chile for export and they are the second most exported fruit in the country in the maule region the red apple production area is 18 706 ha and nationally it is estimated to be 29 168 ha the area of red apple grown with drip irrigation is 4863 ha and of gala brookfield baigent apple brookfield gala is 1443 ha where nearly 80 of apples grown are intended for export odepa ciren 2016 among the strategies to compete in world markets the availability of new apple varieties is critical as it places the country in a privileged position in terms of export as compared to its competitors grau 2015 the gala brookfield apple is known for being of good quality and having an attractive red color and uniformly distributed grooves furthermore at present the high density crops systems grafted in the m 9 dwarfing pattern where the greatest root activity is found in the superficial layers are being promoted foster et al 2016 yuri et al 2011 kviklys et al 2012 this results in smaller trees better management greater production and easier harvest the reduction in root system size by using dwarfing rootstocks has implications when drip irrigation is used under high evaporative demand as there must be a minimum wetted soil volume below which water stress will develop despite supplying full amounts of water girona et al 2010 found that the yield in apple trees grafted onto dwarfing m 9 rootstock growing in loam soil was greater with one dripper per tree due to less evaporation from soil and to deeper infiltration in the soil profile than with two drippers per tree however the positive effects of increasing the wetted volume of soil in almond trees were shown by espadafor et al 2018 in their work even when water supply was not limiting almond trees exhibited an enhanced growth and transpiration response when the volume of wetted soil was increased garcía tejera et al 2017 have shown with a simulation model of olive that in drip irrigated trees transpiration can be limited by the wetted soil volume in addition they established that the irrigation design should consider that under conditions of low availability of irrigation water the wetted area of soil should be limited to minimize evaporation losses on the other hand there is some evidence that increased soil wetting volume results in higher yields morales et al 2010 in peach garcia petillo and castel 2004 in citrus holzapfel et al 2015 studied the effect of the number of laterals per row and irrigation frequency in drip irrigated blueberries where the use of four laterals per row in a sandy soil resulted in higher production and fruit quality than two and six laterals per row all applying the same amount of water per bush as all fresh fruits apples are primarily composed by water and fruit growth is most affected when trees are subjected to water deficits which can significantly reduce fruit size mpelasoka et al 2001a 2001b leib et al 2006 due to the shortage of water resources available for agriculture more efficient irrigation strategies are needed to optimize the use of water in apple trees leib et al 2006 talluto et al 2008 girona et al 2010 naor 2014 zhong et al 2019 considering that water stress is an important factor that can limit plant performance during the initial phases of growth and orchard establishment psarras and merwin 2000 as for apple quality water deficits can increase the concentration of soluble solids mpelasoka et al 2001a 2001b leib et al 2006 also pulp firmness increases as the amount of water applied is reduced fallahi et al 2010 additionally pre harvest climatic conditions may affect fruit diameter but this is not necessarily correlated with appropriate fruit maturity feippe 1993 drip irrigation in high density apple tree orchards generally uses one to two emitter laterals per row li et al 2002 naor et al 1999 therefore an analysis of the relationship between production and fruit quality with respect to the soil wetting pattern for the same volume of water applied is an important and necessary factor to evaluate especially given the importance of root distribution in apples the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of water distribution in drip irrigation on fruit production and fruit quality of gala brookfield apple grafted on m 9 dwarf rootstock in two locations with different soil conditions el manzano farm clay loam soil and santa mercedes farm stony loam soil 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was performed in a commercial orchard at el manzano clay loam soil and santa mercedes stony loam soil farms both farms have cv gala brookfield grafted on m 9 dwarf rootstock with cv granny smith as pollinator and were planted in 2012 in an area of 17 ha in el manzano farm and 8 ha in santa mercedes farm in río claro and molina county located in the central valley of chile fig 1 el manzano farm is located at the latitude 35 14 19 01 s and longitude 71 16 43 84 w altitude 267 m a s l santa mercedes farm is located at latitude 35 8 18 33 s and longitude 71 15 16 91 w altitude 277 m a s l and they are located 11 km apart both farms have a mediterranean marine climate with an average annual temperature of 14 9 c an average maximum temperature of 30 8 c in the warmest month january and a minimum average of 3 8 c in the coldest month july the frost free growing period is 7 months from october to april the annual sum of temperatures with a base of 5 c is 3598 day and 1854 day with a base temperature of 10 c the cold hours from march to november are 1018 average annual precipitation is 735 mm with june being the rainiest month with an average of 189 mm pan evaporation reaches 1108 mm per year with a maximum of 215 mm month in january and a minimum of 19 mm month in june the dry season is approximately 4 months long and lasts from december to march del pozo and del canto 1999 2 2 experimental orchard apple trees were spaced 1 m apart in the row and 3 5 m between rows with an east west orientation the agronomic management was provided by copefrut company www copefrut cl following the standards of high density orchards winter pruning fertilization weed control pest management and chemical and manual fruit thinning in order to leave a fruit load of 100 120 fruits tree fertigation was used in both orchards throughout the two irrigation seasons october march in weekly applications for a total annual rate of 25 kg ha 1 co nh2 2 44 kg ha 1 h3po3 187 kg ha 1 kcl 126 kg ha 1 ca no3 2 174 kg ha 1 mgso4 furthermore it was supplemented at an annual rate of 15 l ha 1 with foliar fertilizer extra bioplus total amino acids 49 free amino acids 20 organic nitrogen n 7 5 organic carbon 22 calcium cao 0 3 potassium k 1000 ppm 17 5 kg ha 1 nh4h2po4 2 l ha 1 amazinc 600 zn 35 w v and mn 25 w v every 7 10 days from october to december and 9 kg ha 1 co nh2 2 plus 15 kg ha 1 mgso4 with three applications every 7 10 days from november to march the training system was the tall spindle position and winter pruning in the high density orchards took place during the third or fourth year for precocity and productive centers near the trunk where the height of the tree was limited to 3 2 m the soil physical parameters were determined by the pressure plate method klute 1986 on soil dry mass basis at pressures of 0 03 and 1 5 mpa el manzano farm has soil with a clay loam texture fluventic humic dystroxerepts surface slope about 0 5 to the west and a field capacity ranging from 0 24 g g 1 on the surface to 0 23 g g 1 at the 0 9 m depth and a permanent wilting point of 0 13 g g 1 throughout the profile santa mercedes farm has a homogeneous soil profile of loamy texture aquic durixerolls with a field capacity of 0 24 g g 1 and permanent wilting point of 0 10 g g 1 a surface slope about 0 4 to the south with 50 stones in the soil matrix that greatly reduces the water holding capacity no water table was observed down to 2 0 m at both farms during the two irrigation seasons 2 3 experimental design prior to this study both farms used drip irrigation with two laterals per row and 4 non pressure compensating emitters of 2 l h 1 per tree the 2014 2015 season was used as an adjustment period to avoid carry over effects as the irrigation system was modified in the spring of 2014 experimental seasons were 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 for each type of soil a completely randomized block experimental design was established with three treatments and four replicates each individual block consisted of 9 rows of trees the experimental unit per treatment consisted of three contiguous rows of 40 trees each with a central measuring row and two guard rows ten trees in each central row per plot were identified for the two seasons of analysis for a total of 30 trees sampled per block three treatments and a total of 120 trees measured in each orchard the 12 experimental plots were located in a 0 5 ha area within the commercial orchard at both farms blocks were established across rows with irrigation treatments randomly assigned within each block the three irrigation treatments were one lateral per tree row with drippers spaced 50 cm two emitters per tree and flow rate of 4 l h 1 t1 two laterals per tree row with drippers spaced 50 cm four emitters per tree and flow of 2 l h 1 t2 and four laterals per tree row with drippers spaced 50 cm eight emitters per tree and flow rate of 1 l h 1 t3 this design allows maintaining the same volume of applied water in each treatment but achieving differential wetting patterns 2 4 irrigation management in the clay loam soil el manzano farm irrigation was applied three times a week during the season in the stony loam soil santa mercedes farm irrigation took place three times a week in october and november and daily from monday to saturday for the rest of the season december to march the volume of applied water and the irrigation frequency were determined following the criteria of the technical advisor in both farms the theoretical volume of irrigation water required by each orchard management unit on each farm was estimated using an online computational platform called aquasat 2016 the aquasat platform is a decision support system that allows estimating actual crop evapotranspiration determined from a spatially distributed evapotranspiration map using a surface energy balance model and internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 and the landsat 7 and 8 satellite images with a spatial resolution of 30 by 30 m with this information of actual crop evapotranspiration aquasat performed a weekly forecast of orchard water demand based on the hargreaves and samani model samani 2000 even though remote sensing estimates of evapotranspiration for orchards could be less precise it is important to note that the estimates from aquasat are upper limit values indeed gonzalo martín et al 2017 showed that root mean square errors for evapotranspiration estimates are around 1 5 mm day 1 after assessing the performance of surface energy balance models using satellite images in the central valley of chile thus aquasat has shown to be a reliable and useful tool to tailor irrigation management practices by providing for next days estimates ex ante estimates or for ex post assessment holzapfel et al 2020 gavilán et al 2019 it must be stressed that aquasat evapotranspiration estimates are used as guiding values instead of error free values of actual crop evapotranspiration in a review about estimates of actual et using remote sensing methods zhang et al 2016 discusses the sources and approaches to reduce uncertainties in time and space they conclude that merging multiple sources would increase accuracy but not necessarily the understanding of underlying physical process also it is important to note that uncertainty coming from field data at the point scale may not be representative of what is occurring at the field scale weather data were obtained from the tres esquinas meteorological station inia 2017 located 3 km east from santa mercedes farm and 14 km northeast from el manzano farm daily precipitation and minimum and maximum air temperatures for the two experimental seasons are shown in fig 2 2 5 soil moisture measurements the soil moisture content was determined twice a week with a neutron probe troxler model 4300 nc usa that was calibrated at the site r2 of 0 88 in the clay loam soil el manzano farm during the first season three access tubes were installed at the treatment sites of one lateral t1 five access tubes in the treatment of two lateral t2 and the treatment of four lateral t3 had seven access tubes distributed around the trunk perpendicular to the plantation row fig 3 a moisture was measured in soil layers of 0 30 30 60 60 90 cm each block of the experimental design had a similar access tube arrangement for each treatment with a total of 12 trees in the second season soil moisture content was measured with a set of seven watermark sensors for depths comprising layers of 0 30 30 60 60 90 cm around the root system of a representative tree fig 3b and in a single experimental unit per treatment the soil moisture content in the santa mercedes farm due to its 50 stone content was measured with a set of seven watermark sensors irrometer company inc ca usa for depths comprising layers of 0 30 30 60 60 90 cm around the root system of a representative tree fig 3b and in a single experimental unit per treatment a datalogger measured the voltage readings of the seven sensors every 30 min the soil water tension readings were converted to soil water content values through the individual laboratory calibration of the watermark sensors the sensors were placed in a water container for 12 h in order to reach a saturation tension of 0 centibar soil samples were sieved at 2 mm mesh and taken to a container where the sensors were positioned at 15 cm depth and 25 cm apart in saturated soil recording the water tension after sensor voltage readings were stabilized the extracted soil samples were then placed in an oven at 105 c temperature for 48 h to obtain the gravimetric moisture content at the respective tensions finally the relation between gravimetric moisture content and soil water tension was determined using a quadratic adjustment the soil moisture content for both farms was depicted using the kriging interpolation method oliver and webster 1990 implemented in matlab 2 6 fruit yield and statistical analysis the harvest took place in mid february in both seasons when all the fruits of the 10 trees in the central row of each experimental unit 40 trees per treatment were harvested the total harvest weight was obtained using a digital scale with a precision of 0 5 kg for fruit quality parameters 30 fruits from each experimental unit were randomly selected and the weight of each fruit was measured with a precision of 1 0 g the equatorial diameter was measured for each of the selected fruits using a vernier caliper fruit flesh firmness was measured at the equator of each fruit after removing the exocarp peel using a manual pressure meter effegi ft 327 italy with an 11 mm strut at the time of fruit firmness evaluation total soluble solids brix were measured with a refractometer atago model master t japan in january 2017 trunk diameters were measured in 40 trees per treatment at both farms 15 cm above the graft union for both seasons and farms the fraction of soil surface covered by the green canopy was 70 in january for each farm independently an analysis of variance anova was conducted considering separately irrigation treatments and season the means were compared with tukey s multiple test p 0 05 using r project software 3 results and discussion 3 1 applied water in the 2015 2016 irrigation season at the farm of clay loam soil the applied water was very similar to that estimated by aquasat fig 4 a the water volume estimated by aquasat was 3187 m3 ha 1 while applied water was 3080 m3 ha 1 a difference of ca 3 for the 2016 january to early march period similarly in the 2016 2017 irrigation season fig 4 c the water volume estimated by aquasat was 5066 m3 ha 1 and the water volume applied was 4851 m3 ha 1 a difference of ca 4 for the october 2016 february 2017 period while there were minor variations along the irrigation season in el manzano farm there was general agreement between the applied water and aquasat estimates of seasonal water requirements for the stony loam soil in the 2015 2016 irrigation season fig 4 b the volume estimated by aquasat was 3422 m3 ha 1 while the volume of applied water was 14 less 2945 m3 ha 1 for the 2016 january to march period for most of that period there was an irrigation deficit even though in february there was an excess of applied water in the second season october 2016 to end of february 2017 fig 4 d the water requirements estimated by aquasat were 4375 m3 ha 1 while the applied water was 3035 m3 ha 1 a deficit of ca 30 from october until the middle of december water application was less than that calculated by aquasat and thereafter amounts were similar thus in the santa mercedes farm the volume of applied water was insufficient to meet the demand estimated by aquasat particularly in the second season despite the missing data from october to december 2015 2016 season and given the climatic conditions that concentrate the irrigation season in summer our irrigation study encompasses the main season in both years and farms and it is highly probable that the picture that emerges from this research will not change in fact in spring the soil is still wet from the winter rains and the orchard water requirements are still low furthermore two rains of 20 mm each occurred in december 2015 fig 2a so the irrigation requirements decreased even more it is well known that the timing extend and magnitude of water deficits excesses could affect yield and quality at harvest kuschel otárola et al 2020a even though weekly values are shown in fig 4 it must be emphasized that the experimental design was set to assess differences between seasonal applied water and fruit quality at harvest even with the detailed data collected it is extremely difficult to disentangle water stress variations at weekly time scale as shown in fig 4 at santa mercedes farm where there were periods on excess stress however in this regard aquasat provides guidance raising flags when applied water is outside the predefined ranges leading to water excess stress 3 2 soil water content fig 5 presents representative data on soil water content prior to an irrigation event in the 2015 2016 season for both farms for the clay loam soil t2 and t3 exhibited a gradual decrease in soil water content vertically and a horizontal variation with maximum depletion at the deeper depths fig 5 under the tree trunk the low soil water content values observed close to the permanent wilting point in these two treatments would indicate a situation of low water availability however t1 treatment showed water uptake just in the first 45 cm of depth around the trunk indicating a shallower water extraction pattern in the stony loam soil there was increased depletion with depth as the number of laterals increased from t1 to t3 as indicated by the lower water content in t3 the seasonal trend during 2016 2017 of soil water content at two soil depths for the three treatments is presented in fig 6 in the case of clay loam soil the effects of the different treatments on soil moisture content are clear for the case of t1 the first two strata in the area near the trunk remained close to field capacity indicating the expansion of the wet bulb in this type of soil by contrast 54 cm away from the trunk the soil moisture content is monotonically decreasing down to the permanent wilting point this was probably caused by the combination of root water extraction outside the emitter zone and of evaporation from the unshaded soil for the t2 treatment and 0 30 cm of soil depth it is observed that the zone closest to the trunk was maintained at high soil water content decreasing soil water content occurred at a distance of 27 cm from the trunk since the end of december and at a distance of 54 cm from the trunk since the end of november at the 30 60 cm of soil depth the soil water content decreased only at a distance of 54 cm from the trunk for the t3 treatment the total soil profile remained with high soil water content due to the pattern of tree water uptake and the extracting capacity of the root system under a very shallow and wide wetted surface area the stony loam soil showed in general soil water content variability both vertical and horizontally during october through november fig 6 with high soil water content near the trunk for all treatments in the upper layer however since the beginning of december a change of irrigation frequency from three times a week to daily irrigation produced an effect on the soil wetting pattern too in t1 the soil water content at 27 cm distance remained in the range between field capacity and permanent wilting point a situation attributed to root water extraction also at 54 cm away from the trunk the soil water content remained practically at permanent wilting point during the entire season showing that irrigation water did not reach that zone in the 30 60 cm depth close to the trunk and 27 cm away the soil water content was close to field capacity however at 54 cm away from the trunk the soil water content approached permanent wilting point values throughout the irrigation season in t2 it was observed constant high soil water content near the trunk as well as at 27 cm from it in the upper layer while at 54 cm away from the trunk the soil water content remained between field capacity and permanent wilting point probably due to lack of wetting by the emitters and to soil water evaporation for the 30 60 cm depth the soil water content remained practically near field capacity for all distances from the trunk through the entire irrigation season finally in the t3 treatment the soil water content at all distances away from the trunk at all depths stayed near field capacity since the beginning of december girona 2007 found for mature apple trees grafted on m 9 rootstock growing in a loam texture soil little water extraction below 40 cm of depth in addition girona et al 2008 2010 determined that under extreme drought conditions reducing the number of emitters per tree from two to one drastically reduced the wetted area decreasing soil evaporation thus leaving more water available in the soil profile with a positive effect on yields then it can be concluded that the volume of soil water content in clay loam soil under t1 would allow adequate soil water content up to a distance of 27 cm from the trunk in the first two layers of soil 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm on the other hand in t3 there was high soil water content in the profile fig 6 which is not recommended for the m 9 dwarf rootstock it is known that m 9 rootstock requires a well drained soil crassweller and schupp 2018 in fact olien and lakso 1986 observed under warm and sunny conditions and high soil moisture lower midday stem water potential of apple trees grafted on m 9 than in trees grafted on other rootstocks in the case of a stony loam soil the volume of soil wetted in the first 60 cm of depth and up to a distance of 54 cm from the trunk was largely suitable in the t3 treatment since december associated with the change in irrigation frequency from three times a week in october and november to daily irrigation for the rest of the season however it was insufficient for the t1 and t2 treatments paltineanu et al 2017 determined an intense concentration of roots near the tree with an 80 of roots in the first 60 cm of soil depth and to a horizontal distance of 40 cm on the row and 70 cm between rows in mature apple trees grafted on m 9 growing in a loamy sand soil under drip irrigation tanasescu and paltineanu 2004 found in a loamy sand texture and under various irrigation methods maximum values of active roots within the first 40 cm of depth in golden delicious apple grafted on m m 106 rootstock semi dwarfing for this reason soils with low water storage capacity tend to have the highest root concentration in the superficial layers of soils when there is an adequate level of water in such strata in addition it is important to point out that the root system requires to obtain the water from an adequate volume of soil that has the capability to provide the water in periods of highest evaporative demand fernandez and perry 1995 in a research with several apple rootstocks including m 9 in two type of soils found that around 91 94 of roots were localized in the first 60 cm depth in silt loam soil with a fragipan at 60 and 70 cm below the soil surface however in soil without any restriction fine sandy loam only an average of 60 of roots were in the first 60 cm depth showing that the root system growth is greatly affected by soil conditions the soil moisture data fig 6 confirmed that water deficits developed in the santa mercedes farm due to the water applied being less than that predicted by aquasat to compensate for this irrigation deficit in the october to december period fig 4 an active root water uptake was observed which is reflected in the decrease of soil moisture at t2 and t3 in all distances from the trunk in that period in the case of t1 this situation was less noticeable 3 3 production the total fruit production shown in table 1 indicates that in both seasons at the clay loam soil site the highest yield was obtained in the t1 treatment this response indicates that sufficient soil volume was wetted with one lateral probably in the zone of the largest amount of roots water extraction fig 5 showed in t1 that in this soil it was possible to wet with one lateral an adequate density of active roots in approximately 60 cm in depth and a horizontal diameter of 54 cm the two other treatments t2 and t3 also wetted more horizontally but also more superficially than in t1 causing more evaporation from soil for this clay loam soil one lateral per row with emitters of 4 l h 1 spaced at 50 cm allowed for an application of water that wetted the root water extraction zone in an appropriate way the fruit production in the stony loam soil was significantly higher in t3 for both seasons table 1 this would indicate that wetting a greater soil volume resulted in more effective irrigation due to the low soil water storage capacity as affected by the presence of stones 50 in the soil matrix conversely in t1 and t2 the soil water content mostly increased in depth but the surface layers with the highest density of active roots did not get sufficient water thus t3 wetted a greater soil volume than the other two treatments in the first two layers where the highest root densities occur girona 2007 in the second season there was an increase in production on both farms even though at santa mercedes the water applied was less than what aquasat estimated fig 4 possibly increased tree growth from the fourth to the fifth year led to greater estimated water requirements as a comparison yuri et al 2011 obtained average yields around 24 9 ton ha in a 4 year old apple tree grafted on m m 106 semi dwarfing and 42 5 ton ha in a 5 year old brookfield gala on rootstock m 9 emla dwarfing in a commercial orchard on a silty clay loam soil ortega et al 2014 in a zone with the same climatic conditions as those of our study obtained similar yields 58 5 ton ha with 6 year old royal gala grafted on rootstock m 26 dwarfing in clay loam soil drip irrigated two laterals and four emitters per tree with a 100 reposition of crop evapotranspiration however with a 125 reposition of crop evapotranspiration yield was only 38 70 ton ha on the other hand yildirim et al 2016 showed lower yields 42 9 ton ha for a 5 year old royal gala grafted on rootstock m 9 in a medium light textured soil in isparta turkey with very heavy crop load and excess water application using a kp of 1 25 of class a pan evaporation under drip irrigation with two laterals and four emitters per tree these reports and our results show the importance of maintaining adequate soil moisture distribution conditions of apple trees grafted on rootstock m 9 thus soil type and wetting patterns under drip irrigation have an important influence on the yield and performance of trees under different irrigation strategies as it provides a significant storage and buffer for plants making it possible to produce more crop per drop kuschel otárola et al 2020b 3 4 fruit quality for both seasons and soil types tables 2 and 3 the fruit equatorial diameters were above the 60 mm minimum required by the standard codex stan 299 2010 fao 2010 for apples without significant differences between treatments at each farm however there was a trend to higher equatorial diameter values in the stony soil in both seasons probably due to a reduction of fruit numbers as found by yildirim et al 2016 the weight of the fruit was higher than the 90 g minimum required for export fao 2010 in both seasons and soil types tables 2 and 3 significant differences in fruit weight were not recorded between treatments at each farm but the fruit weight was significant higher at both farms in the second season it is important to mention that the number of fruits is directly related to yield and this variable is highly relevant in commercial production yildirim et al 2016 furthermore with optimal pruning as well as agronomic management larger fruit sizes can be obtained parra quezada et al 2008 the trunk diameter is associated with the climatic conditions of the area yuri et al 2011 and the fruit load in the management of the orchards barden and marini 2001 yildirim et al 2016 in january 2017 el manzano farm recorded a trunk diameter of 5 7 cm t1 and t2 and 5 5 cm t3 while santa mercedes farm recorded a trunk diameter of 4 3 cm t1 and 4 6 cm t2 and t3 without significant differences between treatments at each farm on the other hand this average difference of 1 1 cm between the two farms may be an indication of differences in irrigation management that are expressed in fruit number per tree in our case the number of fruits per tree at harvest was lower in stony loam soil in both seasons table 3 likewise the tendency of a greater number of fruits in the t3 treatment for both seasons would explain the greater yield in the stony loam soil when irrigated with four laterals per row also the tendency of the t1 treatment in clay loam soil towards a higher number of fruits would explain its higher yield table 2 as for fruit firmness this variable was higher than 76 n cm2 17 lb cm2 in the clay loam soil table 2 while the firmness values in the second season in the stony loam soil were below the minimum required for export table 3 these results could be related to the deficit irrigation situation that occurred in the stony loam soil as detected by aquasat fig 4 d especially during initial fruit development stage on the other hand mpelasoka et al 2001a reported that late season deficit irrigation increased firmness in 7 year old braeburn apple grown in lysimeters and irrigated at 40 of well irrigated control treatment on the other hand fallahi et al 2010 with 5 year old autumn rose fuji apple fruits and talluto et al 2008 with 5 year old lady pink apple fruits shown that fruit firmness at harvest was unaffected by irrigation regimes low firmness at harvest and low calcium uptake into the plant is associated to low soil water content and high temperatures during the growing cycle milosevic and milosevic 2015 also several postharvest disorders are related to calcium in apple fruits doryanizadeh et al 2017 and fruit with higher firmness at harvest tend to maintain better conditions after storage than fruit with lower firmness johnston et al 2002 the total soluble solids showed a higher concentration of sugars in the fruit grown during the second season for both soils considering that the minimum acceptable value is 10 5 brix fao 2010 all treatments would comply with this requirement tables 2 and 3 however yuri et al 2019 mention that 12 brix is required to export from chile in such case t2 and t3 treatments in clay loam soil table 2 and t1 treatment in stony loam soil table 3 did not reach this minimum value in the first season 3 5 analysis of number of laterals per row costs and production based on the results herein and from an economic point of view the annual equivalent marginal income gained by investing in two additional drip laterals per row t3 at santa mercedes farm annual interest rate of 8 is profitable considering that drip tubing costs approximately us 0 20 m and fruit prices average us 0 3 kg odepa 2020 the investment required for adding two extra laterals per row would be paid in one year even at a marginal increase of annual fruit production near 4 0 t ha 1 with all other variables constant thus the observed increase in yield in one year 8 0 t ha 1 would pay twice for the investment necessary to irrigate with four laterals t3 apples in santa mercedes farm another option to be explored in low soil water storage situations is to use micro sprinklers that would wet a larger surface area instead of drippers this would be strictly an engineering and economic decision by contrast at the el manzano farm given our experimental results the expected increase in marginal revenue by reducing the standard two laterals per tree row installation to one lateral per row does not make economic sense however for new projects in this type of soil one lateral per row reduces the initial costs of the irrigation system in the first years of the orchard 4 conclusions this study shows that variations in the wetting patterns under drip irrigation caused significant differences in fruit yield and quality on two different soil types in the production of gala brookfield apple orchards grafted on m 9 dwarf rootstock the best results varied with soil type emphasizing the need to consider availability of stored soil water in drip irrigation design in the clay loam soil yields were higher with a one lateral per row and two 4 l h 1 emitters per tree t1 59 29 t ha 1 while in a stony loam soil the highest production was obtained with four laterals per row and eight 1 l h 1 emitters per tree t3 50 82 t ha 1 pooled over the two growing seasons the research showed that there was a positive response to increasing the number of emitters in santa mercedes farm beyond the normal two drip lines that farmers use due to its stony loam soil type soil water monitoring confirmed that the different irrigation treatments induced different soil wetted volumes and extraction patterns in the clay loam soil t1 provided the most adequate wet volume for deeper extraction however in the stony loam soil with four laterals per row t3 and daily irrigation frequency the volume of soil wetted in the first 45 cm of soil depth in t3 was greater than in the other two treatments applied water in the clay loam soil was similar to the estimated volume by aquasat in both seasons by contrast in the stony loam soil especially for the second season there was an irrigation deficit relative to that estimated by aquasat this may explain the greater fruit production in the farm with clay loam soil in both seasons but emphasizes the need to wet an adequate soil volume under deficit irrigation as well based on the results obtained in mature gala brookfield apple trees grafted on m 9 dwarf rootstock it was established that the treatment of one lateral per row with two 4 0 l h 1 emitters per tree and irrigated three times a week would be appropriate for clay loam soil while four laterals per row with eight 1 0 l h 1 emitters per tree and daily irrigation would be most suitable for the stony loam soil and other similar soils of low storage capacity declaration

10184,climate change scenarios are predicting an increase in temperature as well as more scarce and torrential rainfall episodes due to this an imbalance between grape technological and phenolic maturity is being observed detrimentally affecting grapes composition in semi arid areas irrigation management is a main field practice to influence grape ripening the goal of the present study was to investigate in vitis vinifera l cv bobal grapevine responses to three watering regimes i rainfed ii deficit irrigation di replacing only 35 of the estimated crop evapotranspiration etc and iii full irrigation fi replacing 100 etc in the mid summer rainfed grapevines showed different degrees of water stress determined by midday stem water potentials ψstem ranging from 1 1 to 1 4 mpa depening on the season rainfed plants had in all seasons less vigor and production and at harvest higher concentrations of total soluble solids tss and grape phenolics compounds as well as lower ph with respect to the other water regimes studied di grapevines generally had intermediate values between rainfed and fi which presented extreme values of the studied parameters respect to rainfed the effects observed on grape color parameters and phenolic compounds with the rainfed regime were mainly due to a dehydration of the berry which lowered the yield and the weight of the berry compared to the irrigated treatments the lower tss accumulation in the di berries with respect to the rainfed will favor obtaining wines with lower alcohol content currently more demanded by the consumers besides despite the differences obtained between water regime treatments in the tss accumulation the extractability of the anthocyanins was similar which is interesting since anthocyanin extraction from grapes is prerequisite to the formation of stable red wine pigments although the most convenient irrigation strategy might depend to the wine style to be obtained di is a strategy that can help to close the gap in the imbalance between the technological and phenolic maturity positively affecting vine yield and performance with respect to the rainfed strategy keywords bobal regulated deficit irrigation water stress yield grape polyphenols 1 introduction with an increase in aridity and the frequency of extreme events predicted in the near future according to global climate models ipcc 2018 soil water availability may become a more important limiting factor in wine production and quality thus the rise of temperatures and the decrease of precipitations due to climate change trigger advanced maturation causing an imbalance between grape sugars and phenolic maturity poni et al 2018 which affects grape composition and therefore wine quality van leeuwen and darriet 2016 however together with higher temperatures higher concentrations of co2 are expected to increase biomass production moutinho pereira et al 2009 however vine productivity might be limited by rainfall distribution and water availability especially at the end of the growth cycle fraga et al 2016 2018 therefore in order to adapt the viticulture to this changing situation different management techniques such as deficit irrigation di can help to stabilize yield and maintain or improve wine quality as well as to increase water use efficiency wue chaves et al 2007 dos santos et al 2007 gálvez et al 2014 lanari et al 2014 cole and pagay 2015 bonada et al 2018 deficit irrigation consists of applying water rates to replace only part of the potential vine evapotranspiration either during the whole season or only during some phenological periods previously established intrigliolo and castel 2010 however the phenological stage when regulated deficit irrigation rdi is applied in addition to the water stress intensity and duration posed by the irrigation system determines the vinegrape growth behavior as well as the grape composition and quality attributes thus mccarthy 1997 reported that water stress during the period from fruit set to veraison heavily reduces fruit size intrigliolo et al 2012 and niculcea et al 2014 found that water deficits negatively impact berry weight especially when applied before veraison salón et al 2005 in bobal cultivar and intrigliolo et al 2012 in tempranillo showed that the delay of irrigation start during the period before veraison until reaching a moderate stem stress level stem water potential at midday of 1 0 mpa allows good control of vegetative growth and a moderate reduction in berry size this resulted in berries with a higher concentration of anthocyanins being the remaining grape composition parameters sugars total acidity ph malic and tartaric acids and total phenols similar to those of fully irrigated vines however they reported that a post veraison deficit irrigation strategy irrigation of 25 50 of grapevine total requirements and avoiding severe water stress stem water potential 1 4 mpa did not affect the final berry size but reduced the accumulation of sugars in it and delayed the ripening likewise girona et al 2009 showed that only moderate water stress at post veraison on tempranillo vines stem water potential 1 0 mpa can have positive effects on grape composition moreover authors as ojeda et al 2002 pellegrino et al 2005 and romero et al 2016 found a substantial improvement in berry quality under di treatment for decreasing yield and berry size roby et al 2004 van leeuwen et al 2004 salón et al 2005 ferrandino and lovisolo 2014 degaris et al 2015 and conesa et al 2016 observed that the synthesis and concentration of phenolic compounds soluble solids and anthocyanins were promoted by water deficit however other authors such as walker et al 2005 zarrouk et al 2016 obtained contrary results with anthocyanins reductions in the grape skins and loss of color in the wines compared to those of rainfed vineyards in particular zarrouk et al 2016 demonstrate that seasons with increased water stress lead to a larger impact of high temperatures on the berry ripening and composition petrie et al 2004 also reported reduction in berry and bunch weight yield and sugar concentration and increases in phenolic compounds concentration when water deficit was applied at shiraz grapevines in the post veraison period but anthocyanin concentration was unaffected they observed that although in the following season irrigation was returned to standard practice yield was reduced in accordance with the previous season stress therefore petrie et al 2004 reported that post veraison water deficit has the potential to impact both yield and fruit composition during both the current and the subsequent season according to koundouras et al 2006 and bindon et al 2011 the positive effects of water deficit in grapevines are directly related to wine quality components such as color flavor and wine aroma due to an increment of skin to pulp ratio in berries besides there is a wider consensus that ph and titratable acidity values are not greatly affected by irrigation sivilotti et al 2005 bobal vitis vinifera l cultivar is a native variety of the utiel requena designation of origin southeast of spain which coves 78 of the total surface of the red varieties planted in this grape growing region méndez 2005 intrigliolo and castel 2010 its main characteristics include its productivity a large number of clusters and large size high acidity and polyphenols levels its color intensity and brightness and fresh aroma which give rise to good red and rosé wines it is a vigorous and semi upright plant with high fertility has medium high production large clusters and long and creeping shoots bobal is very resistant to drought and it is better suited to loose and airy soils in la mancha region central spain bobal has been cultivated in vineyards where the soil is poor and yields are low to obtain high quality grapes garcía carpintero et al 2011 there bobal is cultivated in areas with specific weather conditions warm summers cold winters and limited rainfall which could influence its aroma composition dugelay et al 1993 however although drip irrigation has been steadily increasing for its crop there is little information published about the effect of the irrigation management on the bobal vine performance and grape and must composition to our knowledge only salón et al 2005 studied the effect of drip irrigation on bobal agronomic performance and on red and rosé wines quality in vines that were trained to an open vase system and wide vine spacing therefore the main objective of this study was to investigate how different irrigation strategies could affect the agronomic and oenological behavior of a bobal vineyard under vertical shoot positioning and a general more intensive vineyard plantation system 2 material and methods 2 1 site description soil and meteorological data the trial was carried out from 2012 to 2014 in a commercial vineyard located near requena valencia southeast spain latitude 39º 29 n longitude 1º 13w elevation above sea level 750 m belonging to the utiel requena denomination of origen d o the experiment was conducted with vitis vinifera l cv bobal grafted onto 161 49c couderc rootstock the grapevines were trained to a vertical trellis system on a bilateral cordon oriented north south and were planted in 2002 at a spacing of 2 5 1 4 m 2857 vinesha 1 the soil of the vineyard was a typic calciorthid with a clay loam to light clay texture highly calcareous and of low fertility soil depth was 2 m and available water capacity was about 200 mm m 1 the climate in the area is continental mediterranean and semiarid the heliothermal index is 2291 ºc corresponding to a temperate warm viticultural climate with cool nights and moderately dry according to the classification system for grape growing regions proposed by tonietto and carbonneau 2004 at the experimental site the annual average values for the last 12 years of the reference evapotranspiration eto and the rainfall were 1127 mm and 380 mm respectively about 65 of precipitation occurs in winter time thus during the grapevine dormant period during the vegetative period from april to end september of the study years the average temperature the eto calculated using the penman monteith formula described by allen et al 1998 and the rainfall data were recorded table 1 2 2 experimental design and irrigation treatments the experiment was a randomized block design with three treatments in four replications there were then a total of 12 experimental plots with four plots per each treatment each of the replications had 35 plants spread over five consecutive rows of seven grapes each one although only the three inner rows were used for sampling and the two outer rows were used as edges since plantation time the experimental vineyard was irrigated by a controlled deficit irrigation system with around 60 mm per season standard irrigation rates in the area from 2012 the three irrigation treatments explored were as follows i r rainfed which only received rainfall water ii di deficit irrigation controlled where water was applied to replace only 35 of the estimated crop evapotranspiration etc iii fi full irrigation where water was not limiting for the grapevines applying 100 of the etc the different irrigation regimes were applied by modifying the irrigation doses applied in each irrigation event but maintaining the same frequency of irrigation that varied from 1 to 2 times per week in spring to 5 6 times per week during the mid summer irrigation started when the rainfed vines reached threshold values of stem water potential ψstem of 0 6 to 0 7 mpa the etc was estimated using the crop coefficient kc according to williams and ayars 2005 considerations thus at full canopy growth the estimated kc value to refill the potential water needs was considered to be 0 6 etc eto kc the drip lines had emitters of 3 5 l h 1 spaced at 1 25 m all treatments were fertilized at a rate of 30 20 60 16 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 k2o and mgo respectively fields practices were those commonly used in the area including shoot trimming applied after fruit set 2 3 water status determination the plant water status was determined at midday 11 30 12 30 hr solar by measuring ψstem on two representative vines per experimental plot and one fully expanded leaf on the outer rim of the canopy per vine using a pressure chamber pms instrument company model 600 albany or usa the leaves were placed in totally hermetic aluminum foil bags for at least 1 h prior to the measurement time from mid may june to end september october on a bi weekly basis according to climatic conditions and the phenological stage of the plant the water stress integral sψ was calculated for each treatment using the stem water potential data according to the equation defined by myers 1988 in which the sψ was calculated eq 1 as the sum of the difference of average of two consecutive plant water potential measurements ψstem ψ i i 1 and the maximum least negative value registered during the study period in our case was c 0 45 mpa multiplying it by the number of days in the interval between one measurement and the next n 1 s φ i 0 i t ψ i i 1 c n the water use efficiency wue was calculated as a ratio between yield and the volume of water provided in each treatment through irrigation and rainfall this is a core subject of interest to secure sustainability in viticulture medrano et al 2014 2 4 leaf area estimation and vigor parameters after veraison five representative shoots per replicate were collected and leaf area was measured in the laboratory using a leaf area meter li 3100 lambda instrument corp lincoln ne primary and lateral leaf area was kept separated the number of shoots was determined on all the experimental vines to calculate vine leaf area by multiplying the average shoot leaf area obtained using the allometric relationships between shoot length and leaf area per the total number of shoots per vine shoot length shoot weight and shoot mass per grapevine were determined at pruning ravaz index was calculated by the ratio between mass of clusters harvested and mass of cane prunings expressed in kg of grapes of cane prunings 2 5 berry ripening sampling and oenological determinations during the ripening period from berry color change veraison to harvest randomly samples of 300 berries per experimental plot were taken at bi weekly intervals to determine technological maturity and phenolic parameters date of the first sampling for each year was 08 28 2012 09 10 2013 09 8 2014 and date of the second sampling was 09 4 2012 09 23 2013 and 09 15 2014 parameters related to technological maturity were berry fresh weight berry total soluble solids tss concentration expressed as ºbrix ph and total acidity expressed in g l 1 tartaric acid grape phenolic maturity parameters at ph 1 and ph 3 2 color intensity anthocyanins polyphenols total polyphenol index tpi and tannins were determined during ripening only in 2013 and 2014 seasons while in 2012 these parameters were determined only at harvest total soluble solids brix was determined using a manual refractometer atc 1 atago tokyo japan the titratable acidity and ph were measured by manual titrating with naoh 0 1 m to an end point of ph 7 0 using an electronic phmeter mettler toledo s20 mettler toledo ohio usa following regulated methods oiv 2003 for berry phenolics extraction saint cricq de gaulejac et al 1999 procedures were employed briefly in order to extract phenolic compounds four replicates of 50 g of homogenized sample were used for each sample two samples were used for phenolics determination after 4 h of maceration with 50 ml of hcl 0 1 n buffered at ph 1 0 while extractable values were obtained after 4 h of maceration with a solution buffered at ph 3 2 the ph 1 0 extraction implies the liberation diffusion and solubilization of the most percentage of the phenolics compounds due to the degradation of the skin cells the ph 3 2 extraction methodology is comparable to the one used during a classic red vinification saint cricq de gaulejac et al 1999 intrigliolo et al 2016 phenolic composition of the extracts was determined with uv and visible spectrophotometry with a uv visible jasco v 530 spectrophotometer jasco analytical instruments maryland usa color intensity ci and polyphenolic index tpi were estimated using the method described by glories 1978 anthocyanins and polyphenolic content were determined using the method to puissant león described by blouin 1992 tannins concentration was estimated according to sarneckis et al 2006 the difference of the studied polyphenols concentrations in the two extracts at ph 1 0 and ph 3 2 is an indicator of the fragility of the skin cell membranes and also of the polyphenols extractability the extractability percentage described by saint cricq de gaulejac et al 1999 as the capability of anthocyanins or polyphenols liberation result in a decrease when anthocyanins and polyphenols extractability increase during the ripening period for that reason the lower values for extractability percentage the more capability of anthocyanin and polyphenol extraction according to intrigliolo et al 2016 anthocyanin extractability ea represents the amount of anthocyanins that cannot be extracted in winemaking and is calculated by the difference between the total anthocyanins extracted at ph1 and the extractable anthocyanins at ph 3 2 besides considering that the total polyphenols determined in the extract correspond mainly to the sum of anthocyanins skin tannins and seed tannins and that there is a relationship more or less fixed in the accumulation of anthocyanins and tannins in the skin the amount of tannins contributed by the seeds to the wine can be determined by the difference during maturation the percentage of ripeness of the seeds decreases due to the grapes mature so the amount of tannins in the seeds decreases and their contribution to the polyphenolic concentration is lower thus the phenolic seed maturity pm which represents the contribution percentage of the seed tannins to the wine phenolic richness was determined according to saint cricq de gaulejac et al 1999 methodology all the analytical determinations were realized by duplicate so the results were the average of two analyses n 2 2 6 harvest sampling and yield components at the optimum moment of grape maturation according to the parameters set by the utiel requena d o on 10th 30th and 29th september of 2012 2013 and 2014 seasons respectively 20 grapevines were harvested by hand for each repetition number of clusters per grapevine bunch weight and yield kg grapevine 1 were recorded kern ch 15k20 spain samples of 600 grapes were randomly selected for each repetition and were divided into two set of 300 berries one for analyzing flesh and seed evaluation and aromatic compounds see details in garcía esparza et al 2020 and the other one for determining technological and polyphenolic parameters in the destemmed and crushed must samples following the same methodology as set out in section 2 4 organic acids malic and tartaric were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc following the procedures described by romero et al 1993 all the analytical determinations were realized by duplicate so the results were the average of two analyses n 2 2 7 statistical analysis the data were subjected to analysis of variance anova with irrigation treatment and year as factors mean comparisons were performed using duncan multiple range test when the differences were statistically significant at 95 probability level p 0 05 across seasons data were analyzed with irrigation treatment season and their interaction as factors the probability levels used were p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 simple linear regression analysis was performed to explore relationships between parameters using the sigmaplot package version 14 systat software inc san josé ca usa the statistical analysis were carried out using spss spss inc chicago il for windows version 11 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 water balance components and vine water status according to the data shown in table 1 and in the supplementary graph supl 1 on temperature reference evaporative demand of the plants eto rainfall and irrigation provided in each year the three studied vintages were different thus 2014 presented the most severe drought conditions with lower annual rainfall and higher evaporative demand therefore in this season the irrigation started earlier may 5 than in the other two vintages 2012 and 2013 from the 1st of april to the day in which the irrigation started the rain recorded was 55 7 112 3 and 4 6 mm in each season for 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively however in 2014 in relation to plant water status and according to the values indicate by acevedo opazo et al 2010 even the rainfed plants showed moderate values of stress ψs 1 2 mpa day 205 fig 1 by contrast in 2013 the irrigation began later may 29 because the rainfall during pre veraison was sufficient to increase the water available to the plants only at the end of the cycle the plants under rainfed treatment had some moderate stress fig 1 reaching similar ψs values than in 2014 but only by the end of the season on the other hand 2012 vintage had an intermediate climate behavior between the other two years although the rains fallen in spring allowed to reload with water the soil profile in this year the irrigation started later june 12 the scarce rains fallen during the summer resulted that the plants from the rainfed treatment showed severe stress ψs 1 29 to 1 45 mpa during most part of their pre and post veraison and ripening period from 2nd july to 3rd september fig 1 besides except for specific periods in 2014 from 11th to 22th august when the stem water potential of the di plants was lowered ψs 1 25 mpa and approached to those values presented by the rainfed plants during the rest of the growing cycles the plants under the di treatment did not suffer of water stress the same occurred with the plants under the fi treatment that were the ones that presented the highest stem water potentials throughout the three studied years fig 1 similar as observed by intrigliolo et al 2016 in their study with cabernet cultivar in 2012 the crop water use efficiency wue decreased with increasing water application di and fi table 2 however in 2013 and 2014 the rainiest and driest seasons respectively wue differences between irrigation treatments were not found flexas et al 2010 reported that wue can be modified by the management techniques and timing of water availability according to simonneau et al 2017 wue is a parameter that depends on the genetics and the scions rootstocks combinations used medrano et al 2014 reported that the effects of deficit irrigation strategies in wue are not conclusive and that many factors as genotypes environment soil and crop management can influence in plant behavior to deficit irrigation strategies mainly in relation to wue these authors also observed that there are cultivars reputed as more adapted to drought prone conditions which presumably should also present high wue 3 2 yield and its components in all seasons the most irrigated treatment fi had higher yield than rainfed grapevines being the yield of the rainfed treatment in 2014 quite lower than the rest of the treatments table 2 this matches with the results obtained by other authors such as williams et al 2010 chalmers et al 2010 and intrigliolo et al 2016 thus in general the yield decreases as water availability does fig 2a r2 0 70 0 57 0 74 for 2012 2013 and 2014 season respectively although the response varies depending on the irrigation dose climatic conditions and the period of application for instance yu et al 2020 observed that early season water deficit irrigation prior to veraison had higher probability to decrease yield than later season water deficit irrigation post veraison to harvest the number of clusters per grapevine and the cluster and berry weights also had the same trend as the yield with higher values in grapevines under irrigation regimes di and fi although on the first season 2012 the number of clusters had not significant differences between treatments table 2 this could be related to the fact that the higher budburst is a consequence of the improved water status during the previous season and in 2011 all the grapevines had the same water status the increases in yield produced by irrigation were mostly due to the berry size as also observed by salón et al 2004 in their bobal and tempranillo trials where yield increased linearly with water application in the present research berry weight was the main yield component affected by water availability r2 0 83 0 35 and 0 88 in 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively fig 2b in agreement with esteban et al 1999 salón et al 2005 baeza et al 2007 and intrigliolo et al 2016 a significant effect of the year by treatment interaction was observed on cluster number per grapevine cluster weight and berry weight suggesting that the effect of the irrigation regime on these parameters was different among seasons table 2 thus these productive parameters were influenced by the vintage being 2013 the coldest and the wettest year where the cluster weight values in all treatments were lower compared to the other two study seasons however in 2013 the berry weight was similar between treatments with lower water availability and fi probably due to the effect of the spring and summer rains in this year moreover it is important to highlight that although the yield between grapevines in 2012 and 2013 did not show significant differences between these years the weight of the bunch was of the order of 3 rainfed and di samples and 4 fi ones times higher in 2012 compared to those of the 2013 year besides the number of clusters per grapevine in the rainfed treatment in 2012 was greater than in 2013 table 2 girona et al 2006 also shown significant reductions in the number of clusters after three years of severe deficit irrigation and in non irrigated vines and shellie 2006 found a yield reduction associated with fewer cluster per vine under di treatment on the other hand the cluster fertility number of berries per cluster was not affected by water availability table 2 similarly to what reported by baeza et al 2007 these authors suggested that this could be because the flower differentiation is carried out near budburst when all treatments were well supplied with water from the winter rains etchebarne et al 2010 in their grenache noir vines observed that the difference from one year to the next in berry number per cluster was most probably a consequence of variations in fruit set due to the weather conditions in each year and not as a result of the irrigation treatments applied after berry set however authors like keller 2010 explained that high temperatures around budburst can lower the number of flowers per inflorescence which could occur in the non irrigated treatment whose lesser vegetative development could modify the microclimate of the bunch increasing its temperature bergqvist et al 2001 reported that high temperatures and high light intensity during the floral initiation process can increase the number of inflorescences and matthews and anderson 1989 specified that a water deficit during this period can have strong opposite effects 3 3 vigor and vegetative growth parameters the canopy components were affected by the irrigation treatments table 3 shoot weight and length r2 0 59 and 0 63 in 2013 and 2014 respectively and pruning weight per grapevine r2 0 61 and 0 77 in 2013 and 2014 respectively were higher when irrigation treatments were applied figs 2c and d respectively this suggests that these growth processes are very sensitive to water stress although this also depends on the variety roby et al 2004 romero et al 2013 similarly leaf area per vine was affect by the irrigation treatment increasing in the fi grapevines respect to those of the other treatments table 3 in 2014 the warmest and driest year of the study table 1 the differences in leaf area between rainfed and fi vines were statistically very considerable as can also be observed in the shoot total length table 3 etchebarne et al 2020 did not found irrigation effect on leaf area mainly because the secondary shoots were removed and no compensatory growth seemed to occur for the primary shoots besides the redistribution of grapevine reserves plays a role attenuating the effect of leaf area reduction candolfi vasconcellos et al 1994 candolfi vasconcellos and koblet 1990 reported that berry size increases when leaf area increases and according to dokoozlian and hirschfelt 1995 when berry number decreases the ravaz index yield vigor ratio was not affected by the irrigation treatments table 3 this could be because the increase in yield due to irrigations was in most part compensated by the higher vine growth of the irrigated vines although this parameter differs with the grape variety in order to obtained balanced grapevines garcía escudero et al 2006 suggested that for cv tempranillo in the climatic conditions of aoc rioja region the optimum values of ravaz index ranged between 4 and 7 while smart and robinson 1991 recommend for vitis vinifera l values between 5 and 10 in our case most of irrigated grapevines had ravaz index around 7 without significant differences between watering regimes thus the management and pruning of the vineyards were the same in all the treatments and should aim at the development of balanced grapevines ensuring stable yields over consecutive crops and without compromising the quality of the grapes therefore in addition to the shaded atmosphere created in the area of the bunches and their conditions conducive to the development of diseases in berries dokoozlian and kliewer 1996 an excess of vigor in the vine can reduce the accumulation of sugars and phenolic compounds in berries resulting from competition for assimilates between vegetative growth and bunch ripening in this context bunch ripening is delayed which leads to problems in the ripeness of the berries in the aromas and other compounds that can be sensitive to passed on to the wine pérez álvarez 2015 3 4 grape enological parameters 3 4 1 technological maturity the date of harvest was twenty days before in 2012 september 10th than in 2013 september 30th and 2014 september 29th seasons however the grape total soluble solids tss accumulation expressed as ºbrix varied between seasons table 4 6 matthews and anderson 1988 also observed the same behavior and reported that water deficit might alter the onset or duration of the ripening period thus at harvest tss was higher in 2012 even in fi grapes than in the other seasons table 6 as aforementioned year 2013 was the coolest year with the lowest eto and the highest rainfall throughout growing cycle indeed only the rainfed and di grapes in 2012 and the rainfed in 2014 reached the target soluble solids concentration of 22 ºbrix at the harvesting time table 6 being the tss in the rainfed treatment at harvest by about 1 ºbrix higher than the values of di and 1ºbrix higher than those of the fi samples therefore the reduction in berry weight and yield tables 2 3 caused by rainfed or di versus fi treatment resulted in an advanced maturation thus two factors could explain the accumulation of tss a greater water deficit that advances the berry maturation leading to a lower total acidity ta escalona et al 2003 or a dehydration of the berry in our study the first case could be observed in di grapes especially in 2014 when ta was reduced compared to the other treatments however the increase in tss in the case of the rainfed grapes could be due to a dehydration of the berry which presented the lowest weights throughout the ripening process tables 2 4 5 and 6 esteban et al 1999 reported that the tss concentration was reduced when the dilution caused by the berry growth is faster than the increase in sugar transport into the berry in the same way that irrigation treatments were more conducive to dilution than in the rainfed regime because of larger berry growth table 2 williams 2012 and intrigliolo et al 2016 also found that berry maturity is delayed and soluble solids concentration decreased with increasing water applications grapes with a high sugar content may lead to residual sugars in the fermentation responsible for impacting on the wine organoleptic characteristics therefore in wineries a current objective pursued is to reduce these soluble solids which are attempted through various cultivation practices such as di or already in the winery itself through coupages or de alcoholization processes intrigliolo et al 2016 in 2012 and 2014 the must ph showed correlation with water stress integral r2 0 58 and 0 31 respectively fig 3 confirming that must ph responses to the irrigation regime are dependent on several vine and edapho climatic factors williams and matthews 1990 in all the seasons at harvest time the rainfed treatment had the highest tss ºbrix and fi the lowest on the contrary the ph reached the lowest values in rainfed treatment and the highest in fi except in 2013 when there were no differences in ph between treatments table 6 etchebarne et al 2010 observed that the ph was not affected by either leaf area fruit ratio or soil water availability in contrast esteban et al 1999 found more differences in ph as distinct differences in soil water availability occurred during different growth seasons according to hrazdina et al 1984 changes in the ph of the grape berries are caused by metabolism of the major acids and accumulation of cations which transform the free acids into their corresponding salts the different environmental conditions and crop levels probably affected the season effect of irrigation regime on must acidity tables 4 6 in 2012 and 2014 with drier conditions than in 2013 irrigation treatments decreased acidity most likely because the rainfed berries were more ripen supl 2a and had lower ph at harvest table 6 supl 2b this did not match with those results observed by the majority of authors who investigated the response of total acidity to vine water supply such as estaban et al 1999 which found higher acidity at harvest for the irrigated treatment as occurs in our case in 2013 or etchebarne et al 2010 which grapes from grenache noir grapevines with a favorable water status accumulated more organic acids at maturity at harvest the tartaric acid content was higher in rainfed samples in the three seasons thus the higher acidity observed in 2013 in the irrigated samples could be mainly due to the highest malic acid concentration obtained in fi samples this year in general malic acid is the organic acid which more contributing to changes the acidity romero et al 1993 and which degradation is usually higher in non irrigated vines because of less cluster shading by leaves and increased cluster exposure to direct solar radiation intrigliolo and castel 2010 tartaric acid was more stable than malic acid esteban et al 1999 and at harvest its concentration were higher than malic acid table 6 as also observed by esteban et al 1999 in their study while they reported that before veraison the maximum concentration of these organic acids is reversed the tartaric acid is difficult to metabolize due to both its resistance to combustion at high temperatures and its propensity to form salts which are not easily degradated by any known enzymes iland and coombe 1988 the application of irrigation altered the balance between malic and tartaric acid increasing the former and decreasing the latter thus the decrease of tartaric acid concentration with the irrigation treatments was determined by the dilution due to the increase in berry size respect to rainfed berries however the malic acid content was higher under irrigated conditions except in 2014 probably due to the lower solar radiation and temperature reached during ripening in cluster area respect to rainfed grapevines rainfed grapevines shown lower shoot pruning weight and also had lower leaf area index table 3 than irrigated plants with higher direct solar incidence that increases the temperature on rainfed cluster zone facilitating further malic acid degradation this may aid in explaining the higher malic acid concentration under irrigated treatments compared to rainfed in spite of the dilution effect in the irrigated treatment due to greater berry growth as also observed morlat et al 1992 esteban et al 1999 and intrigliolo and castel 2010 3 4 2 phenological maturity throughout the ripening process the interaction year by treatment was significant in most of the color anthocyanins and tannins parameters measured indicating that the season affected the must phenological parameters tables 4 and 5 however at harverst this interaction was not significant in the most of the must phenological parameters suggesting that the effect of the irrigation regime on these parameters was not different between seasons table 6 in most of the color parameters measured at harvest at ph 3 2 value close to that of the ph during fermentation their highest amount was observed in rainfed treatment which were the berries that also had the greatest sugar accumulation at harvest di samples had intermediate values and samples of fi treatment showed the lowest color parameters content thus it seems that a more severe water restriction favored a better grape maturation and increased must color intensity polyphenols anthocyanins and tannins concentration this could be consequence of both an increase of expression of genes involved in synthesis of the phenolic pigments in berries by the water stress as observed castellarin et al 2007 and intrigliolo and castel 2010 as seems to have occurred in 2013 when all the treatments had the same berry weight maybe because the spring rainfall blunted the effect of the irrigation regimes or a dilution effect besides it can also be seen that the color intensity total polyphenols anthocyanins and tannins concentration increase with the maturity of the grapes at harvest table 6 however although the polyphenols tpi and tannins were influenced by the irrigation treatments their evolution pattern through the ripening stage was different between the three seasons supl 2c f thus color parameters showed a gradual increase in 2012 and 2013 season but with a sudden increase in 2014 after 7 days of accumulation and to a subsequent decrease until the final content is achieved at harverst supl 2c and d this also occurred with anthocyanin biosynthesis that was consistently increased throughout ripening except in rainfed and di samples of 2014 the driest season supl 2e by contrast in the case of the tannins supl 2f in 2013 and 2014 their accumulation reached a maximum near the anthocyanins maximums but later its content remains almost constant throughout the grapes ripening until harvest thus the accumulation of tannins was essentially complete by veraison as also observed bucchetti et al 2011 total tannin concentration was increased with rainfed and di compared to fi vines as well as reported romero et al 2013 however despite finding higher concentrations of anthocyanins in grapes under treatments with water restriction as observed ginestar et al 1998 choné et al 2001a 2001b ojeda et al 2002 and acevedo opazo et al 2010 in the present experiment the percentage of the anthocyanins extractability ae only was higher in 2013 season in rainfed respect to fi treatment at harvest in this 2013 season the grapes of rainfed had higher tss than the grapes from irrigated treatments table 6 nevertheless the percentage of maturation that had the seed at harvest was lower in the rainfed treatment respect to those of the irrigated ones which indicates that the seed tannins extractability was higher in the non irrigated grapes than in the irrigated ones table 6 in 2013 the high seed ripening percentage of the fi grapes table 6 plus the anthocyanins increasing trend during the ripening supl 2e and added to the fact that by the date of harvest of all the treatments these grapes were the ones that reached the lowest accumulation of sugars may reveal that the phenolic maturity was still incomplete in 2012 and 2014 seasons despite the differences in tss accumulation obtained between water regime treatments the extractability of the anthocyanins was similar which is interesting since anthocyanin extraction from grapes is prerequisite to the formation of stable red wine pigments unterkofler et al 2020 thus the greater skin anthocyanins observed in rainfed and di treatments respect to fi garcía esparza et al 2020 favors the extraction of total anthocyanins and easily extractable anthocyanins as reported ginestar et al 1998 thus according to glories and augustin 1993 it is important to note that phenolic maturity consists of two parts the determination of anthocyanin and tannin potential and the extractibility of these compounds during winemaking thus skins rich in anthocyanins and easily extractable tannins and seeds relatively poor in tannins characterize a ripe harvest hence the amount of anthocyanins and tannins are a precise indicator to determine the harvest date according to phenolic maturity therefore these wines whose technological maturity arrived earlier leaving the phenolic maturity incomplete will have a marked vegetable character astringency and will be more diluted lowering substantially its quality this could be avoided by monitoring the evolution of phenols as ripening proceeds and the grapes are harvested at their optimum sugar total acidity ratio both technological and phenolic ripening processes are complementary and have to be synchronized which is what determines the quality of the wine in order to mitigate the desynchronization of both ripening processes specially accentuated at the global level as a result of climate change deficit irrigation management is an interesting tool that could help us to mitigate it and that should be further studied 4 conclusions despite that the vintage effect influenced on the growth and vegetative and productive development of the bobal vines studied irrigation management by means of a deficit irrigation treatment di in the studied conditions has emerged as an interesting tool to transmit the maximum oenological potential to the wine therefore water regime did not affect the stability of the color of the wine over time however the di treatment produced a reduction in productive yield and vegetative development compared to the unlimited irrigation fi not as marked as the rainfed treatment so presumably di regulated better the temperature and microclimatic conditions reached in the bunches which is fundamental for both the quality and the ripening of the grapes and for their optimum health status besides grapes from di regime achieved higher total soluble solids accumulation and total acidity lower ph and greater potential of phenolic compounds than grapes with the maximum irrigation treatment fi and without differentiating of anthocyanin extractability degree between irrigation treatments the wine s acidic taste is essential since together with the polyphenols it counteracts the sweet taste of ethanol therefore di is a managing irrigation that can be interesting from an oenological point of view because contributes also to achieve a more favorable microbial and color stability of the wines than that from berries coming from the other irrigation regimes in addition with this controlled deficit irrigation system the problem of water scarcity which is faced by and increasing number of countries especially those with a mediterranean climate is taken into consideration declaration of competing

10184,climate change scenarios are predicting an increase in temperature as well as more scarce and torrential rainfall episodes due to this an imbalance between grape technological and phenolic maturity is being observed detrimentally affecting grapes composition in semi arid areas irrigation management is a main field practice to influence grape ripening the goal of the present study was to investigate in vitis vinifera l cv bobal grapevine responses to three watering regimes i rainfed ii deficit irrigation di replacing only 35 of the estimated crop evapotranspiration etc and iii full irrigation fi replacing 100 etc in the mid summer rainfed grapevines showed different degrees of water stress determined by midday stem water potentials ψstem ranging from 1 1 to 1 4 mpa depening on the season rainfed plants had in all seasons less vigor and production and at harvest higher concentrations of total soluble solids tss and grape phenolics compounds as well as lower ph with respect to the other water regimes studied di grapevines generally had intermediate values between rainfed and fi which presented extreme values of the studied parameters respect to rainfed the effects observed on grape color parameters and phenolic compounds with the rainfed regime were mainly due to a dehydration of the berry which lowered the yield and the weight of the berry compared to the irrigated treatments the lower tss accumulation in the di berries with respect to the rainfed will favor obtaining wines with lower alcohol content currently more demanded by the consumers besides despite the differences obtained between water regime treatments in the tss accumulation the extractability of the anthocyanins was similar which is interesting since anthocyanin extraction from grapes is prerequisite to the formation of stable red wine pigments although the most convenient irrigation strategy might depend to the wine style to be obtained di is a strategy that can help to close the gap in the imbalance between the technological and phenolic maturity positively affecting vine yield and performance with respect to the rainfed strategy keywords bobal regulated deficit irrigation water stress yield grape polyphenols 1 introduction with an increase in aridity and the frequency of extreme events predicted in the near future according to global climate models ipcc 2018 soil water availability may become a more important limiting factor in wine production and quality thus the rise of temperatures and the decrease of precipitations due to climate change trigger advanced maturation causing an imbalance between grape sugars and phenolic maturity poni et al 2018 which affects grape composition and therefore wine quality van leeuwen and darriet 2016 however together with higher temperatures higher concentrations of co2 are expected to increase biomass production moutinho pereira et al 2009 however vine productivity might be limited by rainfall distribution and water availability especially at the end of the growth cycle fraga et al 2016 2018 therefore in order to adapt the viticulture to this changing situation different management techniques such as deficit irrigation di can help to stabilize yield and maintain or improve wine quality as well as to increase water use efficiency wue chaves et al 2007 dos santos et al 2007 gálvez et al 2014 lanari et al 2014 cole and pagay 2015 bonada et al 2018 deficit irrigation consists of applying water rates to replace only part of the potential vine evapotranspiration either during the whole season or only during some phenological periods previously established intrigliolo and castel 2010 however the phenological stage when regulated deficit irrigation rdi is applied in addition to the water stress intensity and duration posed by the irrigation system determines the vinegrape growth behavior as well as the grape composition and quality attributes thus mccarthy 1997 reported that water stress during the period from fruit set to veraison heavily reduces fruit size intrigliolo et al 2012 and niculcea et al 2014 found that water deficits negatively impact berry weight especially when applied before veraison salón et al 2005 in bobal cultivar and intrigliolo et al 2012 in tempranillo showed that the delay of irrigation start during the period before veraison until reaching a moderate stem stress level stem water potential at midday of 1 0 mpa allows good control of vegetative growth and a moderate reduction in berry size this resulted in berries with a higher concentration of anthocyanins being the remaining grape composition parameters sugars total acidity ph malic and tartaric acids and total phenols similar to those of fully irrigated vines however they reported that a post veraison deficit irrigation strategy irrigation of 25 50 of grapevine total requirements and avoiding severe water stress stem water potential 1 4 mpa did not affect the final berry size but reduced the accumulation of sugars in it and delayed the ripening likewise girona et al 2009 showed that only moderate water stress at post veraison on tempranillo vines stem water potential 1 0 mpa can have positive effects on grape composition moreover authors as ojeda et al 2002 pellegrino et al 2005 and romero et al 2016 found a substantial improvement in berry quality under di treatment for decreasing yield and berry size roby et al 2004 van leeuwen et al 2004 salón et al 2005 ferrandino and lovisolo 2014 degaris et al 2015 and conesa et al 2016 observed that the synthesis and concentration of phenolic compounds soluble solids and anthocyanins were promoted by water deficit however other authors such as walker et al 2005 zarrouk et al 2016 obtained contrary results with anthocyanins reductions in the grape skins and loss of color in the wines compared to those of rainfed vineyards in particular zarrouk et al 2016 demonstrate that seasons with increased water stress lead to a larger impact of high temperatures on the berry ripening and composition petrie et al 2004 also reported reduction in berry and bunch weight yield and sugar concentration and increases in phenolic compounds concentration when water deficit was applied at shiraz grapevines in the post veraison period but anthocyanin concentration was unaffected they observed that although in the following season irrigation was returned to standard practice yield was reduced in accordance with the previous season stress therefore petrie et al 2004 reported that post veraison water deficit has the potential to impact both yield and fruit composition during both the current and the subsequent season according to koundouras et al 2006 and bindon et al 2011 the positive effects of water deficit in grapevines are directly related to wine quality components such as color flavor and wine aroma due to an increment of skin to pulp ratio in berries besides there is a wider consensus that ph and titratable acidity values are not greatly affected by irrigation sivilotti et al 2005 bobal vitis vinifera l cultivar is a native variety of the utiel requena designation of origin southeast of spain which coves 78 of the total surface of the red varieties planted in this grape growing region méndez 2005 intrigliolo and castel 2010 its main characteristics include its productivity a large number of clusters and large size high acidity and polyphenols levels its color intensity and brightness and fresh aroma which give rise to good red and rosé wines it is a vigorous and semi upright plant with high fertility has medium high production large clusters and long and creeping shoots bobal is very resistant to drought and it is better suited to loose and airy soils in la mancha region central spain bobal has been cultivated in vineyards where the soil is poor and yields are low to obtain high quality grapes garcía carpintero et al 2011 there bobal is cultivated in areas with specific weather conditions warm summers cold winters and limited rainfall which could influence its aroma composition dugelay et al 1993 however although drip irrigation has been steadily increasing for its crop there is little information published about the effect of the irrigation management on the bobal vine performance and grape and must composition to our knowledge only salón et al 2005 studied the effect of drip irrigation on bobal agronomic performance and on red and rosé wines quality in vines that were trained to an open vase system and wide vine spacing therefore the main objective of this study was to investigate how different irrigation strategies could affect the agronomic and oenological behavior of a bobal vineyard under vertical shoot positioning and a general more intensive vineyard plantation system 2 material and methods 2 1 site description soil and meteorological data the trial was carried out from 2012 to 2014 in a commercial vineyard located near requena valencia southeast spain latitude 39º 29 n longitude 1º 13w elevation above sea level 750 m belonging to the utiel requena denomination of origen d o the experiment was conducted with vitis vinifera l cv bobal grafted onto 161 49c couderc rootstock the grapevines were trained to a vertical trellis system on a bilateral cordon oriented north south and were planted in 2002 at a spacing of 2 5 1 4 m 2857 vinesha 1 the soil of the vineyard was a typic calciorthid with a clay loam to light clay texture highly calcareous and of low fertility soil depth was 2 m and available water capacity was about 200 mm m 1 the climate in the area is continental mediterranean and semiarid the heliothermal index is 2291 ºc corresponding to a temperate warm viticultural climate with cool nights and moderately dry according to the classification system for grape growing regions proposed by tonietto and carbonneau 2004 at the experimental site the annual average values for the last 12 years of the reference evapotranspiration eto and the rainfall were 1127 mm and 380 mm respectively about 65 of precipitation occurs in winter time thus during the grapevine dormant period during the vegetative period from april to end september of the study years the average temperature the eto calculated using the penman monteith formula described by allen et al 1998 and the rainfall data were recorded table 1 2 2 experimental design and irrigation treatments the experiment was a randomized block design with three treatments in four replications there were then a total of 12 experimental plots with four plots per each treatment each of the replications had 35 plants spread over five consecutive rows of seven grapes each one although only the three inner rows were used for sampling and the two outer rows were used as edges since plantation time the experimental vineyard was irrigated by a controlled deficit irrigation system with around 60 mm per season standard irrigation rates in the area from 2012 the three irrigation treatments explored were as follows i r rainfed which only received rainfall water ii di deficit irrigation controlled where water was applied to replace only 35 of the estimated crop evapotranspiration etc iii fi full irrigation where water was not limiting for the grapevines applying 100 of the etc the different irrigation regimes were applied by modifying the irrigation doses applied in each irrigation event but maintaining the same frequency of irrigation that varied from 1 to 2 times per week in spring to 5 6 times per week during the mid summer irrigation started when the rainfed vines reached threshold values of stem water potential ψstem of 0 6 to 0 7 mpa the etc was estimated using the crop coefficient kc according to williams and ayars 2005 considerations thus at full canopy growth the estimated kc value to refill the potential water needs was considered to be 0 6 etc eto kc the drip lines had emitters of 3 5 l h 1 spaced at 1 25 m all treatments were fertilized at a rate of 30 20 60 16 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 k2o and mgo respectively fields practices were those commonly used in the area including shoot trimming applied after fruit set 2 3 water status determination the plant water status was determined at midday 11 30 12 30 hr solar by measuring ψstem on two representative vines per experimental plot and one fully expanded leaf on the outer rim of the canopy per vine using a pressure chamber pms instrument company model 600 albany or usa the leaves were placed in totally hermetic aluminum foil bags for at least 1 h prior to the measurement time from mid may june to end september october on a bi weekly basis according to climatic conditions and the phenological stage of the plant the water stress integral sψ was calculated for each treatment using the stem water potential data according to the equation defined by myers 1988 in which the sψ was calculated eq 1 as the sum of the difference of average of two consecutive plant water potential measurements ψstem ψ i i 1 and the maximum least negative value registered during the study period in our case was c 0 45 mpa multiplying it by the number of days in the interval between one measurement and the next n 1 s φ i 0 i t ψ i i 1 c n the water use efficiency wue was calculated as a ratio between yield and the volume of water provided in each treatment through irrigation and rainfall this is a core subject of interest to secure sustainability in viticulture medrano et al 2014 2 4 leaf area estimation and vigor parameters after veraison five representative shoots per replicate were collected and leaf area was measured in the laboratory using a leaf area meter li 3100 lambda instrument corp lincoln ne primary and lateral leaf area was kept separated the number of shoots was determined on all the experimental vines to calculate vine leaf area by multiplying the average shoot leaf area obtained using the allometric relationships between shoot length and leaf area per the total number of shoots per vine shoot length shoot weight and shoot mass per grapevine were determined at pruning ravaz index was calculated by the ratio between mass of clusters harvested and mass of cane prunings expressed in kg of grapes of cane prunings 2 5 berry ripening sampling and oenological determinations during the ripening period from berry color change veraison to harvest randomly samples of 300 berries per experimental plot were taken at bi weekly intervals to determine technological maturity and phenolic parameters date of the first sampling for each year was 08 28 2012 09 10 2013 09 8 2014 and date of the second sampling was 09 4 2012 09 23 2013 and 09 15 2014 parameters related to technological maturity were berry fresh weight berry total soluble solids tss concentration expressed as ºbrix ph and total acidity expressed in g l 1 tartaric acid grape phenolic maturity parameters at ph 1 and ph 3 2 color intensity anthocyanins polyphenols total polyphenol index tpi and tannins were determined during ripening only in 2013 and 2014 seasons while in 2012 these parameters were determined only at harvest total soluble solids brix was determined using a manual refractometer atc 1 atago tokyo japan the titratable acidity and ph were measured by manual titrating with naoh 0 1 m to an end point of ph 7 0 using an electronic phmeter mettler toledo s20 mettler toledo ohio usa following regulated methods oiv 2003 for berry phenolics extraction saint cricq de gaulejac et al 1999 procedures were employed briefly in order to extract phenolic compounds four replicates of 50 g of homogenized sample were used for each sample two samples were used for phenolics determination after 4 h of maceration with 50 ml of hcl 0 1 n buffered at ph 1 0 while extractable values were obtained after 4 h of maceration with a solution buffered at ph 3 2 the ph 1 0 extraction implies the liberation diffusion and solubilization of the most percentage of the phenolics compounds due to the degradation of the skin cells the ph 3 2 extraction methodology is comparable to the one used during a classic red vinification saint cricq de gaulejac et al 1999 intrigliolo et al 2016 phenolic composition of the extracts was determined with uv and visible spectrophotometry with a uv visible jasco v 530 spectrophotometer jasco analytical instruments maryland usa color intensity ci and polyphenolic index tpi were estimated using the method described by glories 1978 anthocyanins and polyphenolic content were determined using the method to puissant león described by blouin 1992 tannins concentration was estimated according to sarneckis et al 2006 the difference of the studied polyphenols concentrations in the two extracts at ph 1 0 and ph 3 2 is an indicator of the fragility of the skin cell membranes and also of the polyphenols extractability the extractability percentage described by saint cricq de gaulejac et al 1999 as the capability of anthocyanins or polyphenols liberation result in a decrease when anthocyanins and polyphenols extractability increase during the ripening period for that reason the lower values for extractability percentage the more capability of anthocyanin and polyphenol extraction according to intrigliolo et al 2016 anthocyanin extractability ea represents the amount of anthocyanins that cannot be extracted in winemaking and is calculated by the difference between the total anthocyanins extracted at ph1 and the extractable anthocyanins at ph 3 2 besides considering that the total polyphenols determined in the extract correspond mainly to the sum of anthocyanins skin tannins and seed tannins and that there is a relationship more or less fixed in the accumulation of anthocyanins and tannins in the skin the amount of tannins contributed by the seeds to the wine can be determined by the difference during maturation the percentage of ripeness of the seeds decreases due to the grapes mature so the amount of tannins in the seeds decreases and their contribution to the polyphenolic concentration is lower thus the phenolic seed maturity pm which represents the contribution percentage of the seed tannins to the wine phenolic richness was determined according to saint cricq de gaulejac et al 1999 methodology all the analytical determinations were realized by duplicate so the results were the average of two analyses n 2 2 6 harvest sampling and yield components at the optimum moment of grape maturation according to the parameters set by the utiel requena d o on 10th 30th and 29th september of 2012 2013 and 2014 seasons respectively 20 grapevines were harvested by hand for each repetition number of clusters per grapevine bunch weight and yield kg grapevine 1 were recorded kern ch 15k20 spain samples of 600 grapes were randomly selected for each repetition and were divided into two set of 300 berries one for analyzing flesh and seed evaluation and aromatic compounds see details in garcía esparza et al 2020 and the other one for determining technological and polyphenolic parameters in the destemmed and crushed must samples following the same methodology as set out in section 2 4 organic acids malic and tartaric were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc following the procedures described by romero et al 1993 all the analytical determinations were realized by duplicate so the results were the average of two analyses n 2 2 7 statistical analysis the data were subjected to analysis of variance anova with irrigation treatment and year as factors mean comparisons were performed using duncan multiple range test when the differences were statistically significant at 95 probability level p 0 05 across seasons data were analyzed with irrigation treatment season and their interaction as factors the probability levels used were p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 simple linear regression analysis was performed to explore relationships between parameters using the sigmaplot package version 14 systat software inc san josé ca usa the statistical analysis were carried out using spss spss inc chicago il for windows version 11 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 water balance components and vine water status according to the data shown in table 1 and in the supplementary graph supl 1 on temperature reference evaporative demand of the plants eto rainfall and irrigation provided in each year the three studied vintages were different thus 2014 presented the most severe drought conditions with lower annual rainfall and higher evaporative demand therefore in this season the irrigation started earlier may 5 than in the other two vintages 2012 and 2013 from the 1st of april to the day in which the irrigation started the rain recorded was 55 7 112 3 and 4 6 mm in each season for 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively however in 2014 in relation to plant water status and according to the values indicate by acevedo opazo et al 2010 even the rainfed plants showed moderate values of stress ψs 1 2 mpa day 205 fig 1 by contrast in 2013 the irrigation began later may 29 because the rainfall during pre veraison was sufficient to increase the water available to the plants only at the end of the cycle the plants under rainfed treatment had some moderate stress fig 1 reaching similar ψs values than in 2014 but only by the end of the season on the other hand 2012 vintage had an intermediate climate behavior between the other two years although the rains fallen in spring allowed to reload with water the soil profile in this year the irrigation started later june 12 the scarce rains fallen during the summer resulted that the plants from the rainfed treatment showed severe stress ψs 1 29 to 1 45 mpa during most part of their pre and post veraison and ripening period from 2nd july to 3rd september fig 1 besides except for specific periods in 2014 from 11th to 22th august when the stem water potential of the di plants was lowered ψs 1 25 mpa and approached to those values presented by the rainfed plants during the rest of the growing cycles the plants under the di treatment did not suffer of water stress the same occurred with the plants under the fi treatment that were the ones that presented the highest stem water potentials throughout the three studied years fig 1 similar as observed by intrigliolo et al 2016 in their study with cabernet cultivar in 2012 the crop water use efficiency wue decreased with increasing water application di and fi table 2 however in 2013 and 2014 the rainiest and driest seasons respectively wue differences between irrigation treatments were not found flexas et al 2010 reported that wue can be modified by the management techniques and timing of water availability according to simonneau et al 2017 wue is a parameter that depends on the genetics and the scions rootstocks combinations used medrano et al 2014 reported that the effects of deficit irrigation strategies in wue are not conclusive and that many factors as genotypes environment soil and crop management can influence in plant behavior to deficit irrigation strategies mainly in relation to wue these authors also observed that there are cultivars reputed as more adapted to drought prone conditions which presumably should also present high wue 3 2 yield and its components in all seasons the most irrigated treatment fi had higher yield than rainfed grapevines being the yield of the rainfed treatment in 2014 quite lower than the rest of the treatments table 2 this matches with the results obtained by other authors such as williams et al 2010 chalmers et al 2010 and intrigliolo et al 2016 thus in general the yield decreases as water availability does fig 2a r2 0 70 0 57 0 74 for 2012 2013 and 2014 season respectively although the response varies depending on the irrigation dose climatic conditions and the period of application for instance yu et al 2020 observed that early season water deficit irrigation prior to veraison had higher probability to decrease yield than later season water deficit irrigation post veraison to harvest the number of clusters per grapevine and the cluster and berry weights also had the same trend as the yield with higher values in grapevines under irrigation regimes di and fi although on the first season 2012 the number of clusters had not significant differences between treatments table 2 this could be related to the fact that the higher budburst is a consequence of the improved water status during the previous season and in 2011 all the grapevines had the same water status the increases in yield produced by irrigation were mostly due to the berry size as also observed by salón et al 2004 in their bobal and tempranillo trials where yield increased linearly with water application in the present research berry weight was the main yield component affected by water availability r2 0 83 0 35 and 0 88 in 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively fig 2b in agreement with esteban et al 1999 salón et al 2005 baeza et al 2007 and intrigliolo et al 2016 a significant effect of the year by treatment interaction was observed on cluster number per grapevine cluster weight and berry weight suggesting that the effect of the irrigation regime on these parameters was different among seasons table 2 thus these productive parameters were influenced by the vintage being 2013 the coldest and the wettest year where the cluster weight values in all treatments were lower compared to the other two study seasons however in 2013 the berry weight was similar between treatments with lower water availability and fi probably due to the effect of the spring and summer rains in this year moreover it is important to highlight that although the yield between grapevines in 2012 and 2013 did not show significant differences between these years the weight of the bunch was of the order of 3 rainfed and di samples and 4 fi ones times higher in 2012 compared to those of the 2013 year besides the number of clusters per grapevine in the rainfed treatment in 2012 was greater than in 2013 table 2 girona et al 2006 also shown significant reductions in the number of clusters after three years of severe deficit irrigation and in non irrigated vines and shellie 2006 found a yield reduction associated with fewer cluster per vine under di treatment on the other hand the cluster fertility number of berries per cluster was not affected by water availability table 2 similarly to what reported by baeza et al 2007 these authors suggested that this could be because the flower differentiation is carried out near budburst when all treatments were well supplied with water from the winter rains etchebarne et al 2010 in their grenache noir vines observed that the difference from one year to the next in berry number per cluster was most probably a consequence of variations in fruit set due to the weather conditions in each year and not as a result of the irrigation treatments applied after berry set however authors like keller 2010 explained that high temperatures around budburst can lower the number of flowers per inflorescence which could occur in the non irrigated treatment whose lesser vegetative development could modify the microclimate of the bunch increasing its temperature bergqvist et al 2001 reported that high temperatures and high light intensity during the floral initiation process can increase the number of inflorescences and matthews and anderson 1989 specified that a water deficit during this period can have strong opposite effects 3 3 vigor and vegetative growth parameters the canopy components were affected by the irrigation treatments table 3 shoot weight and length r2 0 59 and 0 63 in 2013 and 2014 respectively and pruning weight per grapevine r2 0 61 and 0 77 in 2013 and 2014 respectively were higher when irrigation treatments were applied figs 2c and d respectively this suggests that these growth processes are very sensitive to water stress although this also depends on the variety roby et al 2004 romero et al 2013 similarly leaf area per vine was affect by the irrigation treatment increasing in the fi grapevines respect to those of the other treatments table 3 in 2014 the warmest and driest year of the study table 1 the differences in leaf area between rainfed and fi vines were statistically very considerable as can also be observed in the shoot total length table 3 etchebarne et al 2020 did not found irrigation effect on leaf area mainly because the secondary shoots were removed and no compensatory growth seemed to occur for the primary shoots besides the redistribution of grapevine reserves plays a role attenuating the effect of leaf area reduction candolfi vasconcellos et al 1994 candolfi vasconcellos and koblet 1990 reported that berry size increases when leaf area increases and according to dokoozlian and hirschfelt 1995 when berry number decreases the ravaz index yield vigor ratio was not affected by the irrigation treatments table 3 this could be because the increase in yield due to irrigations was in most part compensated by the higher vine growth of the irrigated vines although this parameter differs with the grape variety in order to obtained balanced grapevines garcía escudero et al 2006 suggested that for cv tempranillo in the climatic conditions of aoc rioja region the optimum values of ravaz index ranged between 4 and 7 while smart and robinson 1991 recommend for vitis vinifera l values between 5 and 10 in our case most of irrigated grapevines had ravaz index around 7 without significant differences between watering regimes thus the management and pruning of the vineyards were the same in all the treatments and should aim at the development of balanced grapevines ensuring stable yields over consecutive crops and without compromising the quality of the grapes therefore in addition to the shaded atmosphere created in the area of the bunches and their conditions conducive to the development of diseases in berries dokoozlian and kliewer 1996 an excess of vigor in the vine can reduce the accumulation of sugars and phenolic compounds in berries resulting from competition for assimilates between vegetative growth and bunch ripening in this context bunch ripening is delayed which leads to problems in the ripeness of the berries in the aromas and other compounds that can be sensitive to passed on to the wine pérez álvarez 2015 3 4 grape enological parameters 3 4 1 technological maturity the date of harvest was twenty days before in 2012 september 10th than in 2013 september 30th and 2014 september 29th seasons however the grape total soluble solids tss accumulation expressed as ºbrix varied between seasons table 4 6 matthews and anderson 1988 also observed the same behavior and reported that water deficit might alter the onset or duration of the ripening period thus at harvest tss was higher in 2012 even in fi grapes than in the other seasons table 6 as aforementioned year 2013 was the coolest year with the lowest eto and the highest rainfall throughout growing cycle indeed only the rainfed and di grapes in 2012 and the rainfed in 2014 reached the target soluble solids concentration of 22 ºbrix at the harvesting time table 6 being the tss in the rainfed treatment at harvest by about 1 ºbrix higher than the values of di and 1ºbrix higher than those of the fi samples therefore the reduction in berry weight and yield tables 2 3 caused by rainfed or di versus fi treatment resulted in an advanced maturation thus two factors could explain the accumulation of tss a greater water deficit that advances the berry maturation leading to a lower total acidity ta escalona et al 2003 or a dehydration of the berry in our study the first case could be observed in di grapes especially in 2014 when ta was reduced compared to the other treatments however the increase in tss in the case of the rainfed grapes could be due to a dehydration of the berry which presented the lowest weights throughout the ripening process tables 2 4 5 and 6 esteban et al 1999 reported that the tss concentration was reduced when the dilution caused by the berry growth is faster than the increase in sugar transport into the berry in the same way that irrigation treatments were more conducive to dilution than in the rainfed regime because of larger berry growth table 2 williams 2012 and intrigliolo et al 2016 also found that berry maturity is delayed and soluble solids concentration decreased with increasing water applications grapes with a high sugar content may lead to residual sugars in the fermentation responsible for impacting on the wine organoleptic characteristics therefore in wineries a current objective pursued is to reduce these soluble solids which are attempted through various cultivation practices such as di or already in the winery itself through coupages or de alcoholization processes intrigliolo et al 2016 in 2012 and 2014 the must ph showed correlation with water stress integral r2 0 58 and 0 31 respectively fig 3 confirming that must ph responses to the irrigation regime are dependent on several vine and edapho climatic factors williams and matthews 1990 in all the seasons at harvest time the rainfed treatment had the highest tss ºbrix and fi the lowest on the contrary the ph reached the lowest values in rainfed treatment and the highest in fi except in 2013 when there were no differences in ph between treatments table 6 etchebarne et al 2010 observed that the ph was not affected by either leaf area fruit ratio or soil water availability in contrast esteban et al 1999 found more differences in ph as distinct differences in soil water availability occurred during different growth seasons according to hrazdina et al 1984 changes in the ph of the grape berries are caused by metabolism of the major acids and accumulation of cations which transform the free acids into their corresponding salts the different environmental conditions and crop levels probably affected the season effect of irrigation regime on must acidity tables 4 6 in 2012 and 2014 with drier conditions than in 2013 irrigation treatments decreased acidity most likely because the rainfed berries were more ripen supl 2a and had lower ph at harvest table 6 supl 2b this did not match with those results observed by the majority of authors who investigated the response of total acidity to vine water supply such as estaban et al 1999 which found higher acidity at harvest for the irrigated treatment as occurs in our case in 2013 or etchebarne et al 2010 which grapes from grenache noir grapevines with a favorable water status accumulated more organic acids at maturity at harvest the tartaric acid content was higher in rainfed samples in the three seasons thus the higher acidity observed in 2013 in the irrigated samples could be mainly due to the highest malic acid concentration obtained in fi samples this year in general malic acid is the organic acid which more contributing to changes the acidity romero et al 1993 and which degradation is usually higher in non irrigated vines because of less cluster shading by leaves and increased cluster exposure to direct solar radiation intrigliolo and castel 2010 tartaric acid was more stable than malic acid esteban et al 1999 and at harvest its concentration were higher than malic acid table 6 as also observed by esteban et al 1999 in their study while they reported that before veraison the maximum concentration of these organic acids is reversed the tartaric acid is difficult to metabolize due to both its resistance to combustion at high temperatures and its propensity to form salts which are not easily degradated by any known enzymes iland and coombe 1988 the application of irrigation altered the balance between malic and tartaric acid increasing the former and decreasing the latter thus the decrease of tartaric acid concentration with the irrigation treatments was determined by the dilution due to the increase in berry size respect to rainfed berries however the malic acid content was higher under irrigated conditions except in 2014 probably due to the lower solar radiation and temperature reached during ripening in cluster area respect to rainfed grapevines rainfed grapevines shown lower shoot pruning weight and also had lower leaf area index table 3 than irrigated plants with higher direct solar incidence that increases the temperature on rainfed cluster zone facilitating further malic acid degradation this may aid in explaining the higher malic acid concentration under irrigated treatments compared to rainfed in spite of the dilution effect in the irrigated treatment due to greater berry growth as also observed morlat et al 1992 esteban et al 1999 and intrigliolo and castel 2010 3 4 2 phenological maturity throughout the ripening process the interaction year by treatment was significant in most of the color anthocyanins and tannins parameters measured indicating that the season affected the must phenological parameters tables 4 and 5 however at harverst this interaction was not significant in the most of the must phenological parameters suggesting that the effect of the irrigation regime on these parameters was not different between seasons table 6 in most of the color parameters measured at harvest at ph 3 2 value close to that of the ph during fermentation their highest amount was observed in rainfed treatment which were the berries that also had the greatest sugar accumulation at harvest di samples had intermediate values and samples of fi treatment showed the lowest color parameters content thus it seems that a more severe water restriction favored a better grape maturation and increased must color intensity polyphenols anthocyanins and tannins concentration this could be consequence of both an increase of expression of genes involved in synthesis of the phenolic pigments in berries by the water stress as observed castellarin et al 2007 and intrigliolo and castel 2010 as seems to have occurred in 2013 when all the treatments had the same berry weight maybe because the spring rainfall blunted the effect of the irrigation regimes or a dilution effect besides it can also be seen that the color intensity total polyphenols anthocyanins and tannins concentration increase with the maturity of the grapes at harvest table 6 however although the polyphenols tpi and tannins were influenced by the irrigation treatments their evolution pattern through the ripening stage was different between the three seasons supl 2c f thus color parameters showed a gradual increase in 2012 and 2013 season but with a sudden increase in 2014 after 7 days of accumulation and to a subsequent decrease until the final content is achieved at harverst supl 2c and d this also occurred with anthocyanin biosynthesis that was consistently increased throughout ripening except in rainfed and di samples of 2014 the driest season supl 2e by contrast in the case of the tannins supl 2f in 2013 and 2014 their accumulation reached a maximum near the anthocyanins maximums but later its content remains almost constant throughout the grapes ripening until harvest thus the accumulation of tannins was essentially complete by veraison as also observed bucchetti et al 2011 total tannin concentration was increased with rainfed and di compared to fi vines as well as reported romero et al 2013 however despite finding higher concentrations of anthocyanins in grapes under treatments with water restriction as observed ginestar et al 1998 choné et al 2001a 2001b ojeda et al 2002 and acevedo opazo et al 2010 in the present experiment the percentage of the anthocyanins extractability ae only was higher in 2013 season in rainfed respect to fi treatment at harvest in this 2013 season the grapes of rainfed had higher tss than the grapes from irrigated treatments table 6 nevertheless the percentage of maturation that had the seed at harvest was lower in the rainfed treatment respect to those of the irrigated ones which indicates that the seed tannins extractability was higher in the non irrigated grapes than in the irrigated ones table 6 in 2013 the high seed ripening percentage of the fi grapes table 6 plus the anthocyanins increasing trend during the ripening supl 2e and added to the fact that by the date of harvest of all the treatments these grapes were the ones that reached the lowest accumulation of sugars may reveal that the phenolic maturity was still incomplete in 2012 and 2014 seasons despite the differences in tss accumulation obtained between water regime treatments the extractability of the anthocyanins was similar which is interesting since anthocyanin extraction from grapes is prerequisite to the formation of stable red wine pigments unterkofler et al 2020 thus the greater skin anthocyanins observed in rainfed and di treatments respect to fi garcía esparza et al 2020 favors the extraction of total anthocyanins and easily extractable anthocyanins as reported ginestar et al 1998 thus according to glories and augustin 1993 it is important to note that phenolic maturity consists of two parts the determination of anthocyanin and tannin potential and the extractibility of these compounds during winemaking thus skins rich in anthocyanins and easily extractable tannins and seeds relatively poor in tannins characterize a ripe harvest hence the amount of anthocyanins and tannins are a precise indicator to determine the harvest date according to phenolic maturity therefore these wines whose technological maturity arrived earlier leaving the phenolic maturity incomplete will have a marked vegetable character astringency and will be more diluted lowering substantially its quality this could be avoided by monitoring the evolution of phenols as ripening proceeds and the grapes are harvested at their optimum sugar total acidity ratio both technological and phenolic ripening processes are complementary and have to be synchronized which is what determines the quality of the wine in order to mitigate the desynchronization of both ripening processes specially accentuated at the global level as a result of climate change deficit irrigation management is an interesting tool that could help us to mitigate it and that should be further studied 4 conclusions despite that the vintage effect influenced on the growth and vegetative and productive development of the bobal vines studied irrigation management by means of a deficit irrigation treatment di in the studied conditions has emerged as an interesting tool to transmit the maximum oenological potential to the wine therefore water regime did not affect the stability of the color of the wine over time however the di treatment produced a reduction in productive yield and vegetative development compared to the unlimited irrigation fi not as marked as the rainfed treatment so presumably di regulated better the temperature and microclimatic conditions reached in the bunches which is fundamental for both the quality and the ripening of the grapes and for their optimum health status besides grapes from di regime achieved higher total soluble solids accumulation and total acidity lower ph and greater potential of phenolic compounds than grapes with the maximum irrigation treatment fi and without differentiating of anthocyanin extractability degree between irrigation treatments the wine s acidic taste is essential since together with the polyphenols it counteracts the sweet taste of ethanol therefore di is a managing irrigation that can be interesting from an oenological point of view because contributes also to achieve a more favorable microbial and color stability of the wines than that from berries coming from the other irrigation regimes in addition with this controlled deficit irrigation system the problem of water scarcity which is faced by and increasing number of countries especially those with a mediterranean climate is taken into consideration declaration of competing
