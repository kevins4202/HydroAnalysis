22340,based on the sinking construction of the largest open caisson across the world a sinking simulation test is designed and conducted in this work data from sensors during subsidence the migration track of the sand outside the caisson and the settlement of the riverbed after the sinking are measured and analysed the relationships between the influence range of sand migration outside the caisson and the sinking depth and the characteristics of the subsidence space formed after migration are described combined with measured data from caisson construction the migration of sand outside the caisson is concluded to be mainly related to the depth of the caisson and the spatial position of the sand outside the caisson and to be influenced by the seepage force the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure a calculation model describing the behaviour of the migration is established through dynamic comparison and analysis it is found that the seepage force the blade foot reaction force the lateral pressure sand gushing and sudden sinking of the caisson are all related to the sand migration a migration coefficient is defined to describe the migration rate and different degrees of sand gushing and sudden sinking keywords caisson sinking sand migration spatial effect seepage force sand gushing and sudden sinking 1 introduction open caisson foundations have been widely used in large span deep water bridges due to advantages such as their large bearing capacities high stiffnesses high integrities and small settlements e g nonveiller e 1987 tanimoto k 1994 with the rapid development of transportation in recent years china has built a number of large deep water caissons a plane area greater than 2000 m2 and a depth greater than 40 m e g hu z b 2016 tb10093 2017 gb50007 2011 however the base size and sinking depth of such caissons exceed the limit of current design specifications e g tb10093 2017 gb50007 2011 tb10093 2017 gb50007 2011 these caissons sink mainly due to undrained sediment suction which keeps the water level inside and outside the caisson nearly equal and the mixture of soil and water around the blade foot is sucked out by suction pumps causing the caisson to sink due to gravity e g zhang f x 2010 in recent years many studies have investigated suction in caissons e g luke a m 2005 lian j 2014 but few studies have explored the sinking of large deep water open caissons geuguwen yea 2012 studied the force of the blade foot during the sinking process through field experiments chiou j s 2012 analysed a laterally loaded bridge caisson foundation in gravel gerolymos n 2006 zhong and huang 2013 and zafeirakos a 2013 studied the model of the dynamic response of a caisson large deep water open caissons face a series of problems such as slow sinking tilt sand gushing and sudden sinking e g allenby d 2009 sand gushing is a phenomenon in which the mixture of water and sand outside a caisson rapidly migrates to the inside of the caisson and gushes out through the blade foot sudden sinking refers to the unexpected sinking of a caisson without warning during the process of sinking construction according to statistics the total subsidence of the 28 caisson 86 9 58 7 105 m of the hutong bridge in the final subsidence stage was 22 m and the subsidence caused by sand gushing and sudden sinking reached 46 which occurred 30 times while sudden subsidence occurred 19 times e g jiang b n 2016 the key to solving the above problems is to determine the migration regularity of the sand outside a caisson existing studies have not systematically or thoroughly studied the behaviour of sand migration outside large deep water open caissons which leads to blind construction to a certain extent using a submerged caisson mesoscopic test mu b g et al 2014 found that the range of influence of surface subsidence linearly decreases with increasing depth and is funnel shaped in addition a larger caisson size corresponds to a larger funnel radius and more obvious sand migration in the fields of mining and foundation engineering some scholars have studied sand migration phenomena such as gushing of water and sand sui w h 2008 found that a change in pore water pressure near unconsolidated stratum mining has precursory significance for the gushing of water and sand after gushing of water and sand the pore pressure drops sharply and generates instantaneous negative pressure and the hydraulic gradient appears to decline near the mouth of the sand gushing using a microscopic test of the sand piping mechanism yao z x et al 2009 found that the hydraulic gradient suddenly increases leading to agglomeration of local particles in soil samples the sudden increase in pore pressure destroys the soil arching effect in the system and reduces the anti seepage ability of the system in this work we design and complete simulation testing of a large deep water caisson to explore undrained sediment suction induced sinking of open caissons in saturated sand and analyses the influences of caisson depth the spatial position of sand outside the caisson the seepage force the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure on sand migration outside the caisson we then compare the results with measured data from a sinking construction site which provides an experimental reference for engineering and research in related fields 2 general parameters of the model test the experimental model takes the main tower caisson of the largest caisson hutong bridge 89 6 58 7 115 m as the prototype we simulate the same type of open caisson the geological conditions and the construction methods the model size is 120 90 140 cm height and the similarity ratio is approximately 1 70 reflecting a rectangular round shape with an aspect ratio of 1 33 the width of the blade foot is 4 cm and the width and height of the bevel projection are each 10 cm the caisson walls are composed of two spliced layers of 5 mm steel plate with full seam welding for waterproofing the inner and outer walls of the caisson are filled with sand the thickness of the sidewall is 10 15 cm and the middle of the model has a hole with a size of 82 52 cm the weight of the model is 20 kn as shown in fig 1 the bottom of the steel casing and the outer shaft wall of the caisson are punched with a diameter of 2 cm the earth pressure box and the pore water pressure meter are embedded the sensor which has a diameter of 1 9 cm is placed on the surface of the caisson the surface of the sensor is flat with the steel casing and is bonded with welding adhesive cracks are waterproofed using neutral silica gel the sensor wire is drawn from the inside of the steel casing to the top of the caisson and then connected to a data acquisition box along the test tank ten bwx strain earth pressure sensors each with a range of 200 kpa are buried at the blade foot the number of sensors and buried positions are shown in fig 2 the sidewall of the caisson is divided into 6 sections by height and each section has 10 measuring points including 7 measuring points for earth pressure 42 points in total and 3 measuring points for pore water pressure 18 points in total taking the south sidewall and section 1 as an example the number and burial layout are shown in fig 3 the effective stress of each measured point is the difference between the measured earth pressure and the pore water pressure the pore water pressure on the eastern side is identical to that on the western side the measuring range of the earth pressure box at sections 1 2 and 3 is 50 kpa and the measuring range at sections 4 5 and 6 is 30 kpa the measuring range of the pore water pressure meter is 50 kpa the measured value of the sensor is the reading during the test minus the initial reading the size of the test slot is 4 5 4 5 3 m and a sand cushion of approximately 15 cm is laid at the bottom of the slot then two 13 m 13 m layers of pvc tarpaulin with thicknesses of 0 5 cm are laid to isolate water the sand is filled into four layers in this test and each layer is 0 5 m high the physical parameters of the sand used in the test are shown in table 1 the distribution curve of grain size is shown in fig 4 which represents for medium coarse sand after the filling is completed the caisson is statically placed on the surface of the sand for a period of time until the pore water pressure remain stable and the test sand is fully saturated water is added to the examined slot until the level of liquid is higher than the level of sand before the test the examined sand is saturated fully for 3 days water is added to 0 1 m above the surface of the sand before the test a keyence il 1000 laser displacement meter keyence china co ltd shanghai china is set at the top of the corner of the caisson to measure the dynamic subsidence of the caisson and two inclinometers are set at the middle points of the sidewalls on both sides to observe the posture of the caisson three groups of pore pressure meters with a spacing of 20 cm are buried 45 cm from the middle of the sidewall of the caisson on the south west and north sides the location of the pore pressure meter is fixed to prevent the influence of migration of sand mass on the process of sinking and the hydraulic gradient around the caisson is measured jointly by the pore pressure meters on the sidewall as shown in fig 5 a triangular bracket is arranged on the south side of the tested slot and a sliding rail is fixed on one side of the bracket four displacement meters each with a range of 25 cm are fixed on the slider and are labelled no 4 through no 7 the distances between the displacement meters and the caisson are 15 cm 25 cm 40 cm and 55 cm the slider can be moved up and down when the bottom of the displacement meter is touched with a slender hollow aluminium rod it can be flexed the length of the slender hollow aluminium rods are 90 cm 70 cm and 50 cm and are inserted 30 cm before the test a round gasket with a diameter of 2 cm is set at the bottom of the aluminium rods to prevent them from excessively drilling the aluminium bars can undergo lateral displacement with the sand which prevents excessive deflection of the aluminium bars at the ends on the other side of the bracket three displacement meters each with a range of 25 cm are installed and are labelled no 1 through no 3 their distances from the caisson are 15 cm 30 cm and 50 cm the displacement meters are touching the surface of the sand after insertion of a cork mat a transversely rotating roller is arranged between the displacement meters and the support to ensure that the displacement meters can rotate with migration of the sand a micro inclinometer is fixed to each displacement meter to measure its rotation angle as shown in fig 6 a solid liquid circulation system is used to control the caisson during undrained sediment suction sinking the system consists of two pumps each with 4 kw power flow 35 m 3 h water height 12 m and two tanks with a volume of 1 5 m³ the diameter of sand extraction pipe is 6 8 cm a sand pump pumps the sand water mixture from the hole in the caisson into the water tank after being filtered the water is pumped back into the caisson by another pump the sand pump uses a frequency converter to control its speed valves are installed at the inlet and outlet ports to ensure that the level of liquid inside and outside the caisson remains the same a frame table is set at the bottom of the tested slot and the top surface of the table is at the same level as the fill surface such that the additional stress produced by the operator is reduced the overall layout of the test is shown in fig 7 first water is poured into the pump and sand pipe to drain the air before the test then the inlet and outlet valves of the sand extraction pipe are closed after filling with water next the valve and sand suction pump are opened after inserting the caisson to establish solid liquid circulation the pump must be adjusted to the appropriate rotational speed after the suction began the caisson sank under gravity to ensure the effective operation of each system the subsidence debugging stage is found 30 cm from the surface of the soil to the burial depth to ensure the success of the test solid liquid circulation must be established in the commissioning stage and the speed of the sand pump must be appropriately set the sand pump is allowed to pause and start multiple times during the debugging stage after debugging the caisson will remain static for half an hour before sinking and then data recording begins to ensure that the seepage effect during the debugging stage does not affect the formal test the reciprocating sweeping suction method is adopted in accordance with the actual project the frequencies of the micro inclinometer on the displacement meter and horizontal displacement monitoring of the aluminium rods are 1 time point per minute while the other sensors run at 1 hz when the caisson reaches a predetermined height the test is terminated as shown in fig 8 3 the regularity of sand migration outside the caisson due to failure of the sand pumps in the middle of the test the test was divided into two times and the speed of the pumps during the two times remained the same the first stage lasted 1342 s the subsidence was 53 4 cm and the average speed of subsidence was 2 39 cm min the second stage lasted 855 s the subsidence was 19 1 cm and the average speed of subsidence was 1 34 cm min the total depth of subsidence was 72 5 cm and the final sinking depth of the caisson was 102 cm the sinking curve in this experiment is compared with jiang and ma 2019b as shown in fig 9 in the two experiments except for the soil compactness caused by the filling although the soil migration measurement points are not set in the test by jiang the other conditions are basically the same although differences exist in the sinking curve the curve form is basically the same and the sinking rate decreases in the late sinking stage in jiang s test the sinking of the caisson is faster but the total amount of sinking is slightly smaller therefore the impact of the failure of the sand pump on the test results is negligible sand gushing is a phenomenon in which the mixture of water and sand outside a caisson rapidly migrates to the inside of the caisson and gushes out through the blade foot which is confirmed by the instant increase in the turbidity of the water inside the caisson at the same time due to the increase in the amount of instantaneous sand absorption the contact of the suction pipe and the sound inside the pipe also change to ensure the continuity of the test the inner sand surface is not measured after sand gushing occurs after sinking the water in the tested slot is discharged to expose the riverbed the relevant data of the riverbed and the sand surface in the caisson are measured the sand outside the caisson is excavated to assess the data from the displacement meter as shown in fig 10 3 1 dynamic analysis of sand migration outside the caisson the changes in the riverbed surface and soil displacement meters outside the caisson with subsidence of the caisson are shown in fig 11 the displacement data represent the sinking depth at the middle point of the side where the sensor is located no 7 showed no obvious change throughout the test fig 11 shows that with increasing subsidence the overall amount of migration of sand outside the caisson shows an increasing trend the amount and average speed of sand migration in the first stage 0 35 cm are substantially lower than those in the second stage 35 70 cm the trend of the migration speed at the measured points outside the caisson is basically the same at the same vertical height a closer measuring point to the caisson corresponds to a greater migration amount and a higher speed in the same period the difference between the migration amount and migration speed is considerable indicating that the migration of the sand outside the caisson is related to the depth and the horizontal distance between the sand and the caisson in the section of subsidence between 0 and 50 cm the average subsidence speed of the caisson is greater than 2 5 cm min and the subsidence varies evenly the change rules for sand migration and subsidence are basically the same and the migration speed is 0 4 cm min in the section of subsidence between 50 and 70 cm the average subsidence speed of the caisson is low at 1 2 cm min which is 50 of the speed in the section between 0 and 50 cm in addition the sediment change is not even sand migration is large and complex and the average migration speed is 1 26 cm min which is more than 3 times the speed in the section between 0 and 50 cm the time history curve of the displacement of the measured points in the section between 50 and 70 cm of the subsidence is shown in fig 12 by comparing the caisson subsidence curves with the displacement change in the sand measured points one can see that when the subsidence speed of the caisson is high the migration speed is high however when the subsidence speed of the caisson is low the migration speed of the measured points is also low from 1972 s to 2050 s the subsidence rate of the caisson is low while the rate of sand migration is very high indicating that sand migration is also related to other factors in this paper the law of sand migration is analysed in combination with the hydraulic gradient around the outer sidewall the blade foot pressure and the lateral earth pressure 3 2 the sand migration track outside the caisson the track of migration for the measured points can be obtained after sinking the fixed point of the riverbed is 65 cm away from the caisson wall and the fixed point of the sand at 30 cm below the riverbed is 55 cm away from the caisson wall thus the range of influence of this sinking can be obtained the track of migration and the range of influence of the subsidence are shown in fig 13 when the sand at the inner bottom of the blade foot is sucked out the sand at the outer side moves horizontally to the inside and the sand outside the caisson moves obliquely downward at a certain angle determined by the spatial position of the blade foot for sand the migration angle of the measured points on the riverbed is 70 the angle between the migration track and the horizontal direction and the migration angle of the sand in the caisson is 65 a larger vertical distance between the sand in the caisson and the riverbed corresponds to a smaller migration angle after the surface of the riverbed migrates the measured points are mainly upper concave curves while the internal measured points are lower concave curves indicating that the migration channel is close to the sidewall of the caisson a closer blade foot corresponds to more obvious migration according to the migration angle and the surface after migrating the migration amount of the sand on the riverbed is the same as that under the riverbed in other words within a 27 cm range of the sidewall the migration amount of the riverbed is less than the migration amount of sand in addition if the depth of the sand in the caisson increases the range will be less than 27 cm within a certain range of the sidewall and with the same horizontal distance from the sidewall a greater vertical distance from the riverbed corresponds to a greater amount of migration in addition this range decreases with the increase in the vertical distance between the sand in the caisson and the riverbed combined with section 3 1 sand migration is found to be related to the horizontal distance between the sand in the caisson and the vertical distance of the riverbed that is to the plane position of the sand using a combination of these data and the phenomena found in mu bao gang et al 2014 the range of influence of sinking for a caisson on the surrounding sand is given via nonlinear fitting the distribution of broken lines can be adopted in engineering for simplification the boundary influenced by the riverbed surface is 0 65 h and the boundary influenced at 0 3 h below the riverbed surface is 0 55 h where h is the depth of the caisson 3 3 the spatial effect of sand migration outside the caisson the discussion in the above two sections is based on the vertical section where the displacement meter is located that is the migration law of sand at the middle point of the long edge of the caisson however the sinking of the caisson is a spatial problem and the migration of sand on different sides also varies after the test the settlement and range of influence of all riverbed sand are measured and counted as shown in figs 14 and 15 the inside rectangle is the caisson plane and the outside arc is the influence range of the subsidence on the surface of the riverbed based on the above analysis the migration amount and influence range of the sand outside the caisson may be related to the length of the side of the caisson the displacement and range of influence of the sand at the long side are greater than those at the short side the long side and short side both influence each other and the displacement and influence range at the west side of the caisson are greater than those at the east side according to the data for the sand surface the average surface depth for sand on the north and south sides of the caisson is greater than the values on the east and west sides that is the blade foot is more likely to be empty and sand migration occurs the influence boundary on the short side is 0 35 h which is smaller than the value of 0 65 h on the long side in the direction of the parallel sidewall of the caisson from section 1 1 the curved surface formed by sand migration is approximately parabolic and the average angle between the line from the vertex to the riverbed boundary and the horizontal direction is approximately 18 the average settlement of the caisson riverbed is 0 15 h which is close to the value for the 28 caisson without considering the effect of the erosion of sand in the direction of the vertical sidewall of the caisson the average slope at the middle point of the sidewall is 0 44 according to sections 2 2 and 3 3 and the angle between the sidewall and the horizontal direction is close to 45 0 5 ϕ which is the controlled rupture angle of the slope stability 3 4 field measurement comparison the average settlement of the riverbed close to the outer wall is shown in figs 16 and 17 the construction time for 28 and 29 caissons is approximately 480 days the sinking time is 207 days and the average sinking speed is 0 34 m d when the caisson does not sink the average scour is 1 m year for the 28 caisson bed and 0 4 m year for the 29 caisson bed when sinking the scouring action is more obvious because the sand sucked out during construction is scattered on the surface of the riverbed but the scouring speed is lower than the speed of sand suction thus the surface of the riverbed is uplifted in the early stage of sinking which is called the scouring sucking effect the average settlement of the riverbed rises with increasing caisson settlement the subsidence amount and subsidence speed in the first stage 0 35 m are much lower than those in the second stage 35 70 m which is consistent with the results of the simulation test before the 28 caisson sinks stones are not thrown into the riverbed surface the subsidence speed of the riverbed increases rapidly when the subsidence of the caisson exceeds 40 m when the subsidence amount of the caisson is greater than 60 m the caisson is difficult to sink and the settlement of the riverbed is nearly unchanged the 29 caisson dumped a 3 m thick gravel cushion on the riverbed before the caisson was implanted and the settlement of the riverbed changed more evenly than the riverbed settlement of the 28 caisson the settlement of the riverbed surface of the 29 caisson is less than that of the 28 caisson at the same subsidence depth when the depth of subsidence exceeds 45 m mainly because the gravel cushion reduces the effect of flow scouring and renders sand accumulation more obvious the settlement speed increases when the buried depth of the caisson exceeds 65 m after sinking ends the average settlement for the riverbed of the 28 caisson is 0 14 h while the average settlement for the riverbed of the 29 caisson is 0 06 h if the scouring sucking effect is considered these values will increase combined with the model test results one can see that the ratio of side friction resistance to total resistance is small at the initial stage of sinking when the sand at the blade foot is sucked out the contact area between the blade foot and the sand decreases and stress redistribution occurs rapidly in the caisson the contact area of the blade foot increases again after the open caisson breaks ground and sinks to achieve a new stress balance when the caisson sinks to a certain depth stress redistribution increases the side friction resistance and the contact area between the blade foot and the sand continues to decrease because of the difficulty of controlling the suction equipment in a deep water environment further reduction of the contact area to a certain extent is difficult if the side friction resistance still does not reach the limit value the sinking will stop when the position of the suction pipe changes due to the stagnation of sinking the sand outside the open caisson can migrate into the caisson at the place where the reaction force at the blade foot of the caisson is small the caisson may experience sand gushing and sudden sinking after sand gushing and sudden sinking both the reaction force at the blade foot and the side friction resistance decrease rapidly e g jiang and ma 2019a 2019b chu j l 2019 thus when the caisson is in the second half of sinking the sinking speed of the open caisson decreases the riverbed settlement increases the migration speed increases and the sand gushing and sudden sinking times increase 3 5 calculation model of sand migration based on the data for the hydraulic gradient the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure around the blade foot during sinking and combined with the research results in the previous sections the calculation model of sand migration is established the hydraulic gradient curves near the blade foot the time history curves of the blade foot reaction forces and the lateral pressures in the 50 70 cm section are plotted as shown in fig 18 and fig 19 the methods for determining the hydraulic gradient are as follows 1 calculate the horizontal hydraulic gradient from the difference between ky1 1 and the external pore pressure gauge 2 calculate the vertical hydraulic gradient from the difference between ky1 1 and ky2 1 3 superposition vectors 1 and 2 to obtain the hydraulic gradient near the blade foot since the suction pipe is close to the blade foot the hydraulic gradient i calculated by the above method is smaller than the actual hydraulic gradient i at the blade foot set i a i where a is the position coefficient of the hydraulic gradient the subsidence time between 1200 s and 2200 s is analysed by comparing changes in the migration amount and taking measuring point 4 of the sand outside the caisson where the changes in migration amount and migration speed are most obvious as an example the average subsidence speed is 1 2 cm min and the average migration speed is 1 26 cm min throughout the entire sinking process the trend of the hydraulic gradient is basically the same as that of the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure at a similar position a load bearing core soil column is assumed to exist at the lower part of the blade foot tread with a height of z and a width of b 1 tread width when the caisson sinks normally part of the soil in the core soil column area is sucked away the caisson breaks the soil under its own weight and sinks e g jiang and ma 2019b which is defined as progressive migration mode when the suction force increases to a certain value the core soil column can be completely sucked away instantaneously leading to sand gushing or sudden sinking and sand migration increases rapidly which is defined as complete migration mode a stress analysis of the core soil column is carried out as shown in fig 20 the self weight of the core soil column is w and the buoyant unit weight is γ w the seepage force acting on the core soil column is j and the direction is horizontal the coefficient of friction between the core soil column and the blade tread is μ 1 and the coefficient of friction between the core soil column and the lower soil is μ 2 the blade foot reaction force is p 1 the lateral pressure is s and the sinking depth of the caisson is h considering the relaxation effect caused by sand migration e g chu j l 2019 and the extrusion effect caused by subsidence the soil load outside the caisson is simplified and decomposed into uniform load p 2 p 2 γ w h the width is b 2 and a triangular load p 3 p 3 p 2 s k the influence width is b 3 0 65 h if p 3 p 2 s k 0 where k is the lateral pressure coefficient the direction of p 3 is downward the lateral pressure of the soil outside the core soil column is p 4 p 4 k γ w z since the inner sand surface height is small and the suction is loose e g jiang and ma 2019b the influence of the inner sand is not considered assuming that the soil is an isotropic semi infinite body the elastic theory is used to solve the stress distribution under different loads and the stress distribution curve is simplified according to the linear distribution terzaghi k t 1965 mentioned the specific calculation methods and formulas of applying elastic semi infinite body theory and ma j l 2011 summarized the formulas for the deformation of the x y axis then the different stress distributions are superimposed which are calculated according to the methods and formulas mentioned by terzaghi and ma as shown in fig 21 25 and equations 6 19 where σ z is the vertical component under stress σ x is the horizontal component under stress which are numbered for different stresses the ratio of the height of the core soil column to the width of the stress is k for different stresses k i z b i i 1 2 3 which is a dimensionless coefficient 6 σ z 1 x 0 z b 1 k 1 p 1 π 2 arctan 1 2 k 1 16 k 1 3 4 k 1 16 k 1 4 8 k 1 2 1 7 σ x 1 x 0 z b 1 k 1 p 1 π 2

et al 2015 summary of others research achievements let b be the coefficient of migration which is calculated by formula 25 when b 1 the soil in the core soil column area is in a critical state of overall migration 25 b j f 1 f 2 s formula 25 shows the migration coefficient is positively correlated with the seepage force and negatively correlated with the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure at the same time as shown in figs 18 and 19 the seepage force influences the change trends of the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure and is the main factor affecting sand migration taking the period from 2132 to 2210s as an example the hydraulic gradient i increases from 0 09 to 1 1 2186 s extensive sand gushing and sudden sinking occur in the caisson and the blade foot reaction force rj 3 and lateral pressure change substantially assume that when the hydraulic gradient i reaches its maximum value 2186 s the migration coefficient at rj 1 is 1 and overall migration occurs the height of the core soil column is z 0 068 m which is the same as the diameter of the suction pipe relevant values are shown in table 2 below the hydraulic gradient position coefficient a 11 is obtained by substituting the calculation model additionally the seepage force at the tread is close to the suction force at the nozzle of the suction pump since the suction method is reciprocating sweeping suction the distance between the suction pipe and the blade foot tread is constantly changing and is affected by the water flow of the return pipe thus the hydraulic gradient at the blade foot tread is difficult to determine the position coefficient of hydraulic gradient is assumed to be related only to the location of the sand and to be independent of the change in the hydraulic gradient when the suction pipe is subjected to the suction operation thus the transfer coefficient b at other time points can be obtained during the whole sinking process the reaction force at rj 1 is less than that at rj 2 and the reaction force at ty1 1 is less than that at ty1 2 for most of the time therefore the migration coefficients at rj 1 and rj 3 are calculated as shown in fig 25 the hydraulic gradient at rj 3 is the same as that at rj 1 but a gap may exist between them during actual suction from 1200 s to 1250 s the sinking rate of the caisson is 2 0 cm min and the migration rate is 1 5 cm min the migration coefficient b max 0 3 rj 3 and the sinking and migration speeds are higher than the average value from 1250 s to 1340s the subsidence speed is 0 3 cm min and the migration speed is 0 4 cm min the hydraulic gradient changes abruptly and decreases to 0 in 1260 s resulting in stagnation of the seepage flow inside and outside the caisson with b max 0 1 rj 3 sand particles stop moving and subsidence and sand migration are basically stagnated from 1340 s to 1480 s subsidence and sand migration basically stagnate with a subsidence speed of 0 2 cm min and a migration speed of 0 1 cm min b 0 2 rj 3 and remains stable the sinking of the caisson and the migration of sand are basically stagnated from 1480 s to 1550s the caisson starts to sink again with a sinking speed of 1 5 cm min and a migration speed of 1 cm min the hydraulic gradient changes abruptly to 0 60 b max 0 59 1474 s rj 3 and b max 0 44 1481 s rj 1 shortly after the sudden change the sinking speed of the caisson is relatively high and sand gushing and sudden sinking occur in the caisson from 1550 s to 1634 s the sinking speed and migration speed are 0 7 cm min and 0 3 cm min respectively b max 0 1 and subsidence and sand migration are basically stagnated from 1634 s to 1692 s the sinking rate of the caisson is 5 2 cm min which is 4 3 times the average rate and the migration rate is 2 8 cm min b max 0 34 rj 1 and the sinking and migration speeds of the caisson are somewhat fast from 1692 s to 1850s the sinking speed and migration speed are 1 0 cm min and 1 2 cm min respectively b max 0 1 rj 1 and the subsidence speed and migration speed are smaller than the average value from 1850 s to 1972 s the sinking speed of the caisson is 0 2 cm min the migration speed is 0 4 cm min the hydraulic gradient is negative and b max 0 indicating that the caisson migrates from inside to outside but is blocked by the sand outside the caisson subsidence and migration are basically stagnated from 1972 s to 2060 s the caisson sinks slowly but its migration speed increases rapidly the sinking speed of the caisson is 0 8 cm min the migration speed is 5 5 cm min which is 4 4 times the average value b max 0 64 rj 1 and small scale sand gushing occurs at rj 1 because b max 0 2 rj 3 is small the caisson does not undergo sudden sinking from 2060 s to 2132 s the sinking speed and migration speed are 0 7 cm min and 0 9 cm min respectively the migration coefficient b decreases with an average of 0 2 the internal and external channels are reduced due to the end of small scale sand gushing and the decrease in the seepage force and the subsidence speed and migration speed are reduced from 2132 s to 2210 s the sinking speed of the caisson is 4 6 cm min the migration speed is 2 7 cm min and the hydraulic gradient changes to 1 1 2186 s b max 1 rj 1 2186 s b max 0 53 rj 2 2186s and b max 0 28 rj 3 2209s thus large scale sand gushing and sudden sinking occur in the caisson the lateral pressure of the open caisson increases with the decrease in pore water pressure before sudden sinking when the hydraulic gradient increases to 1 1 a large amount of sand outside the caisson pours into the caisson the core soil column area underneath the blade foot is destroyed and the blade foot reaction force of the caisson decreases rapidly the caisson experiences sand gushing and sudden sinking and the lateral pressure of the caisson decreases rapidly due to sand gushing with the sinking of the caisson some sand migration paths are truncated and the sinking and sand migration reach dynamic equilibrium until the caisson sinks as migration proceeds the migration point diffuses to both sides which enlarges the migration area and drives the surrounding sand to migrate the migration coefficient b can appropriately describe the migration behaviour of sand and predict the occurrence of sand gushing and sudden sinking 1 when b 0 2 the migration of sand outside the caisson is less than the average value 2 when 0 2 b 0 3 the migration speed of sand in the caisson is close to the average speed 3 when 0 3 b 0 5 the sand migration speed in the caisson is greater than the average speed 4 when 0 5 b 1 small scale sand gushing and sudden sinking will occur in the open caisson 5 when b 1 large scale sand gushing and sudden sinking will occur in the open caisson determination of coefficient a in this model is based on experiments which is related to sand properties and the permeability coefficient if the soil properties are close to those of the test soil then a reference can be made if the soil properties are different such as clay further studies are needed to determine them because of the complexity of calculation this paper does not calculate the progressive migration model the description of progressive migration is based on the complete migration model of sand which requires further study based on the above analysis the migration of sand outside the caisson is a dynamic problem which is mainly related to the depth of caisson sinking and the horizontal distance between the sand and the outside wall of the caisson at the same time sand migration is affected by the seepage force the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure 4 conclusion based on a simulation test of a large deep water open caisson this paper analyses the spatial migration law of sand outside the caisson and its influencing factors during the sinking process the main conclusions are as follows 1 migration of the sand outside the caisson is mainly related to the depth of the caisson and the spatial position of the sand outside the caisson which is affected by the seepage force the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure of the caisson the migration and range of influence of sand outside the caisson increases with increasing subsidence depth sand migration and the migration speed in the first half stage of sinking are much lower than those in the latter half stage the seepage force is positively correlated with migration while the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure are negatively correlated with migration seepage affects both the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure which are the main factors affecting sand migration 2 a larger vertical distance between the sand and the riverbed corresponds to a smaller migration angle and a more obvious low concave surface of migration for sand within a certain range of the sidewall of the caisson with the same horizontal distance from the caisson sidewall a larger vertical distance from the riverbed corresponds to a greater amount of migration in addition this range decreases with increases in the vertical distance between the sand in the caisson and the riverbed 3 the migration and range of influence of the soil on the long side are greater than those on the short side and the long and short sides influence each other for a caisson with a length width ratio of 1 33 the range of influence of the long side is 0 65 h and the range of influence of the short side is 0 35 h in the direction of the sidewall of the parallel caisson the surface of the soil mass formed by migration is approximately a parabola in the direction of the vertical sidewall the surface of the soil mass formed by soil migration is approximately linear and the angle with the horizontal direction is close to 45 0 5 ϕ the average subsidence of the riverbed for the caisson is 0 15 h which is close to the value for the 28 caisson without considering the scouring sucking effect 4 the sinking rate of the open caisson decreases the migration rate increases and the number of sand gushing and sudden sinking events increases in the second half of sinking the calculation model of migration coefficient b based on force balance can appropriately describe the migration speed of sand and can identify the sand gushing and sudden sinking when 0 5 b 1 small scale sand gushing and sudden sinking will occur when b 1 large scale sand gushing and sudden sinking will occur as migration proceeds the migration point diffuses to both sides and drives the surrounding sand to migrate the conclusions drawn in this paper have important reference value for the design and construction of caissons sinking and can provide experimental support for subsequent research it is found that the seepage force the blade foot reaction force the lateral pressure sand gushing and sudden sinking of the caisson are all related to the sand migration which provide an experimental basis for the establishment of a sand gushing and sudden sinking early warning system however the study in this paper is limited to sandy sand and the migration law for other soils with different properties still requires further study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

large span deep water bridges due to advantages such as their large bearing capacities high stiffnesses high integrities and small settlements e g nonveiller e 1987 tanimoto k 1994 with the rapid development of transportation in recent years china has built a number of large deep water caissons a plane area greater than 2000 m2 and a depth greater than 40 m e g hu z b 2016 tb10093 2017 gb50007 2011 however the base size and sinking depth of such caissons exceed the limit of current design specifications e g tb10093 2017 gb50007 2011 tb10093 2017 gb50007 2011 these caissons sink mainly due to undrained sediment suction which keeps the water level inside and outside the caisson nearly equal and the mixture of soil and water around the blade foot is sucked out by suction pumps causing the caisson to sink due to gravity e g zhang f x 2010 in recent years many studies have investigated suction in caissons e g luke a m 2005 lian j 2014 but few studies have explored the sinking of large deep water open caissons geuguwen yea 2012 studied the force of the blade foot during the sinking process through field experiments chiou j s 2012 analysed a laterally loaded bridge caisson foundation in gravel gerolymos n 2006 zhong and huang 2013 and zafeirakos a 2013 studied the model of the dynamic response of a caisson large deep water open caissons face a series of problems such as slow sinking tilt sand gushing and sudden sinking e g allenby d 2009 sand gushing is a phenomenon in which the mixture of water and sand outside a caisson rapidly migrates to the inside of the caisson and gushes out through the blade foot sudden sinking refers to the unexpected sinking of a caisson without warning during the process of sinking construction according to statistics the total subsidence of the 28 caisson 86 9 58 7 105 m of the hutong bridge in the final subsidence stage was 22 m and the subsidence caused by sand gushing and sudden sinking reached 46 which occurred 30 times while sudden subsidence occurred 19 times e g jiang b n 2016 the key to solving the above problems is to determine the migration regularity of the sand outside a caisson existing studies have not systematically or thoroughly studied the behaviour of sand migration outside large deep water open caissons which leads to blind construction to a certain extent using a submerged caisson mesoscopic test mu b g et al 2014 found that the range of influence of surface subsidence linearly decreases with increasing depth and is funnel shaped in addition a larger caisson size corresponds to a larger funnel radius and more obvious sand migration in the fields of mining and foundation engineering some scholars have studied sand migration phenomena such as gushing of water and sand sui w h 2008 found that a change in pore water pressure near unconsolidated stratum mining has precursory significance for the gushing of water and sand after gushing of water and sand the pore pressure drops sharply and generates instantaneous negative pressure and the hydraulic gradient appears to decline near the mouth of the sand gushing using a microscopic test of the sand piping mechanism yao z x et al 2009 found that the hydraulic gradient suddenly increases leading to agglomeration of local particles in soil samples the sudden increase in pore pressure destroys the soil arching effect in the system and reduces the anti seepage ability of the system in this work we design and complete simulation testing of a large deep water caisson to explore undrained sediment suction induced sinking of open caissons in saturated sand and analyses the influences of caisson depth the spatial position of sand outside the caisson the seepage force the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure on sand migration outside the caisson we then compare the results with measured data from a sinking construction site which provides an experimental reference for engineering and research in related fields 2 general parameters of the model test the experimental model takes the main tower caisson of the largest caisson hutong bridge 89 6 58 7 115 m as the prototype we simulate the same type of open caisson the geological conditions and the construction methods the model size is 120 90 140 cm height and the similarity ratio is approximately 1 70 reflecting a rectangular round shape with an aspect ratio of 1 33 the width of the blade foot is 4 cm and the width and height of the bevel projection are each 10 cm the caisson walls are composed of two spliced layers of 5 mm steel plate with full seam welding for waterproofing the inner and outer walls of the caisson are filled with sand the thickness of the sidewall is 10 15 cm and the middle of the model has a hole with a size of 82 52 cm the weight of the model is 20 kn as shown in fig 1 the bottom of the steel casing and the outer shaft wall of the caisson are punched with a diameter of 2 cm the earth pressure box and the pore water pressure meter are embedded the sensor which has a diameter of 1 9 cm is placed on the surface of the caisson the surface of the sensor is flat with the steel casing and is bonded with welding adhesive cracks are waterproofed using neutral silica gel the sensor wire is drawn from the inside of the steel casing to the top of the caisson and then connected to a data acquisition box along the test tank ten bwx strain earth pressure sensors each with a range of 200 kpa are buried at the blade foot the number of sensors and buried positions are shown in fig 2 the sidewall of the caisson is divided into 6 sections by height and each section has 10 measuring points including 7 measuring points for earth pressure 42 points in total and 3 measuring points for pore water pressure 18 points in total taking the south sidewall and section 1 as an example the number and burial layout are shown in fig 3 the effective stress of each measured point is the difference between the measured earth pressure and the pore water pressure the pore water pressure on the eastern side is identical to that on the western side the measuring range of the earth pressure box at sections 1 2 and 3 is 50 kpa and the measuring range at sections 4 5 and 6 is 30 kpa the measuring range of the pore water pressure meter is 50 kpa the measured value of the sensor is the reading during the test minus the initial reading the size of the test slot is 4 5 4 5 3 m and a sand cushion of approximately 15 cm is laid at the bottom of the slot then two 13 m 13 m layers of pvc tarpaulin with thicknesses of 0 5 cm are laid to isolate water the sand is filled into four layers in this test and each layer is 0 5 m high the physical parameters of the sand used in the test are shown in table 1 the distribution curve of grain size is shown in fig 4 which represents for medium coarse sand after the filling is completed the caisson is statically placed on the surface of the sand for a period of time until the pore water pressure remain stable and the test sand is fully saturated water is added to the examined slot until the level of liquid is higher than the level of sand before the test the examined sand is saturated fully for 3 days water is added to 0 1 m above the surface of the sand before the test a keyence il 1000 laser displacement meter keyence china co ltd shanghai china is set at the top of the corner of the caisson to measure the dynamic subsidence of the caisson and two inclinometers are set at the middle points of the sidewalls on both sides to observe the posture of the caisson three groups of pore pressure meters with a spacing of 20 cm are buried 45 cm from the middle of the sidewall of the caisson on the south west and north sides the location of the pore pressure meter is fixed to prevent the influence of migration of sand mass on the process of sinking and the hydraulic gradient around the caisson is measured jointly by the pore pressure meters on the sidewall as shown in fig 5 a triangular bracket is arranged on the south side of the tested slot and a sliding rail is fixed on one side of the bracket four displacement meters each with a range of 25 cm are fixed on the slider and are labelled no 4 through no 7 the distances between the displacement meters and the caisson are 15 cm 25 cm 40 cm and 55 cm the slider can be moved up and down when the bottom of the displacement meter is touched with a slender hollow aluminium rod it can be flexed the length of the slender hollow aluminium rods are 90 cm 70 cm and 50 cm and are inserted 30 cm before the test a round gasket with a diameter of 2 cm is set at the bottom of the aluminium rods to prevent them from excessively drilling the aluminium bars can undergo lateral displacement with the sand which prevents excessive deflection of the aluminium bars at the ends on the other side of the bracket three displacement meters each with a range of 25 cm are installed and are labelled no 1 through no 3 their distances from the caisson are 15 cm 30 cm and 50 cm the displacement meters are touching the surface of the sand after insertion of a cork mat a transversely rotating roller is arranged between the displacement meters and the support to ensure that the displacement meters can rotate with migration of the sand a micro inclinometer is fixed to each displacement meter to measure its rotation angle as shown in fig 6 a solid liquid circulation system is used to control the caisson during undrained sediment suction sinking the system consists of two pumps each with 4 kw power flow 35 m 3 h water height 12 m and two tanks with a volume of 1 5 m³ the diameter of sand extraction pipe is 6 8 cm a sand pump pumps the sand water mixture from the hole in the caisson into the water tank after being filtered the water is pumped back into the caisson by another pump the sand pump uses a frequency converter to control its speed valves are installed at the inlet and outlet ports to ensure that the level of liquid inside and outside the caisson remains the same a frame table is set at the bottom of the tested slot and the top surface of the table is at the same level as the fill surface such that the additional stress produced by the operator is reduced the overall layout of the test is shown in fig 7 first water is poured into the pump and sand pipe to drain the air before the test then the inlet and outlet valves of the sand extraction pipe are closed after filling with water next the valve and sand suction pump are opened after inserting the caisson to establish solid liquid circulation the pump must be adjusted to the appropriate rotational speed after the suction began the caisson sank under gravity to ensure the effective operation of each system the subsidence debugging stage is found 30 cm from the surface of the soil to the burial depth to ensure the success of the test solid liquid circulation must be established in the commissioning stage and the speed of the sand pump must be appropriately set the sand pump is allowed to pause and start multiple times during the debugging stage after debugging the caisson will remain static for half an hour before sinking and then data recording begins to ensure that the seepage effect during the debugging stage does not affect the formal test the reciprocating sweeping suction method is adopted in accordance with the actual project the frequencies of the micro inclinometer on the displacement meter and horizontal displacement monitoring of the aluminium rods are 1 time point per minute while the other sensors run at 1 hz when the caisson reaches a predetermined height the test is terminated as shown in fig 8 3 the regularity of sand migration outside the caisson due to failure of the sand pumps in the middle of the test the test was divided into two times and the speed of the pumps during the two times remained the same the first stage lasted 1342 s the subsidence was 53 4 cm and the average speed of subsidence was 2 39 cm min the second stage lasted 855 s the subsidence was 19 1 cm and the average speed of subsidence was 1 34 cm min the total depth of subsidence was 72 5 cm and the final sinking depth of the caisson was 102 cm the sinking curve in this experiment is compared with jiang and ma 2019b as shown in fig 9 in the two experiments except for the soil compactness caused by the filling although the soil migration measurement points are not set in the test by jiang the other conditions are basically the same although differences exist in the sinking curve the curve form is basically the same and the sinking rate decreases in the late sinking stage in jiang s test the sinking of the caisson is faster but the total amount of sinking is slightly smaller therefore the impact of the failure of the sand pump on the test results is negligible sand gushing is a phenomenon in which the mixture of water and sand outside a caisson rapidly migrates to the inside of the caisson and gushes out through the blade foot which is confirmed by the instant increase in the turbidity of the water inside the caisson at the same time due to the increase in the amount of instantaneous sand absorption the contact of the suction pipe and the sound inside the pipe also change to ensure the continuity of the test the inner sand surface is not measured after sand gushing occurs after sinking the water in the tested slot is discharged to expose the riverbed the relevant data of the riverbed and the sand surface in the caisson are measured the sand outside the caisson is excavated to assess the data from the displacement meter as shown in fig 10 3 1 dynamic analysis of sand migration outside the caisson the changes in the riverbed surface and soil displacement meters outside the caisson with subsidence of the caisson are shown in fig 11 the displacement data represent the sinking depth at the middle point of the side where the sensor is located no 7 showed no obvious change throughout the test fig 11 shows that with increasing subsidence the overall amount of migration of sand outside the caisson shows an increasing trend the amount and average speed of sand migration in the first stage 0 35 cm are substantially lower than those in the second stage 35 70 cm the trend of the migration speed at the measured points outside the caisson is basically the same at the same vertical height a closer measuring point to the caisson corresponds to a greater migration amount and a higher speed in the same period the difference between the migration amount and migration speed is considerable indicating that the migration of the sand outside the caisson is related to the depth and the horizontal distance between the sand and the caisson in the section of subsidence between 0 and 50 cm the average subsidence speed of the caisson is greater than 2 5 cm min and the subsidence varies evenly the change rules for sand migration and subsidence are basically the same and the migration speed is 0 4 cm min in the section of subsidence between 50 and 70 cm the average subsidence speed of the caisson is low at 1 2 cm min which is 50 of the speed in the section between 0 and 50 cm in addition the sediment change is not even sand migration is large and complex and the average migration speed is 1 26 cm min which is more than 3 times the speed in the section between 0 and 50 cm the time history curve of the displacement of the measured points in the section between 50 and 70 cm of the subsidence is shown in fig 12 by comparing the caisson subsidence curves with the displacement change in the sand measured points one can see that when the subsidence speed of the caisson is high the migration speed is high however when the subsidence speed of the caisson is low the migration speed of the measured points is also low from 1972 s to 2050 s the subsidence rate of the caisson is low while the rate of sand migration is very high indicating that sand migration is also related to other factors in this paper the law of sand migration is analysed in combination with the hydraulic gradient around the outer sidewall the blade foot pressure and the lateral earth pressure 3 2 the sand migration track outside the caisson the track of migration for the measured points can be obtained after sinking the fixed point of the riverbed is 65 cm away from the caisson wall and the fixed point of the sand at 30 cm below the riverbed is 55 cm away from the caisson wall thus the range of influence of this sinking can be obtained the track of migration and the range of influence of the subsidence are shown in fig 13 when the sand at the inner bottom of the blade foot is sucked out the sand at the outer side moves horizontally to the inside and the sand outside the caisson moves obliquely downward at a certain angle determined by the spatial position of the blade foot for sand the migration angle of the measured points on the riverbed is 70 the angle between the migration track and the horizontal direction and the migration angle of the sand in the caisson is 65 a larger vertical distance between the sand in the caisson and the riverbed corresponds to a smaller migration angle after the surface of the riverbed migrates the measured points are mainly upper concave curves while the internal measured points are lower concave curves indicating that the migration channel is close to the sidewall of the caisson a closer blade foot corresponds to more obvious migration according to the migration angle and the surface after migrating the migration amount of the sand on the riverbed is the same as that under the riverbed in other words within a 27 cm range of the sidewall the migration amount of the riverbed is less than the migration amount of sand in addition if the depth of the sand in the caisson increases the range will be less than 27 cm within a certain range of the sidewall and with the same horizontal distance from the sidewall a greater vertical distance from the riverbed corresponds to a greater amount of migration in addition this range decreases with the increase in the vertical distance between the sand in the caisson and the riverbed combined with section 3 1 sand migration is found to be related to the horizontal distance between the sand in the caisson and the vertical distance of the riverbed that is to the plane position of the sand using a combination of these data and the phenomena found in mu bao gang et al 2014 the range of influence of sinking for a caisson on the surrounding sand is given via nonlinear fitting the distribution of broken lines can be adopted in engineering for simplification the boundary influenced by the riverbed surface is 0 65 h and the boundary influenced at 0 3 h below the riverbed surface is 0 55 h where h is the depth of the caisson 3 3 the spatial effect of sand migration outside the caisson the discussion in the above two sections is based on the vertical section where the displacement meter is located that is the migration law of sand at the middle point of the long edge of the caisson however the sinking of the caisson is a spatial problem and the migration of sand on different sides also varies after the test the settlement and range of influence of all riverbed sand are measured and counted as shown in figs 14 and 15 the inside rectangle is the caisson plane and the outside arc is the influence range of the subsidence on the surface of the riverbed based on the above analysis the migration amount and influence range of the sand outside the caisson may be related to the length of the side of the caisson the displacement and range of influence of the sand at the long side are greater than those at the short side the long side and short side both influence each other and the displacement and influence range at the west side of the caisson are greater than those at the east side according to the data for the sand surface the average surface depth for sand on the north and south sides of the caisson is greater than the values on the east and west sides that is the blade foot is more likely to be empty and sand migration occurs the influence boundary on the short side is 0 35 h which is smaller than the value of 0 65 h on the long side in the direction of the parallel sidewall of the caisson from section 1 1 the curved surface formed by sand migration is approximately parabolic and the average angle between the line from the vertex to the riverbed boundary and the horizontal direction is approximately 18 the average settlement of the caisson riverbed is 0 15 h which is close to the value for the 28 caisson without considering the effect of the erosion of sand in the direction of the vertical sidewall of the caisson the average slope at the middle point of the sidewall is 0 44 according to sections 2 2 and 3 3 and the angle between the sidewall and the horizontal direction is close to 45 0 5 ϕ which is the controlled rupture angle of the slope stability 3 4 field measurement comparison the average settlement of the riverbed close to the outer wall is shown in figs 16 and 17 the construction time for 28 and 29 caissons is approximately 480 days the sinking time is 207 days and the average sinking speed is 0 34 m d when the caisson does not sink the average scour is 1 m year for the 28 caisson bed and 0 4 m year for the 29 caisson bed when sinking the scouring action is more obvious because the sand sucked out during construction is scattered on the surface of the riverbed but the scouring speed is lower than the speed of sand suction thus the surface of the riverbed is uplifted in the early stage of sinking which is called the scouring sucking effect the average settlement of the riverbed rises with increasing caisson settlement the subsidence amount and subsidence speed in the first stage 0 35 m are much lower than those in the second stage 35 70 m which is consistent with the results of the simulation test before the 28 caisson sinks stones are not thrown into the riverbed surface the subsidence speed of the riverbed increases rapidly when the subsidence of the caisson exceeds 40 m when the subsidence amount of the caisson is greater than 60 m the caisson is difficult to sink and the settlement of the riverbed is nearly unchanged the 29 caisson dumped a 3 m thick gravel cushion on the riverbed before the caisson was implanted and the settlement of the riverbed changed more evenly than the riverbed settlement of the 28 caisson the settlement of the riverbed surface of the 29 caisson is less than that of the 28 caisson at the same subsidence depth when the depth of subsidence exceeds 45 m mainly because the gravel cushion reduces the effect of flow scouring and renders sand accumulation more obvious the settlement speed increases when the buried depth of the caisson exceeds 65 m after sinking ends the average settlement for the riverbed of the 28 caisson is 0 14 h while the average settlement for the riverbed of the 29 caisson is 0 06 h if the scouring sucking effect is considered these values will increase combined with the model test results one can see that the ratio of side friction resistance to total resistance is small at the initial stage of sinking when the sand at the blade foot is sucked out the contact area between the blade foot and the sand decreases and stress redistribution occurs rapidly in the caisson the contact area of the blade foot increases again after the open caisson breaks ground and sinks to achieve a new stress balance when the caisson sinks to a certain depth stress redistribution increases the side friction resistance and the contact area between the blade foot and the sand continues to decrease because of the difficulty of controlling the suction equipment in a deep water environment further reduction of the contact area to a certain extent is difficult if the side friction resistance still does not reach the limit value the sinking will stop when the position of the suction pipe changes due to the stagnation of sinking the sand outside the open caisson can migrate into the caisson at the place where the reaction force at the blade foot of the caisson is small the caisson may experience sand gushing and sudden sinking after sand gushing and sudden sinking both the reaction force at the blade foot and the side friction resistance decrease rapidly e g jiang and ma 2019a 2019b chu j l 2019 thus when the caisson is in the second half of sinking the sinking speed of the open caisson decreases the riverbed settlement increases the migration speed increases and the sand gushing and sudden sinking times increase 3 5 calculation model of sand migration based on the data for the hydraulic gradient the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure around the blade foot during sinking and combined with the research results in the previous sections the calculation model of sand migration is established the hydraulic gradient curves near the blade foot the time history curves of the blade foot reaction forces and the lateral pressures in the 50 70 cm section are plotted as shown in fig 18 and fig 19 the methods for determining the hydraulic gradient are as follows 1 calculate the horizontal hydraulic gradient from the difference between ky1 1 and the external pore pressure gauge 2 calculate the vertical hydraulic gradient from the difference between ky1 1 and ky2 1 3 superposition vectors 1 and 2 to obtain the hydraulic gradient near the blade foot since the suction pipe is close to the blade foot the hydraulic gradient i calculated by the above method is smaller than the actual hydraulic gradient i at the blade foot set i a i where a is the position coefficient of the hydraulic gradient the subsidence time between 1200 s and 2200 s is analysed by comparing changes in the migration amount and taking measuring point 4 of the sand outside the caisson where the changes in migration amount and migration speed are most obvious as an example the average subsidence speed is 1 2 cm min and the average migration speed is 1 26 cm min throughout the entire sinking process the trend of the hydraulic gradient is basically the same as that of the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure at a similar position a load bearing core soil column is assumed to exist at the lower part of the blade foot tread with a height of z and a width of b 1 tread width when the caisson sinks normally part of the soil in the core soil column area is sucked away the caisson breaks the soil under its own weight and sinks e g jiang and ma 2019b which is defined as progressive migration mode when the suction force increases to a certain value the core soil column can be completely sucked away instantaneously leading to sand gushing or sudden sinking and sand migration increases rapidly which is defined as complete migration mode a stress analysis of the core soil column is carried out as shown in fig 20 the self weight of the core soil column is w and the buoyant unit weight is γ w the seepage force acting on the core soil column is j and the direction is horizontal the coefficient of friction between the core soil column and the blade tread is μ 1 and the coefficient of friction between the core soil column and the lower soil is μ 2 the blade foot reaction force is p 1 the lateral pressure is s and the sinking depth of the caisson is h considering the relaxation effect caused by sand

the core soil column is p 4 p 4 k γ w z since the inner sand surface height is small and the suction is loose e g jiang and ma 2019b the influence of the inner sand is not considered assuming that the soil is an isotropic semi infinite body the elastic theory is used to solve the stress distribution under different loads and the stress distribution curve is simplified according to the linear distribution terzaghi k t 1965 mentioned the specific calculation methods and formulas of applying elastic semi infinite body theory and ma j l 2011 summarized the formulas for the deformation of the x y axis then the different stress distributions are superimposed which are calculated according to the methods and formulas mentioned by terzaghi and ma as shown in fig 21 25 and equations 6 19 where σ z is the vertical component under stress σ x is the horizontal component under stress which are numbered for different stresses the ratio of the height of the core soil column to the width of the

et al 2015 summary of others research achievements let b be the coefficient of migration which is calculated by formula 25 when b 1 the soil in the core soil column area is in a critical state of overall migration 25 b j f 1 f 2 s formula 25 shows the migration coefficient is positively correlated with the seepage force and negatively correlated with the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure at the same time as shown in figs 18 and 19 the seepage force influences the change trends of the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure and is the main factor affecting sand migration taking the period from 2132 to 2210s as an example the hydraulic gradient i increases from 0 09 to 1 1 2186 s extensive sand gushing and sudden sinking occur in the caisson and the blade foot reaction force rj 3 and lateral pressure change substantially assume that when the hydraulic gradient i reaches its maximum value 2186 s the migration coefficient at rj 1 is 1 and overall migration occurs the height of the core soil column is z 0 068 m which is the same as the diameter of the suction pipe relevant values are shown in table 2 below the hydraulic gradient position coefficient a 11 is obtained by substituting the calculation model additionally the seepage force at the tread is close to the suction force at the nozzle of the suction pump since the suction method is reciprocating sweeping suction the distance between the suction pipe and the blade foot tread is constantly changing and is affected by the water flow of the return pipe thus the hydraulic gradient at the blade foot tread is difficult to determine the position coefficient of hydraulic gradient is assumed to be related only to the location of the sand and to be independent of the change in the hydraulic gradient when the suction pipe is subjected to the suction operation thus the transfer coefficient b at other time points can be obtained during the whole sinking process the reaction force at rj 1 is less than that at rj 2 and the reaction force at ty1 1 is less than that at ty1 2 for most of the time therefore the migration coefficients at rj 1 and rj 3 are calculated as shown in fig 25 the hydraulic gradient at rj 3 is the same as that at rj 1 but a gap may exist between them during actual suction from 1200 s to 1250 s the sinking rate of the caisson is 2 0 cm min and the migration rate is 1 5 cm min the migration coefficient b max 0 3 rj 3 and the sinking and migration speeds are higher than the average value from 1250 s to 1340s the subsidence speed is 0 3 cm min and the migration speed is 0 4 cm min the hydraulic gradient changes abruptly and decreases to 0 in 1260 s resulting in stagnation of the seepage flow inside and outside the caisson with b max 0 1 rj 3 sand particles stop moving and subsidence and sand migration are basically stagnated from 1340 s to 1480 s subsidence and sand migration basically stagnate with a subsidence speed of 0 2 cm min and a migration speed of 0 1 cm min b 0 2 rj 3 and remains stable the sinking of the caisson and the migration of sand are basically stagnated from 1480 s to 1550s the caisson starts to sink again with a sinking speed of 1 5 cm min and a migration speed of 1 cm min the hydraulic gradient changes abruptly to 0 60 b max 0 59 1474 s rj 3 and b max 0 44 1481 s rj 1 shortly after the sudden change the sinking speed of the caisson is relatively high and sand gushing and sudden sinking occur in the caisson from 1550 s to 1634 s the sinking speed and migration speed are 0 7 cm min and 0 3 cm min respectively b max 0 1 and subsidence and sand migration are basically stagnated from 1634 s to 1692 s the sinking rate of the caisson is 5 2 cm min which is 4 3 times the average rate and the migration rate is 2 8 cm min b max 0 34 rj 1 and the sinking and migration speeds of the caisson are somewhat fast from 1692 s to 1850s the sinking speed and migration speed are 1 0 cm min and 1 2 cm min respectively b max 0 1 rj 1 and the subsidence speed and migration speed are smaller than the average value from 1850 s to 1972 s the sinking speed of the caisson is 0 2 cm min the migration speed is 0 4 cm min the hydraulic gradient is negative and b max 0 indicating that the caisson migrates from inside to outside but is blocked by the sand outside the caisson subsidence and migration are basically stagnated from 1972 s to 2060 s the caisson sinks slowly but its migration speed increases rapidly the sinking speed of the caisson is 0 8 cm min the migration speed is 5 5 cm min which is 4 4 times the average value b max 0 64 rj 1 and small scale sand gushing occurs at rj 1 because b max 0 2 rj 3 is small the caisson does not undergo sudden sinking from 2060 s to 2132 s the sinking speed and migration speed are 0 7 cm min and 0 9 cm min respectively the migration coefficient b decreases with an average of 0 2 the internal and external channels are reduced due to the end of small scale sand gushing and the decrease in the seepage force and the subsidence speed and migration speed are reduced from 2132 s to 2210 s the sinking speed of the caisson is 4 6 cm min the migration speed is 2 7 cm min and the hydraulic gradient changes to 1 1 2186 s b max 1 rj 1 2186 s b max 0 53 rj 2 2186s and b max 0 28 rj 3 2209s thus large scale sand gushing and sudden sinking occur in the caisson the lateral pressure of the open caisson increases with the decrease in pore water pressure before sudden sinking when the hydraulic gradient increases to 1 1 a large amount of sand outside the caisson pours into the caisson the core soil column area underneath the blade foot is destroyed and the blade foot reaction force of the caisson decreases rapidly the caisson experiences sand gushing and sudden sinking and the lateral pressure of the caisson decreases rapidly due to sand gushing with the sinking of the caisson some sand migration paths are truncated and the sinking and sand migration reach dynamic equilibrium until the caisson sinks as migration proceeds the migration point diffuses to both sides which enlarges the migration area and drives the surrounding sand to migrate the migration coefficient b can appropriately describe the migration behaviour of sand and predict the occurrence of sand gushing and sudden sinking 1 when b 0 2 the migration of sand outside the caisson is less than the average value 2 when 0 2 b 0 3 the migration speed of sand in the caisson is close to the average speed 3 when 0 3 b 0 5 the sand migration speed in the caisson is greater than the average speed 4 when 0 5 b 1 small scale sand gushing and sudden sinking will occur in the open caisson 5 when b 1 large scale sand gushing and sudden sinking will occur in the open caisson determination of coefficient a in this model is based on experiments which is related to sand properties and the permeability coefficient if the soil properties are close to those of the test soil then a reference can be made if the soil properties are different such as clay further studies are needed to determine them because of the complexity of calculation this paper does not calculate the progressive migration model the description of progressive migration is based on the complete migration model of sand which requires further study based on the above analysis the migration of sand outside the caisson is a dynamic problem which is mainly related to the depth of caisson sinking and the horizontal distance between the sand and the outside wall of the caisson at the same time sand migration is affected by the seepage force the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure 4 conclusion based on a simulation test of a large deep water open caisson this paper analyses the spatial migration law of sand outside the caisson and its influencing factors during the sinking process the main conclusions are as follows 1 migration of the sand outside the caisson is mainly related to the depth of the caisson and the spatial position of the sand outside the caisson which is affected by the seepage force the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure of the caisson the migration and range of influence of sand outside the caisson increases with increasing subsidence depth sand migration and the migration speed in the first half stage of sinking are much lower than those in the latter half stage the seepage force is positively correlated with migration while the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure are negatively correlated with migration seepage affects both the blade foot reaction force and the lateral pressure which are the main factors affecting sand migration 2 a larger vertical distance between the sand and the riverbed corresponds to a smaller migration angle and a more obvious low concave surface of migration for sand within a certain range of the sidewall of the caisson with the same horizontal distance from the caisson sidewall a larger vertical distance from the riverbed corresponds to a greater amount of migration in addition this range decreases with increases in the vertical distance between the sand in the caisson and the riverbed 3 the migration and range of influence of the soil on the long side are greater than those on the short side and the long and short sides influence each other for a caisson with a length width ratio of 1 33 the range of influence of the long side is 0 65 h and the range of influence of the short side is 0 35 h in the direction of the sidewall of the parallel caisson the surface of the soil mass formed by migration is approximately a parabola in the direction of the vertical sidewall the surface of the soil mass formed by soil migration is approximately linear and the angle with the horizontal direction is close to 45 0 5 ϕ the average subsidence of the riverbed for the caisson is 0 15 h which is close to the value for the 28 caisson without considering the scouring sucking effect 4 the sinking rate of the open caisson decreases the migration rate increases and the number of sand gushing and sudden sinking events increases in the second half of sinking the calculation model of migration coefficient b based on force balance can appropriately describe the migration speed of sand and can identify the sand gushing and sudden sinking when 0 5 b 1 small scale sand gushing and sudden sinking will occur when b 1 large scale sand gushing and sudden sinking will occur as migration proceeds the migration point diffuses to both sides and drives the surrounding sand to migrate the conclusions drawn in this paper have important reference value for the design and construction of caissons sinking and can provide experimental support for subsequent research it is found that the seepage force the blade foot reaction force the lateral pressure sand gushing and sudden sinking of the caisson are all related to the sand migration which provide an experimental basis for the establishment of a sand gushing and sudden sinking early warning system however the study in this paper is limited to sandy sand and the migration law for other soils with different properties still requires further study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

22341,nowadays the service life monitoring of mooring lines attracts more and more attention from the marine renewable energy mre industry where developers desire to have a closer look on the safety margin besides current standards are also being improved in order to ensure safe and cost effective design for mre devices in the present study we believe that monitoring and modeling should be implemented in parallel in order to better estimate the actual state and the reliability of the system during the expected service life besides it is crucial to clarify the mechanic of the mooring line responses to understand why and how they are modified during deployment and how those can be accounted for in order to update the actual fatigue damage and predict the remaining allowable service life of system a comprehensive modeling and service life monitoring methodology for mooring lines of floating wind turbines fwts is discussed by the authors based on the reliability approach critical factors that influence structural behaviors such as material deterioration and marine environmental factors involved are identified and accounted for in this reliability monitoring basis ultimately based on the reliability level estimated decisions regarding required maintenance or replacement of lines can be made keywords floating wind turbine service life monitoring reliability mooring line fls uls 1 introduction the modeling and monitoring of offshore mooring lines require a sound understanding of both the relating mechanical behaviors of all the mooring components i e load strain behaviors breaking strength critical modes of failure etc and the marine environmental factors i e environmental loading corrosion abrasion colonization of marine species etc that influence such behaviors the design of offshore mooring lines are often checked against three limit states dnv os e301 2010 ultimate limit state uls where the maximum tension in the lines is designed to remain below the minimum breaking strength of the mooring components a good estimate of the working tension is therefore mandatory for a reliable design it also means that in order to perform a detailed mooring design the mechanical properties i e load strain properties breaking strength etc of all the mooring components and the relating deterioration factors must be well understood fatigue limit state fls where mooring lines are designed for a certain service life usually between 20 and 25 years for fwts the fatigue life of a mooring line is affected by not only the mechanical fatigue behaviors of the materials composing that line but also the material deterioration due to the marine environmental factors accident limit state als where the mooring lines are designed with a certain redundancy in order to ensure their capability of surviving against the failure of one mooring line the previous issues have been subjects of a large amount of research work aqdam et al 2018 xue et al 2018 wu et al 2015 ma et al 2013 investigated several accidental events in permanent mooring systems and found that many line failures occurred in early service years of mooring lines even if fatigue is generally the dominant cause gryphon incident finucane 2012 teaches us a case of failure due to a combination of failure of heading control and overload moreover the failure mechanisms have surprised the industry experts a limit number of known failures for mooring lines of marine renewable energy devices e g oceanlinx in 2010 and wavedragon in 2004 has been discussed by christensen et al 2005 but the reasons of failure stay still unclear brindley et al 2014 stressed that only strength requirements do not fully reflect the system reliability pham et al 2004 pham 2018 studied the interaction between the reliability in the uls and fls according to their conclusions the total reliability should be considered either by multiplying the reliability of the two design criteria for the reliability in the uls case or by adding the fatigue damage caused by extreme sea states that might probably occur at any point during the expected service life of structures for the reliability in the fls case unlike o g platforms mre devices are generally small compared to the incident wave length and thus complex motions may occur which may be large if the system response is resonant weller et al 2013 moreover strong coupling between the device and mooring system is usually observed for the floatgen project that the present case study is based on nylon is used as a principal mooring component and the modeling of mooring responses lacks validation it is mainly due to the non linear load elongation behaviors and fatigue characteristics of nylon mooring ropes that can not be captured following the same testing and modeling procedures for polyester as recommended by the current oil gas o g standards thies et al 2014 proposed other than numerical modeling an alternative approach to predict fatigue damage using directly in situ load measurements their approach has been concluded to allow a better fatigue assessment and an optimization of safety factors at the design state where on site measurements are available also the approach can be used for the in situ monitoring in order to predict the fatigue damage and the remaining service life of the structure during deployment however the authors believe that only load measurements are not enough to characterize the actual state of mooring lines that actually includes the likely modified mooring line mechanical behaviors e g strength and stiffness reduction etc due to material loss gao et al 2005 liu et al 2015 modified mass and hydrodynamic damping due to biofouling and other marine environmental factors e g corrosion wear etc these mechanical behaviors of mooring materials and marine environmental factors should be fully understood and accounted for indeed it is vital to clarify the mechanic of the mooring line responses to understand why and how they might be modified during deployment and how those can be accounted for in order to update the actual fatigue damage and predict the remaining allowable service life of the system that is why in our opinion modeling and monitoring should be implemented in parallel in order to better control and update the actual state of mooring lines better estimate the fatigue damage and reliability of the system during deployment based on that decisions regarding required maintenance or replacement of lines can be made the present modeling and service life monitoring methodology for mooring lines of fwts is based on the reliability approach the methodology is applied in the following for the ultimate limit state uls in order to check if the mooring lines can still sustain the design extreme load case after years of operation also by applying the methodology for the fatigue limit state fls the remaining allowable service life can be predicted based on the information obtained from the previous operating years furthermore the present methodology can also be considered for a more detailed mooring design once the information from similar structures projects sites etc are known the defined case study is inspired from the hybrid mooring lines of the 2 mw fwt installed at the sem rev test site since 2017 as part of the fp7 eu floatgen project pham et al 2019 berhault 2017 spraul et al 2017 berhault et al 2016 we focus on the mechanical behaviors of two mooring components i e chain and nylon the material deterioration during operation and the marine environmental factors that influence such behaviors once the previously mentioned information is fully understood and accounted for the reliability following the service life of mooring lines can be better predicted the corresponding level of reliability is then used to decide whether maintenance or replacement of lines is necessary the floatgen fwt s principal mooring components and the orcaflex model of its hybrid mooring lines connected to the floater are illustrated in fig 1 in which a line composed of top and bottom chains with a nylon section in between a similar floating structure and mooring configuration have been published by spraul et al 2017 pham et al 2019 based on the publically available information from ideol and the ecole centrale de nantes berhault 2017 the hydrodynamic database is calculated by hydrostar bureau veritas 2016 however ones should be aware that the floater and mooring characteristics used in this study are selected only for the study purpose and are not representative of the ideol s real floating structure and the floatgen s mooring system 2 mechanical behaviors of mooring components for the modeling and monitoring of mooring lines in order to apply the present methodology on the mooring lines of the fwt mentioned above this section will briefly discuss the mechanical behaviors of two mooring components i e chain and nylon and the marine environmental factors that influence such behaviors 1 1 chain with more than 50 000 tons in service according to the data from j fernández and storesund 2014 a huge effort has been putting on studying the characteristics and behaviors of chain mooring lines the outcomes of several jips have been integrated to the offshore standards such as api rp 2sk 2005 dnv os e301 2010 bureau veritas guidance note ni 493 2015 etc together with wire rope and connector e g shackles h link etc chain make one of the top three components that caused most incidents in mooring lines some failure mechanisms are listed by ma et al 2013 such as out of plane bending opb chain hockling flawed flash welds pitting corrosion etc therefore it is vital to understand all these mechanisms in order to identify the potential weak points of the lines why and how the structural responses are modified during operation and finally how to consider them in strength and fatigue design in the present study in order to illustrate how the service life monitoring methodology can be applied we focus on the corrosion of chains due to the marine environment as this phenomenon can lead to significant loss of material and likely modified mooring responses indeed experiences from the oil gas industry show several mooring line failures due to the fatigue damage induced by the crack propagation which can be accelerated by corrosion in marine environment and wear between chain links or at connection points lardier and moan 2008 corrosion results in the reduction of steel surface variation in residual stresses therefore influences both strength and fatigue design of mooring lines corrosion in sea water of chains is a complex phenomenon since it depends on both the mooring material properties and the marine environment characteristics the composition of sea water temperature salinity dissolved oxygen etc most of corrosion models are simply based on a constant rate of corrosion for instances api rp 2sk 2005 recommends an industry practice to increase the chain diameter in the splash zone and the dip or thrash zone on hard bottom by 0 2 0 4 mm year this increasing diameter is reduced to 0 1 0 2 mm year for the remaining length bureau veritas guidance note ni 493 2015 requires a 0 4 mm years of corrosion and wear allowance for the chain section in splash zone and the bottom length and 0 3 mm year in the remaining length dnv os e301 2010 recommends considering a corrosion rate of 0 4 mm year in chain diameter in the catenary and bottom parts and a higher rate of 0 8 mm year for the splash zone melchers et al 2007 proposed a probabilistic model for fully submerged chains with the mean value of corrosion rate about 0 44 mm year with a standard deviation of 0 1 mm year schoefs et al 2009 suggested an inspection model of the steel loss in view to account for the variability of the corrosion rate with time 1 2 nylon for pilot farms of floating wind turbines fwts in shallow water between 50 m and 100 m the application of nylon as a mooring component can provide a more cost effective design indeed nylon is a preferred candidate over polyester for fwt mooring because of its lower stiffness and a corresponding capacity of reducing maximum tensions in the mooring system the use of nylon has however not been well proven appropriate for permanent mooring application due to its poor wet fatigue characteristics the main mechanisms of fatigue for synthetic ropes are creep hysteresis heating internal abrasion axial compression etc hearle et al 1993 parsey 1982 it is believed that hysteresis heating is not a concern for offshore mooring applications where ropes remain under water throughout its service life likewise the axial compression fatigue affects only stiff fibers such as aramid thus should not be a concern for nylon however the design practice for polyester mooring lines recommended by bureau veritas ni 432 2007 is to keep the minimum tension not lower than 2 of minimum breaking strength mbs to avoid axial compression fatigue the internal abrasion and creep therefore remain two critical fatigue modes for nylon ropes creep is a static fatigue damage mode that ropes fail after a certain duration of time at a constant tension creep is either recoverable primary creep at low tension or non recoverable secondary creep at high tension the latter is relevant to creep fatigue failure of fiber ropes creep fatigue failure can be critical for typical nylon that might fail in less than 5 h being tensioned at 80 of its breaking strength mckenna et al 2004 for wet nylon 66 the creep process is the dominating fatigue mechanism for load levels above 30 its breaking strength for cyclic loading the creep effect is the same as if the peak load i e maximum load has been applied continuously the creep fatigue mechanism is independent of the frequency of loading and can be predicted by the linear relationship between the maximum load and the log time to failure in second creep effect doesn t lead to the reduction of strength of ropes at least up to 75 80 of the fatigue life time mandell 1987 mandell et al 1987 internal abrasion is a dynamic fatigue damage mode that the rope fails after a certain number of cycles under cyclic loading internal abrasion is caused by relative motions between strands which are directly related to the tension range and inversely related to the mean tension therefore it can be concluded that the severity of internal abrasion is directly related to the tension amplitude and inversely related to the mean tension flory et al 2006 internal abrasion is a serious problem for highly structured wet nylon ropes at moderate tension mckenna et al 2004 severe internal abrasion can lead to significant loss of strength of ropes and therefore might modify mooring system behaviors and even lead to failure in ultimate and fatigue conditions the internal abrasion damage can be reduced by recent fiber rope technologies such as the application of long lay twisted ropes and special marine finish banfield et al 2017 2 marine environmental impacts the environmental factors that influence the modeling and health monitoring of mooring lines include the water depth the environmental loads e g wind current wave marine species water temperature salinity dissolved oxygen etc spraul et al 2017 yang et al 2017 and wright et al 2016 studied the effects of marine growth on the mooring lines of marine renewable energy devices according to their conclusions the biofouling has an important impact on the tension responses and the fatigue life of mooring lines for fiber rope mooring without covering and filters junior harsh marine species such as mussels can even penetrate and growth inside the ropes then accelerate the inter strand abrasion weller et al 2013 2015 the marine species colonization measured at the ecole centrale nantes sem rev test site spraul et al 2017 is shown in fig 2 for illustration other marine environmental effects such as accelerated corrosion of chain links in sea water wear at the fairlead connection point and seabed touchdown sections of the lines etc should also be listed and understood for a comprehensive modeling and service life monitoring approach the corrosion observed in the catenary mooring lines of a meteocean buoy operated at the ecole centrale nantes sem rev sea test site berhault 2017 is illustrated in fig 3 2 1 frequency domain method for fatigue damage estimate the frequency domain fatigue analysis approaches benasciutti and tovo 2004 gao and moan 2007 han and ma 2016 ma et al 2018 tovo 2002 have been studied in order to accurately predict the fatigue damage without having to perform time consuming rain flow counting rfc technique in time domain approach moreover the analytical formula used to calculate the damage based on the chosen frequency domain method can be applied directly to reliability analysis for the service life monitoring of mooring lines the procedure is interesting as it can be applied directly on the measured tension responses in this study as an example the time domain dynamic mooring analysis is performed using orcaflex in order to get the time histories of the tension responses that will be latter considered as measured signals the considered measured tension time histories are then transformed to power spectral density psd in frequency domain by using fast fourier transformation fft in matlab as illustrated in fig 4 since the so called measured tension time histories used in the present work are obtained from numerical simulations as mention above they can be considered as non noisy signals however it should be noted that measurement noise is a critical issue to be considered which may add extra power to the psd curve api rp 2sk 2005 and dnv os 301 2010 recommend t n and s n curves to calculate the fatigue damage of different mooring materials in this study the fatigue damage is calculated following the s n curve approach since the uncertainties of the dnv s s n curve can be known from the publications of lardier and moan 2008 and mathisen and hørte 2005 the fatigue curve is used for calculating the fatigue lives of mooring components as 1 n k s m where n is the number of cycle to failure under a stress range s k m are the s n curves parameters the fatigue damage accumulation is calculated following the palmgren miner s rule as 2 d i 1 n 1 n s i 1 k i 1 n s i m where si is the stress range of the stress cycle number i n is the number of stress cycles si if the stress process x t is a narrow band gaussian process its amplitude follows a rayleigh distribution the expected damage due to x t in a duration of time t in seconds is calculated as 3 d n b ν 0 t k 2 2 σ x m γ m 2 1 where γ gamma function γ z 0 α z 1 e α d α σ x standard deviation of the response ν 0 mean zero upcrossing rate ν 0 λ 2 λ 0 λ n is the n th spectral moments λ n 0 f n w x f d f w x f is the power spectral density of the response when x t is a non linear and wide band process the assumption of its rayleigh distributed amplitude is not valid for this the frequency domain fatigue analysis approaches gao and moan 2007 benasciutti and tovo 2004 han and ma 2016 ma et al 2018 tovo 2002 have been studied in order to select the most suitable approach to calculate the fatigue damage the idea is first to calculate the narrow band fatigue damage according to eq 3 then correct it with adjusted coefficients to account for the actual wide band and non linear characteristics of the tension stress responses the fatigue damage calculated by these approaches are compared with the time domain fatigue analysis for 20 different sea states as shown in fig 5 the tovo benasciutti approach with the non linear coefficient suggested by winterstein 1988 braccesi et al 2009 cianetti et al 2017 provides very good fatigue estimate comparing with the time domain approach the so called d tb c approach is chosen to calculate the fatigue damage of mooring lines and to perform reliability analysis for the following sections of the paper based on that the fatigue damage is calculated as

life monitoring of mooring lines a methodology for modeling and service life monitoring of mooring lines is discussed in the following based on the reliability approach we believe that once the mechanical behaviors of mooring components and the influencing factors are fully understood this modeling and service life monitoring approach can provide not only a better estimate of the cumulative fatigue damage but also a better prediction of the allowable remaining service life on the one hand the reliability approach allows accounting for the uncertainties of the materials and environmental loading pham et al 2004 pham 2018 rendón conde and heredia zavoni 2015 bitner gregersen et al 1995 horn et al 2019 on the other hand based on the corresponding required reliability level the design safety coefficients can be optimized for a more cost effective but reliable design finally decisions regarding the required maintenance or replacement of mooring lines can be made based on the level of reliability predicted during operation the methodology is presented in fig 6 and fig 7 in which first the mechanical behaviors of all mooring components i e strength stiffness fatigue characteristics etc as presented in block 2 of the flowchart and the environmental factors that influence such behaviors i e water depth environmental loading marine species corrosion and wear etc as presented in block 1 of the flowchart are identified the measured environmental factors block 1 and mechanical properties of mooring components block 2 are input to mooring analysis tools to calculate the mooring response which is then checked against the measured one basically for the present methodology it is very important to determine and clarify which changes will occur i e material deterioration modified mass and damping due to bio colonization modified length or pretension due to creep of the synthetic mooring components etc and how to update those changes in the modeling and fatigue life monitoring of mooring lines for instance after years of deploying the material loss e g due to corrosion for chain or internal abrasion for nylon may induce significant modifications on not only stiffness but also strength and fatigue characteristics of mooring components finally the collecting information is updated in mooring analysis tools in order to better control the actual state of mooring lines finally it is suggested that the mooring safety is assessed following the expected service life directly via reliability analysis in order to support making decisions regarding maintenance or replacement of lines fig 7 as an example we consider here the corrosion in mooring lines as an annually constant reduction of diameter of chain links this phenomenon leads to material loss and likely modified mooring responses the same exercises have been done by gao et al 2005 and lardier and moan 2008 for the reliability of chain links accounting for the reduced breaking strength and the increased stress due to corrosion in the present modeling and life monitoring methodology we convince that the thies et al s approach thies et al 2014 to estimate mooring responses due to environmental loading based directly on field measurements should be applied in addition the likely modified structural behaviors should also be well considered in the modeling of line responses in our opinion once the modeling of mooring responses can be well implemented based on a full understanding of the mechanical factors involved the modeling responses can be used to compare with the measured ones in order to re evaluate the actual state of mooring lines as a consequence a full control of the actual state of mooring lines and also a better fatigue estimate can be obtained in the present exercise the frequency domain fatigue analysis is chosen to calculate the fatigue damage directly from the measured tension responses the advantages are two fold first the fatigue damage can be estimated without having to perform rfc technique as in time domain analysis second the analytical formula of the fatigue damage can be used directly for reliability analysis considering the uncertainties of the environmental loading and the sn fatigue curve of mooring components the probabilities of failure pf in the uls and fls are calculated following the service life of the mooring lines considering modified mechanical behaviors of mooring components and relating environmental factors the pf for uls pf uls is calculated to ensure a sufficient level of reliability of the system to sustain the design extreme sea states that might probably happen at any moment during the service life the pf for fls pf fls is estimated to ensure a sufficient level of reliability that the cumulative fatigue damage is inferior than the critical damage moreover we also predict the reliability level in fls considering the added damage due to the design extreme sea states e g with a return period of 100 50 20 10 years etc assuming those might probably happen at any moment during the expected service life of lines these probabilities of failures in uls and fls are used for making decisions regarding maintenance or replacement of lines it s worth to acknowledge that standards dnv os e301 2010 api rp 2sk 2005 bureau veritas nr 493 2015 recommend to consider an additional thickness of chain links at the initial design stage in order to compensate the material loss due to corrosion in our opinion this is a good practice for oil gas platforms mooring lines in deep water where maintenance or replacement of lines are difficult and costly however that also increases the cost and the tension responses in the mooring system as they become more heavy and stiff for mooring systems of mre devices where it seems easier and less costly to maintain or replace damage lines the present monitoring methodology might be a promising alternative to ensure a cost effective design and safe operation in the following example instead of choosing a greater diameter of chain links to account for the corrosion effect the mooring system is designed for the expected fatigue life of 20 years with a safety factor of 3 lardier and moan 2008 the probabilities of failure in uls and fls are calculated following the expected service life in order to investigate how material loss e g due to corrosion as in the present example influences the modeling and service life monitoring of mooring lines and how decisions on maintenance or replacement of lines can be made based on the estimated levels of reliability although the material loss due to the internal abrasion fatigue damage of the nylon rope is not considered here due to the lack of publically available data for this fatigue mechanism it can be accounted for in the same manner by following the present methodology the effect of marine growth on the hydrodynamic diameter hydrodynamic coefficient ca cd and mass of the mooring lines is also a source of mooring response modification however for the sake of simplification it is not considered here which is the subject of a separate work spraul et al 2017 the additional damage due to in plane and out of plane bending ipb and opb is also not considered in this example either however it should be stressed that in shallow water and at high pretension i e greater than 10 of the minimum breaking strength of the top chain ipb and opb are important and the combined fatigue i e tension tension plus ipb and opb needs to be investigated bureau veritas 2014 this can be partly mitigated with an appropriate selection of the fairlead type also for simplification in the present model the wind turbine is considered only by modifying the weight and the cog of the floating platform model the mean components of the wind and current loads are considered as lateral loads that result in additional amounts of the mean tension in the mooring lines however the coupled aero hydrodynamic effect of the floating wind turbine should be carefully considered which can be done by linking orcaflex to fast even though the subject of the present work is not on the aero hydro coupling we believe that the wind turbine modeling in the long term can be implemented by the same manner as suggested by the present methodology i e by identifying structural deterioration changes during deployment and updating those changes in the model the time dependent diameter of chain links considering the corrosion effect is determined as lardier and moan 2008 6 d t d 0 t r corr where t the operation time in years d0 the diameter of chain links at t 0 rcorr the annual corrosion rate the time dependent axial stiffness of the chain sections considering the corrosion effect is determined as orcina 2016 ea t 0 854 10 8 d 2 t kn for studless chain 7 ea t 1 01 10 8 d 2 t kn for studlink chain the corrosion in the chain sections are considered as a reduction in the diameter of chain links and the axial stiffness of the sections as in eq 6 and eq 7 those are updated in the orcaflex model to calculate the modified mooring responses the stress process x t is calculated from the tension process ts t as 8 x t t s t a t where a t the time dependent cross section of the chain links a t 2 π d 2 t 4 the time dependent minimum breaking strength of the chain links is determined as 9 mbs t c 2 d 2 t 44 0 08 d t where c is the grade dependent coefficient ramnäs 2013 4 reliability assessment for the case study it is commonly known that reliability plays a key role in the cost effectiveness of the design where uncertainties are important and it is easy to implement in risk analysis in the present case study on the one hand this allows assessing the probability that the structures can sustain the design extreme sea states along the design life time on the other hand the reliability level corresponding to cumulative fatigue damage during operation and the remaining service life of structures can be estimated to support decisions regarding required maintenance or the replacement of lines it should also be noted that the severity in fatigue is dependent of the deploying site and should be investigated case by case in the following example due to the small discrepancy for comparativeness of the probability of failure another estimate of reliability i e the reliability index is compared the reliability analysis is performed based on the first order reliability method form using the open source initiative openturns 2016 4 1 reliability in strength condition uls it is commonly accepted by the offshore industry that for the duration of 3 6 h i e corresponding to the duration of an extreme sea state the tension response process ts t can be considered as stationary assuming that the process is normally distributed the probability density function of the annual maximum tension t smax is expressed as 10 p t smax t 1 σ t s 2 π exp t smax 2 2 σ t s 2 where t the mean tension due to the pre tension and the mean environmental loads σ t s the standard deviation of the tension response process ts t it is highlighted that the assumption of gaussian distribution may lead to an under estimate of the extreme maximum tension response and a corresponding unrealistically low probability of failure and in that case a gumbel distribution may be used instead however this gaussian assumption seems acceptable here as the purpose of the chosen case study is to illustrate the present methodology by showing the importance of updating the material loss during the expected service life in order to better estimate the reliability of the system the annual breaking tension of the chain links t bs t is assumed to be log normally distributed with the mean value equals to 1 2 x mbs t and the coefficient of variation cov equals to 0 05 gao et al 2005 these are presented in tables 1 and 2 where the material loss in the chain links due to corrosion is considered as an annually reduced of diameter rcorr equals to 0 4 mm year and 0 8 mm year the time history and the power spectral density of ts t are presented in fig 8 the annual failure function is written as 11 g uls t t bs t t smax t the annual probability of failure in strength condition is calculated as 12 p f uls t p g uls t 0 the annual reliability index for the 100 years return period sea state of the chain link connected to the fairlead are presented in fig 9 it can be seen that due to corrosion the reliability index decreases as the breaking strength of the chain links decreases therefore if corrosion was not considered in the design e g by increasing the diameter of chain links dnv os e301 2010 api rp 2sk 2005 bureau veritas nr 493 2015 it might be possible that after a few years of deployment the structure would no longer be able to withstand the initial extreme design sea state for instances if we consider that a reliability index of 3 7 vazquez hernandez et al 2006 is acceptable the mooring line is then considered failed under the same design extreme sea state only after 10 years of deployment with an annually reduced diameter of 0 8 mm year in other words maintenance or replacement of lines should be done after 10 years of operation in order to ensure the safety requirement in extreme condition 4 2 reliability in fatigue condition fls the dnv s s n fatigue curve for chain links dnv os e301 2010 is used to calculate the fatigue damage the estimated fatigue life is 20 years with a safety factor equals to 3 lardier and moan 2008 the objective for this setting is to investigate the added effect of corrosion on the cumulative fatigue damage by calculating the annual reliability index of the chain links taking into account an annually reduced diameter of the chain links lardier and moan 2008 fig 10 illustrates different approaches to calculate the cumulative fatigue damage of the chain links considering the effect of corrosion s1 the cumulative fatigue damage is calculated without corrosion s2 the cumulative fatigue damage is calculated with the same quantity of material loss reduced diameter for 20 years of deployment s3 the cumulative fatigue damage is calculated considering an annually reduced diameter of the chain link s4 the cumulative fatigue damage is calculated in the same manner as the case s3 but considering also the added fatigue damage due to the design extreme sea states e g with a return period of 100 50 20 10 years etc that might probably happen at any moment within the expected service life of the mooring lines as mentioned above the effect of corrosion is considered by reducing the diameter of the chain links and the stiffness of the chain sections as we consider here an annual reduction of diameter of the chain links the stress response is considered unchanged within one year for the same sea states so as the fatigue damage dannual with a more frequent measurement the cumulative fatigue damage can be determined by summing the damage calculated from the measured data for every month or couple of months the annual probability of failure of the chain links can be calculated as 13 p f fls p g fls t 0 where g fls t g fls 1 t δ t d annual for the cases s1 and s2 g fls t g fls 3 t δ k 1 t d annual for the case s3 g fls t g fls 4 t δ k 1 t d annual d uls for the case s4 δ is the model uncertainty in the palmgren miner rule presented in table 3 the annual reliability index of the chain link connected to the fairlead is shown in fig 11 and fig 12 considering the effect of corrosion as an annually reduced diameter of chain links of 0 4 mm year and 0 8 mm year we observe in fig 11 that the reliability index is more precisely calculated in the case fls rcorr 0 4 cumulated case s3 where the fatigue damage is cumulatively summed considering an annual reduction of diameter of chain links by contrast the case fls rcorr 0 4 case s2 seems overly conservative since only the final reduced diameter at the end of the 20 years is considered to calculate the annual damage then multiplied with the number of operating year with the assumption that there might be a 100 year return period sea state happen during the structure life time the reliability index is calculated as fls rcorr 0 4 cumulated ext case s4 by summing the added damage caused by this extreme sea state into the cumulative fatigue damage the added damage caused by the extreme sea states is an interesting view that allows forecasting the level reliability of structures in fls considering disadvantage scenarios such as extreme sea states this can be useful to inform stake holders about the probable risk and to support decisions regarding maintenance or replacement of lines again if a reliability index that is not smaller than 3 7 is considered acceptable the fatigue life of the chain link should be 15 years for the case s3 and 13 years for the case s4 instead of 20 years where the corrosion effect is not considered as a consequence maintenance or line replacement should be done after 13 or 15 year of deployment in other words the safety coefficient should not be smaller than 4 for the case s3 and 5 for the case s4 in order to ensure a design fatigue life of 20 years it s also worth noting that the recommended design safety factor for the sn curve given by dnv os e301 2010 is 5 similar conclusions can be made for fig 12 where we consider an annually reduced diameter of the chain links of 8 mm year 5 conclusions and discussion this study discusses a methodology for modeling and fatigue life monitoring of mooring lines for fwts based on the reliability approach in our opinion in order to understand why and how mooring responses are modified during deployment it is crucial to identify and account for not only the likely modified mechanical behaviors of mooring components but also the marine environmental factors influencing such behaviors therefore we believe that in addition to the current monitoring approach thies et al 2014 that uses directly field measurement to calculate fatigue damage the numerical modeling should also be implemented in parallel in a so called digital twin indeed once the present modeling and fatigue life monitoring is properly implemented not only the actual state of the mooring lines will be better controlled but also the cumulative fatigue will be better estimated as a consequence the actual level of reliability of the system can be better predicted by fully understanding the actual state of mooring lines such as residual breaking strength and stiffness of mooring components better estimating the cumulative fatigue damage and better forecasting disadvantage events e g added damage due to extreme sea states based on that decisions regarding maintenance or replacement of lines can be made once the estimated reliability level reaches the critical value furthermore to us a comprehensive methodology for modeling and life monitoring also means a closer look on the design safety factor and as a consequence a more cost effective design finally the authors believe that different safety factors should be considered for mre devices since those are unmanned structures that are significantly different from oil and gaz platforms where the consequences for environment economy and human losses are not in the same order of magnitude moreover since maintenance or replacement of lines for mre devices in shallow water seems simpler and less costly than for deep water o g platforms the present methodology suggests that those could be the other potential options rather than an over engineered mooring system which would not be commercially viable for large scale deployments otherwise a common failure mode is from poor quality assurance quality control qa qc in manufacturing or damage from handling and installation that this methodology does not address extending the methodology to consider these issues is then among the authors future scope of work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

22341,nowadays the service life monitoring of mooring lines attracts more and more attention from the marine renewable energy mre industry where developers desire to have a closer look on the safety margin besides current standards are also being improved in order to ensure safe and cost effective design for mre devices in the present study we believe that monitoring and modeling should be implemented in parallel in order to better estimate the actual state and the reliability of the system during the expected service life besides it is crucial to clarify the mechanic of the mooring line responses to understand why and how they are modified during deployment and how those can be accounted for in order to update the actual fatigue damage and predict the remaining allowable service life of system a comprehensive modeling and service life monitoring methodology for mooring lines of floating wind turbines fwts is discussed by the authors based on the reliability approach critical factors that influence structural behaviors such as material deterioration and marine environmental factors involved are identified and accounted for in this reliability monitoring basis ultimately based on the reliability level estimated decisions regarding required maintenance or replacement of lines can be made keywords floating wind turbine service life monitoring reliability mooring line fls uls 1 introduction the modeling and monitoring of offshore mooring lines require a sound understanding of both the relating mechanical behaviors of all the mooring components i e load strain behaviors breaking strength critical modes of failure etc and the marine environmental factors i e environmental loading corrosion abrasion colonization of marine species etc that influence such behaviors the design of offshore mooring lines are often checked against three limit states dnv os e301 2010 ultimate limit state uls where the maximum tension in the lines is designed to remain below the minimum breaking strength of the mooring components a good estimate of the working tension is therefore mandatory for a reliable design it also means that in order to perform a detailed mooring design the mechanical properties i e load strain properties breaking strength etc of all the mooring components and the relating deterioration factors must be well understood fatigue limit state fls where mooring lines are designed for a certain service life usually between 20 and 25 years for fwts the fatigue life of a mooring line is affected by not only the mechanical fatigue behaviors of the materials composing that line but also the material deterioration due to the marine environmental factors accident limit state als where the mooring lines are designed with a certain redundancy in order to ensure their capability of surviving against the failure of one mooring line the previous issues have been subjects of a large amount of research work aqdam et al 2018 xue et al 2018 wu et al 2015 ma et al 2013 investigated several accidental events in permanent mooring systems and found that many line failures occurred in early service years of mooring lines even if fatigue is generally the dominant cause gryphon incident finucane 2012 teaches us a case of failure due to a combination of failure of heading control and overload moreover the failure mechanisms have surprised the industry experts a limit number of known failures for mooring lines of marine renewable energy devices e g oceanlinx in 2010 and wavedragon in 2004 has been discussed by christensen et al 2005 but the reasons of failure stay still unclear brindley et al 2014 stressed that only strength requirements do not fully reflect the system reliability pham et al 2004 pham 2018 studied the interaction between the reliability in the uls and fls according to their conclusions the total reliability should be considered either by multiplying the reliability of the two design criteria for the reliability in the uls case or by adding the fatigue damage caused by extreme sea states that might probably occur at any point during the expected service life of structures for the reliability in the fls case unlike o g platforms mre devices are generally small compared to the incident wave length and thus complex motions may occur which may be large if the system response is resonant weller et al 2013 moreover strong coupling between the device and mooring system is usually observed for the floatgen project that the present case study is based on nylon is used as a principal mooring component and the modeling of mooring responses lacks validation it is mainly due to the non linear load elongation behaviors and fatigue characteristics of nylon mooring ropes that can not be captured following the same testing and modeling procedures for polyester as recommended by the current oil gas o g standards thies et al 2014 proposed other than numerical modeling an alternative approach to predict fatigue damage using directly in situ load measurements their approach has been concluded to allow a better fatigue assessment and an optimization of safety factors at the design state where on site measurements are available also the approach can be used for the in situ monitoring in order to predict the fatigue damage and the remaining service life of the structure during deployment however the authors believe that only load measurements are not enough to characterize the actual state of mooring lines that actually includes the likely modified mooring line mechanical behaviors e g strength and stiffness reduction etc due to material loss gao et al 2005 liu et al 2015 modified mass and hydrodynamic damping due to biofouling and other marine environmental factors e g corrosion wear etc these mechanical behaviors of mooring materials and marine environmental factors should be fully understood and accounted for indeed it is vital to clarify the mechanic of the mooring line responses to understand why and how they might be modified during deployment and how those can be accounted for in order to update the actual fatigue damage and predict the remaining allowable service life of the system that is why in our opinion modeling and monitoring should be implemented in parallel in order to better control and update the actual state of mooring lines better estimate the fatigue damage and reliability of the system during deployment based on that decisions regarding required maintenance or replacement of lines can be made the present modeling and service life monitoring methodology for mooring lines of fwts is based on the reliability approach the methodology is applied in the following for the ultimate limit state uls in order to check if the mooring lines can still sustain the design extreme load case after years of operation also by applying the methodology for the fatigue limit state fls the remaining allowable service life can be predicted based on the information obtained from the previous operating years furthermore the present methodology can also be considered for a more detailed mooring design once the information from similar structures projects sites etc are known the defined case study is inspired from the hybrid mooring lines of the 2 mw fwt installed at the sem rev test site since 2017 as part of the fp7 eu floatgen project pham et al 2019 berhault 2017 spraul et al 2017 berhault et al 2016 we focus on the mechanical behaviors of two mooring components i e chain and nylon the material deterioration during operation and the marine environmental factors that influence such behaviors once the previously mentioned information is fully understood and accounted for the reliability following the service life of mooring lines can be better predicted the corresponding level of reliability is then used to decide whether maintenance or replacement of lines is necessary the floatgen fwt s principal mooring components and the orcaflex model of its hybrid mooring lines connected to the floater are illustrated in fig 1 in which a line composed of top and bottom chains with a nylon section in between a similar floating structure and mooring configuration have been published by spraul et al 2017 pham et al 2019 based on the publically available information from ideol and the ecole centrale de nantes berhault 2017 the hydrodynamic database is calculated by hydrostar bureau veritas 2016 however ones should be aware that the floater and mooring characteristics used in this study are selected only for the study purpose and are not representative of the ideol s real floating structure and the floatgen s mooring system 2 mechanical behaviors of mooring components for the modeling and monitoring of mooring lines in order to apply the present methodology on the mooring lines of the fwt mentioned above this section will briefly discuss the mechanical behaviors of two mooring components i e chain and nylon and the marine environmental factors that influence such behaviors 1 1 chain with more than 50 000 tons in service according to the data from j fernández and storesund 2014 a huge effort has been putting on studying the characteristics and behaviors of chain mooring lines the outcomes of several jips have been integrated to the offshore standards such as api rp 2sk 2005 dnv os e301 2010 bureau veritas guidance note ni 493 2015 etc together with wire rope and connector e g shackles h link etc chain make one of the top three components that caused most incidents in mooring lines some failure mechanisms are listed by ma et al 2013 such as out of plane bending opb chain hockling flawed flash welds pitting corrosion etc therefore it is vital to understand all these mechanisms in order to identify the potential weak points of the lines why and how the structural responses are modified during operation and finally how to consider them in strength and fatigue design in the present study in order to illustrate how the service life monitoring methodology can be applied we focus on the corrosion of chains due to the marine environment as this phenomenon can lead to significant loss of material and likely modified mooring responses indeed experiences from the oil gas industry show several mooring line failures due to the fatigue damage induced by the crack propagation which can be accelerated by corrosion in marine environment and wear between chain links or at connection points lardier and moan 2008 corrosion results in the reduction of steel surface variation in residual stresses therefore influences both strength and fatigue design of mooring lines corrosion in sea water of chains is a complex phenomenon since it depends on both the mooring material properties and the marine environment characteristics the composition of sea water temperature salinity dissolved oxygen etc most of corrosion models are simply based on a constant rate of corrosion for instances api rp 2sk 2005 recommends an industry practice to increase the chain diameter in the splash zone and the dip or thrash zone on hard bottom by 0 2 0 4 mm year this increasing diameter is reduced to 0 1 0 2 mm year for the remaining length bureau veritas guidance note ni 493 2015 requires a 0 4 mm years of corrosion and wear allowance for the chain section in splash zone and the bottom length and 0 3 mm year in the remaining length dnv os e301 2010 recommends considering a corrosion rate of 0 4 mm year in chain diameter in the catenary and bottom parts and a higher rate of 0 8 mm year for the splash zone melchers et al 2007 proposed a probabilistic model for fully submerged chains with the mean value of corrosion rate about 0 44 mm year with a standard deviation of 0 1 mm year schoefs et al 2009 suggested an inspection model of the steel loss in view to account for the variability of the corrosion rate with time 1 2 nylon for pilot farms of floating wind turbines fwts in shallow water between 50 m and 100 m the application of nylon as a mooring component can provide a more cost effective design indeed nylon is a preferred candidate over polyester for fwt mooring because of its lower stiffness and a corresponding capacity of reducing maximum tensions in the mooring system the use of nylon has however not been well proven appropriate for permanent mooring application due to its poor wet fatigue characteristics the main mechanisms of fatigue for synthetic ropes are creep hysteresis heating internal abrasion axial compression etc hearle et al 1993 parsey 1982 it is believed that hysteresis heating is not a concern for offshore mooring applications where ropes remain under water throughout its service life likewise the axial compression fatigue affects only stiff fibers such as aramid thus should not be a concern for nylon however the design practice for polyester mooring lines recommended by bureau veritas ni 432 2007 is to keep the minimum tension not lower than 2 of minimum breaking strength mbs to avoid axial compression fatigue the internal abrasion and creep therefore remain two critical fatigue modes for nylon ropes creep is a static fatigue damage mode that ropes fail after a certain duration of time at a constant tension creep is either recoverable primary creep at low tension or non recoverable secondary creep at high tension the latter is relevant to creep fatigue failure of fiber ropes creep fatigue failure can be critical for typical nylon that might fail in less than 5 h being tensioned at 80 of its breaking strength mckenna et al 2004 for wet nylon 66 the creep process is the dominating fatigue mechanism for load levels above 30 its breaking strength for cyclic loading the creep effect is the same as if the peak load i e maximum load has been applied continuously the creep fatigue mechanism is independent of the frequency of loading and can be predicted by the linear relationship between the maximum load and the log time to failure in second creep effect doesn t lead to the reduction of strength of ropes at least up to 75 80 of the fatigue life time mandell 1987 mandell et al 1987 internal abrasion is a dynamic fatigue damage mode that the rope fails after a certain number of cycles under cyclic loading internal abrasion is caused by relative motions between strands which are directly related to the tension range and inversely related to the mean tension therefore it can be concluded that the severity of internal abrasion is directly related to the tension amplitude and inversely related to the mean tension flory et al 2006 internal abrasion is a serious problem for highly structured wet nylon ropes at moderate tension mckenna et al 2004 severe internal abrasion can lead to significant loss of strength of ropes and therefore might modify mooring system behaviors and even lead to failure in ultimate and fatigue conditions the internal abrasion damage can be reduced by recent fiber rope technologies such as the application of long lay twisted ropes and special marine finish banfield et al 2017 2 marine environmental impacts the environmental factors that influence the modeling and health monitoring of mooring lines include the water depth the environmental loads e g wind current wave marine species water temperature salinity dissolved oxygen etc spraul et al 2017 yang et al 2017 and wright et al 2016 studied the effects of marine growth on the mooring lines of marine renewable energy devices according to their conclusions the biofouling has an important impact on the tension responses and the fatigue life of mooring lines for fiber rope mooring without covering and filters junior harsh marine species such as mussels can even penetrate and growth inside the ropes then accelerate the inter strand abrasion weller et al 2013 2015 the marine species colonization measured at the ecole centrale nantes sem rev test site spraul et al 2017 is shown in fig 2 for illustration other marine environmental effects such as accelerated corrosion of chain links in sea water wear at the fairlead connection point and seabed touchdown sections of the lines etc should also be listed and understood for a comprehensive modeling and service life monitoring approach the corrosion observed in the catenary mooring lines of a meteocean buoy operated at the ecole centrale nantes sem rev sea test site berhault 2017 is illustrated in fig 3 2 1 frequency domain method for fatigue damage estimate the frequency domain fatigue analysis approaches benasciutti and tovo 2004 gao and moan 2007 han and ma 2016 ma et al 2018 tovo 2002 have been studied in order to accurately predict the fatigue damage without having to perform time consuming rain flow counting rfc technique in time domain approach moreover the analytical formula used to calculate the damage based on the chosen frequency domain method can be applied directly to reliability analysis for the service life monitoring of mooring lines the procedure is interesting as it can be applied directly on the measured tension responses in this study as an example the time domain dynamic mooring analysis is performed using orcaflex in order to get the time histories of the tension responses that will be latter considered as measured signals the considered measured tension time histories are then transformed to power spectral density psd in frequency domain by using fast fourier transformation fft in matlab as illustrated in fig 4 since the so called measured tension time histories used in the present work are obtained from numerical simulations as mention above they can be considered as non noisy signals however it should be noted that measurement noise is a critical issue to be considered which may add extra power to the psd curve api rp 2sk 2005 and dnv os 301 2010 recommend t n and s n curves to calculate the fatigue damage of different mooring materials in this study the fatigue damage is calculated following the s n curve approach since the uncertainties of the dnv s s n curve can be known from the publications of lardier and moan 2008 and mathisen and hørte 2005 the fatigue curve is used for calculating the fatigue lives of mooring components as 1 n k s m where n is the number of cycle to failure under a stress range s k m are the s n curves parameters the fatigue damage accumulation is calculated following the palmgren miner s rule as 2 d i 1 n 1 n s i 1 k i 1 n s i m where si is the stress range of the stress cycle number i n is the number of stress cycles si if the stress process x t is a narrow band gaussian process its amplitude follows a rayleigh distribution the expected damage due to x t in a duration of time t in seconds is calculated as 3 d n b ν 0 t k 2

is the power spectral density of the response when x t is a non linear and wide band process the assumption of its rayleigh distributed amplitude is not valid for this the frequency domain fatigue analysis approaches gao and moan 2007 benasciutti and tovo 2004 han and ma 2016 ma et al 2018 tovo 2002 have been studied in order to select the most suitable approach to calculate the fatigue damage the idea is first to calculate the narrow band fatigue damage according to eq 3 then correct it with adjusted coefficients to account for the actual wide band and non linear characteristics of the tension stress responses the fatigue damage calculated by these approaches are compared with the time domain fatigue analysis for 20 different sea states as shown in fig 5 the tovo benasciutti approach with the non linear coefficient suggested by winterstein 1988 braccesi et al 2009 cianetti et al 2017 provides very good fatigue estimate comparing with the time domain approach the so called d tb c approach is chosen to calculate the fatigue damage of mooring lines and to perform reliability analysis for the following sections of the paper based on that the fatigue damage is calculated as

life monitoring of mooring lines a methodology for modeling and service life monitoring of mooring lines is discussed in the following based on the reliability approach we believe that once the mechanical behaviors of mooring components and the influencing factors are fully understood this modeling and service life monitoring approach can provide not only a better estimate of the cumulative fatigue damage but also a better prediction of the allowable remaining service life on the one hand the reliability approach allows accounting for the uncertainties of the materials and environmental loading pham et al 2004 pham 2018 rendón conde and heredia zavoni 2015 bitner gregersen et al 1995 horn et al 2019 on the other hand based on the corresponding required reliability level the design safety coefficients can be optimized for a more cost effective but reliable design finally decisions regarding the required maintenance or replacement of mooring lines can be made based on the level of reliability predicted during operation the methodology is presented in fig 6 and fig 7 in which first the mechanical behaviors of all mooring components i e strength stiffness fatigue characteristics etc as presented in block 2 of the flowchart and the environmental factors that influence such behaviors i e water depth environmental loading marine species corrosion and wear etc as presented in block 1 of the flowchart are identified the measured environmental factors block 1 and mechanical properties of mooring components block 2 are input to mooring analysis tools to calculate the mooring response which is then checked against the measured one basically for the present methodology it is very important to determine and clarify which changes will occur i e material deterioration modified mass and damping due to bio colonization modified length or pretension due to creep of the synthetic mooring components etc and how to update those changes in the modeling and fatigue life monitoring of mooring lines for instance after years of deploying the material loss e g due to corrosion for chain or internal abrasion for nylon may induce significant modifications on not only stiffness but also strength and fatigue characteristics of mooring components finally the collecting information is updated in mooring analysis tools in order to better control the actual state of mooring lines finally it is suggested that the mooring safety is assessed following the expected service life directly via reliability analysis in order to support making decisions regarding maintenance or replacement of lines fig 7 as an example we consider here the corrosion in mooring lines as an annually constant reduction of diameter of chain links this phenomenon leads to material loss and likely modified mooring responses the same exercises have been done by gao et al 2005 and lardier and moan 2008 for the reliability of chain links accounting for the reduced breaking strength and the increased stress due to corrosion in the present modeling and life monitoring methodology we convince that the thies et al s approach thies et al 2014 to estimate mooring responses due to environmental loading based directly on field measurements should be applied in addition the likely modified structural behaviors should also be well considered in the modeling of line responses in our opinion once the modeling of mooring responses can be well implemented based on a full understanding of the mechanical factors involved the modeling responses can be used to compare with the measured ones in order to re evaluate the actual state of mooring lines as a consequence a full control of the actual state of mooring lines and also a better fatigue estimate can be obtained in the present exercise the frequency domain fatigue analysis is chosen to calculate the fatigue damage directly from the measured tension responses the advantages are two fold first the fatigue damage can be estimated without having to perform rfc technique as in time domain analysis second the analytical formula of the fatigue damage can be used directly for reliability analysis considering the uncertainties of the environmental loading and the sn fatigue curve of mooring components the probabilities of failure pf in the uls and fls are calculated following the service life of the mooring lines considering modified mechanical behaviors of mooring components and relating environmental factors the pf for uls pf uls is calculated to ensure a sufficient level of reliability of the system to sustain the design extreme sea states that might probably happen at any moment during the service life the pf for fls pf fls is estimated to ensure a sufficient level of reliability that the cumulative fatigue damage is inferior than the critical damage moreover we also predict the reliability level in fls considering the added damage due to the design extreme sea states e g with a return period of 100 50 20 10 years etc assuming those might probably happen at any moment during the expected service life of lines these probabilities of failures in uls and fls are used for making decisions regarding maintenance or replacement of lines it s worth to acknowledge that standards dnv os e301 2010 api rp 2sk 2005 bureau veritas nr 493 2015 recommend to consider an additional thickness of chain links at the initial design stage in order to compensate the material loss due to corrosion in our opinion this is a good practice for oil gas platforms mooring lines in deep water where maintenance or replacement of lines are difficult and costly however that also increases the cost and the tension responses in the mooring system as they become more heavy and stiff for mooring systems of mre devices where it seems easier and less costly to maintain or replace damage lines the present monitoring methodology might be a promising alternative to ensure a cost effective design and safe operation in the following example instead of choosing a greater diameter of chain links to account for the corrosion effect the mooring system is designed for the expected fatigue life of 20 years with a safety factor of 3 lardier and moan 2008 the probabilities of failure in uls and fls are calculated following the expected service life in order to investigate how material loss e g due to corrosion as in the present example influences the modeling and service life monitoring of mooring lines and how decisions on maintenance or replacement of lines can be made based on the estimated levels of reliability although the material loss due to the internal abrasion fatigue damage of the nylon rope is not considered here due to the lack of publically available data for this fatigue mechanism it can be accounted for in the same manner by following the present methodology the effect of marine growth on the hydrodynamic diameter hydrodynamic coefficient ca cd and mass of the mooring lines is also a source of mooring response modification however for the sake of simplification it is not considered here which is the subject of a separate work spraul et al 2017 the additional damage due to in plane and out of plane bending ipb and opb is also not considered in this example either however it should be stressed that in shallow water and at high pretension i e greater than 10 of the minimum breaking strength of the top chain ipb and opb are important and the combined fatigue i e tension tension plus ipb and opb needs to be investigated bureau veritas 2014 this can be partly mitigated with an appropriate selection of the fairlead type also for simplification in the present model the wind turbine is considered only by modifying the weight and the cog of the floating platform model the mean components of the wind and current loads are considered as lateral loads that result in additional amounts of the mean tension in the mooring lines however the coupled aero hydrodynamic effect of the floating wind turbine should be carefully considered which can be done by linking orcaflex to fast even though the subject of the present work is not on the aero hydro coupling we believe that the wind turbine modeling in the long term can be implemented by the same manner as suggested by the present methodology i e by identifying structural deterioration changes during deployment and updating those changes in the model the time dependent diameter of chain links considering the corrosion effect is determined as lardier and moan 2008 6 d t d 0 t r corr where t the operation time in years d0 the diameter of chain links at t 0 rcorr the annual corrosion rate the time dependent axial stiffness of the chain sections considering the corrosion effect is determined as orcina 2016 ea t 0 854 10 8 d 2 t kn for studless chain 7 ea t 1 01 10 8 d 2 t kn for studlink chain the corrosion in the chain sections are considered as a reduction in the diameter of chain links and the axial stiffness of the sections as in eq 6 and eq 7 those are updated in the orcaflex model to calculate the modified mooring responses the stress process x t is calculated from the tension process ts t as 8 x t t s t a t where a t the time dependent cross section of the chain links a t 2 π d 2 t 4 the time dependent minimum breaking strength of the chain links is determined as 9 mbs t c 2 d 2 t 44 0 08 d t where c is the grade dependent coefficient ramnäs 2013 4 reliability assessment for the case study it is commonly known that reliability plays a key role in the cost effectiveness of the design where uncertainties are important and it is easy to implement in risk analysis in the present case study on the one hand this allows assessing the probability that the structures can sustain the design extreme sea states along the design life time on the other hand the reliability level corresponding to cumulative fatigue damage during operation and the remaining service life of structures can be estimated to support decisions regarding required maintenance or the replacement of lines it should also be noted that the severity in fatigue is dependent of the deploying site and should be investigated case by case in the following example due to the small discrepancy for comparativeness of the probability of failure another estimate of reliability i e the reliability index is compared the reliability analysis is performed based on the first order reliability method form using the open source initiative openturns 2016 4 1 reliability in strength condition uls it is commonly accepted by the offshore industry that for the duration of 3 6 h i e corresponding to the duration of an extreme sea state the tension response process ts t can be considered as stationary assuming that the process is normally distributed the probability density function of the annual maximum tension t smax is expressed as 10 p t smax t 1 σ t s 2 π exp t smax 2 2 σ t s 2 where t the mean tension due to the pre tension and the mean environmental loads σ t s the standard deviation of the tension response process ts t it is highlighted that the assumption of gaussian distribution may lead to an under estimate of the extreme maximum tension response and a corresponding unrealistically low probability of failure and in that case a gumbel distribution may be used instead however this gaussian assumption seems acceptable here as the purpose of the chosen case study is to illustrate the present methodology by showing the importance of updating the material loss during the expected service life in order to better estimate the reliability of the system the annual breaking tension of the chain links t bs t is assumed to be log normally distributed with the mean value equals to 1 2 x mbs t and the coefficient of variation cov equals to 0 05 gao et al 2005 these are presented in tables 1 and 2 where the material loss in the chain links due to corrosion is considered as an annually reduced of diameter rcorr equals to 0 4 mm year and 0 8 mm year the time history and the power spectral density of ts t are presented in fig 8 the annual failure function is written as 11 g uls t t bs t t smax t the annual probability of failure in strength condition is calculated as 12 p f uls t p g uls t 0 the annual reliability index for the 100 years return period sea state of the chain link connected to the fairlead are presented in fig 9 it can be seen that due to corrosion the reliability index decreases as the breaking strength of the chain links decreases therefore if corrosion was not considered in the design e g by increasing the diameter of chain links dnv os e301 2010 api rp 2sk 2005 bureau veritas nr 493 2015 it might be possible that after a few years of deployment the structure would no longer be able to withstand the initial extreme design sea state for instances if we consider that a reliability index of 3 7 vazquez hernandez et al 2006 is acceptable the mooring line is then considered failed under the same design extreme sea state only after 10 years of deployment with an annually reduced diameter of 0 8 mm year in other words maintenance or replacement of lines should be done after 10 years of operation in order to ensure the safety requirement in extreme condition 4 2 reliability in fatigue condition fls the dnv s s n fatigue curve for chain links dnv os e301 2010 is used to calculate the fatigue damage the estimated fatigue life is 20 years with a safety factor equals to 3 lardier and moan 2008 the objective for this setting is to investigate the added effect of corrosion on the cumulative fatigue damage by calculating the annual reliability index of the chain links taking into account an annually reduced diameter of the chain links lardier and moan 2008 fig 10 illustrates different approaches to calculate the cumulative fatigue damage of the chain links considering the effect of corrosion s1 the cumulative fatigue damage is calculated without corrosion s2 the cumulative fatigue damage is calculated with the same quantity of material loss reduced diameter for 20 years of deployment s3 the cumulative fatigue damage is calculated considering an annually reduced diameter of the chain link s4 the cumulative fatigue damage is calculated in the same manner as the case s3 but considering also the added fatigue damage due to the design extreme sea states e g with a return period of 100 50 20 10 years etc that might probably happen at any moment within the expected service life of the mooring lines as mentioned above the effect of corrosion is considered by reducing the diameter of the chain links and the stiffness of the chain sections as we consider here an annual reduction of diameter of the chain links the stress response is considered unchanged within one year for the same sea states so as the fatigue damage dannual with a more frequent measurement the cumulative fatigue damage can be determined by summing the damage calculated from the measured data for every month or couple of months the annual probability of failure of the chain links can be calculated as 13 p f fls p g fls t 0 where g fls t g fls 1 t δ t d annual for the cases s1 and s2 g fls t g fls 3 t δ k 1 t d annual for the case s3 g fls t g fls 4 t δ k 1 t d annual d uls for the case s4 δ is the model uncertainty in the palmgren miner rule presented in table 3 the annual reliability index of the chain link connected to the fairlead is shown in fig 11 and fig 12 considering the effect of corrosion as an annually reduced diameter of chain links of 0 4 mm year and 0 8 mm year we observe in fig 11 that the reliability index is more precisely calculated in the case fls rcorr 0 4 cumulated case s3 where the fatigue damage is cumulatively summed considering an annual reduction of diameter of chain links by contrast the case fls rcorr 0 4 case s2 seems overly conservative since only the final reduced diameter at the end of the 20 years is considered to calculate the annual damage then multiplied with the number of operating year with the assumption that there might be a 100 year return period sea state happen during the structure life time the reliability index is calculated as fls rcorr 0 4 cumulated ext case s4 by summing the added damage caused by this extreme sea state into the cumulative fatigue damage the added damage caused by the extreme sea states is an interesting view that allows forecasting the level reliability of structures in fls considering disadvantage scenarios such as extreme sea states this can be useful to inform stake holders about the probable risk and to support decisions regarding maintenance or replacement of lines again if a reliability index that is not smaller than 3 7 is considered acceptable the fatigue life of the chain link should be 15 years for the case s3 and 13 years for the case s4 instead of 20 years where the corrosion effect is not considered as a consequence maintenance or line replacement should be done after 13 or 15 year of deployment in other words the safety coefficient should not be smaller than 4 for the case s3 and 5 for the case s4 in order to ensure a design fatigue life of 20 years it s also worth noting that the recommended design safety factor for the sn curve given by dnv os e301 2010 is 5 similar conclusions can be made for fig 12 where we consider an annually reduced diameter of the chain links of 8 mm year 5 conclusions and discussion this study discusses a methodology for modeling and fatigue life monitoring of mooring lines for fwts based on the reliability approach in our opinion in order to understand why and how mooring responses are modified during deployment it is crucial to identify and account for not only the likely modified mechanical behaviors of mooring components but also the marine environmental factors influencing such behaviors therefore we believe that in addition to the current monitoring approach thies et al 2014 that uses directly field measurement to calculate fatigue damage the numerical modeling should also be implemented in parallel in a so called digital twin indeed once the present modeling and fatigue life monitoring is properly implemented not only the actual state of the mooring lines will be better controlled but also the cumulative fatigue will be better estimated as a consequence the actual level of reliability of the system can be better predicted by fully understanding the actual state of mooring lines such as residual breaking strength and stiffness of mooring components better estimating the cumulative fatigue damage and better forecasting disadvantage events e g added damage due to extreme sea states based on that decisions regarding maintenance or replacement of lines can be made once the estimated reliability level reaches the critical value furthermore to us a comprehensive methodology for modeling and life monitoring also means a closer look on the design safety factor and as a consequence a more cost effective design finally the authors believe that different safety factors should be considered for mre devices since those are unmanned structures that are significantly different from oil and gaz platforms where the consequences for environment economy and human losses are not in the same order of magnitude moreover since maintenance or replacement of lines for mre devices in shallow water seems simpler and less costly than for deep water o g platforms the present methodology suggests that those could be the other potential options rather than an over engineered mooring system which would not be commercially viable for large scale deployments otherwise a common failure mode is from poor quality assurance quality control qa qc in manufacturing or damage from handling and installation that this methodology does not address extending the methodology to consider these

22342,wave radiation due to heave surge and pitch by a box type floating structure based on computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations using openfoam is analysed the cfd simulation results include surge and heave forces and response amplitude operator for the heave surge and pitch at different wave lengths the numerical simulation results of heave force due to incoming waves and resulting motion are compared against experimental data and linearized analytical solutions based on velocity potential flow theory the hydrodynamic effect on the width and draft of the structure in analytical results for vertical wave force horizontal wave force and torque are studied whilst the effect of different wave lengths on heave surge and pitch forces and response amplitude operator from cfd results are analysed the comparison shows that the cfd results are in good agreement with the experimental ones and are very close to the analytical ones the paper concludes that cfd is well capable of simulating wave interaction behaviour of a box type floating structure for wave energy converters and the developed analytical model can serve as an efficient middle fidelity performance evaluation tool for such structures during design development stage keywords openfoam wave radiation response amplitude operator wave forces 1 introduction over the last decade there has been a significant interest on cfd modelling a large number of engineering problems associated with fluid structure interaction due to its level of accuracy and efficiency in handing of complex problems arising in marine and ocean engineering however there is little progress in the literature of wave interaction with floating bodies incorporating different motion characteristics for designing wave energy converters due to the recent advances in computational modelling cfd simulations can give deeper insight into the floating body hydrodynamics which can facilitate better design and optimized operating setup cfd is one of the popular approaches for modelling hydrodynamic loads on the floating structures of different geometries cfd methods which are based on solving navier stokes equations if properly solved can capture most of the nonlinear hydrodynamic loads on an offshore structure and can lead to very reliable results therefore recently the scientific community is interested in comparing the results of motion characteristics of floating structures of various geometries obtained from cfd simulations against experimental data and analytical results to set benchmarks box type floating structures are frequently used as breakwaters for small harbours and marinas black et al 1971 drimer et al 1992 sannasiraj et al 1995 williams et al 2000 huang et al 2015 the study of the radiation problem of box type floating structures based on cfd modelling are of recent interest as it can provide the fundamental information about the structures regarding the hydrodynamic characteristics of added mass radiation damping coefficients and wave forces under the excitation of waves a rigid floating body will exhibit six degrees of freedom namely three translations heave sway and surge and three rotational motions pitch yaw and roll practically vertical horizontal and rotational motions are of primary importance for the hydrodynamic analysis of a floating structure for designing wave energy converters recently several researchers have studied floating structures and wave energy converters based on cfd models holmes et al 2001 used cfd to predict the hydrodynamic loads on heave plates in simple harmonic motion and least mean square method was used to obtain the appropriate morison coefficients for the plates under variety of sea conditions jung et al 2013 studied numerically the interaction between a regular wave and a roll motion of a rectangular floating structure using vof method based on the finite volume method the results showed good agreement with potential theory and also effectively represented the process of vortex generation philip et al 2013 studied the heave damping effects due to circular plates attached to spar hull based on experimental investigation and cfd simulation to establish the relationship between wave frequencies and damping ratio they observed that increase in added mass combined with viscous damping is a key factor for the effectiveness of heave plates in reducing motion response of spar platforms which was also identified by lavrov and guedes soares 2016 chen et al 2014 simulated the wave induced roll of a 2d rectangular barge using openfoam in beam sea conditions and the results were validated with experimental results they concluded that viscous effect not only can damp out the roll motion but also can increase it connell and cashman 2015 compared the heave response of a freely floating body between a state space mathematical model and a navier stokes n s based time domain cfd program ansys fluent they conclude that a combined approach using both the models can make floating body study more efficient and less time consuming jaswar et al 2015 compared the semi submersible heave motion response prediction among diffraction diffraction viscous and diffraction morison methods based on diffraction potential flow theory the paper concluded that morison equation based drag correction method is able to estimate heave response in damping dominated regions and provides more reasonable motion tendency compared to other methods paci et al 2016 simulated the dynamics of a floating vertical cylinder moored to the bottom under regular waves using openfoam coupled with ihfoam they concluded that openfoam coupled with ihfoam is a reliable tool for studying floating body dynamics however they mentioned that dynamic mesh approach for unmoored structures in openfoam is complicated later antonini et al 2016 2016a used overset meshing technique from star ccm to simulated oxyflux model s dynamic response and pumping performance in regular waves apart from validation study the papers also highlighted the effect of non linearity in such studies devolder et al 2017 simulated the heaving floating point absorber wave energy converters using openfoam based on two phase navier stokes fluid solver coupled with a motion solver he modified the built in sst k omega turbulence model by implementing a buoyancy term in the turbulent kinetic energy equation to supress turbulence level at the water and air interface bihs et al 2017 simulated a horizontal cylinder in heave free motion and the motion of a freely floating rectangular barge in waves using the cfd model reef3d and compared the results with experimental data they simulated the barge with different grid sizes and reported that a grid size of 0 01 m performed remarkably well nematbakhsh et al 2017 developed and verified a cfd code based on numerical wave tank to study the wave load effects on fixed and floating offshore structures of sway heave and roll response the paper observed that for fixed cylinder morison equation performs well for long wave lengths while for shorter ones it considerably over predicts the wave loads on the other hand mohapatra et al 2019 developed a boussinesq model to study the wave diffraction by a floating fixed truncated vertical cylinder in this study they compared the results of wave amplitudes around the cylinder between second order analytical results with cfd model simulations recently gadelho et al 2017 simulated the floating fixed box using openfoam and compared the results against boussinesq equation based analytical model and experimental results in different cases paci and archetti 2018 studied a spar type floating wind turbine using openfoam coupled with modified boundary conditions and turbulence model they successfully studied the applicability of the turbine in a particular location considering the wave history of that place islam et al 2018 also simulated a 3d heaving box in head waves using openfoam and compared the results with linear analytical results and experimental data however the box was simulated with only heave free motion and study of wave steepness effect was missing on the other hand the linearized velocity potential flow theory approaches based on analytical solutions for designing floating platforms wave energy devices and breakwaters are quite reliable and much less computational resource consuming thus linearized solutions are still in demand to set benchmarks many researchers have been involved in studying the radiation problem of floating structures of different geometries and configurations to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients wave forces reflection and transmission coefficients based on analytical semi analytical methods see lee 1995 hsu and wu 1997 zheng et al 2006 drobyshevski 2004 mohapatra and guedes soares 2015 studied the wave forces on a two dimensional rectangular floating structure based on linearized boussinesq equations using eigenmode expansion method ngina et al 2015 predicted the wave exciting force on a floating rectangular barge due to surface waves based on panel method with integral equations with the help of appropriate green s functions rodriguez et al 2016 investigated the numerical nonlinear heave response of a rectangular box concerning on the importance of the relative body dimensions further rodriguez and spinneken 2016 performed a series of experiments to analyse the nonlinear loading and dynamic response of a heaving rectangular box in two dimensions under regular and irregular wave conditions recently guo et al 2018 studied the oblique wave diffraction by a long floating structure over flat bottom by analysing the wave forces on the structure and reflection and transmission coefficients in different cases using eigenfunction expansion method generalising further the previous work of islam et al 2018 in the present study wave radiation due to heave surge and pitch motions of box type floating structure is studied by performing two dimensional 2d cfd simulations and the obtained results are compared against experimental and linearized analytical results in order to analyse measure the low high fidelity of the model the cfd numerical model is based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation and continuity equation whilst the linearized analytical model and its solutions are based on velocity potential flow theory the floating structure is modelled as box type structure over flat bottom with finite width and draft the numerical simulation is performed using the open source cfd toolkit openfoam with volume of fluid vof method whilst the linearized analytical solution is based on eigenfunction expansion method in order to analyse the effect of waves on the floating structure the results of the vertical motion of the floating structure due to incoming head waves have been compared against the experimental results rodriguez and spinneken 2016 and analytical solutions in 2d cases further the results of other raos and forces obtained from cfd are compared with numerical results available in the literature it is observed that the cfd results are in good agreement with the experimental data and linear analytical model results demonstrating reliability and high fidelity of the model 2 cfd model formulation and description the computational fluid dynamics cfd software used for the presented study is the open source cfd toolkit openfoam open source field operation and manipulation openfoam has an extensive range of features to solve complex fluid flows and a wide variety of applications including offshore and coastal engineering problems the solver has been elaborately discussed by jasak 1997 2009 for this case study the openfoam release version 2 4 0 was used together with waves2foam utility to run the simulations the version 2 4 0 is a stable version of openfoam which has been in use for a long time and is still being used by a large number of research groups although updated versions provide more utilities in some cases the used version was sufficient for the presented case studies for waves the library waves2foam was used to generate and absorb free surface water waves jacobsen et al 2012 the method applies the relaxation zone technique active sponge layers and supports a large number of wave theories and the relaxation zones can be of arbitrary shapes for the present study stokes second order waves were used the main solver is wavedymfoam which is based on the native solver interdymfoam and is described as a fully viscous solver for two incompressible and immiscible fluids to simulate the motion of the box because of incoming waves the openfoam built in mesh morphing technique with six degrees of freedom of motion sixdofrigidbodymotion solver is applied mesh morphing allows deformation of the mesh or the cells to accommodate the motion of the moving body the morphing area was defined in a manner that it would be enough to support the mesh deformation and would cause minimum distortion to the incoming waves the simulations were run with three outer correctors to have well resolved motion prediction 2 1 cfd mathematical model the governing equations for openfoam are the navier stokes equation and continuity equation for an incompressible laminar flow of a newtonian fluid in vector form the navier stokes equation is given by 1 ρ v t v v p μ 2 v ρ g where ν is the velocity p is the pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity g is acceleration due to gravity and 2 is the laplace operator further the continuity equation is of the form 2 v 0 the solver follows cartesian coordinate system and the volume of fluid method to track the free surface elevation this volume of fluid method determines the fraction of each fluid that exists in each cell the equation for the volume fraction is obtained as 3 α t α u 0 where u is the velocity field α is the volume fraction of water in the cell and varies from 0 to 1 full of air to full of water respectively the governing equation is initially discretized using finite volume method fvm and pressure velocity coupling is with piso algorithm openfoam offers both sst k omega and k epsilon turbulence models however for the presented 2 dimensional 2d studies the flow was considered laminar and no turbulence model has been used this was done to simplify the study since presence of turbulence model in low wave frequency wave tend to show higher dissipation of waves devolder et al 2017 2 2 meshing regarding the meshing openfoam can solve both structured and unstructured meshes for the presented simulation cases blockmesh utility was used to generate a structured outer domain with hexahedral mesh a uniform mesh resolution was applied in the 2 dimensional block mesh with cell size of 0 02 m in wave propagation direction x axis and cell size of 0 01in vertical direction y axis the box was integrated into the block using snappyhexmesh utility no further refinement was done in the block and near the box although the mesh resolution in vertical direction was not enough to provide 6 cells per wave height for all cases it was enough the capture the heaving motion of the box with acceptable accuracy naturally the prediction results improve with improved mesh resolution however considering the large number of simulation cases a mesh with higher resolution was avoided see fig 1 2 3 case setup the numerical setup was done following the experimental setup described by rodriguez and spinneken 2016 all the experiments reported by rodriguez and spinneken were performed in the long wave flume of hydrodynamics laboratory of imperial college london the wave flume is 63 m long 2 79 m in width and has a height of 1 25 m flap type wave makers were used for the study the experimental setup intended to produce almost two dimensional flow conditions for this purpose the width of the rectangular box was chosen to be 2 76 m leaving only a very small gap of 0 015 m to either of the flume s side walls a schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 the base experimental cases were performed for steepness aik 0 05 and 0 1 and kb value ranging from 0 2 to 1 2 with interval of 0 1 here k is the wave number and b is half of the length of the box following the experimental setup the numerical setup was produced to replicate a 2d wave flume with 31 5 m length and 1 25 m water depth the flume length was reduced to ensure less dissipation and also to save computational time for initial validation study a rectangular floating box with 0 5 m 0 5 m x 0 01 m dimensions length x height x width and a draft of 0 25 m was used with heave free motion although the simulations were performed in 2d a width is necessary since openfoam needs a 3d structure to simulate and it is turned into 2d by specifying side boundaries as empty thus the width of 0 01 m has no effect on the simulation later a box with 0 5 m 0 4 m x 0 01 m dimensions and a draft of 0 2 m was used for simulation with 3dof heave pitch and surge the box with a lower draft was used for later cases for better pitch stability the chosen cartesian coordinates x axis is parallel to the flume length and y axis is parallel to the flume height the origin in x axis and y axis are located in the centre of the domain 2 4 computational resource the simulations were performed in three computers with the configuration of intel r core i7 cpu with 8 cores clock speed 3 60 ghz and 16 gb of physical memory the simulations were performed in ubuntu operating system with openfoam version 2 4 0 the dynamic time step size was set following the bounding courant freidrichs lewy cfl number of 0 25 the length of the simulation time was decided based on the wave length to ensure stable sinusoidal output on an average each case took roughly 50 h to simulate 3 analytical model formulation and linearized solution the mathematical model of the physical problem is considered in three dimensional cartesian coordinate system x y z with x z being in the horizontal plane that coincides undisturbed water surface and the y axis being in the vertical downward positive direction the wave radiation due to the heave sway and roll motions of a rectangular structure floating on the free surface of width 2 b draft d and infinitely long in the z direction the origin o is assumed to be the middle point of the rectangular structure as in fig 3 hence the whole fluid domain is divided into three regions as defined by b x 0 y h b x b d y h and b x 0 y h are referred as r 1 r 2 and r 3 respectively the water is assumed to be inviscid incompressible and flow is irrotational and simple harmonic in time with angular frequency ω and also in the z direction thus there exists a velocity potential φ x y z t re ϕ x y z exp i ω t where re denotes the real part of the complex expression and ϕ x y z denotes the spatial velocity potential the potential ϕ x y z may be decomposed into the incident wave potential the diffracted potential due to the stationarity of the structure and the radiated potential due to the heave sway and roll motions of the floating structure are denoted by ϕ i ϕ d and ϕ r respectively so the total potential ϕ x y z can be expressed as see zheng et al 2006 4 ϕ ϕ i ϕ d s 1 3 ϕ r s where s 1 2 and 3 stand for heave sway and roll motions respectively assuming that a progressive wave interacts with a floating rectangular structure making an oblique angle θ with x axis and angular frequency ω thus the spatial incident velocity potential is of the form ϕ i x y z φ i x y e i γ z γ k 0 sin θ is the z component of the wave number k 0 associated with the incident waves therefore the incident wave potential of linear waves propagating to the negative x direction is given by 5 φ i i g i ω cosh k 0 h y cosh k 0 h e i p x where g is acceleration due to gravity i is the incident wave amplitude with the dimension of length and is taken as 1 without loss of any generality in the numerical computation and p k 0 cos θ is the x component of the wave number k 0 associated with the incident wave and k 0 satisfy the gravity wave dispersion relation as given by 6 ω 2 g k 0 tanh k 0 h assuming that the motions of the structure are small and the oscillations vary sinusoidally in the z direction this assumptions have been used previously by many researchers losada et al 1992 sannasiraj et al 1995 abul azm and williams 1997 abul azm and gesraha 2000 zheng et al 2006 and the amplitude of motion mode s of the floating structure is denoted by i r s thus the radiated potential ϕ r s can be expressed as 7 ϕ r s x y z i ω i r s φ r s x y e i γ z where φ r s is the spatial velocity potential independent of z which satisfies the reduced wave equation 8 x y 2 γ 2 φ r s 0 in the fluid domain where x y 2 2 x 2 2 y 2 is the two dimensional laplacian operator combining the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions the linearized boundary condition at the mean free surface is obtained as 9 φ r s y k φ r s 0 on y 0 for r 1 and r 3 where k ω 2 g the no flow conditions at the rigid bottom boundary are given by 10a φ r s y 0 on y h for r 1 r 2 and r 3 10b φ r s x 0 on x b the non homogeneous boundary condition due to the heave sway and roll motions of the floating rectangular structure is given by 11 φ r s y δ 1 s x x 0 δ 3 s on b x b y d the conditions on the rigid structural boundary are described as 12 φ r s x δ 2 s y y 0 δ 3 s at x b and 0 y d where x 0 y 0 is the centre of rotation for roll motion and δ kronecker delta function as defined by 13 δ j s 0 for j s 1 for j s further the radiation condition is assumed to take of the form 14 lim x φ r s x i p φ r s 0 the next section will obtain the analytical expressions for radiation potentials in each region and their solutions by satisfying the governing equations along with the relevant boundary conditions using the method of separation of variables in three regions r 1 r 2 and r 3 the radiated potentials φ r s satisfying 8 along with the relevant boundary

finite number of n terms present in eqs 15 17 once the unknown coefficients a 1 n s s a 2 n s s a 3 n s s and b 2 n s s for n 0 1 2 are determined then the full solution will be obtained in terms of radiated potentials as the floating structure is assumed to be infinite in the z direction and also the potential is periodic in the z direction hence only the wave forces acting on a cross section perpendicular to the z axis to be considered thus the wave forces in terms of incident and radiated potentials can be expressed as see zheng et al 2006 ngina et al 2015 36 f e j i ρ ω s b φ i x y n j d s s b φ r j x y φ i n d s for j 1 2 where s b denotes the wetted surface in x y plane and n j is the inward normal to the floating structure in the x y plane with n 1 n y n 2 n x and n 3 y y 0 n x x x 0 n y n x and n y are the components of unit normal to the floating structure the non dimensional wave forces of heave for j 1 vertical force sway for j 2 horizontal force and roll for j 3 torque motions are defined by 37 f j f e j 2 ρ g b i for j 1 2 f e j 2 ρ g b 2 i for j 3 in the next section the numerical cfd model of vertical force heave will be validated with the experimental model results and then also compared with linearized analytical model results for analyse the level of accuracy as physically vertical heave motion is of primary importance for the hydrodynamic analysis of a floating structure for designing wave energy converters 4 results and discussion a free floating box under wave encounter would experience principally three types of forces deflection diffraction and radiation the deflection and diffraction forces are caused by the interaction of the incident waves with the box whereas the radiation forces come from the radiated waves generated because of the motion of the box generally in cfd studies the body force is derived from the integrated pressure on the floating body during the encounter with the waves and motions are measured by tracking the centre of gravity location in this study instead of 3d a 2d box was simulated to ensure proper validation with the rodriguez and spinneken 2016 box case since the experimental setup was done in a manner to resemble a 2d case furthermore considering the large number of simulation cases 2d significantly reduces the computational time required comparing to 3d cases boxes with two different drafts were simulated one for the validation study with just heave free motion and the other for studying the 3 degrees of freedom dof cases with heave surge and pitch free motion this was done because the box with even length and draft b d has lower pitch stability since mooring was not used in the simulations the easiest solution to make the box pitch stable was to make the length longer than the height b d understandably such a configuration is not good for a wave energy converters wec since they have lower heave rao however the purpose of this paper is not to find the optimum configuration for a box type wec device rather to compare the cfd results with analytical model to understand the level of fidelity of the used analytical model to non dimentionalise the heave surge and pitch raos response amplitude operator and the surging and heaving force following equations were used 38 heave rao ζ h h i surge rao ζ s h i pitch rao θ λ h 360 f x f x ρ g d w h i f y f y ρ g d w h i where ζ h is the heave ζ s is the surge displacement h i is the incoming wave height θ is the total pitch displacement and λ is the incoming wave length further f x and f y are the dimensional surge and heave force respectively ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration b is the half length of the box d is the draft and w is the width 4 1 validation study initially a validation study was performed following the rodriguez and spinneken 2016 box case and the cfd simulation results were compared to their experimental results for validation study a 2d box with 0 5 0 5 m2 b 0 25 d 0 25 dimension was simulated in a numerical tank with length 31 5 m and 1 25 m depth the long domain was used to ensure enough space for the inlet relaxation zone and smooth propagation of wave to the box only heave rao results are provided from the experimental study for the heaving box thus these are the only results that were compared to ensure reliability of the results a grid convergence study was performed following ittc 2008 guidelines three different mesh resolutions were used coarse 0 078 million medium 0 35 million and fine 1 25 million in coarse mesh the cell spacing in x axis was 0 04 and in y axis 0 02 for medium mesh the spacing was 0 02 and 0 01 and for fine mesh it was 0 01 and 0 005 in x and y axis respectively both the cases that were studied for grid dependency showed monotonous convergence as shown in table 1 in the table øn is the solution result for the particular grid and hn is the cell size of mesh n the results significantly improve with improved mesh resolution however considering resource limitation for rest of all the simulations the medium mesh resolution was used the simulated cases are shown in table 2 and the simulation results together with experimental fluid dynamics efd results are shown in fig 4 as can be seen from table 2 simulations were performed for two different wave steepness and the cfd results show good agreement with experimental data fig 4 the slight deviation observed between the efd and cfd data is mostly because of insufficient mesh resolution and the results improve with higher resolution as shown in the grid dependency study the results also show that the heave response of the box is not linear for different wave steepness indicating the importance of using viscous non linear solvers for studying such structures here k represents the wave number b is half of the length of the floating fox ai is the incident wave amplitude and aik is the wave steepness h is the wave height t is the wave period and λ is the wave length fig 4 also shows that the heaving box shows optimum heave response for a wave length of around 3 m the experimental results also show that better response is observed for waves with less steepness however cfd at its present resolution fails to capture that properly except for near optimal performance area this is mostly because of the mesh resolution since the mesh resolution used for both wave steepness were the same higher amplitude cases has greater number of cell per wave height comparing to the low steepness cases as such low steepness cases face comparatively higher dissipation during propagation and under predict the estimations 4 2 comparison between cfd and analytical model with hydrodynamic effect on 3dof results in order to check the computational accuracy the convergence of the series solutions is demonstrated in table 3 by computing the values of hydrodynamic coefficients of heave sway and roll motions of the floating structure in two dimensional case from table 1 it is clear that the values of f j for j 1 2 3 are correct up to three decimal places for values of n greater than or equal to 30 thus for numerical accuracy the number of terms n in the radiation velocity potential formulae is restricted to 30 in the computation on the other hand it may be noted that as the bottom is flat it is considered that h1 h3 h and h2 h d fig 5 shows the comparison of cfd against linearized analytical results of non dimensional vertical wave force acting on the floating box versus kb it is observed that the cfd result is almost same with analytical model results for almost all values of kb and the vertical force behaviour pattern is similar in nature for both models however small deviation between them is observed for higher and lower values of kb which observation is similar as in islam et al 2018 these differences can be explained by the full non linearity solution of the cfd model while the solution of the analytical model is only of linear it is also suspected that the viscous effects considered in the cfd model can play an important part in the description of the wave force profile while these effects are neglected in the analytical approach the non dimensional forces for the heave sway and roll are shown in figs 6 8 respectively explicitly the variation of the non dimensional vertical wave force f 1 horizontal wave force f 2 and torque f 3 for different non dimensional width b h of the structure with d h 0 5 versus k 0 h are plotted it is observed that the vertical and horizontal wave forces decreases with increase in width of the structure which may be due to the interaction of incident and reflected waves in region 1 this observation is similar as in zheng et al 2006 and also same as in guo et al 2018 in case of wave diffraction by a floating rectangular structure on the other hand the torques increases with increase in the value of width of the structure for smaller value of wave number and its effect becomes opposite in nature for higher values of wave number however the horizontal wave force is less than that of vertical wave forces figs 9 11 plot the variations of the non dimensional vertical wave force f 1 horizontal wave force f 2 and torque f 3 respectively for different non dimensional draft d h with h l 1 2 versus k 0 h it is observed that the non dimensional vertical wave forces increases with decrease in draft whilst the horizontal force increases with increase in non dimensional draft this is due to the deeper drafts causes more horizontal load on the floating box and smaller load in vertical these observations are similar in the cases of oblique wave diffraction by a floating structure on a stepped bottom as in bhattacharjee and guedes soares 2011 the peaks are observed in torques for smaller values of wave number and it attends zero for lower value of non dimensional draft further the observations in vertical force for both width and draft are similar as in figs 5 and 8 4 3 cfd simulation results for floating box with 3 dof after validation and comparison study simulations were performed for the 2d box with 3dof heave surge and pitch with a different draft d 0 2 except the draft all other domain settings and mesh remained the same the simulation cases performed for the comparison study are shown in table 4 for comparison mostly high wave steepness cases were simulated the results for the heave surge and pitch raos are show in figs 12 14 respectively the heave rao results show that the shallower draft shows lower heave response for the low wave frequency cases however shows reduced motion in near resonance cases furthermore the wave steepness has very limited influence on heave response of the box comparing to the even length and height cases nevertheless the box follows very similar heaving motion pattern as observed in the experimental study the surge and pitch rao results show that the natural frequency for the surge and pitch motion for the box is not the same as that of the heave motion according to the results the natural frequency for the surge and pitch motion stands in the higher wavelength region comparing to the heave response furthermore the results also show minimum variation in the motion response due to difference in incoming wave steepness the results also indicate that comparing to the heave motion the surge and pitch response of the box is quite low the heave and surge force results are show in figs 15 and 16 the figures well represent the motion response figures the figures indicate that the heave force increases with the increasing wave period and the so does the surge force the raos are justified by the forces acting on them as the motions increase with the increasing force acting on them the pitch moment results have not been show here since the pitch moment showed a non sinusoidal response for proper capturing of the response and fft was essential thus it was avoided to further illustrate the results time history of the surge heave pitch motion and pitch moment for the wave period 0 96 s and wave height 0 045 m are shown is fig 17 because of the length of the simulation domain it takes roughly 10 s for the waves to reach the box thus motion response of the box due to the incoming waves is observed after 10 s both surge and heave motions show sinusoidal response to the incoming waves and the response remains the same over the time period as for the pitch motion the time history shows that before the box encounters the waves it oscillates in natural pitch frequency after facing the incoming waves the box aligns itself to the pitch stable condition which seems to be at around 2 25 and oscillates with the incoming waves the description can be supported by the pitch moment history which shows stable sinusoidal pitch moment to demonstrate the difference in response of the box due to changing wave conditions time history for the wave period 1 62 s with wave height of 0 125 m is also shown in fig 18 unlike previous case longer wave period and greater wave height shows more non linear behaviour for both the motions and the forces and moments to demonstrate the wave encounter by the box the hydrodynamic pressure field gained from the simulations for cases with wave period 0 96 and 1 62 s are shown in figs 19 and 20 respectively the figures show gradual wave encounter by the box the high and low pressure points indicate the wave crest and trough irrespective of the wave condition the box maintains a slight pitch angle indicating that the pitch stability is not at zero while encountering waves for the first case period 0 96s both the wave period and the wave height are small thus the response motions are also small as for the second case due to larger wave period and greater wave height the motion of the box is more pronounced the vortices generated below the box are also well visible the figures show that the box maintains a low pressure below while facing the wave crest and a high pressure while facing the wave trough this opposite pressure helps dampen the motion of the box while facing the waves 5 conclusions this paper studied the wave radiation due to a moving box type floating structure due to incoming waves and compared the vertical force results among the cfd experimental and linearized analytical model solution results further the simulated results of rao in cfd are also compared with experimental results available in the literature the validation and comparison of the numerical wave flume cfd for working with a box type floating structure based on experimental model data and the linearized velocity potential theory results are demonstrated to be successful however the paper does come with certain limitations in order to fully understand the behaviour of a box type energy converter a more realistic 3d model is essential the study ignores turbulence which might have some effect as well the study also ignores mooring which will play an essential role in motion control especially considering the shape and dimension of wave energy converters mooring is essential to maintain their stability and perform a realistic study thus addressing these limitations would be the principal focus in future studies nevertheless the study demonstrates that the open source cfd toolkit openfoam is a promising tool for studying hydrodynamics of wave energy converters furthermore the study also shows the capability of the linear analytical model in generating motion response results confirming that the analytical model might be a very promising tool for initial design study the study also demonstrates the potential of cfd modelling to investigate the interaction between water waves and wave energy

of simulating wave interaction behaviour of a box type floating structure for wave energy converters and the developed analytical model can serve as an efficient middle fidelity performance evaluation tool for such structures during design development stage keywords openfoam wave radiation response amplitude operator wave forces 1 introduction over the last decade there has been a significant interest on cfd modelling a large number of engineering problems associated with fluid structure interaction due to its level of accuracy and efficiency in handing of complex problems arising in marine and ocean engineering however there is little progress in the literature of wave interaction with floating bodies incorporating different motion characteristics for designing wave energy converters due to the recent advances in computational modelling cfd simulations can give deeper insight into the floating body hydrodynamics which can facilitate better design and optimized operating setup cfd is one of the popular approaches for modelling hydrodynamic loads on the floating structures of different geometries cfd methods which are based on solving navier stokes equations if properly solved can capture most of the nonlinear hydrodynamic loads on an offshore structure and can lead to very reliable results therefore recently the scientific community is interested in comparing the results of motion characteristics of floating structures of various geometries obtained from cfd simulations against experimental data and analytical results to set benchmarks box type floating structures are frequently used as breakwaters for small harbours and marinas black et al 1971 drimer et al 1992 sannasiraj et al 1995 williams et al 2000 huang et al 2015 the study of the radiation problem of box type floating structures based on cfd modelling are of recent interest as it can provide the fundamental information about the structures regarding the hydrodynamic characteristics of added mass radiation damping coefficients and wave forces under the excitation of waves a rigid floating body will exhibit six degrees of freedom namely three translations heave sway and surge and three rotational motions pitch yaw and roll practically vertical horizontal and rotational motions are of primary importance for the hydrodynamic analysis of a floating structure for designing wave energy converters recently several researchers have studied floating structures and wave energy converters based on cfd models holmes et al 2001 used cfd to predict the hydrodynamic loads on heave plates in simple harmonic motion and least mean square method was used to obtain the appropriate morison coefficients for the plates under variety of sea conditions jung et al 2013 studied numerically the interaction between a regular wave and a roll motion of a rectangular floating structure using vof method based on the finite volume method the results showed good agreement with potential theory and also effectively represented the process of vortex generation philip et al 2013 studied the heave damping effects due to circular plates attached to spar hull based on experimental investigation and cfd simulation to establish the relationship between wave frequencies and damping ratio they observed that increase in added mass combined with viscous damping is a key factor for the effectiveness of heave plates in reducing motion response of spar platforms which was also identified by lavrov and guedes soares 2016 chen et al 2014 simulated the wave induced roll of a 2d rectangular barge using openfoam in beam sea conditions and the results were validated with experimental results they concluded that viscous effect not only can damp out the roll motion but also can increase it connell and cashman 2015 compared the heave response of a freely floating body between a state space mathematical model and a navier stokes n s based time domain cfd program ansys fluent they conclude that a combined approach using both the models can make floating body study more efficient and less time consuming jaswar et al 2015 compared the semi submersible heave motion response prediction among diffraction diffraction viscous and diffraction morison methods based on diffraction potential flow theory the paper concluded that morison equation based drag correction method is able to estimate heave response in damping dominated regions and provides more reasonable motion tendency compared to other methods paci et al 2016 simulated the dynamics of a floating vertical cylinder moored to the bottom under regular waves using openfoam coupled with ihfoam they concluded that openfoam coupled with ihfoam is a reliable tool for studying floating body dynamics however they mentioned that dynamic mesh approach for unmoored structures in openfoam is complicated later antonini et al 2016 2016a used overset meshing technique from star ccm to simulated oxyflux model s dynamic response and pumping performance in regular waves apart from validation study the papers also highlighted the effect of non linearity in such studies devolder et al 2017 simulated the heaving floating point absorber wave energy converters using openfoam based on two phase navier stokes fluid solver coupled with a motion solver he modified the built in sst k omega turbulence model by implementing a buoyancy term in the turbulent kinetic energy equation to supress turbulence level at the water and air interface bihs et al 2017 simulated a horizontal cylinder in heave free motion and the motion of a freely floating rectangular barge in waves using the cfd model reef3d and compared the results with experimental data they simulated the barge with different grid sizes and reported that a grid size of 0 01 m performed remarkably well nematbakhsh et al 2017 developed and verified a cfd code based on numerical wave tank to study the wave load effects on fixed and floating offshore structures of sway heave and roll response the paper observed that for fixed cylinder morison equation performs well for long wave lengths while for shorter ones it considerably over predicts the wave loads on the other hand mohapatra et al 2019 developed a boussinesq model to study the wave diffraction by a floating fixed truncated vertical cylinder in this study they compared the results of wave amplitudes around the cylinder between second order analytical results with cfd model simulations recently gadelho et al 2017 simulated the floating fixed box using openfoam and compared the results against boussinesq equation based analytical model and experimental results in different cases paci and archetti 2018 studied a spar type floating wind turbine using openfoam coupled with modified boundary conditions and turbulence model they successfully studied the applicability of the turbine in a particular location considering the wave history of that place islam et al 2018 also simulated a 3d heaving box in head waves using openfoam and compared the results with linear analytical results and experimental data however the box was simulated with only heave free motion and study of wave steepness effect was missing on the other hand the linearized velocity potential flow theory approaches based on analytical solutions for designing floating platforms wave energy devices and breakwaters are quite reliable and much less computational resource consuming thus linearized solutions are still in demand to set benchmarks many researchers have been involved in studying the radiation problem of floating structures of different geometries and configurations to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients wave forces reflection and transmission coefficients based on analytical semi analytical methods see lee 1995 hsu and wu 1997 zheng et al 2006 drobyshevski 2004 mohapatra and guedes soares 2015 studied the wave forces on a two dimensional rectangular floating structure based on linearized boussinesq equations using eigenmode expansion method ngina et al 2015 predicted the wave exciting force on a floating rectangular barge due to surface waves based on panel method with integral equations with the help of appropriate green s functions rodriguez et al 2016 investigated the numerical nonlinear heave response of a rectangular box concerning on the importance of the relative body dimensions further rodriguez and spinneken 2016 performed a series of experiments to analyse the nonlinear loading and dynamic response of a heaving rectangular box in two dimensions under regular and irregular wave conditions recently guo et al 2018 studied the oblique wave diffraction by a long floating structure over flat bottom by analysing the wave forces on the structure and reflection and transmission coefficients in different cases using eigenfunction expansion method generalising further the previous work of islam et al 2018 in the present study wave radiation due to heave surge and pitch motions of box type floating structure is studied by performing two dimensional 2d cfd simulations and the obtained results are compared against experimental and linearized analytical results in order to analyse measure the low high fidelity of the model the cfd numerical model is based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation and continuity equation whilst the linearized analytical model and its solutions are based on velocity potential flow theory the floating structure is modelled as box type structure over flat bottom with finite width and draft the numerical simulation is performed using the open source cfd toolkit openfoam with volume of fluid vof method whilst the linearized analytical solution is based on eigenfunction expansion method in order to analyse the effect of waves on the floating structure the results of the vertical motion of the floating structure due to incoming head waves have been compared against the experimental results rodriguez and spinneken 2016 and analytical solutions in 2d cases further the results of other raos and forces obtained from cfd are compared with numerical results available in the literature it is observed that the cfd results are in good agreement with the experimental data and linear analytical model results demonstrating reliability and high fidelity of the model 2 cfd model formulation and description the computational fluid dynamics cfd software used for the presented study is the open source cfd toolkit openfoam open source field operation and manipulation openfoam has an extensive range of features to solve complex fluid flows and a wide variety of applications including offshore and coastal engineering problems the solver has been elaborately discussed by jasak 1997 2009 for this case study the openfoam release version 2 4 0 was used together with waves2foam utility to run the simulations the version 2 4 0 is a stable version of openfoam which has been in use for a long time and is still being used by a large number of research groups although updated versions provide more utilities in some cases the used version was sufficient for the presented case studies for waves the library waves2foam was used to generate and absorb free surface water waves jacobsen et al 2012 the method applies the relaxation zone technique active sponge layers and supports a large number of wave theories and the relaxation zones can be of arbitrary shapes for the present study stokes second order waves were used the main solver is wavedymfoam which is based on the native solver interdymfoam and is described as a fully viscous solver for two incompressible and immiscible fluids to simulate the motion of the box because of incoming waves the openfoam built in mesh morphing technique with six degrees of freedom of motion sixdofrigidbodymotion solver is applied mesh morphing allows deformation of the mesh or the cells to accommodate the motion of the moving body the morphing area was defined in a manner that it would be enough to support the mesh deformation and would cause minimum distortion to the incoming waves the simulations were run with three outer correctors to have well resolved motion prediction 2 1 cfd mathematical model the governing equations for openfoam are the navier stokes equation and continuity equation for an incompressible laminar flow of a newtonian fluid in vector form the navier stokes equation is given by 1 ρ v t v v p μ 2 v ρ g where ν is the velocity p is the pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity g is acceleration due to gravity and 2 is the laplace operator further the continuity equation is of the form 2 v 0 the solver follows cartesian coordinate system and the volume of fluid method to track the free surface elevation this volume of fluid method determines the fraction of each fluid that exists in each cell the equation for the volume fraction is obtained as 3 α t α u 0 where u is the velocity field α is the volume fraction of water in the cell and varies from 0 to 1 full of air to full of water respectively the governing equation is initially discretized using finite volume method fvm and pressure velocity coupling is with piso algorithm openfoam offers both sst k omega and k epsilon turbulence models however for the presented 2 dimensional 2d studies the flow was considered laminar and no turbulence model has been used this was done to simplify the study since presence of turbulence model in low wave frequency wave tend to show higher dissipation of waves devolder et al 2017 2 2 meshing regarding the meshing openfoam can solve both structured and unstructured meshes for the presented simulation cases blockmesh utility was used to generate a structured outer domain with hexahedral mesh a uniform mesh resolution was applied in the 2 dimensional block mesh with cell size of 0 02 m in wave propagation direction x axis and cell size of 0 01in vertical direction y axis the box was integrated into the block using snappyhexmesh utility no further refinement was done in the block and near the box although the mesh resolution in vertical direction was not enough to provide 6 cells per wave height for all cases it was enough the capture the heaving motion of the box with acceptable accuracy naturally the prediction results improve with improved mesh resolution however considering the large number of simulation cases a mesh with higher resolution was avoided see fig 1 2 3 case setup the numerical setup was done following the experimental setup described by rodriguez and spinneken 2016 all the experiments reported by rodriguez and spinneken were performed in the long wave flume of hydrodynamics laboratory of imperial college london the wave flume is 63 m long 2 79 m in width and has a height of 1 25 m flap type wave makers were used for the study the experimental setup intended to produce almost two dimensional flow conditions for this purpose the width of the rectangular box was chosen to be 2 76 m leaving only a very small gap of 0 015 m to either of the flume s side walls a schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 the base experimental cases were performed for steepness aik 0 05 and 0 1 and kb value ranging from 0 2 to 1 2 with interval of 0 1 here k is the wave number and b is half of the length of the box following the experimental setup the numerical setup was produced to replicate a 2d wave flume with 31 5 m length and 1 25 m water depth the flume length was reduced to ensure less dissipation and also to save computational time for initial validation study a rectangular floating box with 0 5 m 0 5 m x 0 01 m dimensions length x height x width and a draft of 0 25 m was used with heave free motion although the simulations were performed in 2d a width is necessary since openfoam needs a 3d structure to simulate and it is turned into 2d by specifying side boundaries as empty thus the width of 0 01 m has no effect on the simulation later a box with 0 5 m 0 4 m x 0 01 m dimensions and a draft of 0 2 m was used for simulation with 3dof heave pitch and surge the box with a lower draft was used for later cases for better pitch stability the chosen cartesian coordinates x axis is parallel to the flume length and y axis is parallel to the flume height the origin in x axis and y axis are located in the centre of the domain 2 4 computational resource the simulations were performed in three computers with the configuration of intel r core i7 cpu with 8 cores clock speed 3 60 ghz and 16 gb of physical memory the simulations were performed in ubuntu operating system with openfoam version 2 4 0 the dynamic time step size was set following the bounding courant freidrichs lewy cfl number of 0 25 the length of the simulation time was decided based on the wave length to ensure stable sinusoidal output on an average each case took roughly 50 h to simulate 3 analytical model formulation and linearized solution the mathematical model of the physical problem is considered in three dimensional cartesian coordinate system x y z with x z being in the horizontal plane that coincides undisturbed water surface and the y axis being in the vertical downward positive direction the wave radiation due to the heave sway and roll motions of a rectangular structure floating on the free surface of width 2 b draft d and infinitely long in the z direction the origin o is assumed to be the middle point of the rectangular structure as in fig 3 hence the whole fluid domain is divided into three regions as defined by b x 0 y h b x b d y h and b x 0 y h are referred as r 1 r 2 and r 3 respectively the water is assumed to be inviscid incompressible and flow is irrotational and simple harmonic in time with angular frequency ω and also in the z direction thus there exists a velocity potential φ x y z t re ϕ x y z exp i ω t where re denotes the real part of the complex expression and ϕ x y z denotes the spatial velocity potential the potential ϕ x y z may be decomposed into the incident wave potential the diffracted potential due to the stationarity of the structure and the radiated potential due to the heave sway and roll motions of the floating structure are denoted by ϕ i ϕ d and ϕ r respectively so the total potential ϕ x y z can be expressed as see zheng et al 2006 4 ϕ ϕ i ϕ d s 1 3 ϕ r s where s 1 2 and 3 stand for heave sway and roll motions respectively assuming that a progressive wave interacts with a floating rectangular structure making an oblique angle θ with x axis and angular frequency ω thus the spatial incident velocity potential is of the form ϕ i x y z φ i x y e i γ z γ k 0 sin θ is the z component of the wave number k 0 associated with the incident waves therefore the incident wave potential of linear waves propagating to the negative x direction is given by 5 φ i i g i ω cosh k 0 h y cosh k 0 h e i p x where g is acceleration due to gravity i is the incident wave amplitude with the dimension of length and is taken as 1 without loss of any generality in the numerical computation and p k 0 cos θ is the x component of the wave number k 0 associated with the incident wave and k 0 satisfy the gravity wave dispersion relation as given by 6 ω 2 g k 0 tanh k 0 h assuming that the motions of the structure are small and the oscillations vary sinusoidally in the z direction this assumptions have been used previously by many researchers losada et al 1992 sannasiraj et al 1995 abul azm and williams 1997 abul azm and gesraha 2000 zheng et al 2006 and the amplitude of motion mode s of the floating structure is denoted by i r s thus the radiated potential ϕ r s can be expressed as 7 ϕ r s x y z i ω i r s φ r s x y e i γ z where φ r s is the spatial velocity potential independent of z which satisfies the reduced wave equation 8 x y 2 γ 2 φ r s 0 in the fluid domain where x y 2 2 x 2 2 y 2 is the two dimensional laplacian operator combining the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions the linearized boundary condition at the mean free surface is obtained as 9 φ r s y k φ r s 0 on y 0 for r 1 and r 3 where k ω 2 g the no flow conditions at the rigid bottom boundary are given by 10a φ r s y 0 on y h for r 1 r 2 and r 3 10b φ r s x 0 on x b the non homogeneous boundary condition due to the heave sway and roll motions of the floating rectangular structure is given by 11 φ r s y δ 1 s x x 0 δ 3 s on b x b y d the conditions on the rigid structural boundary are described as 12 φ r s x δ 2 s y y 0 δ 3 s at x b and 0 y d where x 0 y 0 is the centre of rotation for roll motion and δ kronecker delta function as defined by 13 δ j s 0 for j s 1 for j s further the radiation condition is assumed to take of the form 14 lim x φ r s x i p φ r s 0 the next section will obtain the analytical expressions for radiation potentials in each region and their solutions by satisfying the governing equations along with the relevant boundary conditions using the method of separation of variables in three regions r 1 r 2 and r 3 the radiated potentials φ r s satisfying 8 along with the relevant boundary conditions 9 14 are expanded as as in islam et al 2018 15 φ r 1 s a 10 s e i p 0 x b u 0 y n 1 a 1 n s e p n x b u n y 16 φ r 2 s cosh α 0 h y α 0 sinh α 0 h d δ 1 s x x 0 δ 3 s n 0 a 2 n s e α n x b

finite number of n terms present in eqs 15 17 once the unknown coefficients a 1 n s s a 2 n s s a 3 n s s and b 2 n s s for n 0 1 2 are determined then the full solution will be obtained in terms of radiated potentials as the floating structure is assumed to be infinite in the z direction and also the potential is periodic in the z direction hence only the wave forces acting on a cross section perpendicular to the z axis to be considered thus the wave forces in terms of incident and radiated potentials can be expressed as see zheng et al 2006 ngina et al 2015 36 f e j i ρ ω s b φ i x y n j d s s b φ r j x y φ i n d s for j 1 2 where s b denotes the wetted surface in x y plane and n j is the inward normal to the floating structure in the x y plane with n 1 n y n 2 n x and n 3 y y 0 n x x x 0 n y n x and n y are the components of unit normal to the floating structure the non dimensional wave forces of heave for j 1 vertical force sway for j 2 horizontal force and roll for j 3 torque motions are defined by 37 f j f e j 2 ρ g b i for j 1 2 f e j 2 ρ g b 2 i for j 3 in the next section the numerical cfd model of vertical force heave will be validated with the experimental model results and then also compared with linearized analytical model results for analyse the level of accuracy as physically vertical heave motion is of primary importance for the hydrodynamic analysis of a floating structure for designing wave energy converters 4 results and discussion a free floating box under wave encounter would experience principally three types of forces deflection diffraction and radiation the deflection and diffraction forces are caused by the interaction of the incident waves with the box whereas the radiation forces come from the radiated waves generated because of the motion of the box generally in cfd studies the body force is derived from the integrated pressure on the floating body during the encounter with the waves and motions are measured by tracking the centre of gravity location in this study instead of 3d a 2d box was simulated to ensure proper validation with the rodriguez and spinneken 2016 box case since the experimental setup was done in a manner to resemble a 2d case furthermore considering the large number of simulation cases 2d significantly reduces the computational time required comparing to 3d cases boxes with two different drafts were simulated one for the validation study with just heave free motion and the other for studying the 3 degrees of freedom dof cases with heave surge and pitch free motion this was done because the box with even length and draft b d has lower pitch stability since mooring was not used in the simulations the easiest solution to make the box pitch stable was to make the length longer than the height b d understandably such a configuration is not good for a wave energy converters wec since they have lower heave rao however the purpose of this paper is not to find the optimum configuration for a box type wec device rather to compare the cfd results with analytical model to understand the level of fidelity of the used analytical model to non dimentionalise the heave surge and pitch raos response amplitude operator and the surging and heaving force following equations were used 38 heave rao ζ h h i surge rao ζ s h i pitch rao θ λ h 360 f x f x ρ g d w h i f y f y ρ g d w h i where ζ h is the heave ζ s is the surge displacement h i is the incoming wave height θ is the total pitch displacement and λ is the incoming wave length further f x and f y are the dimensional surge and heave force respectively ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration b is the half length of the box d is the draft and w is the width 4 1 validation study initially a validation study was performed following the rodriguez and spinneken 2016 box case and the cfd simulation results were compared to their experimental results for validation study a 2d box with 0 5 0 5 m2 b 0 25 d 0 25 dimension was simulated in a numerical tank with length 31 5 m and 1 25 m depth the long domain was used to ensure enough space for the inlet relaxation zone and smooth propagation of wave to the box only heave rao results are provided from the experimental study for the heaving box thus these are the only results that were compared to ensure reliability of the results a grid convergence study was performed following ittc 2008 guidelines three different mesh resolutions were used coarse 0 078 million medium 0 35 million and fine 1 25 million in coarse mesh the cell spacing in x axis was 0 04 and in y axis 0 02 for medium mesh the spacing was 0 02 and 0 01 and for fine mesh it was 0 01 and 0 005 in x and y axis respectively both the cases that were studied for grid dependency showed monotonous convergence as shown in table 1 in the table øn is the solution result for the particular grid and hn is the cell size of mesh n the results significantly improve with improved mesh resolution however considering resource limitation for rest of all the simulations the medium mesh resolution was used the simulated cases are shown in table 2 and the simulation results together with experimental fluid dynamics efd results are shown in fig 4 as can be seen from table 2 simulations were performed for two different wave steepness and the cfd results show good agreement with experimental data fig 4 the slight deviation observed between the efd and cfd data is mostly because of insufficient mesh resolution and the results improve with higher resolution as shown in the grid dependency study the results also show that the heave response of the box is not linear for different wave steepness indicating the importance of using viscous non linear solvers for studying such structures here k represents the wave number b is half of the length of the floating fox ai is the incident wave amplitude and aik is the wave steepness h is the wave height t is the wave period and λ is the wave length fig 4 also shows that the heaving box shows optimum heave response for a wave length of around 3 m the experimental results also show that better response is observed for waves with less steepness however cfd at its present resolution fails to capture that properly except for near optimal performance area this is mostly because of the mesh resolution since the mesh resolution used for both wave steepness were the same higher amplitude cases has greater number of cell per wave height comparing to the low steepness cases as such low steepness cases face comparatively higher dissipation during propagation and under predict the estimations 4 2 comparison between cfd and analytical model with hydrodynamic effect on 3dof results in order to check the computational accuracy the convergence of the series solutions is demonstrated in table 3 by computing the values of hydrodynamic coefficients of heave sway and roll motions of the floating structure in two dimensional case from table 1 it is clear that the values of f j for j 1 2 3 are correct up to three decimal places for values of n greater than or equal to 30 thus for numerical accuracy the number of terms n in the radiation velocity potential formulae is restricted to 30 in the computation on the other hand it may be noted that as the bottom is flat it is considered that h1 h3 h and h2 h d fig 5 shows the comparison of cfd against linearized analytical results of non dimensional vertical wave force acting on the floating box versus kb it is observed that the cfd result is almost same with analytical model results for almost all values of kb and the vertical force behaviour pattern is similar in nature for both models however small deviation between them is observed for higher and lower values of kb which observation is similar as in islam et al 2018 these differences can be explained by the full non linearity solution of the cfd model while the solution of the analytical model is only of linear it is also suspected that the viscous effects considered in the cfd model can play an important part in the description of the wave force profile while these effects are neglected in the analytical approach the non dimensional forces for the heave sway and roll are shown in figs 6 8 respectively explicitly the variation of the non dimensional vertical wave force f 1 horizontal wave force f 2 and torque f 3 for different non dimensional width b h of the structure with d h 0 5 versus k 0 h are plotted it is observed that the vertical and horizontal wave forces decreases with increase in width of the structure which may be due to the interaction of incident and reflected waves in region 1 this observation is similar as in zheng et al 2006 and also same as in guo et al 2018 in case of wave diffraction by a floating rectangular structure on the other hand the torques increases with increase in the value of width of the structure for smaller value of wave number and its effect becomes opposite in nature for higher values of wave number however the horizontal wave force is less than that of vertical wave forces figs 9 11 plot the variations of the non dimensional vertical wave force f 1 horizontal wave force f 2 and torque f 3 respectively for different non dimensional draft d h with h l 1 2 versus k 0 h it is observed that the non dimensional vertical wave forces increases with decrease in draft whilst the horizontal force increases with increase in non dimensional draft this is due to the deeper drafts causes more horizontal load on the floating box and smaller load in vertical these observations are similar in the cases of oblique wave diffraction by a floating structure on a stepped bottom as in bhattacharjee and guedes soares 2011 the peaks are observed in torques for smaller values of wave number and it attends zero for lower value of non dimensional draft further the observations in vertical force for both width and draft are similar as in figs 5 and 8 4 3 cfd simulation results for floating box with 3 dof after validation and comparison study simulations were performed for the 2d box with 3dof heave surge and pitch with a different draft d 0 2 except the draft all other domain settings and mesh remained the same the simulation cases performed for the comparison study are shown in table 4 for comparison mostly high wave steepness cases were simulated the results for the heave surge and pitch raos are show in figs 12 14 respectively the heave rao results show that the shallower draft shows lower heave response for the low wave frequency cases however shows reduced motion in near resonance cases furthermore the wave steepness has very limited influence on heave response of the box comparing to the even length and height cases nevertheless the box follows very similar heaving motion pattern as observed in the experimental study the surge and pitch rao results show that the natural frequency for the surge and pitch motion for the box is not the same as that of the heave motion according to the results the natural frequency for the surge and pitch motion stands in the higher wavelength region comparing to the heave response furthermore the results also show minimum variation in the motion response due to difference in incoming wave steepness the results also indicate that comparing to the heave motion the surge and pitch response of the box is quite low the heave and surge force results are show in figs 15 and 16 the figures well represent the motion response figures the figures indicate that the heave force increases with the increasing wave period and the so does the surge force the raos are justified by the forces acting on them as the motions increase with the increasing force acting on them the pitch moment results have not been show here since the pitch moment showed a non sinusoidal response for proper capturing of the response and fft was essential thus it was avoided to further illustrate the results time history of the surge heave pitch motion and pitch moment for the wave period 0 96 s and wave height 0 045 m are shown is fig 17 because of the length of the simulation domain it takes roughly 10 s for the waves to reach the box thus motion response of the box due to the incoming waves is observed after 10 s both surge and heave motions show sinusoidal response to the incoming waves and the response remains the same over the time period as for the pitch motion the time history shows that before the box encounters the waves it oscillates in natural pitch frequency after facing the incoming waves the box aligns itself to the pitch stable condition which seems to be at around 2 25 and oscillates with the incoming waves the description can be supported by the pitch moment history which shows stable sinusoidal pitch moment to demonstrate the difference in response of the box due to changing wave conditions time history for the wave period 1 62 s with wave height of 0 125 m is also shown in fig 18 unlike previous case longer wave period and greater wave height shows more non linear behaviour for both the motions and the forces and moments to demonstrate the wave encounter by the box the hydrodynamic pressure field gained from the simulations for cases with wave period 0 96 and 1 62 s are shown in figs 19 and 20 respectively the figures show gradual wave encounter by the box the high and low pressure points indicate the wave crest and trough irrespective of the wave condition the box maintains a slight pitch angle indicating that the pitch stability is not at zero while encountering waves for the first case period 0 96s both the wave period and the wave height are small thus the response motions are also small as for the second case due to larger wave period and greater wave height the motion of the box is more pronounced the vortices generated below the box are also well visible the figures show that the box maintains a low pressure below while facing the wave crest and a high pressure while facing the wave trough this opposite pressure helps dampen the motion of the box while facing the waves 5 conclusions this paper studied the wave radiation due to a moving box type floating structure due to incoming waves and compared the vertical force results among the cfd experimental and linearized analytical model solution results further the simulated results of rao in cfd are also compared with experimental results available in the literature the validation and comparison of the numerical wave flume cfd for working with a box type floating structure based on experimental model data and the linearized velocity potential theory results are demonstrated to be successful however the paper does come with certain limitations in order to fully understand the behaviour of a box type energy converter a more realistic 3d model is essential the study ignores turbulence which might have some effect as well the study also ignores mooring which will play an essential role in motion control especially considering the shape and dimension of wave energy converters mooring is essential to maintain their stability and perform a realistic study thus addressing these limitations would be the principal focus in future studies nevertheless the study demonstrates that the open source cfd toolkit openfoam is a promising tool for studying hydrodynamics of wave energy converters furthermore the study also shows the capability of the linear analytical model in generating motion response results confirming that the analytical model might be a very promising tool for initial design study the study also demonstrates the potential of cfd modelling to investigate the interaction between water waves and wave energy

amount of minerals and rich aquatic life are available in the ocean these are indispensable to the needs of rapidly growing human population and are pivotal for further development and urbanization since the human population is increasing and the useable land is scarce in comparison with the increasing population therefore researchers and scientists have resorted to water based structures for creating artificial land in the ocean further the artificial land the floating structures such as floating wind turbines oscillating water columns can be used for the creation of energy for effective utilization of marine infrastructures like marinas docks along the coastlines and offshore structures they need to be safeguarded from wave attacks to which these are continuously exposed breakwater is one such device which serves the purpose of protecting marine structures extensive studies have been performed on the performance of breakwaters like rubble mounds or caissons to reduce wave height but practically the construction of these breakwaters is restricted by a number of factors like their construction is very expensive in deep water regions moreover the interrupted sediment flow and interfered fish mobilization is observed in the vicinity of such breakwaters therefore the floating breakwaters is an effective alternative to such type of conventional breakwaters as they are economic solutions to provide the protection near the free surface where wave energy is highly concentrated very recently a detailed analysis of developments in floating type breakwaters can be found in an extensive review paper by dai et al 2018 when the interest is to protect harbours and beaches the main focus will be for the reduction of transmission of energy for which a suitable option can be the use of rigid barriers as breakwaters based on eigenfunction matching method losada et al 1992 and abul azm 1993 investigated the efficiency of different configurations of a rigid thin

newman 1974 discussed results on scattering of water waves by two parallel surface piercing plates in deep waters among rigid breakwaters other than plates conventional structures such as box type cylindrical and trapezoidal type are important the performance of the box type structure is anticipated to increase with the inclusion of a rigid or porous plate at the front wall of the box as studied by koutandos and prinos 2011 dalrymple et al 1991 presented various results on reflection and transmission coefficients from porous structures for obliquely incident waves sahoo et al 2000 studied the trapping of water waves by porous barriers in the finite depth of fluid they showed that when the distance between the wall and the breakwater is an integral multiple of wavelength then optimum wave reflection is attained lee and chwang 2000 examined scattering and radiation problems of water waves by permeable barriers using eigenfunction matching method manam and sahoo 2005 studied the scattering of water waves by porous structures in two layer fluid and derived the oblique line source wave potentials for finite and infinite depth of water depending on the presence of the source in the fluid domain similar work on porous plate structures can also be found in chwang and wu 1994 and references cited therein cho and kim 2008 cho and kim 2013 investigated the problem of water wave scattering by submerged and inclined porous plate using boundary integral equation method and eigenfunction matching method and concluded that the suitable structural porosity effectively attenuates wave reflection and transmission they authenticated their results through experiments hsu and wu 1998 employed a boundary integral equation method to study the scattering of water waves by a horizontal plate in the presence of permeable breakwater at the sea bed li et al 2003 presented a mathematical study on the water wave reflection by double layered perforated wall breakwater with an impermeable back wall a comparison of numerical results obtained using eigenfunction matching method with experimental data authenticated their methodology liu et al 2007 developed an analytical solution based on linear water wave theory for the interaction of water waves with a perforated wall breakwater comprising a porous front wall solid back wall and a horizontal porous plate installed between the two vertical walls the numerical results showed exact matching with the predictions of the work of yip and chwang 2000 who studied the efficiency of a perforated wall breakwater and a submerged horizontal rigid plate for wave reflection the use of double or more number of barriers has also been investigated by many researchers see twu and lin 1991a b losada et al 1993 isaacson et al 1999 studied the scattering of water waves by double slotted partial barriers using eigenfunction matching method and presented various results on reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients behera et al 2015 studied the scattering of water waves by porous structures over a step type bottom they employed a modified mild slope equation in conjunction with the eigenfunction expansion method and presented results on reflection and transmission of waves with the consideration of attenuating wave heights more efficiently and also to save construction cost of breakwaters various different forms of fixed and floating structures have been suggested in the past refer neelamani and rajendran 2002a b günaydın and kabdaşlı 2004 investigated experimentally the performance of u type breakwaters under regular and irregular waves they expressed parameters involved in the study as a dimensionless group using π theory very recently deng et al 2019 used eigenfunction matching method in conjunction with gegenbauer polynomials as auxiliary functions to study the hydrodynamic performance of a t shaped floating breakwater in all the aforementioned studies the use of vertical porous barrier single multiple is analysed researchers have studied the role of submerged horizontal porous plates also in the literature the researchers have investigated box type breakwaters by taking one wall of the box being porous many researchers analysed the functionality of double barrier in reflecting and dissipating wave energy so motivated by these studies we wanted to propose and study the effectiveness of a open box type breakwater with two vertical barrier and one submerged barrier all three sides of the box being porous so in totality we investigated the performance of a breakwater composed of three different structures this shall be a new addition to the type of breakwaters and can be of help in ocean engineering problems the present paper deals with the study of scattering of water waves by a surface piercing porous box with the assumptions of the linear theory of water waves and flow past porous structures based on darcy s law the physical problem is formulated mathematically which is then solved using eigenfunction matching method the study aims to find the performance of a porous box in attenuating wave reflection and transmission the role of structural parameters and wave parameters is analysed through various graphs it is observed that the surface piercing porous box type breakwater effectively reduce wave reflection as well as wave transmission when structural porosity and dimensions of the box are chosen appropriately 2 mathematical formulation an obliquely incident small amplitude and regular wave having angular frequency ω is considered to propagate past a floating a surface piercing porous box in water of depth h the box is composed of rectangular type surface where the vertical plates are located at x a and the horizontal plate is located at y d see fig 1 a cartesian coordinate system is considered to represent the physical problem where the origin is taken at the midpoint between the vertical plates the fluid domain is extended along the z axis in the horizontal direction where the x z plane is the horizontal plane with θ being the angle made with x axis y is measured positive in the vertically downwards direction for linear water wave theory to be applicable wave height is taken to be small enough and fluid under consideration is assumed to be inviscid incompressible and irrotational thereby the motion of the fluid is characterized by the velocity potential φ of the form 2 1 φ x y z t ℜ ϕ x y e i k z z i ω t where ℜ denotes the real part of the argument and k z k 0 sin θ is the

moreover for g 3 0 it reduces to dispersion relation for wave interaction with a submerged impermeable plate on the other hand in the case of submerged porous plate all the roots of the dispersion relation 3 8 are complex in nature in the present study newton raphson s method is used to evaluate the roots of this complex dispersion relation moreover the contour plots are used to obtain the initial guess of the root in the newton raphson s method as discussed in behera and sahoo 2015 the eigenfunctions ψ m for m 0 1 2 in the open water region are orthogonal and satisfy the orthogonality

linear algebraic equations in 4 n 4 unknowns this system is solved numerically to obtain the set of unknowns after the determination of the unknown constants a series of physical quantities useful in engineering practices are evaluated for example hydrodynamic forces and the free surface elevations the effectiveness of this porous box placed as a breakwater can be studied through reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients which are computed respectively as follows 3 15 k r r 0 k t t 0 and k d 1 k r 2 k t 2 moreover the non dimensionalized forces on the sea side lee side and

is considered to be incident at an angle θ 3 0 o the convergence of the numerical solutions with the number of evanescent modes n is listed in table 1 for different values of k 0 h and for fixed values of h 10 m a h 0 5 and g 1 g 2 g 3 1 0 5 i it is seen that the acceptable convergence of the present solution is obtained at n 10 thus for all numerical computation n 10 is kept fixed on taking porous effect parameters g 1 g 2 g 3 0 the problem reduces to scattering of water waves by a rigid dock as shown in fig 2 a the parameters as given in mciver 1985 are chosen for fig 2 a it is seen that results of present problem are in agreement with the results of mciver 1985 further for the validation of the model numerical results are compared with the experimental and theoretical work of li et al 2006 in fig 2 b it is observed that present model on taking g 2 g 3 10000 matches very well with the theoretical and experimental study on scattering of water waves by thin permeable barrier two particular cases i scattering of water waves by single porous barrier on taking porous effect parameters g 2 1 g 1 g 3 1000 assuming large value and ii scattering of water waves by double porous barriers when g 3 is very large are shown in figs 3 a and 3 b respectively in fig 3 a the observation matches with the results of lee and chwang 2000 in fig 3 b it is seen that results of present problem are almost similar to that of isaacson et al 1999 figs 2 and 3 reflect the validation of the method presented herein fig 4 a shows the reflection and transmission coefficients as a function of k 0 h for different submergence depth d h of the box wave reflection and transmission show oscillatory behaviour and the amplitude of oscillations appears to be increasing as k 0 h increases the oscillatory pattern in wave reflection and transmission is due to the resonating interactions between the two vertical sides of the box and the submerged horizontal plate of the box also it is observed that along increasing k 0 h wave reflection increases with increase in submergence depth of the vertical plate except for 1 7 k 0 h 4 this increase in reflection is due to the effectiveness of the vertical side of the box in reflecting wave energy but in case of wave transmission an increasing trend is noticed with an increase in d h for a larger k 0 h fig 4 b shows the variations in energy dissipation coefficient as a function of k 0 h for varied d h it is observed that the energy dissipation is more when the submerged porous plate is nearer to the free surface which is due to the more wave energy concentration at the free surface further it is noticed that the wave energy dissipation follows an oscillatory pattern and amplitude of the oscillations increases as d h increases the behaviour of energy dissipation and wave reflection coefficients are exactly opposite to each other as observed in fig 4 the point of maximum reflection in waves corresponds to minimum energy dissipation as seen in figs 4 a and 4 b fig 5 a shows the variation in wave reflection and wave transmission as a function of k 0 h for box with varied width a h with increase in a h both wave reflection and transmission show a substantial decrease due to increased dissipation of energy by horizontal plate of the box and there is an oscillatory behaviour in wave reflection also the number of oscillations increases with increase in a h inherently due to increased mutual interactions of waves in the confined interior of the box in fig 5 b the variations in energy dissipation coefficient for different a h is presented it is observed that with increase in a h dissipation coefficient increases thereby depicting that large a h results high dissipation of energy wave reflection and energy dissipation depict opposite pattern as found in fig 5 b fig 6 a shows the variation in wave reflection and transmission versus k 0 h for different porous effect parameter values it is found that reflection increases as k 0 h increases from smaller to intermediate wave number and then as wave number increases further reflection begins to decrease there is an increase in wave reflection for 0 k 0 h 2 because a surface piercing barrier is not very much effective to obstruct long waves but as wave number further increases i e in the short wave region the surface piercing vertical sides of the box become effective in obstructing the waves and thus a continuous oscillatory pattern is observed further a decrease in wave reflection is observed which is primarily due to increase in absolute value of porous effect parameter g increasing porous effect parameter makes barrier more transparent thereby reducing wave reflection and increasing wave transmission in case of transmission of water waves it decreases for smaller to intermediate wave number and it increases for intermediate to larger wave number this is mainly due to the wave energy distributed uniformly over the depth for small wave numbers and it is primarily accumulated near the free surface for large wave numbers with an increase in porous effect parameter values a reduced wave reflection is observed and consequently an increased transmission is seen due to the smooth flow of fluid and lesser resistance offered by the box it is also clearly visible from the figure that porous box helps in reducing reflection of wave energy as compared to the impermeable box fig 6 b shows the variations in energy dissipation coefficient as a function of k 0 h for different g 1 it is observed that for small to intermediate wave number values dissipation of energy increases with an increase in absolute value of porous effect parameter further as wave number takes large values increase in porosity leads to decreased dissipation of energy fig 7 a shows the variation in k r and k t versus θ for different submergence depth of the box as θ increases k r increases and k t decreases also with increase in submergence depth an increase in transmission and reflection as a function of θ is observed further fig 7 b shows the variation in wave reflection and transmission versus θ for different a h values as a h increases wave reflection rises along increasing θ and opposite trend is observed in transmission of waves this fact is apprehended by the argument that larger a h implies longer horizontal plate resulting more reflection and dissipation and less transmission fig 8 shows the variation in wave reflection and transmission versus θ for different g 1 here wave reflection reduces significantly as absolute value of porous effect parameters increases and a moderate increase in wave transmission is observed this is due to the fact that large porous effect parameter implies more dissipation of wave energy resulting less reflection and consequently more transmission in fig 9 the results of wave reflection and transmission are plotted as a function of 2 a λ for different values of g 1 it is observed that as 2 a λ increases wave reflection decreases in amplitude further with an increase in absolute values of the porous effect parameters there will be dissipation of energy and hence there is a significant reduction in wave reflection as plate length 2 a λ increases the mutual interaction between the vertical plate and horizontal plate of the box results in an oscillatory pattern in wave reflection and opposite trend is observed in wave transmission as 2 a λ further increases the oscillatory pattern in k r vanishes and k t curve descends to zero fig 10 a shows the result of wave reflection and transmission as a function of 2 a λ for different θ it is observed that as 2 a λ increases the wave reflection shows an oscillatory pattern which is decreasing continuously in amplitude which is due to the same fact as explained in fig 9 moreover it is observed that with increase in θ wave reflection increases and transmission decreases also wave reflection shows a phase shift towards increasing 2 a λ which is due to increasing θ fig 10 b shows the variation in wave reflection and transmission for different d h a similar pattern of increase in transmission of waves is observed as noticed in fig 7 a with increasing d h the amplitude of reflection increases due to the fact that larger vertical barrier length results higher wave reflection however it is seen that the amplitude of reflection decreases along increasing 2 a λ which is due to increased dissipation of energy with increase in 2 a λ fig 11 shows the variation of forces exerted on the sea side lee side and bottom of the structure f 1 f 2 and f 3 respectively as a function of θ for different values of g 1 from these figures it is seen that with an increase in θ the wave force decreases as noticed moreover with increase in g 1 force f 1 decreases because with increase in porosity reflection decreases and consequently wave transmission increases thereby force f 2 increases on lee side vertical plate on the other hand wave force f 3 increases with an increase in porous effect parameter which is due to increased transmission of waves towards the lee side of the box resulting in large force exerted on the horizontal part of the box fig 12 shows the variation in forces f 1 f 2 f 3 respectively as a function of k 0 h for different values of a h in fig 12 a f 1 reduces in amplitude as a h increases because the dissipation is increased with an increase in submerged plate length as observed in fig 12 a it is also noticed in fig 12 b that force decreases with increase in a h values the reduced force on both vertical plates is due to the increased dissipation of energy with an increase in a h in fig 12 c with increase in a h the force f 3 on submerged plate of the box increases because larger plate length exerts more force on the submerged horizontal plate of the box fig 13 shows the variation in force on the three sides of the box respectively as a function of k 0 h for different values of g 1 in fig 13 a as porous effect parameter value increases the force f 1 is reduced this is due to the decrease in reflection of water waves with the increase in the porous effect parameter as observed in fig 6 a from fig 13 b one may see that with an increase in porous effect parameter lesser force on the lee side of the box is exerted this is supported by the behaviour of transmission of waves as noticed in fig 6 a wherein long wave region transmission is not affected by porous effect parameter thus force in long wave zone remains unaffected in addition with an increase in porous effect parameter wave transmission increases from intermediate to short wave region thereby force on the lee side of the box reduces with increase in the porous effect parameter fig 13 c shows the variation in f 3 versus k 0 h with an increase in g 1 values the force exerted on the base of the box increases in the long wave region and decreases in intermediate to short water region the variation in amplitude of free surface elevation for the different porous effect parameter is shown in fig 14 a it is observed that as porous effect parameter increases more wave energy is dissipated by the porous sides of the box and thus the amplitude of the free surface elevation is reduced in fig 14 b when the depth of submergence of the box is increased the amplitude of free surface elevation reduces in the windward direction which is due to the increase in reflection of waves further in fig 14 c angle of incidence θ plays an imperative role in wave attenuation when θ increases the amplitude of free surface elevation is reduced in the lee side of the box also a phase shift occurs due to a change in θ 5 conclusion the present study outlines the performance of a surface piercing porous box floating at the free surface in attenuating wave reflection and wave height in the finite depth of fluid using the eigenfunction matching technique the associated boundary value problem is reduced into a system of linear algebraic equations which is solved numerically the study reveals that the wave reflection decreases with an increase in structural porosity whilst the reverse trend in wave transmission occurs with an increase in structural porosity of the barrier the amplitude of free surface elevation is reduced by suitably selecting the values of the porous effect parameter the reflection pattern depends on the oblique angle of incidence with an increase in angle of incidence the reflection coefficient increases with a shift in phase thus it is observed that a porous box of suitable configurations can attenuate wave height effectively however for better understanding about the flow behaviour around the structure and role of viscosity a computational fluid dynamics based model will be required which is beyond the scope of the present study and can be considered as a different study the concept and methodology discussed in the present paper can be

the scattering of water waves by porous structures in two layer fluid and derived the oblique line source wave potentials for finite and infinite depth of water depending on the presence of the source in the fluid domain similar work on porous plate structures can also be found in chwang and wu 1994 and references cited therein cho and kim 2008 cho and kim 2013 investigated the problem of water wave scattering by submerged and inclined porous plate using boundary integral equation method and eigenfunction matching method and concluded that the suitable structural porosity effectively attenuates wave reflection and transmission they authenticated their results through experiments hsu and wu 1998 employed a boundary integral equation method to study the scattering of water waves by a horizontal plate in the presence of permeable breakwater at the sea bed li et al 2003 presented a mathematical study on the water wave reflection by double layered perforated wall breakwater with an impermeable back wall a comparison of numerical results obtained using eigenfunction matching method with experimental data authenticated their methodology liu et al 2007 developed an analytical solution based on linear water wave theory for the interaction of water waves with a perforated wall breakwater comprising a porous front wall solid back wall and a horizontal porous plate installed between the two vertical walls the numerical results showed exact matching with the predictions of the work of yip and chwang 2000 who studied the efficiency of a perforated wall breakwater and a submerged horizontal rigid plate for wave reflection the use of double or more number of barriers has also been investigated by many researchers see twu and lin 1991a b losada et al 1993 isaacson et al 1999 studied the scattering of water waves by double slotted partial barriers using eigenfunction matching method and presented various results on reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients behera et al 2015 studied the scattering of water waves by porous structures over a step type bottom they employed a modified mild slope equation in conjunction with the eigenfunction expansion method and presented results on reflection and transmission of waves with the consideration of attenuating wave heights more efficiently and also to save construction cost of breakwaters various different forms of fixed and floating structures have been suggested in the past refer neelamani and rajendran 2002a b günaydın and kabdaşlı 2004 investigated experimentally the performance of u type breakwaters under regular and irregular waves they expressed parameters involved in the study as a dimensionless group using π theory very recently deng et al 2019 used eigenfunction matching method in conjunction with gegenbauer polynomials as auxiliary functions to study the hydrodynamic performance of a t shaped floating breakwater in all the aforementioned studies the use of vertical porous barrier single multiple is analysed researchers have studied the role of submerged horizontal porous plates also in the literature the researchers have investigated box type breakwaters by taking one wall of the box being porous many researchers analysed the functionality of double barrier in reflecting and dissipating wave energy so motivated by these studies we wanted to propose and study the effectiveness of a open box type breakwater with two vertical barrier and one submerged barrier all three sides of the box being porous so in totality we investigated the performance of a breakwater composed of three different structures this shall be a new addition to the type of breakwaters and can be of help in ocean engineering problems the present paper deals with the study of scattering of water waves by a surface piercing porous box with the assumptions of the linear theory of water waves and flow past porous structures based on darcy s law the physical problem is formulated mathematically which is then solved using eigenfunction matching method the study aims to find the performance of a porous box in attenuating wave reflection and transmission the role of structural parameters and wave parameters is analysed through various graphs it is observed that the surface piercing porous box type breakwater effectively reduce wave reflection as well as wave transmission when structural porosity and dimensions of the box are chosen appropriately 2 mathematical formulation an obliquely incident small amplitude and regular wave having angular frequency ω is considered to propagate past a floating a surface piercing porous box in water of depth h the box is composed of rectangular type surface where the vertical plates are located at x a and the horizontal plate is located at y d see fig 1 a cartesian coordinate system is considered to represent the physical problem where the origin is taken at the midpoint between the vertical plates the fluid domain is extended along the z axis in the horizontal direction where the x z plane is the horizontal plane with θ being the angle made with x axis y is measured positive in the vertically downwards direction for linear water wave theory to be applicable wave height is taken to be small enough and fluid under consideration is assumed to be inviscid incompressible and irrotational thereby the motion of the fluid is characterized by the velocity potential φ of the form 2 1 φ x y z t ℜ ϕ x y e i k z z i ω t where ℜ denotes the real part of the argument and k z k 0 sin θ is the

moreover for g 3 0 it reduces to dispersion relation for wave interaction with a submerged impermeable plate on the other hand in the case of submerged porous plate all the roots of the dispersion relation 3 8 are complex in nature in the present study newton raphson s method is used to evaluate the roots of this complex dispersion relation moreover the contour plots are used to obtain the initial guess of the root in the newton raphson s method as discussed in behera and sahoo 2015 the eigenfunctions ψ m for m 0 1 2 in the open water region are orthogonal and satisfy the orthogonality

linear algebraic equations in 4 n 4 unknowns this system is solved numerically to obtain the set of unknowns after the determination of the unknown constants a series of physical quantities useful in engineering practices are evaluated for example hydrodynamic forces and the free surface elevations the effectiveness of this porous box placed as a breakwater can be studied through reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients which are computed respectively as follows 3 15 k r r 0 k t t 0 and k d 1 k r 2 k t 2 moreover the non dimensionalized forces on the sea side lee side and base of the box are respectively given by 3 16 f 1 i ω g h 2 0 d ϕ 1 ϕ 2 d y f 2 i ω g h 2 0 d ϕ 2 ϕ 4 d y f 3 i ω g h 2 a a ϕ 3 ϕ 2 d x also the free surface elevation is given by 3 17 η j i ω g ϕ j y 0 j 1 2 and 4 4 numerical results and discussion for examining the hydrodynamic behaviour of the surface piercing porous box we have written a matlab program to solve the linear system of eqs 3 10 3

is considered to be incident at an angle θ 3 0 o the convergence of the numerical solutions with the number of evanescent modes n is listed in table 1 for different values of k 0 h and for fixed values of h 10 m a h 0 5 and g 1 g 2 g 3 1 0 5 i it is seen that the acceptable convergence of the present solution is obtained at n 10 thus for all numerical computation n 10 is kept fixed on taking porous effect parameters g 1 g 2 g 3 0 the problem reduces to scattering of water waves by a rigid dock as shown in fig 2 a the parameters as given in mciver 1985 are chosen for fig 2 a it is seen that results of present problem are in agreement with the results of mciver 1985 further for the validation of the model numerical results are compared with the experimental and theoretical work of li et al 2006 in fig 2 b it is observed that present model on taking g 2 g 3 10000 matches very well with the theoretical and experimental study on scattering of water waves by thin permeable barrier two particular cases i scattering of water waves by single porous barrier on taking porous effect parameters g 2 1 g 1 g 3 1000 assuming large value and ii scattering of water waves by double porous barriers when g 3 is very large are shown in figs 3 a and 3 b respectively in fig 3 a the observation matches with the results of lee and chwang 2000 in fig 3 b it is seen that results of present problem are almost similar to that of isaacson et al 1999 figs 2 and 3 reflect the validation of the method presented herein fig 4 a shows the reflection and transmission coefficients as a function of k 0 h for different submergence depth d h of the box wave reflection and transmission show oscillatory behaviour and the amplitude of oscillations appears to be increasing as k 0 h increases the oscillatory pattern in wave reflection and transmission is due to the resonating interactions between the two vertical sides of the box and the submerged horizontal plate of the box also it is observed that along increasing k 0 h wave reflection increases with increase in submergence depth of the vertical plate except for 1 7 k 0 h 4 this increase in reflection is due to the effectiveness of the vertical side of the box in reflecting wave energy but in case of wave transmission an increasing trend is noticed with an increase in d h for a larger k 0 h fig 4 b shows the variations in energy dissipation coefficient as a function of k 0 h for varied d h it is observed that the energy dissipation is more when the submerged porous plate is nearer to the free surface which is due to the more wave energy concentration at the free surface further it is noticed that the wave energy dissipation follows an oscillatory pattern and amplitude of the oscillations increases as d h increases the behaviour of energy dissipation and wave reflection coefficients are exactly opposite to each other as observed in fig 4 the point of maximum reflection in waves corresponds to minimum energy dissipation as seen in figs 4 a and 4 b fig 5 a shows the variation in wave reflection and wave transmission as a function of k 0 h for box with varied width a h with increase in a h both wave reflection and transmission show a substantial decrease due to increased dissipation of energy by horizontal plate of the box and there is an oscillatory behaviour in wave reflection also the number of oscillations increases with increase in a h inherently due to increased mutual interactions of waves in the confined interior of the box in fig 5 b the variations in energy dissipation coefficient for different a h is presented it is observed that with increase in a h dissipation coefficient increases thereby depicting that large a h results high dissipation of energy wave reflection and energy dissipation depict opposite pattern as found in fig 5 b fig 6 a shows the variation in wave reflection and transmission versus k 0 h for different porous effect parameter values it is found that reflection increases as k 0 h increases from smaller to intermediate wave number and then as wave number increases further reflection begins to decrease there is an increase in wave reflection for 0 k 0 h 2 because a surface piercing barrier is not very much effective to obstruct long waves but as wave number further increases i e in the short wave region the surface piercing vertical sides of the box become effective in obstructing the waves and thus a continuous oscillatory pattern is observed further a decrease in wave reflection is observed which is primarily due to increase in absolute value of porous effect parameter g increasing porous effect parameter makes barrier more transparent thereby reducing wave reflection and increasing wave transmission in case of transmission of water waves it decreases for smaller to intermediate wave number and it increases for intermediate to larger wave number this is mainly due to the wave energy distributed uniformly over the depth for small wave numbers and it is primarily accumulated near the free surface for large wave numbers with an increase in porous effect parameter values a reduced wave reflection is observed and consequently an increased transmission is seen due to the smooth flow of fluid and lesser resistance offered by the box it is also clearly visible from the figure that porous box helps in reducing reflection of wave energy as compared to the impermeable box fig 6 b shows the variations in energy dissipation coefficient as a function of k 0 h for different g 1 it is observed that for small to intermediate wave number values dissipation of energy increases with an increase in absolute value of porous effect parameter further as wave number takes large values increase in porosity leads to decreased dissipation of energy fig 7 a shows the variation in k r and k t versus θ for different submergence depth of the box as θ increases k r increases and k t decreases also with increase in submergence depth an increase in transmission and reflection as a function of θ is observed further fig 7 b shows the variation in wave reflection and transmission versus θ for different a h values as a h increases wave reflection rises along increasing θ and opposite trend is observed in transmission of waves this fact is apprehended by the argument that larger a h implies longer horizontal plate resulting more reflection and dissipation and less transmission fig 8 shows the variation in wave reflection and transmission versus θ for different g 1 here wave reflection reduces significantly as absolute value of porous effect parameters increases and a moderate increase in wave transmission is observed this is due to the fact that large porous effect parameter implies more dissipation of wave energy resulting less reflection and consequently more transmission in fig 9 the results of wave reflection and transmission are plotted as a function of 2 a λ for different values of g 1 it is observed that as 2 a λ increases wave reflection decreases in amplitude further with an increase in absolute values of the porous effect parameters there will be dissipation of energy and hence there is a significant reduction in wave reflection as plate length 2 a λ increases the mutual interaction between the vertical plate and horizontal plate of the box results in an oscillatory pattern in wave reflection and opposite trend is observed in wave transmission as 2 a λ further increases the oscillatory pattern in k r vanishes and k t curve descends to zero fig 10 a shows the result of wave reflection and transmission as a function of 2 a λ for different θ it is observed that as 2 a λ increases the wave reflection shows an oscillatory pattern which is decreasing continuously in amplitude which is due to the same fact as explained in fig 9 moreover it is observed that with increase in θ wave reflection increases and transmission decreases also wave reflection shows a phase shift towards increasing 2 a λ which is due to increasing θ fig 10 b shows the variation in wave reflection and transmission for different d h a similar pattern of increase in transmission of waves is observed as noticed in fig 7 a with increasing d h the amplitude of reflection increases due to the fact that larger vertical barrier length results higher wave reflection however it is seen that the amplitude of reflection decreases along increasing 2 a λ which is due to increased dissipation of energy with increase in 2 a λ fig 11 shows the variation of forces exerted on the sea side lee side and bottom of the structure f 1 f 2 and f 3 respectively as a function of θ for different values of g 1 from these figures it is seen that with an increase in θ the wave force decreases as noticed moreover with increase in g 1 force f 1 decreases because with increase in porosity reflection decreases and consequently wave transmission increases thereby force f 2 increases on lee side vertical plate on the other hand wave force f 3 increases with an increase in porous effect parameter which is due to increased transmission of waves towards the lee side of the box resulting in large force exerted on the horizontal part of the box fig 12 shows the variation in forces f 1 f 2 f 3 respectively as a function of k 0 h for different values of a h in fig 12 a f 1 reduces in amplitude as a h increases because the dissipation is increased with an increase in submerged plate length as observed in fig 12 a it is also noticed in fig 12 b that force decreases with increase in a h values the reduced force on both vertical plates is due to the increased dissipation of energy with an increase in a h in fig 12 c with increase in a h the force f 3 on submerged plate of the box increases because larger plate length exerts more force on the submerged horizontal plate of the box fig 13 shows the variation in force on the three sides of the box respectively as a function of k 0 h for different values of g 1 in fig 13 a as porous effect parameter value increases the force f 1 is reduced this is due to the decrease in reflection of water waves with the increase in the porous effect parameter as observed in fig 6 a from fig 13 b one may see that with an increase in porous effect parameter lesser force on the lee side of the box is exerted this is supported by the behaviour of transmission of waves as noticed in fig 6 a wherein long wave region transmission is not affected by porous effect parameter thus force in long wave zone remains unaffected in addition with an increase in porous effect parameter wave transmission increases from intermediate to short wave region thereby force on the lee side of the box reduces with increase in the porous effect parameter fig 13 c shows the variation in f 3 versus k 0 h with an increase in g 1 values the force exerted on the base of the box increases in the long wave region and decreases in intermediate to short water region the variation in amplitude of free surface elevation for the different porous effect parameter is shown in fig 14 a it is observed that as porous effect parameter increases more wave energy is dissipated by the porous sides of the box and thus the amplitude of the free surface elevation is reduced in fig 14 b when the depth of submergence of the box is increased the amplitude of free surface elevation reduces in the windward direction which is due to the increase in reflection of waves further in fig 14 c angle of incidence θ plays an imperative role in wave attenuation when θ increases the amplitude of free surface elevation is reduced in the lee side of the box also a phase shift occurs due to a change in θ 5 conclusion the present study outlines the performance of a surface piercing porous box floating at the free surface in attenuating wave reflection and wave height in the finite depth of fluid using the eigenfunction matching technique the associated boundary value problem is reduced into a system of linear algebraic equations which is solved numerically the study reveals that the wave reflection decreases with an increase in structural porosity whilst the reverse trend in wave transmission occurs with an increase in structural porosity of the barrier the amplitude of free surface elevation is reduced by suitably selecting the values of the porous effect parameter the reflection pattern depends on the oblique angle of incidence with an increase in angle of incidence the reflection coefficient increases with a shift in phase thus it is observed that a porous box of suitable configurations can attenuate wave height effectively however for better understanding about the flow behaviour around the structure and role of viscosity a computational fluid dynamics based model will be required which is beyond the scope of the present study and can be considered as a different study the concept and methodology discussed in the present paper can be

22344,modelling wind turbine wake effects at a range of wind speeds and directions with actuator disk ad models can provide insight but also be challenging with any model it is important to quantify the level of error but this can also present a challenge when comparing a steady state model to measurement data with scatter this paper models wind flow in a wind farm at a range of wind speeds and directions using an ad implementation the results from these models are compared to data collected from the actual farm being modelled an extensive comparison is conducted constituted from 35 cases where two turbulence models the standard k ε and k ω sst are evaluated the steps taken in building the models as well as processes for comparing the ad computational fluid dynamics cfd results to real world data using the regression models of ensemble bagging and gaussian process are outlined turbine performance data and boundary conditions are determined using the site data modifications to an existing opensource ad code are shown so that the predetermined turbine performance can be implemented into the cfd model steady state solutions are obtained with the openfoam cfd solver results are compared in terms of velocity deficit at the measurement locations using the standard k ε model a mean absolute error for all cases together of roughly 8 can be achieved but this error changes for different directions and methods of evaluating it keywords actuator disk offshore wind farm cfd scada site data turbulence models 1 introduction offshore wind power is growing rapidly not only within the uk and eu but is beginning to gain traction around the world in other markets including taiwan yue et al 2019 china poulsen and hasager 2017 yang et al 2017 and the united states chipindula et al 2018 donovan et al 2018 musial 2015 wiseret al 2015 mills et al 2018 to capture the maximum energy from an offshore wind farm the most reliable assessment needs to be made of the potential wind farm before it is constructed the models need to be able to assess the wind behaviour for the entire wind farm rather than for a single turbine to be able to get the most accurate picture of how the wakes interact within the wind farm and conduct further analysis such as structural modelling gentils et al 2017 rasheed et al 2014 wang et al 2016b 2016a 2016c zhu et al 2019 a variety of methods exist and have been used in literature for modelling the wake of turbines within a wind farm for horizontal or vertical axis turbines these methods include navier stokes computational fluid dynamics cfd solvers where the turbine is modelled as an actuator disk ad porté agel et al 2014 richmond et al 2018 to more computationally intensive models of fully resolved wind turbines wang et al 2016b stergiannis et al 2016a zahle et al 2018 rodrigues and lengsfeld 2019 at the most computationally intensive end of the methods are fully resolved wind turbine these can provide accurate answers and predict the flow realistically relative to less detailed methods but are limited to modelling only short time intervals relative to the lifetime of the wind farm of a few seconds due to their computationally intensive nature there are a wide range of navier stokes ns based approaches to choose from actuator line is a common approach for representing the turbines which takes the idea of an actuator disk but applies it to a rotating line in a transient analysis porté agel et al 2014 mehta et al 2014 kalvig et al 2014 the simplest ns based models are porous disks or momentum sinks which can provide good estimates but lack detail in their assessments johnson 2015 johnson et al 2014 ad is a low to medium fidelity approach where the turbine is modelled as a permeable disk whose loading influences the flow field annoni et al 2014 the load can be evaluated either through looking up aerodynamic values for the blade or through solving euler or navier stokes equations over a discretised field wang 2015 the advantage of ad is its relative simplicity and reduced computational cost due to not having to resolve the boundary layer around the blade porté agel et al 2014 however due to the inviscid assumption of the model it is inaccurate in predicting downstream wake because it under predicts the turbulence required for wake dissipation stergiannis et al 2016a annoni et al 2014 for evaluating wind load variation within a wind farm ad appears to be a good compromise method between engineering or analytical models and fully resolved rotors the method is mature at least 30 years old with a variety of implementations researchers can either be interested in near wake or in the wake deficit and studies have shown that ad produces good agreement with measurements regarding wake deficit kalvig et al 2014 johnson 2015 the turbulence model used can have a significant impact on both the accuracy and stability of the solution and can be either steady state or unsteady comparisons of these have been made by other researchers kalvig et al 2014 cabezón et al 2011 castellani et al 2013 different levels of turbulence lengths scales might be modelled for example many researchers have used large eddy viscosity les to model turbulence which models large turbulence length scales while averaging smaller length scales porté agel et al 2014 mehta et al 2014 ivanell et al 2007 however a less computationally expensive option is to model the turbulence using reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approaches based on eddy viscosity turbulence models including different implementations of k ε johnson et al 2014 réthoré and sørensen 2009 réthoréet al 2007 and k ω johnson 2015 wang et al 2016d turbulence models as these researchers have found using the right turbulence model can have a large impact and it s not always clear from the start which model is a better choice comparisons have been conducted in wind tunnel conditions kalvig et al 2014 réthoré et al 2011 stergiannis et al 2016b stevens et al 2018 because those are easier to measure and compare to than full wind farms however real wind farms have much more complex flow conditions some authors have modelled full wind farms but they ve done so only at a very limited range of wind directions and speeds if there is any range at all for example ivanell et al 2007 was conducted at 7 directions but appears to have only been modelled at one far field velocity while churchfieldet al 2012 was only conducted at one direction to accurately assess the wind resource it is not enough to simply assess wind flow at one input condition but rather over a range of conditions these conditions can include inflow velocity and direction because even a small change in either of these can have large implications for the wind farm some researchers have conducted wind farm level research at multiple inflow directions javaheri and cañadillas 2013 however when a turbulence model is assessed it is usually assessed only at a limited range of inputs and not over a broad range kalvig et al 2014 very few papers combine a range of directions necessary to evaluate a wind farm model and use wind turbine scada data for example in creech et al 2015 they did this but used engineering wake models and not cfd ad models the work presented here uses an ns based giving the reader more knowledge of the performance of such models in this case so that the reader can decide which type of model to use for their own purposes as well as better understanding what impact modelling choices make in this application the main contribution of this paper is that a cfd simulation of an entire wind farm is conducted at multiple free stream directions and speeds which is then compared to scada and met mast data held for that wind farm thus evaluating the approach in a real case these simulations are conducted for two different steady state rans turbulence models allowing a direct comparison an additional contribution of this paper is that it demonstrates a modification to an open source actuator disk code in openfoam svenning 2010 which expands the code s capabilities by incorporating individual turbine performance methods for evaluating the model against real site data by approximating the measurement data with regression models is presented the work not only demonstrates best practice which has been shown in other research but also builds on it this work expands on a previous conference paper richmond et al 2018 with a strong focus on the cfd aspect specifically much more is done to evaluate the results against the wind farm data the construction of the model is much more detailed and twice as many cfd cases are used in section 2 the reference offshore wind farm and the reference data available are presented in section 3 the cfd model is discussed in detail including the boundary conditions meshing strategy and the turbulence models section 4 presents the actuator disk model used and the modifications to it section 5 outlines the validation approach including modelling of scada data for comparison section 6 presents the results in comparison to the real data from the wind farm and discusses the findings finally a conclusion is given in section 7 2 reference offshore wind farm in this work an offshore wind farm containing 25 turbines is modelled using actuator disks in a cfd domain the comparisons are made to data obtained from a meteorological mast met mast mm this mast is permanently positioned on site roughly between two turbines on an outer corner the mm has sensors which can record wind speed and direction at five elevations up to a maximum of the hub height of the turbines these data are recorded as averages in 10 min intervals a map of the reference wind farm is shown in fig 1 turbine 16 is circled in red the figure shows that the reference zero direction for the cfd model is normal to the turbine rows this orientation puts the mm in the wake of two turbines at the reference zero but also shows some interesting behaviour at the two extremes because the met mast starts being in the wake of the turbines next to it which causes a large velocity deficit which allows for investigation of the edge of the wake there are 25 turbines in the wind farm but fig 1 shows 30 to protect confidentiality of the company who provided data although the orientation of the direction values was not given it is possible to determine this out from comparison of the mm data to the map the typical convention is wind coming from the north going south is zero and then the value goes up clockwise mittelmeier et al 2016 however that assumption doesn t fit the mm data the correct orientation for this wind farm is rotated 25 counter clockwise from a north zero this type of sensor calibration issue is not uncommon catapult 2018 3 methodology 3 1 governing equations and numerical discretisation within this section the cfd framework is detailed the governing equations physics models and numerical schemes are presented a computational aerodynamic database is constructed within a parameterization process within the cfd simulation framework the governing equations of fluid dynamics are numerically solved the navier stokes equations for incompressible fluids encompass the principles of continuum mechanics and conservation laws which along with more details on the solver used can be found in openfoamwiki 2019 and are also given here 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j μ u i x i where u i is the cartesian velocity vector with components in three spatial dimensions u u 1 u 2 u 3 t x i the spatial coordinate direction vector respectively where ρ is the fluid s density p the pressure and μ the dynamic viscosity as the flow of wind turbines is turbulent of high reynolds number reynolds averaging is applied thus the final equations solved are the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans reynolds averaging decomposes the mean flow variables to mean and fluctuating terms where temporal and spatial ensemble averaging ensures steady state solutions are obtained to close the set of equations boussinesq approximation of the eddy viscosity hypothesis is set where turbulence modelling mathematically describes the eddy viscosity μ t the governing equations are formulated within the finite volume numerical framework and discretised in three space dimensions where the simple algorithm is employed to obtain numerical solutions mangani and bianchini 2007 ambatipudi 2006 this is a widely used solver algorithm which has been used by other researchers in modelling wind turbines including in openfoam s simplefoam openfoamwiki 2014 solver which is for incompressible steady flow without changes in temperature stergiannis et al 2016a stergiannis et al 2017 a digraskar 2010 the simple algorithm solves the governing equations in a sequential approach iteratively until convergence is reached the governing equations are discretised in time and the time derivatives are set to zero the gradient scheme is the standard gaussian finite volume discretisation where the scalar gradient is computed using green gauss theorem federer 1944 and the values at the cell faces are linearly interpolated from the cell centre values the divergence schemes are the second order gauss for the velocity field and bounded gauss for k ε and ω more on the openfoam numerical schemes can be found on the openfoam user guide greenshields 2018 the convergence criteria were set to 10 8 for difference in turbulence kinetic energy k and each velocity component and was set to 10 7 for the difference in pressure these convergence criteria were reached after around 5000 iterations with some variation of 1000 for all case set ups tracking values for velocity and turbulence kinetic energy at the met mast during solving the values used were appropriate as the physical values converged in around as many iterations 3 2 turbulence models several published works compare turbulence models used with ad models for wind turbines wake models for example some researchers have found that standard k ε under predicts wind speed deficit kalvig et al 2014 cabezón et al 2011 some researchers comparing k ε and k ω models recommend k ε because the high level of turbulence in k ω leads to quick wake recovery and hence less accurate predictions in mid and far wakes regions stergiannis et al 2017 although modified versions of the k ε and k ω models can be less robust they generally perform better than the standard models cabezón et al 2011 stergiannis et al 2016b therefore to use the most suitable model for this work a comparison of several rans turbulence models was conducted the three turbulence models compared are standard k ε realizable k ε and k ω sst 3 2 1 standard k ε turbulence model the standard k ε model is a widely used turbulence model developed by launder et al spalding and launder 1972 this model calculates a turbulence kinematic viscosity ν t based on the turbulence kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε the standard transport equations are 3 k t u j k x j x j ν ν t σ ε k x j ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i ε 4 ε t u j ε x j x j ν ν t σ ε ε x

μ c 1 c 2 σ k and σ ε are standard constants given in the original publication from launder et al spalding and launder 1972 these values have been used by other authors in modelling wind turbines kalvig et al 2014 stergiannis et al 2016b stergiannis et al 2017 however some authors have shown that different choices of constant values are more appropriate for atmospheric flow el kasmi and masson 2008 from which the turbulence kinematic viscosity can be calculated using 5 ν t c μ k 2 ε 3 2 2 realizable k ε turbulence model the realizable eddy viscosity model was developed by shih et al 1995 and implements a realizable eddy viscosity formulation through modified dissipation rate equation this modified dissipation rate equation is fluent inc 2006 6 ε t u j ε x i x j ν ν t σ ε ε x i c 1 s ε c 2 ε 2 k ν ε s ε where s ε is the mean strain rate and ν is the kinematic viscosity the difference being that the reynolds stresses do not appear in this equation the standard model constants are given in the original publication shih et al 1995 3 2 3 k ω shear stress transport the k ω shear stress transport sst model was introduced by mentor el al menter 1994 this model uses k ω from wilcox 2008 to calculate the inner boundary layer flow and a k ε model in the free shear flow the k ω equations for turbulent kinetic energy k and specific rate of dissipation ω are 7 k t u j k x j p k β ω k x j ν σ k ν t k x j 8 ω t u j ω x i α s 2 β ω 2 x j ν σ ω ν t ω x j 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 1 ω k x i ω x i where x j is cartesian space coordinate ν is kinematic viscosity f1 is a blending function pk is a production limiter and σ k ω ω 2 β and α are closure coefficients given in the original k ω formulation from wilcox 2008 3 3 model set up the velocity inlet uses a fully developed wind shear profile the logarithmic profile was fitted to an averaged set of met mast wind velocity samples which records velocities at different heights only samples for which the met mast was in the free stream and not in the wake of the wind farm were used there are some potential limitations to this for example that this is the opposite to the direction at which the cfd cases used to build training data were conducted at however it gives the most accurate assessment of the local wind shear profile possible fig 2 gives an example of what the samples are like each dot represents an individual value and the five lines each link points from the same sample for the sake of representation the velocity at 58 m was limited to 7 5 m s 0 1 m s in this plot the velocity profile used is of the form in 9 which comes from the openfoam api guide openfoam 9 u u k ln z z g z 0 z 0 where k is the von karmen constant zg is the ground surface height z0 is the roughness height and u is given by 10 from this study it was found that the most suitable value for roughness height for this location was z0 0 015 although since waves are predominantly wind driven z0 would change for a given wind speed 10 u k u r e f ln z r e f z 0 z 0 the atmospheric boundary layer model used is the standard atmospheric boundary layer in openfoam which is the model presented by richards et al richards and hoxey 1993 in all of turbulence models a turbulence kinetic energy value of 1 3 was used wall functions were used for the sea surface using the inlet values the top wall uses a slip condition however it is 2 km above the turbine hubs so should have no noticeable impact on the wind turbines 3 4 meshing strategy the grid used is a structured grid with over 63 million cells to construct such a large grid openfoam s blockmesh utility is used on an academic high performance computer cluster which has 118 compute nodes each node having 16 cpu cores with a base frequency of 2 10 ghz and 128 gb of shared memory the domain is much larger than the area of the wind farm to avoid the influence of the walls on the turbines the domain is 16 km wide 6 8 km long and 2 km tall the grid is refined in such a way to have smaller cells around where the turbines are located and larger cells further away from the turbines despite being such a large grid with over 63 million cells there are roughly 12 cells across the diameter of the turbines this is a consequence of having a structured grid with such a large domain the advantage of a structured mesh however is that it ensures a high quality mesh a grid sensitivity study is conducted to determine suitable cell sizes with a base set of values used being taken from a paper on validating openfoam s actuator disk model javaheri and cañadillas 2013 though a more fine structured grid is used in the end the domain used for the work is shown in fig 3 the grid used is demonstrated in fig 4 4 actuator disk model 4 1 original actuator disk code the simplefoam code is modified to implement an actuator disk model with tangential force momentum source to represent the turbines the code used for the study is based upon svenning s actuator disk model svenning 2010 which represents the turbine not as an infinitely thin disk but as a three dimensional region where cell centres within the region are assigned new momentum terms this gives more flexibility in changing the direction of the turbines 4 2 modifications to actuator disk code to implement turbine performance it is necessary to determine thrust and torque curves for a given wind speed such as the curves which can be found for the nrel 5 mw turbine as shown in jonkman et al 2009 this was done by first filtering out data not representative of general turbine performance e g speed below cut in and pitch higher than usual values then generator power was converted to rotor power through an efficiency curve rotor speed was used to convert rotor power to rotor torque and finally velocity at the disk was used to convert rotor power to rotor thrust this is resulted in clear performance curves which are very similar to the nrel curves in general shape scatter plots of the turbine performance are shown in fig 5 to automate selection performance for each turbine that is the perpendicular and tangential components of velocity this performance needed to be modelled and the curve fitted approximation model needed to be integrated into the ad code polynomial functions were then fitted to this data using the method of least squares two polynomials for each value with the change occurring at rated power from cut in speed to 10 85 m s a fourth order polynomial was used for both thrust and torque after 10 85 m s a third order polynomial was used for thrust and a straight line for torque these shapes were chosen after comparison to other shapes they fit this particular data set the best the use of a polynomial model was chosen because it fit the data very well as can be seen in fig 5 and also it could easily and efficiently be integrated into the openfoam code these performance curves were based on inflow velocity however this isn t what is observed by the turbines within the wind farm so instead it was necessary to determine a theoretical upstream velocity based on the velocity at the disk and ad theory the theoretical upstream velocity was used instead by the code to determine the thrust and torque values for each given turbine fundamental ad equations were used for this which come from burton et al 2011 these equations are 11 u d u 1 a 12 c t t h r u s t 1 2 ρ u 2 a d 13 c t 4 a 1 a where u d is the velocity at the disk in the cfd code this is velocity averaged over the disk volume and in the scada data this is velocity measured by the anemometer on the nacelle this is a source of some minor discrepancy u is the far field velocity c t is the coefficient of thrust a d is the area of the disk and a is the axial induction factor equations 11 12 and 13 were used to derive the following equation for axial induction factor in terms of thrust and velocity at the disk 14 a b 4 b where 15 b t h r u s t 1 2 ρ u d 2 a d this equation is solved iteratively within the ad code for each turbine at each solver iteration as thrust is dependent on axial induction finally the original code used two point values x y z to define the start and end points which define the yaw of the turbine all turbines set to a single direction the same direction assumption is not necessarily true and the difference in mean direction between two turbines is an average of around 9 for this scada data however this assumption was made for simplification the process followed by the code is shown in fig 6 5 validation approach samples in the mm data occur at random input conditions to overcome this samples close to the cfd input conditions were taken put into bins and averaged the bins are made as small as possible to only take representative samples but still be able to determine an average their size were chosen in order to have between 8 and 10 data points in each additionally there are very few samples around 15 m s inflow velocity but a very large amount around 7 5 m s even with thousands of samples some of the limits had to be large to ensure there were enough samples in each bin different limits were chosen for each inflow velocity with the aim of having good representation for each point between roughly 3 to 10 samples each the bin sizes as well as the mae for each inflow velocity is presented in table 1 the values compared for the cfd are root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error both as a value and a percentage of the value being predicted and are calculated using standard equations the error is determined in comparing the cfd results to the real data from the wind farm with so much scatter in the met mast and scada data it is difficult to discern the general behaviour in the data from a scatter or other types of plots although putting the data into averaged bins is a commonly used and straight forward approach the resulting bins can be relatively large in some places as shown previously in table 1 additionally the observations within each bin are not weighted therefore observations far from the bin centre have as much impact on the average as those far away regression models have the potential to be more representative of the data therefore to determine the behaviour of the data as well as for comparison to the cfd values regression models were applied to the scada mm data there are two independent variables inflow velocity and inflow direction which were used to predict the one independent variable met mast velocity after restricting the direction to 35 from the zero reference direction data set was reduced to 5046 samples for the regression modelling the regression learner app in matlab s statistics and machine learning toolbox was used which has a wide selection of regression methods all of the models available in the app were tested and the ones which fit the data best based on their rmse values were gaussian process regression using an exponential kernel function and an ensemble of trees using bagged trees with a minimum leaf size of 25 and 2000 learners gaussian process regression employs a bayesian approach where a prior which is a gaussian distribution based on a noise parameter for each point is combined with observations to form a posterior do and lee 2008 davis 2006 rasmussen and williams 2006 in gaussian process regression the prediction is given by pandit and infield 2019 16 p f x n f 0 k x x where f x is the mean function and k x x is the covariance matrix k x x is determined using the exponential kernel which defines it as mathworks 2019a 17 k x i x j θ σ f 2 exp r σ l where σ f and σ l are signal standard deviation and characteristic length scale respectively the euclidian distance between points xi and xj is defined as 18 r x i x j t x i x j an ensemble of trees approach combines the predictions of multiple decision tree models with their segregation of the variable space randomly determined the use of multiple trees can reduce the level of overfitting to the data compared to a single tree breiman 2001 kam ho for a regression problem the prediction value is the weighted average using selected trees mathworks 2019b 19 y ˆ b a g 1 t 1 t α t i t ε s t 1 t α t y ˆ t i t ε s where α t is the weight of the tree y ˆ t is the prediction from tree t and s is the set of trees used in the prediction the goodness of fit parameters for these two models in predicting the data are given in table 2 these values are limited by the scatter in the data these two independent variables can predict a significant amount of the variation in the results but do not completely account for the variation however for determining the general trend in the data and in comparison to the cfd results which used the same independent variables the results from these models are suitable based on their goodness of fit parameters for calculating the comparison values of rmse and mae only the results from the ensemble method are used not the gpr method this is because ensemble is a simpler but more robust method as the ensemble method takes averages from within multiple partitions the result is more constrained to where the data points are rather than gpr which is also somewhat constrained to forming a continuous function which is not necessarily representative of the data however gpr is used for representation as it provides a smooth function which shows the behaviour well 6 results and discussion 6 1 grid sensitivity study the discretisation error of the spatial numerical scheme can be assessed and evaluated with a grid sensitivity analysis the grid sensitivity analysis entails the consistent generation of consecutively refined grids at least three simulations with the same numerical setup and evaluation of representative quantities asme 2009 four grids are constructed the flow conditions are set as follows velocity magnitude measured at 80 m above sea level was used as a comparative value since much of the future comparisons are made from this the simulations are performed at 0 inflow direction at 10 m s grids specifications are shown in table 3 and solver times are using 2 nodes with 16 cores each on the high performance computer described in section 3 4 for comparison the velocity at the met mast at 80 m was used the results from this are shown in fig 7 the grids were increased by increasing the number of cells along all directions by a certain consistent amount and resulted in a grid refinement ratio of around 2 0 1 given that a second order scheme is used the richardson extrapolation can be used to determine an estimate for the continuum value roache 1998 20 f h 0 f 1 f 1 f 2 r p 1 where f h 0 is the estimated value f 1 and f 2 are the results from the first and second finest grids respectively r is the refinement ratio and p is the model order using the results obtained gives an estimated continuum value of 8 70 m s this is 0 5 higher than the value in grid 4 and 2 2 higher than the value for grid 3 the grid 3 level of refinement was used for the studies this is due to resource constraints given the number of cases to run it wasn t possible to use the highest refinement 6 2 turbulence model sensitivity study the initial turbulence comparison was done at 0 free stream velocity normal to the rows along which the turbines are aligned and at 15 clockwise from this the data compared is the velocity at the met mast the results from this comparison are in line with literature which states that the k ε model is more accurate for this case and that the k ω sst model over predicts the intensity of the wake kalvig et al 2014 the results from this comparison are shown in fig 8 along with predictions from the two regression models which were trained on the scada data as can be seen in the figures the k ω sst model in this case consistently shows much lower values than is observed by the real met mast while k ε generally performs more in line with the real data as is consistent with the findings of other researchers stergiannis et al 2017 at higher velocities around 15 m s and at 0 all models predict velocities that are too low this under prediction by the models is partially due to having so few data points at higher velocities for comparison and so these points come from slightly further away from the centre where the wake is less prominent it is still possible that k ω as implemented performs better than k ε for some combinations of initial conditions as is observed in both 0 and 15 for 5 m s therefore the 35 cases are conducted with both a k ω model and a k ε model the k ε model chosen for this is standard k ε this is because standard k ε is shown to predict closer to the mm data 6 3 case set up a wide range of cases were conducted to evaluate the model over a spectrum of conditions the wind farm is modelled at a range of incoming wind angles between 35 and 35 and the freestream velocity is modelled between 5 m s and 15 m s all combinations of direction including 0 as well as plus and minus 10 20 and 35 are modelled with freestream velocities of 5 7 5 10 12 5 and 15 m s resulting in 35 cases the limit of incoming wind direction is chosen to capture a board range of inflow directions while still capturing a relatively high resolution in terms of angular variation 6 4 comparison to site data approximation the numerical solutions are compared with real data to identify potential discrepancies and evaluate the levels of computational uncertainty therefore data was extracted along a vertical line where the met mast is located to make predictions of local wind velocities once the extracted data are generated from the cfd model they are compared to the wind farm data samples to determine their accuracy from each of the 35 cfd cases local velocity values at the met mast were sampled at hub height the same as one of the sensors on the met mast the results from this comparison are shown in table 4 the mean absolute error for the k ε is 0 761 m s approximately 8 relative to the comparison values and k ω sst is 0 932 m s approximately 10 5 using the binning approach this is roughly in line with the error values achieved in cfd ad by other authors comparing to wind tunnel measurements kalvig et al 2014 stergiannis et al 2016b as well as for wind far measurements javaheri and cañadillas 2013 the results from the cfd analysis are compared to the regression model and binning approaches for each individual data point in fig 9 which is a prediction against true plot where a 45 degree line indicates zero error between the two values for both the binning and ensemble approaches there is good agreement to the cfd results however the values are generally closer for the binning approach this increased accuracy of the binning approach is partially due to an averaging of the result the ensemble approach can show sharp fluctuations as the data fluctuates which would be averaged out in the binning approach this is can be a desirable behaviour to some extent but if there is too much averaging than it ceases to capture the behaviour of the real situation fig 9 also shows larger deviations from the zero error line in both approaches at higher wind speeds this is at least partially due to a lower amount of data present at these higher values and so both approaches become less reliable additionally this could be due to higher unsteadiness at higher velocities if standard deviation values were present in the scada and met mast data this could be investigated fig 10 shows the cfd predictions compared to the measured data from the scada mm for 7 5 m s free stream condition this figure shows the level of scatter present in the measured data and necessitates the use of the regression models this also shows that a significant portion of the difference between cfd prediction and data comes from the difficulty in getting a reliable representation of the measurement data as can be seen from other researchers javaheri and cañadillas 2013 avila et al 2017 measured data is typically not as smooth and determinate as steady state cfd results fig 11 shows the results for the cfd model and the regression models normalised by inflow velocity and averaged for inflow direction at 0 the mm is in the direct wake of two turbines as seen in fig 12 which causes a minor dip in the wind flow velocity this dip is much higher for the k ω sst model than for the k ε model there are numerous things which can affect turbulence kinetic energy including calibration of constants initialisation boundary conditions and so on in this case the k ω sst model predicts lower turbulence viscosity than the k ε and researchers have found that a lower turbulence viscosity results in less wake recovery stergiannis et al 2016b towards 35 degree inflow direction there is a significant drop in the mm velocity shown by the regression models which is captured more closely by this k ω sst turbulence model the results from this direction are shown in fig 13 although the met mast is roughly equidistant between the nearest two turbines this significant drop is not observed in the 35 degree direction the drop at 35 appears to be an interaction of both the near wind turbine and two upstream turbines a typical result from the simulation in shown in figs 12 and 13 which show a two dimensional cross section of the flow field through the turbine centres this image shows the velocity magnitude field the case is set up as described in the methodology section and the inputs for this particular case are inflow velocity of 10 m s and an inflow direction of 0 normal to the three rows several observations can be made from this plot this plot shows how at this direction the met mast is in the wake of two turbines and hence there is a velocity reduction at the mm another observation is that there is more of a velocity deficit on the right of the wake when viewed in the direction of wind flow than on the left this is due to how the turbines interact with the wakes from upstream turbines the third observation is that there appears to be a global reduction in velocity even where there is no immediate wake the velocity is nearly one m s lower on the left side of the figure compared to the right of the figure the turbulence viscosity for k ε where the freestream direction is 35 with a free stream velocity of 10 m s is shown in fig 14 throughout the paper the k ε model is mainly assessed due to it performing better for this model set up this shows that the air downstream of the wind farm is still turbulent for a large distance additionally the turbulence is not so high until after the third row this figure shows that the wake of the turbine is much broader than it appears in the velocity plot just by looking at velocity it might appear there are times when the mm is not in a turbine wake but from the turbulence plot one would conclude that this is never the case for the directions modelled table 4 shows the metrics for comparison of the two turbulence models against the binning and regression approaches this shows that for conducting all cases k ε outperforms k ω for how these models were set up however the difference is not as significant as it might be for a more limited range of inflow directions 7 conclusions in this study a computational fluid dynamics analysis of an existing wind farm is conducted using the actuator disk method not only are the cases conducted at multiple wind directions and velocities but the results are also compared to real recorded data from the wind farm the opensource code openfoam is used and modifications to the code are presented so that the process followed is reproducible additionally methods for processing the wind farm data are presented the two turbulence models of standard k ε and k ω sst were compared and used for all simulations it was found that both perform generally well but for this model setup k ε performs better with a mean absolute error of 8 for all cases compared to 10 for k ω sst when binning is used to compare to the met mast data in the case where the met mast is in the direct wake of two turbines up stream k ε shows good agreement with the recorded data however at 35 when the met mast is on the edge of a very close turbine k ε underpredicts wake deficit therefore an overall error value calculated for one direction only quantifies the error for that direction and not others new methods for the use of scada data in both the construction and evaluation of the wind farm models are shown two approaches of approximating the scada data to more readily compare it to the cfd predictions are shown and compared these approaches are binning the scada data and constructing regression models from the data to compare the deterministic cfd results to the scattered measurement data regression methods are used to approximate the mm data the methods chosen are gaussian process regression and ensemble bagging with mean absolute errors of 0 74 and 0 76 respectively both provide a suitable means of comparison however it is not determined which one is better the current practices for actuator disk method are well suited to modelling wake deficit for an entire wind farm at a range of inflow conditions however some care must be taken when inflow direction is varied as the error is not consistent in terms of potential future work with the growth in computational capabilities cfd can more be applied in a way that expands the compromise between capturing flow complexity and computational time by also combining machine learning approaches using the cfd results as training data this opens the possibility to use cfd for evaluating the wind farm in ways

22344,modelling wind turbine wake effects at a range of wind speeds and directions with actuator disk ad models can provide insight but also be challenging with any model it is important to quantify the level of error but this can also present a challenge when comparing a steady state model to measurement data with scatter this paper models wind flow in a wind farm at a range of wind speeds and directions using an ad implementation the results from these models are compared to data collected from the actual farm being modelled an extensive comparison is conducted constituted from 35 cases where two turbulence models the standard k ε and k ω sst are evaluated the steps taken in building the models as well as processes for comparing the ad computational fluid dynamics cfd results to real world data using the regression models of ensemble bagging and gaussian process are outlined turbine performance data and boundary conditions are determined using the site data modifications to an existing opensource ad code are shown so that the predetermined turbine performance can be implemented into the cfd model steady state solutions are obtained with the openfoam cfd solver results are compared in terms of velocity deficit at the measurement locations using the standard k ε model a mean absolute error for all cases together of roughly 8 can be achieved but this error changes for different directions and methods of evaluating it keywords actuator disk offshore wind farm cfd scada site data turbulence models 1 introduction offshore wind power is growing rapidly not only within the uk and eu but is beginning to gain traction around the world in other markets including taiwan yue et al 2019 china poulsen and hasager 2017 yang et al 2017 and the united states chipindula et al 2018 donovan et al 2018 musial 2015 wiseret al 2015 mills et al 2018 to capture the maximum energy from an offshore wind farm the most reliable assessment needs to be made of the potential wind farm before it is constructed the models need to be able to assess the wind behaviour for the entire wind farm rather than for a single turbine to be able to get the most accurate picture of how the wakes interact within the wind farm and conduct further analysis such as structural modelling gentils et al 2017 rasheed et al 2014 wang et al 2016b 2016a 2016c zhu et al 2019 a variety of methods exist and have been used in literature for modelling the wake of turbines within a wind farm for horizontal or vertical axis turbines these methods include navier stokes computational fluid dynamics cfd solvers where the turbine is modelled as an actuator disk ad porté agel et al 2014 richmond et al 2018 to more computationally intensive models of fully resolved wind turbines wang et al 2016b stergiannis et al 2016a zahle et al 2018 rodrigues and lengsfeld 2019 at the most computationally intensive end of the methods are fully resolved wind turbine these can provide accurate answers and predict the flow realistically relative to less detailed methods but are limited to modelling only short time intervals relative to the lifetime of the wind farm of a few seconds due to their computationally intensive nature there are a wide range of navier stokes ns based approaches to choose from actuator line is a common approach for representing the turbines which takes the idea of an actuator disk but applies it to a rotating line in a transient analysis porté agel et al 2014 mehta et al 2014 kalvig et al 2014 the simplest ns based models are porous disks or momentum sinks which can provide good estimates but lack detail in their assessments johnson 2015 johnson et al 2014 ad is a low to medium fidelity approach where the turbine is modelled as a permeable disk whose loading influences the flow field annoni et al 2014 the load can be evaluated either through looking up aerodynamic values for the blade or through solving euler or navier stokes equations over a discretised field wang 2015 the advantage of ad is its relative simplicity and reduced computational cost due to not having to resolve the boundary layer around the blade porté agel et al 2014 however due to the inviscid assumption of the model it is inaccurate in predicting downstream wake because it under predicts the turbulence required for wake dissipation stergiannis et al 2016a annoni et al 2014 for evaluating wind load variation within a wind farm ad appears to be a good compromise method between engineering or analytical models and fully resolved rotors the method is mature at least 30 years old with a variety of implementations researchers can either be interested in near wake or in the wake deficit and studies have shown that ad produces good agreement with measurements regarding wake deficit kalvig et al 2014 johnson 2015 the turbulence model used can have a significant impact on both the accuracy and stability of the solution and can be either steady state or unsteady comparisons of these have been made by other researchers kalvig et al 2014 cabezón et al 2011 castellani et al 2013 different levels of turbulence lengths scales might be modelled for example many researchers have used large eddy viscosity les to model turbulence which models large turbulence length scales while averaging smaller length scales porté agel et al 2014 mehta et al 2014 ivanell et al 2007 however a less computationally expensive option is to model the turbulence using reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approaches based on eddy viscosity turbulence models including different implementations of k ε

impact and it s not always clear from the start which model is a better choice comparisons have been conducted in wind tunnel conditions kalvig et al 2014 réthoré et al 2011 stergiannis et al 2016b stevens et al 2018 because those are easier to measure and compare to than full wind farms however real wind farms have much more complex flow conditions some authors have modelled full wind farms but they ve done so only at a very limited range of wind directions and speeds if there is any range at all for example ivanell et al 2007 was conducted at 7 directions but appears to have only been modelled at one far field velocity while churchfieldet al 2012 was only conducted at one direction to accurately assess the wind resource it is not enough to simply assess wind flow at one input condition but rather over a range of conditions these conditions can include inflow velocity and direction because even a small change in either of these can have large implications for the wind farm some researchers have conducted wind farm level research at multiple inflow directions javaheri and cañadillas 2013 however when a turbulence model is assessed it is usually assessed only at a limited range of inputs and not over a broad range kalvig et al 2014 very few papers combine a range of directions necessary to evaluate a wind farm model and use wind turbine scada data for example in creech et al 2015 they did this but used engineering wake models and not cfd ad models the work presented here uses an ns based giving the reader more knowledge of the performance of such models in this case so that the reader can decide which type of model to use for their own purposes as well as better understanding what impact modelling choices make in this application the main contribution of this paper is that a cfd simulation of an entire wind farm is conducted at multiple free stream directions and speeds which is then compared to scada and met mast data held for that wind farm thus evaluating the approach in a real case these simulations are conducted for two different steady state rans turbulence models allowing a direct comparison an additional contribution of this paper is that it demonstrates a modification to an open source actuator disk code in openfoam svenning 2010 which expands the code s capabilities by incorporating individual turbine performance methods for evaluating the model against real site data by approximating the measurement data with regression models is presented the work not only demonstrates best practice which has been shown in other research but also builds on it this work expands on a previous conference paper richmond et al 2018 with a strong focus on the cfd aspect specifically much more is done to evaluate the results against the wind farm data the construction of the model is much more detailed and twice as many cfd cases are used in section 2 the reference offshore wind farm and the reference data available are presented in section 3 the cfd model is discussed in detail including the boundary conditions meshing strategy and the turbulence models section 4 presents the actuator disk model used and the modifications to it section 5 outlines the validation approach including modelling of scada data for comparison section 6 presents the results in comparison to the real data from the wind farm and discusses the findings finally a conclusion is given in section 7 2 reference offshore wind farm in this work an offshore wind farm containing 25 turbines is modelled using actuator disks in a cfd domain the comparisons are made to data obtained from a meteorological mast met mast mm this mast is permanently positioned on site roughly between two turbines on an outer corner the mm has sensors which can record wind speed and direction at five elevations up to a maximum of the hub height of the turbines these data are recorded as averages in 10 min intervals a map of the reference wind farm is shown in fig 1 turbine 16 is circled in red the figure shows that the reference zero direction for the cfd model is normal to the turbine rows this orientation puts the mm in the wake of two turbines at the reference zero but also shows some interesting behaviour at the two extremes because the met mast starts being in the wake of the turbines next to it which causes a large velocity deficit which allows for investigation of the edge of the wake there are 25 turbines in the wind farm but fig 1 shows 30 to protect confidentiality of the company who provided data although the orientation of the direction values was not given it is possible to determine this out from comparison of the mm data to the map the typical convention is wind coming from the north going south is zero and then the value goes up clockwise mittelmeier et al 2016 however that assumption doesn t fit the mm data the correct orientation for this wind farm is rotated 25 counter clockwise from a north zero this type of sensor calibration issue is not uncommon catapult 2018 3 methodology 3 1 governing equations and numerical discretisation within this section the cfd framework is detailed the governing equations physics models and numerical schemes are presented a computational aerodynamic database is constructed within a parameterization process within the cfd simulation framework the governing equations of fluid dynamics are numerically solved the navier stokes equations for incompressible fluids encompass the principles of continuum mechanics and conservation laws which along with more details on the solver used can be found in openfoamwiki 2019 and are also given here 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j μ u i x i where u i is the cartesian velocity vector with components in three spatial dimensions u u 1 u 2 u 3 t x i the spatial coordinate direction vector respectively where ρ is the fluid s density p the pressure and μ the dynamic viscosity as the flow of wind turbines is turbulent of high reynolds number reynolds averaging is applied thus the final equations solved are the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans reynolds averaging decomposes the mean flow variables to mean and fluctuating terms where temporal and spatial ensemble averaging ensures steady state solutions are obtained to close the set of equations boussinesq approximation of the eddy viscosity hypothesis is set where turbulence modelling mathematically describes the eddy viscosity μ t the governing equations are formulated within the finite volume numerical framework and discretised in three space dimensions where the simple algorithm is employed to obtain numerical solutions mangani and bianchini 2007 ambatipudi 2006 this is a widely used solver algorithm which has been used by other researchers in modelling wind turbines including in openfoam s simplefoam openfoamwiki 2014 solver which is for incompressible steady flow without changes in temperature stergiannis et al 2016a stergiannis et al 2017 a digraskar 2010 the simple algorithm solves the governing equations in a sequential approach iteratively until convergence is reached the governing equations are discretised in time and the time derivatives are set to zero the gradient scheme is the standard gaussian finite volume discretisation where the scalar gradient is computed using green gauss theorem federer 1944 and the values at the cell faces are linearly interpolated from the cell centre values the divergence schemes are the second order gauss for the velocity field and bounded gauss for k ε and ω more on the openfoam numerical schemes can be found on the openfoam user guide greenshields 2018 the convergence criteria were set to 10 8 for difference in turbulence kinetic energy k and each velocity component and was set to 10 7 for the difference in pressure these convergence criteria were reached after around 5000 iterations with some variation of 1000 for all case set ups tracking values for velocity and turbulence kinetic energy at the met mast during solving the values used were appropriate as the physical values converged in around as many iterations 3 2 turbulence models several published works compare turbulence models used with ad models for wind turbines wake models for example some researchers have found that standard k ε under predicts wind speed deficit kalvig et al 2014 cabezón et al 2011 some researchers comparing k ε and k ω models recommend k ε because the high level of turbulence in k ω leads to quick wake recovery and hence less accurate predictions in mid and far wakes regions stergiannis et al 2017 although modified versions of the k ε and k ω models can be less robust they generally perform better than the standard models cabezón et al 2011 stergiannis et al 2016b therefore to use the most suitable model for this work a comparison of several rans turbulence models was conducted the three turbulence models compared are standard k ε realizable k ε and k ω sst 3 2 1 standard k ε turbulence model the standard k ε model is a widely used turbulence model developed by launder et al spalding and launder 1972 this model calculates a turbulence kinematic viscosity ν t based on the turbulence kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ε the standard transport equations are 3 k t u j k x j x j ν ν t σ ε k x j ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i ε 4 ε t u j ε x j x j ν ν t σ ε ε x i c 1 ε k ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i c 2 ε 2 k where x i j are cartesian space coordinates u i j k are mean stream wise velocity in the denoted cartesian coordinate ν is the kinematic viscosity and c μ c 1 c 2 σ k and σ ε are standard constants given in the original publication from launder et al spalding and launder 1972 these values have been used by other authors in modelling wind turbines kalvig et al 2014 stergiannis et al 2016b stergiannis et al 2017 however some authors have shown that different choices of constant values are more appropriate for atmospheric flow el kasmi and masson 2008 from which the turbulence kinematic viscosity can be calculated using 5 ν t c μ k 2 ε 3 2 2 realizable k ε turbulence model the realizable eddy viscosity model was developed by shih et al 1995 and implements a realizable eddy viscosity formulation through modified dissipation rate equation this modified dissipation rate equation is fluent inc 2006 6 ε t u j ε x i x j ν ν t σ ε ε x i c 1 s ε c 2 ε 2 k ν ε s ε where s ε is the mean strain rate and ν is the kinematic viscosity the difference being that the reynolds stresses do not appear in this equation the standard model constants are given in the original publication shih et al 1995 3 2 3 k ω shear stress transport the k ω shear stress transport sst model was introduced by mentor el al menter 1994 this model uses k ω from wilcox 2008 to calculate the inner boundary layer flow and a k ε model in the free shear flow the k ω equations for turbulent kinetic energy k and specific rate of dissipation ω are 7 k t u j k x j p k β ω k x j ν σ k ν t k x j 8 ω t u j ω x i α s 2 β ω 2 x j ν σ ω ν t ω x j 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 1 ω k x i ω x i where x j is cartesian space coordinate ν is kinematic viscosity f1 is a blending function pk is a production limiter and σ k ω ω 2 β and α are closure coefficients given in the original k ω formulation from wilcox 2008 3 3 model set up the velocity inlet uses a fully developed wind shear profile the logarithmic profile was fitted to an averaged set of met mast wind velocity samples which records velocities at different heights only samples for which the met mast was in the free stream and not in the wake of the wind farm were used there are some potential limitations to this for example that this is the opposite to the direction at which the cfd cases used to build training data were conducted at however it gives the most accurate assessment of the local wind shear profile possible fig 2 gives an example of what the samples are like each dot represents an individual value and the five lines each link points from the same sample for the sake of representation the velocity at 58 m was limited to 7 5 m s 0 1 m s in this plot the velocity profile used is of the form in 9 which comes from the openfoam api guide openfoam 9 u u k ln z z g z 0 z 0 where k is the von karmen constant zg is the ground surface height z0 is the roughness height and u is given by 10 from this study it was found that the most suitable value for roughness height for this location was z0 0 015 although since waves are predominantly wind driven z0 would change for a given wind speed 10 u k u r e f ln z r e f z 0 z 0 the atmospheric boundary layer model used is the standard atmospheric boundary layer in openfoam which is the model presented by richards et al richards and hoxey 1993 in all of turbulence models a turbulence kinetic energy value of 1 3 was used wall functions were used for the sea surface using the inlet values the top wall uses a slip condition however it is 2 km above the turbine hubs so should have no noticeable impact on the wind turbines 3 4 meshing strategy the grid used is a structured grid with over 63 million cells to construct such a large grid openfoam s blockmesh utility is used on an academic high performance computer cluster which has 118 compute nodes each node having 16 cpu cores with a base frequency of 2 10 ghz and 128 gb of shared memory the domain is much larger than the area of the wind farm to avoid the influence of the walls on the turbines the domain is 16 km wide 6 8 km long and 2 km tall the grid is refined in such a way to have smaller cells around where the turbines are located and larger cells further away from the turbines despite being such a large grid with over 63 million cells there are roughly 12 cells across the diameter of the turbines this is a consequence of having a structured grid with such a large domain the advantage of a structured mesh however is that it ensures a high quality mesh a grid sensitivity study is conducted to determine suitable cell sizes with a base set of values used being taken from a paper on validating openfoam s actuator disk model javaheri and cañadillas 2013 though a more fine structured grid is used in the end the domain used for the work is shown in fig 3 the grid used is demonstrated in fig 4 4 actuator disk model 4 1 original actuator disk code the simplefoam code is modified to implement an actuator disk model with tangential force momentum source to represent the turbines the code used for the study is based upon svenning s actuator disk model svenning 2010 which represents the turbine not as an infinitely thin disk but as a three dimensional region where cell centres within the region are assigned new momentum terms this gives more flexibility in changing the direction of the turbines 4 2 modifications to actuator disk code to implement turbine performance it is necessary to determine thrust and torque curves for a given wind speed such as the curves which can be found for the nrel 5 mw turbine as shown in jonkman et al 2009 this was done by first filtering out data not representative of general turbine performance e g speed below cut in and pitch higher than usual values then generator power was converted to rotor power through an efficiency curve rotor speed was used to convert rotor power to rotor torque and finally velocity at the disk was used to convert rotor power to rotor thrust this is resulted in clear performance curves which are very similar to the nrel curves in general shape scatter plots of the turbine performance are shown in fig 5 to automate selection performance for each turbine that is the perpendicular and tangential components of velocity this performance needed to be modelled and the curve fitted approximation model needed to be integrated into the ad code polynomial functions were then fitted to this data using the method of least squares two polynomials for each value with the change occurring at rated power from cut in speed to 10 85 m s a fourth order polynomial was used for both thrust and torque after 10 85 m s a third order polynomial was used for thrust and a straight line for torque these shapes were chosen after comparison to other shapes they fit this particular data set the best the use of a polynomial model was chosen because it fit the data very well as can be seen in fig 5 and also it could easily and efficiently be integrated into the openfoam code these performance curves were based on inflow velocity however this isn t what is observed by the turbines within the wind farm so instead it was necessary to determine a theoretical upstream velocity based on the velocity at the disk and ad theory the theoretical upstream velocity was used instead by the code to determine the thrust and torque values for each given turbine fundamental ad equations were used for this which come from burton et al 2011 these equations are 11 u d u 1 a 12 c t t h r u s t 1 2 ρ u 2 a d 13 c t 4 a 1 a where u d is the velocity at the disk in the cfd code this is velocity averaged over the disk volume and in the scada data this is velocity measured by the anemometer on the nacelle this is a source of some minor discrepancy u is the far field velocity c t is the coefficient of thrust a d is the area of the disk and a is the axial induction factor equations 11 12 and 13 were used to derive the following equation for axial induction factor in terms of thrust and velocity at the disk 14 a b 4 b where 15 b t h r u s t 1 2 ρ u d 2 a d this equation is solved iteratively within the ad code for each turbine at each solver iteration as thrust is dependent on axial induction finally the original code used two point values x y z to define the start and end points which define the yaw of the turbine all turbines set to a single direction the same direction assumption is not necessarily true and the difference in mean direction between two turbines is an average of around 9 for this scada data however this assumption was made for simplification the process followed by the code is shown in fig 6 5 validation approach samples in the mm data occur at random input conditions to overcome this samples close to the cfd input conditions were taken put into bins and averaged the bins are made as small as possible to only take representative samples but still be able to determine an average their size were chosen in order to have between 8 and 10 data points in each additionally there are very few samples around 15 m s inflow velocity but a very large amount around 7 5 m s even with thousands of samples some of the limits had to be large to ensure there were enough samples in each bin different limits were chosen for each inflow velocity with the aim of having good representation for each point between roughly 3 to 10 samples each the bin sizes as well as the mae for each inflow velocity is presented in table 1 the values compared for the cfd are root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error both as a value and a percentage of the value being predicted and are calculated using standard equations the error is determined in comparing the cfd results to the real data from the wind farm with so much scatter in the met mast and scada data it is difficult to discern the general behaviour in the data from a scatter or other types of plots although putting the data into averaged bins is a commonly used and straight forward approach the resulting bins can be relatively large in some places as shown previously in table 1 additionally the observations within each bin are not weighted therefore observations far from the bin centre have as much impact on the average as those far away regression models have the potential to be more representative of the data therefore to determine the behaviour of the data as well as for comparison to the cfd values regression models were applied to the scada mm data there are two independent variables inflow velocity and inflow direction which were used to predict the one independent variable met mast velocity after restricting the direction to 35 from the zero reference direction data set was reduced to 5046 samples for the regression modelling the regression learner app in matlab s statistics and machine learning toolbox was used which has a wide selection of regression methods all of the models available in the app were tested and the ones which fit the data best based on their rmse values were gaussian process regression using an exponential kernel function and an ensemble of trees using bagged trees with a minimum leaf size of 25 and 2000 learners gaussian process regression employs a bayesian approach where a prior which is a gaussian distribution based on a noise parameter for each point is combined with observations to form a posterior do and lee 2008 davis 2006 rasmussen and williams 2006 in gaussian process regression the prediction is given by pandit and infield 2019 16 p f x n f 0 k x x where f x is the mean function and k x x is the covariance matrix k x x is determined using the exponential kernel which defines it as mathworks 2019a 17 k x i x j θ σ f 2 exp r σ l where σ f and σ l are signal standard deviation and characteristic length scale respectively the euclidian distance between points xi and xj is defined as 18 r x i x j t x i x j an ensemble of trees approach combines the predictions of multiple decision tree models with their segregation of the variable space randomly determined the use of multiple trees can reduce the level of overfitting to the data compared to a single tree breiman 2001 kam ho for a regression problem the prediction value is the weighted average using selected trees mathworks 2019b 19 y ˆ b a g 1 t 1 t α t i t ε s t 1 t α t y ˆ t i t ε s where α t is the weight of the tree y ˆ t is the prediction from tree t and s is the set of trees used in the prediction the goodness of fit parameters for these two models in predicting the data are given in table 2 these values are limited by the scatter in the data these two independent variables can predict a significant amount of the variation in the results but do not completely account for the variation however for determining the general trend in the data and in comparison to the cfd results which used the same independent variables the results from these models are suitable based on their goodness of fit parameters for calculating the comparison values of rmse and mae only the results from the ensemble method are used not the gpr method this is because ensemble is a simpler but more robust method as the ensemble method takes averages from within multiple partitions the result is more constrained to where the data points are rather than gpr which is also somewhat constrained to forming a continuous function which is not necessarily representative of the data however gpr is used for representation as it provides a smooth function which shows the behaviour well 6 results and discussion 6 1 grid sensitivity study the discretisation error of the spatial numerical scheme can be assessed and evaluated with a grid sensitivity analysis the grid sensitivity analysis entails the consistent generation of consecutively refined grids at least three simulations with the same numerical setup and evaluation of representative quantities asme 2009 four grids are constructed the flow conditions are set as follows velocity magnitude measured at 80 m above sea level was used as a comparative value since much of the future comparisons are made from this the simulations are performed at 0 inflow direction at 10 m s grids specifications are shown in table 3 and solver times are using 2 nodes with 16 cores each on the high performance computer described in section 3 4 for comparison the velocity at the met mast at 80 m was used the results from this are shown in fig 7 the grids were increased by increasing the number of cells along all directions by a certain consistent amount and resulted in a grid refinement ratio of around 2 0 1 given that a second order scheme is used the richardson extrapolation can be used to determine an estimate for the continuum value roache 1998 20 f h 0 f 1 f 1 f 2 r p 1 where f h 0 is the estimated value f 1 and f 2 are the results from the first and second finest grids respectively r is the refinement ratio and p is the model order using the results obtained gives an estimated continuum value of 8 70 m s this is 0 5 higher than the value in grid 4 and 2 2 higher than the value for grid 3 the grid 3 level of refinement was used for the studies this is due to resource constraints given the number of cases to run it wasn t possible to use the highest refinement 6 2 turbulence model sensitivity study the initial turbulence comparison was done at 0 free stream velocity normal to the rows along which the turbines are aligned and at 15 clockwise from this the data compared is the velocity at the met mast the results from this comparison are in line with literature which states that the k ε model is more accurate for this case and that the k ω sst model over predicts the intensity of the wake kalvig et al 2014 the results from this comparison are shown in fig 8 along with predictions from the two regression models which were trained on the scada data as can be seen in the figures the k ω sst model in this case consistently shows much lower values than is observed by the real met mast while k ε generally performs more in line with the real data as is consistent with the findings of other researchers stergiannis et al 2017 at higher velocities around 15 m s and at 0 all models predict velocities that are too low this under prediction by the models is partially due to having so few data points at higher velocities for comparison and so these points come from slightly further away from the centre where the wake is less prominent it is still possible that k ω as implemented performs better than k ε for some combinations of initial conditions as is observed in both 0 and 15 for 5 m s therefore the 35 cases are conducted with both a k ω model and a k ε model the k ε model chosen for this is standard k ε this is because standard k ε is shown to predict closer to the mm data 6 3 case set up a wide range of cases were conducted to evaluate the model over a spectrum of conditions the wind farm is modelled at a range of incoming wind angles between 35 and 35 and the freestream velocity is modelled between 5 m s and 15 m s all combinations of direction including 0 as well as plus and minus 10 20 and 35 are modelled with freestream velocities of 5 7 5 10 12 5 and 15 m s resulting in 35 cases the limit of incoming wind direction is chosen to capture a board range of inflow directions while still capturing a relatively high resolution in terms of angular variation 6 4 comparison to site data approximation the numerical solutions are compared with real data to identify potential discrepancies and evaluate the levels of computational uncertainty therefore data was extracted along a vertical line where the met mast is located to make predictions of local wind velocities once the extracted data are generated from the cfd model they are compared to the wind farm data samples to determine their accuracy from each of the 35 cfd cases local velocity values at the met mast were sampled at hub height the same as one of the sensors on the met mast the results from this comparison are shown in table 4 the mean absolute error for the k ε is 0 761 m s approximately 8 relative to the comparison values and k ω sst is 0 932 m s approximately 10 5 using the binning approach this is roughly in line with the error values achieved in cfd ad by other authors comparing to wind tunnel measurements kalvig et al 2014 stergiannis et al 2016b as well as for wind far measurements javaheri and cañadillas 2013 the results from the cfd analysis are compared to the regression model and binning approaches for each individual data point in fig 9 which is a prediction against true plot where a 45 degree line indicates zero error between the two values for both the binning and ensemble approaches there is good agreement to the cfd results however the values are generally closer for the binning approach this increased accuracy of the binning approach is partially due to an averaging of the result the ensemble approach can show sharp fluctuations as the data fluctuates which would be averaged out in the binning approach this is can be a desirable behaviour to some extent but if there is too much averaging than it ceases to capture the behaviour of the real situation fig 9 also shows larger deviations from the zero error line in both approaches at higher wind speeds this is at least partially due to a lower amount of data present at these higher values and so both approaches become less reliable additionally this could be due to higher unsteadiness at higher velocities if standard deviation values were present in the scada and met mast data this could be investigated fig 10 shows the cfd predictions compared to the measured data from the scada mm for 7 5 m s free stream condition this figure shows the level of scatter present in the measured data and necessitates the use of the regression models this also shows that a significant portion of the difference between cfd prediction and data comes from the difficulty in getting a reliable representation of the measurement data as can be seen from other researchers javaheri and cañadillas 2013 avila et al 2017 measured data is typically not as smooth and determinate as steady state cfd results fig 11 shows the results for the cfd model and the regression models normalised by inflow velocity and averaged for inflow direction at 0 the mm is in the direct wake of two turbines as seen in fig 12 which causes a minor dip in the wind flow velocity this dip is much higher for the k ω sst model than for the k ε model there are numerous things which can affect turbulence kinetic energy including calibration of constants initialisation boundary conditions and so on in this case the k ω sst model predicts lower turbulence viscosity than the k ε and researchers have found that a lower turbulence viscosity results in less wake recovery stergiannis et al 2016b towards 35 degree inflow direction there is a significant drop in the mm velocity shown by the regression models which is captured more closely by this k ω sst turbulence model the results from this direction are shown in fig 13 although the met mast is roughly equidistant between the nearest two turbines this significant drop is not observed in the 35 degree direction the drop at 35 appears to be an interaction of both the near wind turbine and two upstream turbines a typical result from the simulation in shown in figs 12 and 13 which show a two dimensional cross section of the flow field through the turbine centres this image shows the velocity magnitude field the case is set up as described in the methodology section and the inputs for this particular case are inflow velocity of 10 m s and an inflow direction of 0 normal to the three rows several observations can be made from this plot this plot shows how at this direction the met mast is in the wake of two turbines and hence there is a velocity reduction at the mm another observation is that there is more of a velocity deficit on the right of the wake when viewed in the direction of wind flow than on the left this is due to how the turbines interact with the wakes from upstream turbines the third observation is that there appears to be a global reduction in velocity even where there is no immediate wake the velocity is nearly one m s lower on the left side of the figure compared to the right of the figure the turbulence viscosity for k ε where the freestream direction is 35 with a free stream velocity of 10 m s is shown in fig 14 throughout the paper the k ε model is mainly assessed due to it performing better for this model set up this shows that the air downstream of the wind farm is still turbulent for a large distance additionally the turbulence is not so high until after the third row this figure shows that the wake of the turbine is much broader than it appears in the velocity plot just by looking at velocity it might appear there are times when the mm is not in a turbine wake but from the turbulence plot one would conclude that this is never the case for the directions modelled table 4 shows the metrics for comparison of the two turbulence models against the binning and regression approaches this shows that for conducting all cases k ε outperforms k ω for how these models were set up however the difference is not as significant as it might be for a more limited range of inflow directions 7 conclusions in this study a computational fluid dynamics analysis of an existing wind farm is conducted using the actuator disk method not only are the cases conducted at multiple wind directions and velocities but the results are also compared to real recorded data from the wind farm the opensource code openfoam is used and modifications to the code are presented so that the process followed is reproducible additionally methods for processing the wind farm data are presented the two turbulence models of standard k ε and k ω sst were compared and used for all simulations it was found that both perform generally well but for this model setup k ε performs better with a mean absolute error of 8 for all cases compared to 10 for k ω sst when binning is used to compare to the met mast data in the case where the met mast is in the direct wake of two turbines up stream k ε shows good agreement with the recorded data however at 35 when the met mast is on the edge of a very close turbine k ε underpredicts wake deficit therefore an overall error value calculated for one direction only quantifies the error for that direction and not others new methods for the use of scada data in both the construction and evaluation of the wind farm models are shown two approaches of approximating the scada data to more readily compare it to the cfd predictions are shown and compared these approaches are binning the scada data and constructing regression models from the data to compare the deterministic cfd results to the scattered measurement data regression methods are used to approximate the mm data the methods chosen are gaussian process regression and ensemble bagging with mean absolute errors of 0 74 and 0 76 respectively both provide a suitable means of comparison however it is not determined which one is better the current practices for actuator disk method are well suited to modelling wake deficit for an entire wind farm at a range of inflow conditions however some care must be taken when inflow direction is varied as the error is not consistent in terms of potential future work with the growth in computational capabilities cfd can more be applied in a way that expands the compromise between capturing flow complexity and computational time by also combining machine learning approaches using the cfd results as training data this opens the possibility to use cfd for evaluating the wind farm in ways that were previously not possible declaration of competing interest no other conflict of interest is stated acknowledgements this work was supported by grant ep l016303 1 for cranfield university
