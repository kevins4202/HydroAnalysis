3095,evapotranspiration et is sensitive to environmental factors accurate assessment of et and its response to changing environments have important scientific and practical significance in the context of global climate change china has experienced tremendous land use land cover change lucc processes leaving its et dynamics and influencing factors still to be determined here the interannual variation and spatial distribution characteristics of et over china from 2005 to 2020 were analyzed based on the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model then the separate contributions of climate change and lucc to et variation were quantified by controlling the lucc scenario of the pt jpl model results indicated that the pt jpl model could accurately capture the variation of et the average annual et over china from 2005 to 2020 was 464 52 mm displaying a slightly increasing trend 0 46 mm yr 1 the regions of et increase were mainly concentrated in southern central and northeastern china separating the contributions of climate change and lucc to et revealed that climate change has a more significant effect on et than lucc among the five climatic factors the contributions of relative humidity and precipitation to et variation in dry basins were greater than those in humid or high altitude basins while temperature net radiation and wind speed showed an opposite performance net radiation and temperature were identified as the most critical factors affecting et on the national scale according to china s lucc data from 2005 to 2020 the area conversion between forestlands grasslands and croplands was more significant than that between other land cover types wetlands and forestlands corresponded to higher et values among all land cover types and conversion to other land cover types would cause a decrease in et this study can support policymaking to improve water use efficiency and optimize water resource management keywords evapotranspiration climate change land use land cover change pt jpl model china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et refers to the total water vapor flux transported from the earth s surface to the lower atmosphere it is a critical component of the water cycle and surface energy balance fisher et al 2017 approximately 60 of global precipitation ultimately returns to the atmosphere through et and this proportion is rising due to global warming jasechko et al 2013 moreover vegetation exerts a strong control on key hydrological variables including runoff and et although much attention has been given to the potential impacts of climate change anthropogenic land use land cover change lucc e g ecological restoration and urbanization is also affecting water allocation by altering the et process prăvălie et al 2019 this anomalous state of et caused by climate change and lucc may exacerbate the imbalance between water supply and demand hindering the world s sustainable development dey and mishra 2017 wang et al 2021 therefore accurately identifying the spatiotemporal variation of et and exploring the effect of climate change and lucc on et variation are of great importance for scientific management and allocation of water resources pascolini campbell et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 given the complicated variables and parameters involved e g climatic conditions land cover types and soil physical properties etc et may still be the most challenging surface flux to measure and simulate wang et al 2022 et products and et algorithms based on remote sensing rs technology have been reliable tools for studying spatiotemporal et patterns since the launch of the world s first meteorological satellite by the united states in 1960 wang and dickinson 2012 however numerous researches have shown that the currently available rs et products have a potential uncertainty of approximately 30 and few products can meet the current research needs both in temporal and spatial resolutions zou et al 2017 in contrast among the algorithms based on rs to retrieve et the penman montieth pm and priestley taylor pt models in which almost all variables and parameters have clear physical meanings are currently widely used in hydrological ecological and climatological studies shao et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 of the two models the pt model was designed to overcome the resistance uncertainty in the pm model niu et al 2019 fisher et al 2008 transformed the pt model into an actual et estimation model based on plant physiological constraints and soil drought limitations denoted as priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model shao et al 2019 optimized the sensitive parameter values in the pt jpl model according to different land cover types in china to achieve the integration of the model with vegetation dynamics reducing the simulation error of et while better reflecting the effect of vegetation change on et et is sensitive to changes in environmental factors yang et al 2021b chen et al 2019 reported that the newly added green leaf area on the earth accounts for one third of the global vegetation area during 2000 2017 the region with the highest contribution was china 25 where the large scale lucc has clearly affected its ecosystem meanwhile the water cycle will intensify under global climate change and considerably affect et through land atmosphere interactions pascolini campbell et al 2021 in this context there are large uncertainties in spatiotemporal variation of et over china given its vast size with complex and diverse climate and land cover types kang et al 2017 efforts have been made in recent years to analyze long term et variation in china based on three global high resolution et products the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam the global land data assimilation system gldas and the numerical terradynamic simulation group ntsg bai and liu 2018 revealed that et in china displayed a decreasing spatial variation trend from southeast to northwest ma et al 2019 and mo et al 2015 also detected the same et spatial variation pattern based on calibration free nonlinear complementary relationship cr model and vegetation interface processes vip model respectively but there was spatial heterogeneity in et temporal variation trend of the above studies for example in the northeastern and southeastern regions of china inconsistent variation trends were shown across et models and products whereas exhibiting the same increasing trends of et in the western region of xinjiang similarly several studies indicated that the annual average et in china has shown an increasing trend since 2000 cheng et al 2021a fu et al 2022 while li et al 2017 found that china s annual average et showed a slightly decreasing trend during 2000 2013 for which mo et al 2015 also found the same phenomenon research on the effects of climate change and lucc on et variation in china cheng et al 2021a analyzed the effects of climate and vegetation type changes on china s et using path analysis methods based on modis et products using normalized difference vegetation index ndvi instead of vegetation variation bai et al 2019 investigated the contributions of precipitation ndvi and potential evapotranspiration to et trend in the loess plateau based on scenario simulation experiments also in the loess plateau region liang et al 2020 further used leaf area index lai instead of vegetation greening and analyzed the effects of vegetation greening and climate change on et variation through a simulation strategy zhang et al 2020 identified the contributions of climate change and vegetation greening to et variation in humid coastal regions of southeast china through numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis it can be seen that most previous studies focused on the comprehensive effects of climate change and lucc on et although it can uniformly identify the effects and relative contribution of both to et climate change and lucc may offset and exacerbate each other s effects on et their separate contributions to et have not been fully captured and the individual response of et to change in each climatic factor and each land cover type have not been specifically elucidated li et al 2017 additionally the substitution of vegetation change in lucc mainly by vegetation indices e g ndvi lai also introduced some uncertainty in the assessment of et main driving factors lan et al 2021 in this study et over china from 2005 to 2020 was calculated based on the pt jpl model then a modeling experiment was carried out to assess the individual effects of climate change and lucc on et variation through the control of land cover type variables in the pt jpl model one driven by dynamic land cover type inputs and the other by static land cover type inputs the specific objectives of this study were to 1 calculate the actual et over china for 2005 2020 using the pt jpl model 2 identify the spatiotemporal variation of et during 2005 2020 and 3 quantitatively assess the individual contribution of climate change and lucc to et variation over china this study provides a reference for water resource management and water use efficiency improvement 2 study area and data 2 1 study area china covers an area of approximately 9 6 million km2 and climate of the country varies across its vast territory and diverse landscapes including temperate subtropical tropical and highland mountainous climate zones china s total annual precipitation and average annual temperature form a strong southeast northwest gradient influenced by the southeast monsoon the southeastern region has humid and semi humid zones while the northwestern portion is dominated by semiarid and arid climates and the entire country shows the natural vegetation distribution pattern of forestlands wetlands shrublands grasslands and barelands china can be divided into nine basins based on the distribution of water resources zhang et al 2011 the northwest basin nwb southwest basin swb yangtze river basin yrb pearl river basin prb southeast basin seb yellow river basin yerb haihe river basin hrb huaihe river basin hurb songhua and liaohe river basin slrb fig 1 a to evaluate the performance of the pt jpl model at the basin scale 15 small basins fig 1b were selected for calculating water balance based et details of each small basin are provided in the supplementary material table s1 2 2 data source five modis products https modis gsfc nasa gov were used for pt jpl model calculation including enhanced vegetation index evi normalized vegetation index ndvi leaf area index lai albedo data and land cover type data evi and ndvi were obtained from mod13a1 data for 2005 2020 with 16 days temporal and 500 m spatial resolution lai during the analysis period 2005 2020 was retrieved from mcd15a3h at 500 m spatial resolution with 4 days temporal resolution albedo data was from mcd43a3 with 500 m spatial resolution and a daily temporal resolution over the same analysis period from 2005 to 2020 the land cover type data was obtained from the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification layer of the yearly 500 m mcd12q1 which was reclassified into six categories including forestland shrubland grassland wetland cropland and bareland with reference to liu et al 2020 fig 1a meteorological forcing data were acquired from daily 0 25 gldas 2 1 https disc sci gsfc nasa gov including temperature specific humidity water vapor pressure downward long and short wave radiation the bilinear interpolation method was used to convert gldas data from 0 25 resolution to 500 m resolution li et al 2020 this way achieved coincidence with the modis resolution and a smooth transition of gldas data avoiding the generation of value free areas the monthly et observation data of 10 flux stations from 2005 to 2019 used in this study were obtained from the chinaflux network https www chinaflux org the locations of the 10 flux stations are shown in fig 1a and details of each flux station are presented in table 1 in addition annual average water balance based et datasets for 15 small basins were calculated by the calendar year from 2006 to 2016 monthly runoff data for each small basin are available from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china monthly gravity recovery and climate experiment grace dataset covers the period from 2006 to 2016 with the spatial resolution of 1 0 the official grace science data system https grace jpl nasa gov released monthly grace datasets derived from three different processing institutions geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz center for space research csr and jet propulsion laboratory jpl in this study the three datasets were averaged to minimize the uncertainties associated with data processing meanwhile some of the missing monthly data in the dataset were linearly interpolated by weighted averaging of the values before and after the missing months zhan et al 2022 moreover gaussian filter was also applied to further improve the accuracy of the data xiang et al 2022 3 methods 3 1 the pt jpl model the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model is a relatively simple dual source et model developed by fisher et al 2008 the model requires less ground measurement data and can be combined with remote sensing data to estimate terrestrial et it partitions et into three components canopy transpiration e c soil evaporation e s and interception evaporation e i the equations are as follows 1 et e c e s e i 2 e c 1 f wet f g f t f m α δ δ γ r nc 3 e s f wet f sm 1 f wet α δ δ γ r ns g 4 e i f wet α δ δ γ r nc where δ is the slope of the saturation to vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 α is the pt coefficient of 1 26 unitless γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 r ns and r nc represent the net radiation of soil and canopy w m 2 respectively g is the ground heat flux w m 2 the bio physiological constraints f wet f g f t f m and f sm are relative surface wetness green canopy fraction temperature constraint plant moisture

respectively f apar and f ipar are the fractions of photosynthetically active radiation par absorbed by canopy unitless and the fraction of par intercepted by canopy unitless respectively existing studies have shown that the three parameters m 1 empirical parameters for the proportion of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation range 0 1 4 β sensitivity of soil moisture limitation factor to saturated water vapor pressure difference range 0 1 and t opt in pt jpl are the most sensitive to the model output zhang et al 2017 the parameter β is related to soil evaporation while m 1 affects vegetation canopy resistance shao et al 2019 optimized the values of β and m 1 for different land cover types in china t opt takes the average temperature of vegetation growing season zhang et al 2017 12 g r n γ c 1 m γ s γ c where r n is the net radiation w m 2 γ c 0 05 and γ s 0 325 represent parameters of better vegetation coverage and bare soil area respectively bastiaanssen et al 1998a bastiaanssen et al 1998b m represents the vegetation coverage using ndvi to calculate 13 m ndvi n d v i min ndv i max n d v i min 3 2 climate change and lucc contributions assessment to better understand the mechanisms of climate and land cover type controlling et it can be assumed that the change in et is only attributed to the effects of climate change and lucc as shown in the eq 14 li et al 2017 it follows that if the climate and land cover types of a region do not change over the period the et of the region will remain constant if the climatic conditions in this region remain same then the effect of climate change on et should be the same despite changes in land cover types 14 δ e t total δ e t climate δ e t lucc where δ e t c lim ate and δ e t lucc are the value of et change due to climate change and lucc respectively δ e t total is the actual et change value e t total is calculated directly by the pt jpl model 3 2 1 climate change contribution assessment assuming that no lucc occurred in a region during 2005 2020 then the et variation within the region was attributable to the effect of climate change therefore the parameters and variables related to land cover type in the pt jpl model can be fixed to assess the impact of climate change on et for each year which means that et is calculated assuming no lucc with no change to land cover type related parameters and variables in pt jpl based on the vegetation index albedo and pt jpl temporary parameters in 2005 however different regions have different climatic characteristics li et al 2022 hence we need to explore the primary climatic factors that affect et three climatic factors are included in the pt jpl model temperature relative humidity and net radiation to analyze the effects of climate change on et more comprehensively relative humidity rh net radiation rn average temperature ta precipitation pr and wind speed ws are determined as the main objectives of this study feng et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the contribution of each climatic factor to the et trend for 2005 2020 can be computed as follows chen et al 2017 lobell et al 2011 nicholls 1997 15 y e t c lim ate a a 1 x 1

is the trend of e t c lim ate after normalizing y e t c c t r e n d is the trend of actual e t c lim ate q a c i represents the contribution of each climatic factor to the trend of e t c lim ate a and ε denote the constant term and systemic error 3 2 2 lucc contribution assessment based on the initial assumptions that if land cover types also changed the change in et was caused by climate change and lucc the effects of lucc on et δ e t lucc can be calculated by removing δ e t c lim a t e eq 14 to evaluate the et change caused by the conversion of each land cover type we examined and compared the change in et between unchanged land cover type j and changed land cover type k transformed from land cover type j eq 17 li et al 2017 odongo et al 2019 17 δ e t luc c k e t k c e t j u where e t lucc is calculated by excluding e t c lim a t e from e t total δ e t luc c k is the change in et value caused by the change in land cover type from j to k e t j u is the e t lucc values corresponding to land cover type j that did not change from year to year and e t k c is the e t lucc values corresponding to the land cover type that changed from j to k from year to year 3 3 statistical analysis the spatiotemporal trend analysis of each factor in this study was conducted based on mann kendall and sen s slope statistical tests mann 1945 kendall 1975 sen 1968 the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and percent bias pbias are selected to evaluate the accuracy of the model with the following equations 18 r 2 i 1 n y i y x i x i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 2 19 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 20 pbias i 1 n y i x i i 1 n x i 100 where n is the number of samples x i and y i are the observed and simulated values for sample i x and y denote the average of the observed and simulated values respectively 4 results 4 1 model validation fig 2 shows the validation results between et values simulated by the pt jpl model and the observed values at 10 flux stations from 2005 to 2019 the average r2 was 0 79 min 0 66 max 0 91 the average pbias and rmse were 2 85 min 13 71 max 22 26 and 16 26 mm month 1 min 13 43 mm month 1 max 19 71 mm month 1 respectively it is worth noting that pbias mostly showed negative values and was concentrated in the validation of relatively arid flux stations which means that in these regions the pt jpl model slightly underestimated et among the main vegetation types shrublands had the highest average r2 0 90 followed by grasslands 0 82 wetlands 0 81 forestlands 0 78 and the lowest for croplands 0 72 while croplands also corresponded to higher average rmse 19 71 mm month 1 and it was lowest in forestlands 15 81 mm month 1 for all climate zones the pt jpl model performed best in the temperate zone r2 0 84 and was poorer in the plateau climate zone r2 0 77 but the rmse was lower in the plateau climate zone 16 28 mm month 1 than the temperate zone 17 61 mm month 1 which may be related to the lower et rate in the plateau zone from the overall validation results of the 10 stations the pt jpl model simulations performed better in the humid regions of southeastern china and worse in the arid and semiarid regions in addition estimation of annual et by the pt jpl model in 15 small basins of china was also found to be well consistent with annual water balance based et data r2 0 92 pbias 4 24 and rmse 62 16 mm yr 1 fig 3 in general the calculated results of the pt jpl model are reliable for studying the spatial and temporal variation of chinese et and its influencing factors 4 2 spatiotemporal variation of et during 2005 2020 the average et over china from 2005 to 2020 was 464 52 mm yr 1 max 1580 54 mm yr 1 min 4 18 mm yr 1 showing a decreasing trend from the southeast coast to the northwest inland fig 4 a the regions with the lower et were mainly located in the highland arid zone where nwb is located a basin widely covered by desert grassland and sandy land with low precipitation and soil humidity in contrast et values were relatively high over the tropical and subtropical regions including prb and seb as well as the eastern part of yrb and swb among the land cover types in china fig 1a regions with dense distribution of wetlands and forestlands have higher et values compared to the vast areas of grasslands additionally the average et temporal trend in china during 2005 2020 exhibited a fluctuating increasing pattern with an increasing rate of 0 46 mm yr 1 fig 5 the annual average et variation also showed different trends in each basin with yerb showing a clear upward trend 3 73 mm yr 1 hurb showing the most significant decreasing trend 1 81 mm yr 1 nwb showing the slightest decrease 0 51 mm yr 1 and yrb showing a moderately increasing trend 0 06 mm yr 1 specifically fig 4b shows the temporal trend of et for each raster cell in china over the study period the majority of the study region 98 26 was dominated by a variation ranging from 15 to 15 mm yr 1 the regions with upward et accounted for 48 51 of china and 12 6 of china showed a significant et increase p 0 05 it was mainly located in the central part of yrb the western junction of yerb and yrb the junction of slrb and nwb in contrast et decreased significantly in 23 8 of the regions in china p 0 05 mainly located in nwb hrb hurb and the western region of swb the eastern region of yrb the central region of prb 4 3 contributions of climate change and lucc to et variation fig 6 shows the response of annual average et variation to climate change and lucc in china the fluctuations in the effect of δ e t c lim a t e on δ e t total were significantly greater than that of δ e t lucc from 2005 to 2020 although δ e t lucc has a relatively small effect on the change of e t total δ e t total was also sensitive to δ e t lucc in the years when lucc was significant for example the δ e t total trend which had been dominated by δ e t c lim a t e showed significant loosening during 2010 2014 due to lucc in addition since climate change and lucc had different positive and negative contributions to annual et change we also compared the relative contribution of climate change and lucc to et variation the results showed that there were 12 years in which the contribution of δ e t c lim a t e was greater than that of δ e t lucc the multi year average relative contribution of climate change to et change 68 4 was significantly larger than that of lucc 31 5 from 2005 to 2020 therefore climate change was the main cause for the increase in et from 2005 to 2020 over china and lucc also played a contributing role in the change of et at nine basin scales the fluctuations of δ e t lucc in hrb hurb swb and nwb were considerably smaller than the fluctuations of δ e t c lim a t e fig 6 and the relative contributions of δ e t c lim a t e on δ e t total were 74 3 73 2 72 9 and 75 6 respectively in addition although the fluctuation of δ e t lucc was not obvious in slrb and yerb δ e t c lim a t e did not have as many fluctuations as hurb and hrb thus the relative contributions of δ e t lucc to δ e t total in slrb and yerb reached 32 1 and 31 9 respectively meanwhile the relative contributions of δ e t lucc to δ e t total in prb yrb and seb were also above 30 prb was the basin with the highest influence of δ e t lucc on δ e t total 36 5 among the nine basins 4 3 1 contribution of climatic factor change to et variation the spatial dynamic change patterns of each climatic factor rh rn ta pr and ws are shown in fig 7 and the percentage of the country area corresponding to each factor change trend is shown in table 2 during 2005 2020 rh had varied mainly between 1 18 yr 1 and 1 66 yr 1 with 71 2 of china showing a decreasing trend while only 7 9 of the country reached a significant level rn showed a decreasing trend in 72 3 of the country concentrated in the central eastern part of china and only 3 2 of the country showed a significant increase the variation of ta ranged from 0 13 to 0 23 c yr 1 93 4 of china showed an increasing trend and almost the entire china showed a significant increase in ta except for some regions in slrb yerb and yrb pr and ws varied mainly between 16 36 to 48 17 mm yr 1 and 0 16 to 0 12 m s 1 yr 1 respectively pr mainly showed an increasing trend in the country with 31 6 of the regions increasing significantly while ws showed a significant decrease in 47 6 of the regions over china the spatial distributions of contributions from five climatic factors to et variation are shown in fig 8 corresponding to the average and relative contribution in the nine basins of china as shown in fig 9 the average contribution of rh rn ta pr and ws to et change over china was 0 35 mm yr 1 0 76 mm yr 1 0 63 mm yr 1 0 11 mm yr 1 and 0 22 mm yr 1 with relative contribution of 17 37 30 5 and 11 respectively among all the climatic factors rh ta and ws displayed positive contributions to et change in 63 9 67 6 and 47 1 of the regions in china in contrast rn and pr contributed negatively to et change in 66 3 and 45 3 of the regions in china the distribution of positive and negative contribution regions was relatively dispersed for ta pr and ws whereas the positive contribution regions of rh were mainly distributed in the upstream zone of yerb yrb swb and the junction of slrb hrb nwb the negative contribution regions of rn were mainly distributed in hurb yrb and prb comparing the contribution of each climatic factor to et variation at nine basins showed that the incidence of climatic factors on et varied from region to region fig 9 rn and ta dominated with an absolute advantage in five basins hrb hurb yrb prb and seb rh was the dominant factor in three relatively arid basins slrb yerb and nwb ws played a dominant role in swb which is mainly located in the tibetan plateau region these results indicated that the variation of et over china was mainly caused by rn and ta as the main moisture source of et the contribution of pr was the smallest over china because it mostly displayed either positive or negative contribution at different basins specifically in each basin the contribution of pr 10 20 had a significant increase and was relatively stable compared to other climate factors the contributions of ta and rn in relatively wet basins such as yrb prb and seb were greater than those in relatively dry basins such as yerb slrb and hurb while rh and pr showed the opposite performance ws had a greater impact on higher elevation basins swb in summary the contributions of rn and ta to et change were dominant in both national and basin scales while rh ws and pr had a relatively smaller performance at the national level but their contributions would change at different basin scales 4 3 2 contribution of land cover type transition to et variation fig 10 a shows the variation of each land cover type in china from 2005 to 2020 the land cover type conversion mostly occurred at the junction of each land cover type and the vegetation coverage of major land cover types except shrublands showed an increasing trend fig 10b total vegetation coverage in china increased significantly after 2010 fig 10c responding to the phenomenon shown in fig 6 where china s δ e t lucc had an elevated impact on δ e t total during 2010 2014 from the specific change values in lucc table 3 the area of forestlands increased by 3 13 77914 km2 from 2005 to 2020 and croplands were the main source of forestlands meanwhile the area of grasslands and barelands both decreased with the largest decrease in barelands 2 72 64 866 km2 which was mainly converted to grasslands while grasslands decreased by 1 67 49043 km2 mainly converted into croplands and forestlands the conversion of grasslands to croplands was higher than the conversion to forestlands therefore although the project of returning cropland to forestland had a positive effect the area of cropland was replenished by crowding out the area of grassland to clarify the effect of each land cover type conversion on et this study first compared the corresponding multi year average et values for each land cover type with the order of decreasing et water consumption being wetland forestland cropland grassland shrubland bareland fig 11 shows the change in et caused by each land cover type conversion from 2005 to 2020 similar to the order of decrease in et water consumption corresponding to each land cover type et decreased when converting from forestlands and wetlands to other land cover types indicating that the value of et was higher in forestlands and wetlands than in other land cover types notably the conversion of forestlands to other land cover types resulted in a greater magnitude of et change than the conversion of other land cover types to forestlands for example et decreased by 21 7 mm yr 1 for conversion of forestlands to grasslands but only increased by 12 1 mm yr 1 for conversion of grasslands to forestlands which may be related to the difference in growth cycles between forestlands and other land cover types because the conversion area and et values of forestlands were relatively high during 2005 2020 table 3 the contribution of lucc from forestlands to et should be the largest among the land cover types furthermore the values of et change between grasslands croplands and forestlands showed that the effect of returning grasslands to forestlands on the change in et was greater than that of returning croplands to forestlands the et variation caused by conversion from other land cover types to barelands was higher than that caused by conversion from barelands to other land cover types in the period 2005 2020 which means that et loss due to vegetation degradation may not be compensated by vegetation restoration 5 discussion 5 1 spatiotemporal analysis of et variation the validation results with flux site based et and water balance based et indicated that et values calculated by the pt jpl model for china performed well figs 2 and 3 the et over china increased from northwest to southeast fig 4a with a multi year average et of 464 52 mm yr 1 for the period 2005 2020 given the considerable uncertainties we compared the results of previous studies cheng et al 2021a and cheng et al 2021b used the modis product and the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model to calculate the average et values over china for 2001 2018 as 359 61 mm yr 1 and 482 27 mm yr 1 and noted that the modis product underestimated the actual et in china su et al 2021 pooled six reanalysis et datasets and obtained average et values in china ranging from 409 to 679 mm yr 1 during 1980 2015 in addition the average values of et in china for the 1980 s 2010 s calculated by related scholars based on the remote sensing et model et products and et data from chinese flux sites were in the range of 350 700 mm yr 1 bai and liu 2018 ma et al 2019 sun et al 2017 chen et al 2014 simulated significantly higher et values 535 852 mm yr 1 for 1982 2009 in china based on eight et models and validated them by using measured data from china flux stations which found that r2 ranged from 0 5 to 0 8 this study was 0 6 0 9 the divergences between the results of the above studies may be related to the differences in the model structures and input datasets mueller et al 2013 zhou et al 2012 the average et value and simulation accuracy of pt jpl in this study were within the range of existing research results the average et variation trend in china from 2005 to 2020 was 0 46 mm yr 1 liu et al 2016 showed that the peak of et in china since 1980 occurred around 1997 after which it decreased given the inconsistent choice of data sources and starting ending years the et variation trend showed different numerical fluctuations existing studies calculated the et trend in china since 1997 based on different et estimation models or related products and found that the main range was between 2 19 and 2 95 mm yr 1 liu et al 2016 cheng et al 2021a yang et al 2021a specifically for each basin in china figs 4b and 5 the regions with increase in et were mainly concentrated in the yrb yerb and slrb mokhtar et al 2020 and shao et al 2019 also found an increasing trend of et in the middle and upper reaches of yrb and yerb slrb hrb hurb and yerb are mainly located in the northern part of china although the climate is dry and water resources are relatively scarce these basins also have high et values because of the developed irrigation agriculture cheng et al 2021a as a result of low precipitation and soil moisture limiting surface et nwb generally has lower et values among the nine basins swb which is mainly located in the tibetan plateau region has higher et values compared to nwb because of its low latitude and high precipitation the overall annual average et in swb showed a slight upward trend which might be caused by different et variation trends in the eastern and western parts of the basin han et al 2021 analyzed the et in the tibetan plateau region and reported the same variation pattern the three basins along the southeast coast of china yrb prb and seb showed higher et values owing to the abundance of water and radiation due to the differences in the size and topographic conditions of each basin et showed different trends in these three basins 5 2 effect of climate change on et variation compared with lucc climate change was the main cause of et change in china from 2005 to 2020 fig 6 the influence of five climatic factors rh rn ta pr and ws on et was quantitatively analyzed and it was found that rn and ta were the main influencing factors at the national level fig 9 the same phenomenon had also been observed in other regions of the world including north america africa and europe in recent years boé and terray 2008 gaertner et al 2019 hoffman et al 2011 among the five climatic factors affecting et change rn showed a significant decreasing trend in most regions of the country fig 7 and the decrease in rn is usually associated with an increase in cloudiness and aerosols in the atmosphere roderick et al 2009 comparing fig 4b 7b and 8b it can be seen that the regions with the decrease in et and rn had a similar spatial distribution especially in the nwb prb the middle and lower reaches of yrb in china rh pr and ta played major contributions to et increase in yrb yerb and slrb fig 8 ta showed an increasing trend in most regions of the country and had an important positive effect on et change but comparing the average contribution values of each climatic factor to et in china fig 9 it can be seen that the decrease in et caused by rn was greater than the increase in et caused by ta this gives the phenomenon of increasing in ta and decreasing in et which explains the evaporation paradox to some extent roderick and farquhar 2002 fig 9 shows that the average contribution of rn or ta to et was mostly uniformly negative or positive in nine basins while the positive and negative contributions of rh and pr were relatively dispersed in different basins thus even though the relative contributions of rh and pr to et change were not significant at the national level the relative contributions of these two factors were obviously improved in each basin specifically in addition ponce campos et al 2013 showed that et behaved most sensitive to moisture factors in arid regions by comparing the relative contribution of each climatic factor in different basins it can be seen that pr and rh showed significantly higher contributions to et change in relatively dry basins while rn and ta show the opposite performance the contribution of each climatic factor to et variation showed spatial heterogeneity fig 8 shows that the regional distributions of positive and negative contributions of pr ws and ta were relatively scattered whereas the spatial distribution of rn and rh contributions were relatively uniform from eq 15 and eq 16 the spatial distribution of each climatic factor s contribution to et trend was mainly controlled by the regression coefficients and the trend of each factor therefore when a climatic factor showed general upward or downward trend in a region the spatial distribution of this factor s contribution to et was similar to the spatial distribution of the regression coefficients fig s1 e g ta pr ws on the contrary when the regression coefficients between the climatic factor and et showed general positive or negative correlation in a region the spatial distribution of the climatic factor s contribution to et was similar to the spatial distribution of the factor s variation trend e g rn rh moreover the five considered climatic factors are not completely independent of each other and their interactions may also play some roles in et variation she et al 2017 meanwhile surface topographic factors may also cause different regions to show different correlations between et and each climatic factor lian and zeng 2018 future studies should consider this issue to better determine the influence of each climatic factor on et 5 3 effect of lucc on et variation the chinese government has implemented several restoration strategies to prevent ecological degradation large scale lucc has occurred in china and caused ecohydrological problems such as reduced runoff and soil drought qiu et al 2011 our study determined the land transfer matrix for 2005 2020 based on modis reclassified land cover type data and specified the et change caused by each land cover type transfer table 3 the lucc over china has a positive contribution to et change from 2005 to 2020 the interconversion between forestland grassland and cropland in china was obvious in these 16 years and the areas of forestland shrubland and wetland increased while the areas of grassland and bareland decreased most of the land cover type conversions were concentrated in the east central basins of china such as slrb yerb yrb and prb fig 10a lan et al 2021 found a significant increase in lai in these basins relative to others and vegetation greening had an important influence on et change in this study we also found that the contribution of lucc to et was higher 30 in the slrb yerb yrb and prb compared to other basins which might be related to the greening of vegetation in these basins according to lan et al 2021 forestlands have a taller canopy structure larger leaf area and deeper root distribution indicating that afforestation and deforestation are the most influential lucc processes affecting et ye et al 2021 some researches have found that soil et increased during the conversion of forestlands to croplands but the overall mean et still showed a decreasing trend dias et al 2015 olchev et al 2008 in this study when we quantified the et change caused by the conversion process of each land cover type it was found that forestlands and wetlands caused a decrease in et during conversion to other land cover types fig 11 wetlands also tend to have stronger et than ordinary substrates owing to the large area of vegetation and high water content granata et al 2020 the change in et caused by the interconversion of wetlands and forestlands was positive but the magnitude of et change due to the conversion of forestlands to wetlands was higher than that caused by the conversion of wetlands to forestlands and this phenomenon also occurred in the conversion between grasslands and shrublands the conversion between barelands and other land cover types revealed that vegetation degradation had a greater impact on et than vegetation restoration considering that lucc has local effects on the water cycle although the effect of climate change was excluded in this study the same land cover type in different regions might have diverse et characteristics due to differences in vegetation growth cycle and cover wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b in addition the availability of water resources in a region has a greater impact on et variation for each land cover type zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2018 accordingly the implementation of vegetation restoration projects for arid water scarce regions should effectively reduce the planting of high et vegetation types plant species that absorb large amounts of water should be regularly reduced in regions with high vegetation density and extensive greening the et water consumption sequence obtained in this study wetland forestland cropland grassland shrubland bareland is a good reference for future regional ecosystem planning 5 4 uncertainties and limitations the pt jpl model in this study was driven by modis and gldas data gldas used the bilinear interpolation method to achieve a resolution match with modis data although the model validation results performed well the use of remotely sensed data inevitably resulted in potential spatiotemporal inaccuracies and limited the results of the final correlation analysis in addition the et values simulated by the pt jpl model were lower in the relatively dry regions compared with the measured data considering the low vegetation cover and the large proportion of soil evaporation in these regions it was inferred that the lower simulated values than the measured values might be caused by the low calculation of the soil evaporation module in the model cui et al 2021 meanwhile the uncertainty of land classification and the spatially irregular distribution of the chinese flux station network may also affect the optimization and validation results of the pt jpl model zhang et al 2019b it should also be noted that there are limitations to separating the effects of lucc and climate change on et for example lucc inevitably affects or feeds back the surface energy distribution leading to the change in radiative fluxes lan et al 2021 climate change can also affect lucc by changing vegetation phenology patterns yang et al 2016 the different growth cycles of vegetation and the interaction between climatic factors may also play some roles in et variation the results of this research can provide a theoretical reference for assessing the separate effects of climate change and lucc on et and the feedback mechanism between lucc and climate change can be considered in the future to further deepen the study 6 conclusion based on the pt jpl model this study investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of et variation over china from 2005 to 2020 in contrast to the previous comprehensive evaluation of influencing factors we separated climate change and lucc by controlling the land cover type variables in the pt jpl model and evaluated their individual contribution to et the main conclusions are as follows 1 in this study the actual et in china from 2005 to 2020 was simulated by the pt jpl model tests including comparison with et from flux field observations under different land cover types and water balance based et in 15 small basins confirmed that the et values simulated by the pt jpl model were reliable over china 2 from 2005 to 2020 the average annual et in china was 464 52 mm yr 1 increasing at a slight rate of 0 46 mm yr 1 spatially et decreased gradually from the southeast coast to the northwest inland the significant increase in et was mainly concentrated in southern central and northeastern china 3 the contribution of climate change to et was more significant than lucc over china among the five climatic factors ta and pr displayed an increasing trend while rh rn and ws showed a decreasing trend in most regions of china from 2005 to 2020 rn and ta had a greater influence on et than rh pr and ws the moisture factors rh and pr had a dominant influence on et change in relatively dry basins while the thermal factors rn and ta and power factors ws were more prominent in basins with relatively sufficient moisture and higher elevation 4 during 2005 2020 the conversion of area between forestland cropland and grassland was the most significant this was manifested by the decrease in the area of grassland and the increase in the area of forestland and cropland in this process wetland and forestland corresponded to higher et values and the conversion to other land cover types would cause a decrease in et the order of decreasing evaporative water consumption for each land cover type in china from 2005 to 2020 was wetland forestland cropland grassland shrubland bareland although the effect of lucc on et was less significant than that of climate change it cannot be neglected in the analysis of factors influencing et due to the regional effect of lucc credit authorship contribution statement xiaoyang li methodology investigation software visualization writing original draft lei zou methodology

3095,evapotranspiration et is sensitive to environmental factors accurate assessment of et and its response to changing environments have important scientific and practical significance in the context of global climate change china has experienced tremendous land use land cover change lucc processes leaving its et dynamics and influencing factors still to be determined here the interannual variation and spatial distribution characteristics of et over china from 2005 to 2020 were analyzed based on the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model then the separate contributions of climate change and lucc to et variation were quantified by controlling the lucc scenario of the pt jpl model results indicated that the pt jpl model could accurately capture the variation of et the average annual et over china from 2005 to 2020 was 464 52 mm displaying a slightly increasing trend 0 46 mm yr 1 the regions of et increase were mainly concentrated in southern central and northeastern china separating the contributions of climate change and lucc to et revealed that climate change has a more significant effect on et than lucc among the five climatic factors the contributions of relative humidity and precipitation to et variation in dry basins were greater than those in humid or high altitude basins while temperature net radiation and wind speed showed an opposite performance net radiation and temperature were identified as the most critical factors affecting et on the national scale according to china s lucc data from 2005 to 2020 the area conversion between forestlands grasslands and croplands was more significant than that between other land cover types wetlands and forestlands corresponded to higher et values among all land cover types and conversion to other land cover types would cause a decrease in et this study can support policymaking to improve water use efficiency and optimize water resource management keywords evapotranspiration climate change land use land cover change pt jpl model china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et refers to the total water vapor flux transported from the earth s surface to the lower atmosphere it is a critical component of the water cycle and surface energy balance fisher et al 2017 approximately 60 of global precipitation ultimately returns to the atmosphere through et and this proportion is rising due to global warming jasechko et al 2013 moreover vegetation exerts a strong control on key hydrological variables including runoff and et although much attention has been given to the potential impacts of climate change anthropogenic land use land cover change lucc e g ecological restoration and urbanization is also affecting water allocation by altering the et process prăvălie et al 2019 this anomalous state of et caused by climate change and lucc may exacerbate the imbalance between water supply and demand hindering the world s sustainable development dey and mishra 2017 wang et al 2021 therefore accurately identifying the spatiotemporal variation of et and exploring the effect of climate change and lucc on et variation are of great importance for scientific management and allocation of water resources pascolini campbell et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 given the complicated variables and parameters involved e g climatic conditions land cover types and soil physical properties etc et may still be the most challenging surface flux to measure and simulate wang et al 2022 et products and et algorithms based on remote sensing rs technology have been reliable tools for studying spatiotemporal et patterns since the launch of the world s first meteorological satellite by the united states in 1960 wang and dickinson 2012 however numerous researches have shown that the currently available rs et products have a potential uncertainty of approximately 30 and few products can meet the current research needs both in temporal and spatial resolutions zou et al 2017 in contrast among the algorithms based on rs to retrieve et the penman montieth pm and priestley taylor pt models in which almost all variables and parameters have clear physical meanings are currently widely used in hydrological ecological and climatological studies shao et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 of the two models the pt model was designed to overcome the resistance uncertainty in the pm model niu et al 2019 fisher et al 2008 transformed the pt model into an actual et estimation model based on plant physiological constraints and soil drought limitations denoted as priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model shao et al 2019 optimized the sensitive parameter values in the pt jpl model according to different land cover types in china to achieve the integration of the model with vegetation dynamics reducing the simulation error of et while better reflecting the effect of vegetation change on et et is sensitive to changes in environmental factors yang et al 2021b chen et al 2019 reported that the newly added green leaf area on the earth accounts for one third of the global vegetation area during 2000 2017 the region with the highest contribution was china 25 where the large scale lucc has clearly affected its ecosystem meanwhile the water cycle will intensify under global climate change and considerably affect et through land atmosphere interactions pascolini campbell et al 2021 in this context there are large uncertainties in spatiotemporal variation of et over china given its vast size with complex and diverse climate and land cover types kang et al 2017 efforts have been made in recent years to analyze long term et variation in china based on three global high resolution et products the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam the global land data assimilation system gldas and the numerical terradynamic simulation group ntsg bai and liu 2018 revealed that et in china displayed a decreasing spatial variation trend from southeast to northwest ma et al 2019 and mo et al 2015 also detected the same et spatial variation pattern based on calibration free nonlinear complementary relationship cr model and vegetation interface processes vip model respectively but there was spatial heterogeneity in et temporal variation trend of the above studies for example in the northeastern and southeastern regions of china inconsistent variation trends were shown across et models and products whereas exhibiting the same increasing trends of et in the western region of xinjiang similarly several studies indicated that the annual average et in china has shown an increasing trend since 2000 cheng et al 2021a fu et al 2022 while li et al 2017 found that china s annual average et showed a slightly decreasing trend during 2000 2013 for which mo et al 2015 also found the same phenomenon research on the effects of climate change and lucc on et variation in china cheng et al 2021a analyzed the effects of climate and vegetation type changes on china s et using path analysis methods based on modis et products using normalized difference vegetation index ndvi instead of vegetation variation bai et al 2019 investigated the contributions of precipitation ndvi and potential evapotranspiration to et trend in the loess plateau based on scenario simulation experiments also in the loess plateau region liang et al 2020 further used leaf area index lai instead of vegetation greening and analyzed the effects of vegetation greening and climate change on et variation through a simulation strategy zhang et al 2020 identified the contributions of climate change and vegetation greening to et variation in humid coastal regions of southeast china through numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis it can be seen that most previous studies focused on the comprehensive effects of climate change and lucc on et although it can uniformly identify the effects and relative contribution of both to et climate change and lucc may offset and exacerbate each other s effects on et their separate contributions to et have not been fully captured and the individual response of et to change in each climatic factor and each land cover type have not been specifically elucidated li et al 2017 additionally the substitution of vegetation change in lucc mainly by vegetation indices e g ndvi lai also introduced some uncertainty in the assessment of et main driving factors lan et al 2021 in this study et over china from 2005 to 2020 was calculated based on the pt jpl model then a modeling experiment was carried out to assess the individual effects of climate change and lucc on et variation through the control of land cover type variables in the pt jpl model one driven by dynamic land cover type inputs and the other by static land cover type inputs the specific objectives of this study were to 1 calculate the actual et over china for 2005 2020 using the pt jpl model 2 identify the spatiotemporal variation of et during 2005 2020 and 3 quantitatively assess the individual contribution of climate change and lucc to et variation over china this study provides a reference for water resource management and water use efficiency improvement 2 study area and data 2 1 study area china covers an area of approximately 9 6 million km2 and climate of the country varies across its vast territory and diverse landscapes including temperate subtropical tropical and highland mountainous climate zones china s total annual precipitation and average annual temperature form a strong southeast northwest gradient influenced by the southeast monsoon the southeastern region has humid and semi humid zones while the northwestern portion is dominated by semiarid and arid climates and the entire country shows the natural vegetation distribution pattern of forestlands wetlands shrublands grasslands and barelands china can be divided into nine basins based on the distribution of water resources zhang et al 2011 the northwest basin nwb southwest basin swb yangtze river basin yrb pearl river basin prb southeast basin seb yellow river basin yerb haihe river basin hrb huaihe river basin hurb songhua and liaohe river basin slrb fig 1 a to evaluate the performance of the pt jpl model at the basin scale 15 small basins fig 1b were selected for calculating water balance based et details of each small basin are provided in the supplementary material table s1 2 2 data source five modis products https modis gsfc nasa gov were used for pt jpl model calculation including enhanced vegetation index evi normalized vegetation index ndvi leaf area index lai albedo data and land cover type data evi and ndvi were obtained from mod13a1 data for 2005 2020 with 16 days temporal and 500 m spatial resolution lai during the analysis period 2005 2020 was retrieved from mcd15a3h at 500 m spatial resolution with 4 days temporal resolution albedo data was from mcd43a3 with 500 m spatial resolution and a daily temporal resolution over the same analysis period from 2005 to 2020 the land cover type data was obtained from the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification layer of the yearly 500 m mcd12q1 which was reclassified into six categories including forestland shrubland grassland wetland cropland and bareland with reference to liu et al 2020 fig 1a meteorological forcing data were acquired from daily 0 25 gldas 2 1 https disc sci gsfc nasa gov including temperature specific humidity water vapor pressure downward long and short wave radiation the bilinear interpolation method was used to convert gldas data from 0 25 resolution to 500 m resolution li et al 2020 this way achieved coincidence with the modis resolution and a smooth transition of gldas data avoiding the generation of value free areas the monthly et observation data of 10 flux stations from 2005 to 2019 used in this study were obtained from the chinaflux network https www chinaflux org the locations of the 10 flux stations are shown in fig 1a and details of each flux station are presented in table 1 in addition annual average water balance based et datasets for 15 small basins were calculated by the calendar year from 2006 to 2016 monthly runoff data for each small basin are available from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china monthly gravity recovery and climate experiment grace dataset covers the period from 2006 to 2016 with the spatial resolution of 1 0 the official grace science data system https grace jpl nasa gov released monthly grace datasets derived from three different processing institutions geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz center for space research csr and jet propulsion laboratory jpl in this study the three datasets were averaged to minimize the uncertainties associated with data processing meanwhile some of the missing monthly data in the dataset were linearly interpolated by weighted averaging of the values before and after the missing months zhan et al 2022 moreover gaussian filter was also applied to further improve the accuracy of the data xiang et al 2022 3 methods 3 1 the pt jpl model the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model is a relatively simple dual source et model developed by fisher et al 2008 the model requires less ground measurement data and can be combined with remote sensing data to estimate terrestrial et it partitions et into three components canopy transpiration e c soil evaporation e s and interception evaporation e i the equations are as follows 1 et e c e s e i 2 e c 1 f wet f g f t f m α δ δ γ r nc 3 e s f wet f sm 1 f wet α δ δ γ r ns g 4 e i f wet α δ δ γ r nc where δ is the slope

respectively g is the ground heat flux w m 2 the bio physiological constraints f wet f g f t f m and f sm are relative surface wetness green canopy fraction temperature constraint plant moisture

respectively f apar and f ipar are the fractions of photosynthetically active radiation par absorbed by canopy unitless and the fraction of par intercepted by canopy unitless respectively existing studies have shown that the three parameters m 1 empirical parameters for the proportion of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation range 0 1 4 β sensitivity of soil moisture limitation factor to saturated water vapor pressure difference range 0 1 and t opt in pt jpl are the most sensitive to the model output zhang et al 2017 the parameter β is related to soil evaporation while m 1 affects vegetation canopy resistance shao et al 2019 optimized the values of β and m 1 for different land cover types in china t opt takes the average temperature of vegetation growing

assessment to better understand the mechanisms of climate and land cover type controlling et it can be assumed that the change in et is only attributed to the effects of climate change and lucc as shown in the eq 14 li et al 2017 it follows that if the climate and land cover types of a region do not change over the period the et of the region will remain constant if the climatic conditions in this region remain same then the effect of climate change on et should be the same despite changes in land cover types 14 δ e t total δ e t climate δ e t lucc where δ e t c lim ate and δ e t lucc are the value of et change due to climate change and lucc respectively δ e t total is the actual et change value e t total is calculated directly by the pt jpl model 3 2 1 climate change contribution assessment assuming that no lucc occurred in a region during 2005 2020 then the et variation within the region was attributable to the effect of climate change therefore the parameters and variables related to land cover type in the pt jpl model can be fixed to assess the impact of climate change on et for each year which means that et is calculated assuming no lucc with no change to land cover type related parameters and variables in pt jpl based on the vegetation index albedo and pt jpl temporary parameters in 2005 however different regions have different climatic characteristics li et al 2022 hence we need to explore the primary climatic factors that affect et three climatic factors are included in the pt jpl model temperature relative humidity and net radiation to analyze the effects of climate change on et more comprehensively relative humidity rh net radiation rn average temperature ta precipitation pr and wind speed ws are determined as the main objectives of this study feng et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the contribution of each climatic factor to the et trend for 2005 2020 can be computed as follows chen et al 2017 lobell et al 2011 nicholls 1997 15 y e t c lim ate a a 1 x 1

ε denote the constant term and systemic error 3 2 2 lucc contribution assessment based on the initial assumptions that if land cover types also changed the change in et was caused by climate change and lucc the effects of lucc on et δ e t lucc can be calculated by removing δ e t c lim a t e eq 14 to evaluate the et change caused by the conversion of each land cover type we examined and compared the change in et between unchanged land cover type j and changed land cover type k transformed from land cover type j eq 17 li et al 2017 odongo et al 2019 17 δ e t luc c k e t k c e t j u where e t lucc is calculated by excluding e t c lim a t e from e t total δ e t luc c k is the change in et value caused by the change in land cover type from j to k e t j u is the e t lucc values corresponding to land cover type j that did not change from year to year and e t k c is the e t lucc values corresponding to the land cover type that changed from j to k from year to year 3 3 statistical analysis the spatiotemporal trend analysis of each factor in this study was conducted based on mann kendall and sen s slope statistical tests mann 1945 kendall 1975 sen 1968 the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and percent bias pbias are selected to evaluate the accuracy of the model with the following equations 18 r 2 i 1 n y i y x i x i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 2 19 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 20 pbias i 1 n y i x i i 1 n x i 100 where n is the number of samples x i and y i are the observed and simulated values for sample i x and y denote the average of the observed and simulated values respectively 4 results 4 1 model validation fig 2 shows the validation results between et values simulated by the pt jpl model and the observed values at 10 flux stations from 2005 to 2019 the average r2 was 0 79 min 0 66 max 0 91 the average pbias and rmse were 2 85 min 13 71 max 22 26 and 16 26 mm month 1 min 13 43 mm month 1 max 19 71 mm month 1 respectively it is worth noting that pbias mostly showed negative values and was concentrated in the validation of relatively arid flux stations which means that in these regions the pt jpl model slightly underestimated et among the main vegetation types shrublands had the highest average r2 0 90 followed by grasslands 0 82 wetlands 0 81 forestlands 0 78 and the lowest for croplands 0 72 while croplands also corresponded to higher average rmse 19 71 mm month 1 and it was lowest in forestlands 15 81 mm month 1 for all climate zones the pt jpl model performed best in the temperate zone r2 0 84 and was poorer in the plateau climate zone r2 0 77 but the rmse was lower in the plateau climate zone 16 28 mm month 1 than the temperate zone 17 61 mm month 1 which may be related to the lower et rate in the plateau zone from the overall validation results of the 10 stations the pt jpl model simulations performed better in the humid regions of southeastern china and worse in the arid and semiarid regions in addition estimation of annual et by the pt jpl model in 15 small basins of china was also found to be well consistent with annual water balance based et data r2 0 92 pbias 4 24 and rmse 62 16 mm yr 1 fig 3 in general the calculated results of the pt jpl model are reliable for studying the spatial and temporal variation of chinese et and its influencing factors 4 2 spatiotemporal variation of et during 2005 2020 the average et over china from 2005 to 2020 was 464 52 mm yr 1 max 1580 54 mm yr 1 min 4 18 mm yr 1 showing a decreasing trend from the southeast coast to the northwest inland fig 4 a the regions with the lower et were mainly located in the highland arid zone where nwb is located a basin widely covered by desert grassland and sandy land with low precipitation and soil humidity in contrast et values were relatively high over the tropical and subtropical regions including prb and seb as well as the eastern part of yrb and swb among the land cover types in china fig 1a regions with dense distribution of wetlands and forestlands have higher et values compared to the vast areas of grasslands additionally the average et temporal trend in china during 2005 2020 exhibited a fluctuating increasing pattern with an increasing rate of 0 46 mm yr 1 fig 5 the annual average et variation also showed different trends in each basin with yerb showing a clear upward trend 3 73 mm yr 1 hurb showing the most significant decreasing trend 1 81 mm yr 1 nwb showing the slightest decrease 0 51 mm yr 1 and yrb showing a moderately increasing trend 0 06 mm yr 1 specifically fig 4b shows the temporal trend of et for each raster cell in china over the study period the majority of the study region 98 26 was dominated by a variation ranging from 15 to 15 mm yr 1 the regions with upward et accounted for 48 51 of china and 12 6 of china showed a significant et increase p 0 05 it was mainly located in the central part of yrb the western junction of yerb and yrb the junction of slrb and nwb in contrast et decreased significantly in 23 8 of the regions in china p 0 05 mainly located in nwb hrb hurb and the western region of swb the eastern region of yrb the central region of prb 4 3 contributions of climate change and lucc to et variation fig 6 shows the response of annual average et variation to climate change and lucc in china the fluctuations in the effect of δ e t c lim a t e on δ e t total were significantly greater than that of δ e t lucc from 2005 to 2020 although δ e t lucc has a relatively small effect on the change of e t total δ e t total was also sensitive to δ e t lucc in the years when lucc was significant for example the δ e t total trend which had been dominated by δ e t c lim a t e showed significant loosening during 2010 2014 due to lucc in addition since climate change and lucc had different positive and negative contributions to annual et change we also compared the relative contribution of climate change and lucc to et variation the results showed that there were 12 years in which the contribution of δ e t c lim a t e was greater than that of δ e t lucc the multi year average relative contribution of climate change to et change 68 4 was significantly larger than that of lucc 31 5 from 2005 to 2020 therefore climate change was the main cause for the increase in et from 2005 to 2020 over china and lucc also played a contributing role in the change of et at nine basin scales the fluctuations of δ e t lucc in hrb hurb swb and nwb were considerably smaller than the fluctuations of δ e t c lim a t e fig 6 and the relative contributions of δ e t c lim a t e on δ e t total were 74 3 73 2 72 9 and 75 6 respectively in addition although the fluctuation of δ e t lucc was not obvious in slrb and yerb δ e t c lim a t e did not have as many fluctuations as hurb and hrb thus the relative contributions of δ e t lucc to δ e t total in slrb and yerb reached 32 1 and 31 9 respectively meanwhile the relative contributions of δ e t lucc to δ e t total in prb yrb and seb were also above 30 prb was the basin with the highest influence of δ e t lucc on δ e t total 36 5 among the nine basins 4 3 1 contribution of climatic factor change to et variation the spatial dynamic change patterns of each climatic factor rh rn ta pr and ws are shown in fig 7 and the percentage of the country area corresponding to each factor change trend is shown in table 2 during 2005 2020 rh had varied mainly between 1 18 yr 1 and 1 66 yr 1 with 71 2 of china showing a decreasing trend while only 7 9 of the country reached a significant level rn showed a decreasing trend in 72 3 of the country concentrated in the central eastern part of china and only 3 2 of the country showed a significant increase the variation of ta ranged from 0 13 to 0 23 c yr 1 93 4 of china showed an increasing trend and almost the entire china showed a significant increase in ta except for some regions in slrb yerb and yrb pr and ws varied mainly between 16 36 to 48 17 mm yr 1 and 0 16 to 0 12 m s 1 yr 1 respectively pr mainly showed an increasing trend in the country with 31 6 of the regions increasing significantly while ws showed a significant decrease in 47 6 of the regions over china the spatial distributions of contributions from five climatic factors to et variation are shown in fig 8 corresponding to the average and relative contribution in the nine basins of china as shown in fig 9 the average contribution of rh rn ta pr and ws to et change over china was 0 35 mm yr 1 0 76 mm yr 1 0 63 mm yr 1 0 11 mm yr 1 and 0 22 mm yr 1 with relative contribution of 17 37 30 5 and 11 respectively among all the climatic factors rh ta and ws displayed positive contributions to et change in 63 9 67 6 and 47 1 of the regions in china in contrast rn and pr contributed negatively to et change in 66 3 and 45 3 of the regions in china the distribution of positive and negative contribution regions was relatively dispersed for ta pr and ws whereas the positive contribution regions of rh were mainly distributed in the upstream zone of yerb yrb swb and the junction of slrb hrb nwb the negative contribution regions of rn were mainly distributed in hurb yrb and prb comparing the contribution of each climatic factor to et variation at nine basins showed that the incidence of climatic factors on et varied from region to region fig 9 rn and ta dominated with an absolute advantage in five basins hrb hurb yrb prb and seb rh was the dominant factor in three relatively arid basins slrb yerb and nwb ws played a dominant role in swb which is mainly located in the tibetan plateau region these results indicated that the variation of et over china was mainly caused by rn and ta as the main moisture source of et the contribution of pr was the smallest over china because it mostly displayed either positive or negative contribution at different basins specifically in each basin the contribution of pr 10 20 had a significant increase and was relatively stable compared to other climate factors the contributions of ta and rn in relatively wet basins such as yrb prb and seb were greater than those in relatively dry basins such as yerb slrb and hurb while rh and pr showed the opposite performance ws had a greater impact on higher elevation basins swb in summary the contributions of rn and ta to et change were dominant in both national and basin scales while rh ws and pr had a relatively smaller performance at the national level but their contributions would change at different basin scales 4 3 2 contribution of land cover type transition to et variation fig 10 a shows the variation of each land cover type in china from 2005 to 2020 the land cover type conversion mostly occurred at the junction of each land cover type and the vegetation coverage of major land cover types except shrublands showed an increasing trend fig 10b total vegetation coverage in china increased significantly after 2010 fig 10c responding to the phenomenon shown in fig 6 where china s δ e t lucc had an elevated impact on δ e t total during 2010 2014 from the specific change values in lucc table 3 the area of forestlands increased by 3 13 77914 km2 from 2005 to 2020 and croplands were the main source of forestlands meanwhile the area of grasslands and barelands both decreased with the largest decrease in barelands 2 72 64 866 km2 which was mainly converted to grasslands while grasslands decreased by 1 67 49043 km2 mainly converted into croplands and forestlands the conversion of grasslands to croplands was higher than the conversion to forestlands therefore although the project of returning cropland to forestland had a positive effect the area of cropland was replenished by crowding out the area of grassland to clarify the effect of each land cover type conversion on et this study first compared the corresponding multi year average et values for each land cover type with the order of decreasing et water consumption being wetland forestland cropland grassland shrubland bareland fig 11 shows the change in et caused by each land cover type conversion from 2005 to 2020 similar to the order of decrease in et water consumption corresponding to each land cover type et decreased when converting from forestlands and wetlands to other land cover types indicating that the value of et was higher in forestlands and wetlands than in other land cover types notably the conversion of forestlands to other land cover types resulted in a greater magnitude of et change than the conversion of other land cover types to forestlands for example et decreased by 21 7 mm yr 1 for conversion of forestlands to grasslands but only increased by 12 1 mm yr 1 for conversion of grasslands to forestlands which may be related to the difference in growth cycles between forestlands and other land cover types because the conversion area and et values of forestlands were relatively high during 2005 2020 table 3 the contribution of lucc from forestlands to et should be the largest among the land cover types furthermore the values of et change between grasslands croplands and forestlands showed that the effect of returning grasslands to forestlands on the change in et was greater than that of returning croplands to forestlands the et variation caused by conversion from other land cover types to barelands was higher than that caused by conversion from barelands to other land cover types in the period 2005 2020 which means that et loss due to vegetation degradation may not be compensated by vegetation restoration 5 discussion 5 1 spatiotemporal analysis of et variation the validation results with flux site based et and water balance based et indicated that et values calculated by the pt jpl model for china performed well figs 2 and 3 the et over china increased from northwest to southeast fig 4a with a multi year average et of 464 52 mm yr 1 for the period 2005 2020 given the considerable uncertainties we compared the results of previous studies cheng et al 2021a and cheng et al 2021b used the modis product and the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model to calculate the average et values over china for 2001 2018 as 359 61 mm yr 1 and 482 27 mm yr 1 and noted that the modis product underestimated the actual et in china su et al 2021 pooled six reanalysis et datasets and obtained average et values in china ranging from 409 to 679 mm yr 1 during 1980 2015 in addition the average values of et in china for the 1980 s 2010 s calculated by related scholars based on the remote sensing et model et products and et data from chinese flux sites were in the range of 350 700 mm yr 1 bai and liu 2018 ma et al 2019 sun et al 2017 chen et al 2014 simulated significantly higher et values 535 852 mm yr 1 for 1982 2009 in china based on eight et models and validated them by using measured data from china flux stations which found that r2 ranged from 0 5 to 0 8 this study was 0 6 0 9 the divergences between the results of the above studies may be related to the differences in the model structures and input datasets mueller et al 2013 zhou et al 2012 the average et value and simulation accuracy of pt jpl in this study were within the range of existing research results the average et variation trend in china from 2005 to 2020 was 0 46 mm yr 1 liu et al 2016 showed that the peak of et in china since 1980 occurred around 1997 after which it decreased given the inconsistent choice of data sources and starting ending years the et variation trend showed different numerical fluctuations existing studies calculated the et trend in china since 1997 based on different et estimation models or related products and found that the main range was between 2 19 and 2 95 mm yr 1 liu et al 2016 cheng et al 2021a yang et al 2021a specifically for each basin in china figs 4b and 5 the regions with increase in et were mainly concentrated in the yrb yerb and slrb mokhtar et al 2020 and shao et al 2019 also found an increasing trend of et in the middle and upper reaches of yrb and yerb slrb hrb hurb and yerb are mainly located in the northern part of china although the climate is dry and water resources are relatively scarce these basins also have high et values because of the developed irrigation agriculture cheng et al 2021a as a result of low precipitation and soil moisture limiting surface et nwb generally has lower et values among the nine basins swb which is mainly located in the tibetan plateau region has higher et values compared to nwb because of its low latitude and high precipitation the overall annual average et in swb showed a slight upward trend which might be caused by different et variation trends in the eastern and western parts of the basin han et al 2021 analyzed the et in the tibetan plateau region and reported the same variation pattern the three basins along the southeast coast of china yrb prb and seb showed higher et values owing to the abundance of water and radiation due to the differences in the size and topographic conditions of each basin et showed different trends in these three basins 5 2 effect of climate change on et variation compared with lucc climate change was the main cause of et change in china from 2005 to 2020 fig 6 the influence of five climatic factors rh rn ta pr and ws on et was quantitatively analyzed and it was found that rn and ta were the main influencing factors at the national level fig 9 the same phenomenon had also been observed in other regions of the world including north america africa and europe in recent years boé and terray 2008 gaertner et al 2019 hoffman et al 2011 among the five climatic factors affecting et change rn showed a significant decreasing trend in most regions of the country fig 7 and the decrease in rn is usually associated with an increase in cloudiness and aerosols in the atmosphere roderick et al 2009 comparing fig 4b 7b and 8b it can be seen that the regions with the decrease in et and rn had a similar spatial distribution especially in the nwb prb the middle and lower reaches of yrb in china rh pr and ta played major contributions to et increase in yrb yerb and slrb fig 8 ta showed an increasing trend in most regions of the country and had an important positive effect on et change but comparing the average contribution values of each climatic factor to et in china fig 9 it can be seen that the decrease in et caused by rn was greater than the increase in et caused by ta this gives the phenomenon of increasing in ta and decreasing in et which explains the evaporation paradox to some extent roderick and farquhar 2002 fig 9 shows that the average contribution of rn or ta to et was mostly uniformly negative or positive in nine basins while the positive and negative contributions of rh and pr were relatively dispersed in different basins thus even though the relative contributions of rh and pr to et change were not significant at the national level the relative contributions of these two factors were obviously improved in each basin specifically in addition ponce campos et al 2013 showed that et behaved most sensitive to moisture factors in arid regions by comparing the relative contribution of each climatic factor in different basins it can be seen that pr and rh showed significantly higher contributions to et change in relatively dry basins while rn and ta show the opposite performance the contribution of each climatic factor to et variation showed spatial heterogeneity fig 8 shows that the regional distributions of positive and negative contributions of pr ws and ta were relatively scattered whereas the spatial distribution of rn and rh contributions were relatively uniform from eq 15 and eq 16 the spatial distribution of each climatic factor s contribution to et trend was mainly controlled by the regression coefficients and the trend of each factor therefore when a climatic factor showed general upward or downward trend in a region the spatial distribution of this factor s contribution to et was similar to the spatial distribution of the regression coefficients fig s1 e g ta pr ws on the contrary when the regression coefficients between the climatic factor and et showed general positive or negative correlation in a region the spatial distribution of the climatic factor s contribution to et was similar to the spatial distribution of the factor s variation trend e g rn rh moreover the five considered climatic factors are not completely independent of each other and their interactions may also play some roles in et variation she et al 2017 meanwhile surface topographic factors may also cause different regions to show different correlations between et and each climatic factor lian and zeng 2018 future studies should consider this issue to better determine the influence of each climatic factor on et 5 3 effect of lucc on et variation the chinese government has implemented several restoration strategies to prevent ecological degradation large scale lucc has occurred in china and caused ecohydrological problems such as reduced runoff and soil drought qiu et al 2011 our study determined the land transfer matrix for 2005 2020 based on modis reclassified land cover type data and specified the et change caused by each land cover type transfer table 3 the lucc over china has a positive contribution to et change from 2005 to 2020 the interconversion between forestland grassland and cropland in china was obvious in these 16 years and the areas of forestland shrubland and wetland increased while the areas of grassland and bareland decreased most of the land cover type conversions were concentrated in the east central basins of china such as slrb yerb yrb and prb fig 10a lan et al 2021 found a significant increase in lai in these basins relative to others and vegetation greening had an important influence on et change in this study we also found that the contribution of lucc to et was higher 30 in the slrb yerb yrb and prb compared to other basins which might be related to the greening of vegetation in these basins according to lan et al 2021 forestlands have a taller canopy structure larger leaf area and deeper root distribution indicating that afforestation and deforestation are the most influential lucc processes affecting et ye et al 2021 some researches have found that soil et increased during the conversion of forestlands to croplands but the overall mean et still showed a decreasing trend dias et al 2015 olchev et al 2008 in this study when we quantified the et change caused by the conversion process of each land cover type it was found that forestlands and wetlands caused a decrease in et during conversion to other land cover types fig 11 wetlands also tend to have stronger et than ordinary substrates owing to the large area of vegetation and high water content granata et al 2020 the change in et caused by the interconversion of wetlands and forestlands was positive but the magnitude of et change due to the conversion of forestlands to wetlands was higher than that caused by the conversion of wetlands to forestlands and this phenomenon also occurred in the conversion between grasslands and shrublands the conversion between barelands and other land cover types revealed that vegetation degradation had a greater impact on et than vegetation restoration considering that lucc has local effects on the water cycle although the effect of climate change was excluded in this study the same land cover type in different regions might have diverse et characteristics due to differences in vegetation growth cycle and cover wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b in addition the availability of water resources in a region has a greater impact on et variation for each land cover type zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2018 accordingly the implementation of vegetation restoration projects for arid water scarce regions should effectively reduce the planting of high et vegetation types plant species that absorb large amounts of water should be regularly reduced in regions with high vegetation density and extensive greening the et water consumption sequence obtained in this study wetland forestland cropland grassland shrubland bareland is a good reference for future regional ecosystem planning 5 4 uncertainties and limitations the pt jpl model in this study was driven by modis and gldas data gldas used the bilinear interpolation method to achieve a resolution match with modis data although the model validation results performed well the use of remotely sensed data inevitably resulted in potential spatiotemporal inaccuracies and limited the results of the final correlation analysis in addition the et values simulated by the pt jpl model were lower in the relatively dry regions compared with the measured data considering the low vegetation cover and the large proportion of soil evaporation in these regions it was inferred that the lower simulated values than the measured values might be caused by the low calculation of the soil evaporation module in the model cui et al 2021 meanwhile the uncertainty of land classification and the spatially irregular distribution of the chinese flux station network may also affect the optimization and validation results of the pt jpl model zhang et al 2019b it should also be noted that there are limitations to separating the effects of lucc and climate change on et for example lucc inevitably affects or feeds back the surface energy distribution leading to the change in radiative fluxes lan et al 2021 climate change can also affect lucc by changing vegetation phenology patterns yang et al 2016 the different growth cycles of vegetation and the interaction between climatic factors may also play some roles in et variation the results of this research can provide a theoretical reference for assessing the separate effects of climate change and lucc on et and the feedback mechanism between lucc and climate change can be considered in the future to further deepen the study 6 conclusion based on the pt jpl model this study investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of et variation over china from 2005 to 2020 in contrast to the previous comprehensive evaluation of influencing factors we separated climate change and lucc by controlling the land cover type variables in the pt jpl model and evaluated their individual contribution to et the main conclusions are as follows 1 in this study the actual et in china from 2005 to 2020 was simulated by the pt jpl model tests including comparison with et from flux field observations under different land cover types and water balance based et in 15 small basins confirmed that the et values simulated by the pt jpl model were reliable over china 2 from 2005 to 2020 the average annual et in china was 464 52 mm yr 1 increasing at a slight rate of 0 46 mm yr 1 spatially et decreased gradually from the southeast coast to the northwest inland the significant increase in et was mainly concentrated in southern central and northeastern china 3 the contribution of climate change to et was more significant than lucc over china among the five climatic factors ta and pr displayed an increasing trend while rh rn and ws showed a decreasing trend in most regions of china from 2005 to 2020 rn and ta had a greater influence on et than rh pr and ws the moisture factors rh and pr had a dominant influence on et change in relatively dry basins while the thermal factors rn and ta and power factors ws were more prominent in basins with relatively sufficient moisture and higher elevation 4 during 2005 2020 the conversion of area between forestland cropland and grassland was the most significant this was manifested by the decrease in the area of grassland and the increase in the area of forestland and cropland in this process wetland and forestland corresponded to higher et values and the conversion to other land cover types would cause a decrease in et the order of decreasing evaporative water consumption for each land cover type in china from 2005 to 2020 was wetland forestland cropland grassland shrubland bareland although the effect of lucc on et was less significant than that of climate change it cannot be neglected in the analysis of factors influencing et due to the regional effect of lucc credit authorship contribution statement xiaoyang li methodology investigation software visualization writing original draft lei zou methodology

3096,the restoration and subsequent regeneration of sphagnum moss on harvested peatlands can result in poor hydrological connectivity between the regenerated sphagnum moss and the remnant cutover peat due to the formation of a capillary barrier that favours retention of water in the underlying cutover peat in a restored cutover peatland in québec canada this resulted in a lower soil water content of the regenerated sphagnum moss compared to a natural analogue which may limit carbon sequestration potential previous work has shown it may take 40 years for the regenerated moss layer to overcome this capillary barrier effect however mechanical compression may provide a novel restoration technique to weaken the capillary barrier in restored peatlands this study evaluated the effectiveness of field based mechanical compression to ameliorate the capillary barrier effect and increase the moisture content in a restored cutover peatland a section of restored bois des bel peatland was compressed using a john deere 6430 series tractor in january 2016 followed by hydrological monitoring may august the compressed site was compared to a nearby uncompressed site and a natural peatland 2 km away to determine relative success of mechanical compression the compression reduced moss height by 48 increasing bulk density by 37 and reducing the proportion of macropores by 15 throughout the moss layer consequently compression increased soil water retention and average soil moisture content at the compressed site was consistently higher throughout the moss profile than in the uncompressed site this increased the resilience of the moss to drying though the degree of increased resilience is unknown despite not having the same hydrophysical properties of the natural site the compressed site was wetter than the uncompressed site due to the lessening of the capillary barrier effect and moving the surface closer to the water table thus decreasing the water stress of the regenerated sphagnum carpet keywords peatland restoration capillary barrier sphagnum rubellum water retention unsaturated hydraulic conductivity compression 1 introduction harvested peatlands in canada are routinely restored with the goal of re establishing the self regulatory mechanisms that will lead back to a naturally functioning peat accumulating ecosystem quinty and rochefort 2003 in undisturbed peatlands a suite of ecohydrological feedbacks are critical to maintaining the self regulatory mechanisms that allow for peat accumulation waddington et al 2015 restoring the hydrological regime is the most important factor in meeting this goal chimner et al 2017 while the carbon accumulation properties of restored peatlands may resemble undisturbed peatlands within 14 years nugent et al 2018 restoring the hydrological regime may take longer mccarter and price 2013 2015 accelerating the return of hydrological functionality post restoration will enhance the sustainable management of peatland resources the peatlands chosen for harvesting are generally dominated by sphagnum mosses which are the species primarily responsible for carbon sequestration limpens et al 2008 and regulating the hydrological regime in these peatlands waddington et al 2015 these mosses are distinguished by a dense cluster of young branches forming the top few centimeters of the plant known as the capitulum plural capitula sunlight penetrates the moss surface between 1 and 2 cm depth and so photosynthesis is essentially limited to the capitulum clymo and hayward 1982 zona et al 2011 as sphagnum mosses grow the branches spread out as the stems elongate and overlap to form carpets like all mosses sphagnum are non vascular and so photosynthesis relies on capillary rise to replace water lost from the moss surface by evaporation mccarter and price 2014 volumetric moisture content is ultimately governed by the pore network of the moss created by the overlapping branches and leaves and subsequent decomposition processes mccarter et al 2020 subject to transient weather conditions in natural sphagnum dominated peatlands surficial mosses are relatively undecomposed and have a lower bulk density with a higher proportion of larger pores balliston and price 2020 carey et al 2007 hayward and clymo 1982 mccarter et al 2020 quinton et al 2008a rezanezhad et al 2010 weber et al 2017 than unrestored peatlands mccarter and price 2015 taylor price and strack 2016 as depth from surface increases the degree of decomposition increases which breaks down the peat structure increasing bulk density and the proportion of smaller pores balliston and price 2020 branham and strack 2014 carey et al 2007 hayward and clymo 1982 mccarter et al 2020 quinton et al 2008a rezanezhad et al 2010 weber et al 2017 these smaller pores have a higher soil water retention than larger pores at a given pressure head and so can maintain a higher water content and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at lower pressure heads at pressure heads above 100 cm the mosses can maintain adequate capillary rise to sustain photosynthesis chivers et al 2009 hayward and clymo 1982 schipperges and rydin 1998 strack et al 2009 and to meet evaporative demand mccarter and price 2014 at pressure heads between 100 cm and 600 cm hyaline cells within the moss leaves begin to drain causing the moss to desiccate hayward and clymo 1982 lewis 1988 these desiccated mosses cannot maintain photosynthesis and thus carbon sequestration potential is lowered peat harvesting removes the living and undecomposed mosses leaving more decomposed peat at the surface this peat has a higher bulk density and soil water retention capacity than the pre harvesting surficial layer price 1997 which creates inhospitable hydrological conditions for sphagnum reestablishment price and whitehead 2001 active restoration is necessary to return ecohydrological function to a near natural state poulin et al 2005 restoration over the last 25 years namely the moss layer transfer technique has been successful in returning representative sphagnum cover as well as many vascular species gonzález and rochefort 2014 karofeld et al 2016 purre et al 2021 carbon accumulation has also been re established 14 16 years post restoration nugent et al 2018 despite these successes the hydrological regime necessary to maintain moss productivity may not always be fully re established the newly regenerated moss in restored peatlands can grow loosely forming large pores directly above the dense cutover peat that do not have the strong interstitial pressures required to attract pore water causing a capillary barrier effect mccarter and price 2015 this capillary barrier decreases the ability of the new moss to draw water from the deeper peat lowering the overall moisture content throughout the moss layer in comparison to a natural peatland mccarter and price 2015 the new moss layer may become stressed quicker during dry periods as a result limiting carbon sequestration potential a chronosequence of moss regeneration suggested that it may take 40 years for restored peatlands to overcome the capillary barrier effect taylor and price 2015 and return ecohydrological function to a more natural state decreasing the proportion of macropores i e pores 75 µm diameter and creating a greater abundance of smaller pores through mechanical compression of sphagnum moss in a laboratory setting has been shown to effectively increase bulk density soil water retention thus unsaturated hydraulic conductivity while decreasing total porosity gauthier et al 2018 in the field setting peat compression along seismic lines resulted in a lasting significant increase in bulk density and volumetric moisture content davidson et al 2020 thus mechanical compression of the regenerated sphagnum moss may have the potential to accelerate the recovery of ecohydrological function in restored peatlands however understanding the practical applications requires in field testing as such the objectives of this study are 1 to ascertain the effectiveness of intentional in field mechanical compression to alter the hydrophysical properties of sphagnum moss and 2 to determine the degree to which the capillary barrier effect can be diminished by this process 2 methods 2 1 study site the bois des bel peatland bdb is a restored bog located approximately 10 km west of rivière du loup quebec on the unceded traditional territory of the wəlastəkwiyik maliseet peoples this territory is covered by the treaties of peace and friendship which wəlastəkwiyik maliseet mi kmaq and passamaquoddy peoples first signed with the british crown in 1726 the canadian encyclopedia 2021 restoration of eight peat fields occurred in fall 1999 where this study took place and spring 2000 19 years after active peat harvesting ceased 1980 bdb was one of the first large scale bog restoration efforts using the moss layer transfer technique outlined by rochefort et al 2003 ten years after restoration 2010 sphagnum rubellum wilson was the dominant species forming a 15 20 cm layer poulin et al 2013 above 1 8 m of remnant cutover peat lavoie et al 2001 despite having representative species composition a capillary barrier limited water availability at the surface of the moss mccarter and price 2013 suggesting its vulnerability to desiccation for the purposes of this study the restored bdb peatland 47 58 02 4 n 69 25 44 3 w was separated into two distinct areas the compressed site fields 1 2 and the uncompressed site field 3 fig 1 field 3 was chosen as a restored uncompressed analogue because it had similar moss species and moss height in 2015 to fields 1 2 prior to compression mean moss height one standard deviation in fields 1 2 was 24 8

compressed by the weight of a john deere 6430 premium tractor with dual front and back tires fig 1 compression occurred in january 2016 when the moss layer was unsaturated and frozen with the intent of causing the sphagnum fibers to break instead of temporarily deforming gauthier et al 2018 compression was also completed while there was approximately one meter of snow covering the peatland to protect the moss surface from further damage e g rutting from the tractor due to uncertainty 5 cm with the moss height method outlined by poulin et al 2013 a systematic destructive sampling was completed in october 2016 to determine moss height in fields 1 3 similar to poulin et al 2013 transects were laid out in the center of each field with perpendicular transects at every ten meters samples 10 cm 5 cm surface to 3 cm below cutover peat were taken at every five metres along the perpendicular transects starting from the centre samples were gently removed and placed vertically on a flat surface to limit disturbance moss height was then measured from the surface of the sample to the cutover peat on each side n 4 per sample the mean of the four measured values was used for each sample a total of 126 samples were taken in the compressed site and 72 in the uncompressed site in 2019 moss height was remeasured using the same method to determine if the compressed mosses rebounded over a longer time frame 2 3 in field hydrological monitoring hydrological monitoring of the compressed and uncompressed sites was conducted between day of year doy 145 may 24 2016 and doy 235 august 21 2016 precipitation was logged at 30 minute intervals using a campbell scientific te525 m tipping bucket rain gauge 0 1 mm tip installed in field 2 at bdb total precipitation was determined for each day by summing the 30 minute data volumetric moisture content θ was logged at 30 minute intervals using campbell scientific cs650 time domain reflectometer probes tdrs tdr probes were installed horizontally at 2 5 cm below the moss surface 2 5 cm above the cutover peat and 2 5 cm below the cutover peat in three pits at the compressed site field 2 only n 1 3 3 respectively and two pits in the uncompressed site n 2 depth it should be noted that θ in the uncompressed site was not continuously measured until doy 194 prior to doy 194 instantaneous θ was compared between sites the gaps in logged data for the uncompressed site from doy 196 200 and doy 224 232 were due to equipment malfunction the θ in the natural site was measured using a handheld wet sensortm delta t devices cambridge uk the tdrs and wet sensortm were calibrated following the methods outlined by kellner and lundin 2001 for each site and depth figure si1 r 2 0 99 for all regressions wells 100 cm slotted intake 2 5 cm radius pvc pipe were installed within one meter of each of the tdr locations to measure the water table depth water table depth was logged at 30 minute intervals using solinst gold leveloggers accuracy is 0 3 cm at one tdr pit from each of the compressed and uncompressed site the raw levelogger values were barometrically corrected using a solinst barologger gold accuracy is 0 1 cm manual well measurements accuracy is 1 cm using a blowstick were used to verify the logged water table data water table depth was measured manually in wells without a logger at least once a week linear regressions between logged and unlogged well measurements were used to estimate the gaps between the manual measurements of the unlogged wells figure si2 r 2 0 95 for the compressed site regression and r 2 0 87 for the uncompressed site regression these estimates along with the logged data were averaged for each site to determine the mean water table depth at the tdr pits over time 2 4 moss hydrophysical properties hydrophysical properties of the moss were determined using 10 cm diameter cores taken from the compressed n 10 uncompressed n 6 and natural n 6 sites in august 2016 the moss surface was dominated by s rubellum 95 cover with 5 individuals of s fuscum schimper h klinggräff or individuals from the s magellanicum complex present the cores were taken using 10 cm diameter pvc pipe as a guide and cut using a serrated knife to at least 5 cm below the cutover peat in the compressed and uncompressed sites and to 30 cm at the natural site cores were stored in 10 cm diameter pvc pipe then transported back to the wetlands hydrology lab at the university of waterloo where they were frozen until processed first the moss cores were gently removed from the pvc pipe while frozen moss height above cutover peat was measured for the cores taken from the compressed and uncompressed sites to verify against field measured moss height next all cores were sub sectioned into 5 cm thick samples while frozen to represent 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 25 cm below ground surface samples were set into pvc pipe of equivalent size to thaw once thawed samples were wetted for a minimum of 24 hr to ensure complete saturation unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k unsat was then measured for each sample using the method outlined by mccarter et al 2017 using pressure heads ψ of 5 10 15 and 25 cm samples were weighed following each pressure step to gravimetrically determine θ after the 25 cm pressure step samples were frozen until they could be processed for soil water retention samples were first thawed then weighed to determine the moisture content difference due to freezing 0 03 the samples were then placed in a 5 bar pressure plate extractor soil moisture equipment corp model 1600 to characterize the soil water retention curves using pressure heads of 40 60 80 100 160 300 and 700 cm once the mass was stabilized for each sample at a given pressure head 1 g lost over 24 hr the final sample mass was recorded the sample volume was measured before 5 cm after 100 cm and after drying a second order polynomial was used to describe the relationship between sample volume and pressure r 2 1 0 for all this relationship was then used to calculate θ for each pressure head the young laplace equation bear 1972 was used to determine the pressure head for which macropores completely drained 1 r 2 γ cos β ρ g ψ where r is the theoretical pore opening radius m γ is the surface tension of water 72 75 10 3n m 1 β is the contact angle 51 for surficial peat gharedaghloo and price 2019 ρ is the density of water 1 000 kg m 3 g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 8 m s 2 and ψ is pressure head m the theoretical pore opening radius was set to 37 5 µm as it is the minimum macropore radius defined by the soil science society of america 2008 2008 for mineral soils and used by gauthier et al 2018 at the same site there is a large range in theoretical pore opening radius values used to define macropores in organic soils ranging from 150 µm to 37 5 µm equivalent to 6 9 and 24 7 cm of pressure respectively holden 2009 holden and burt 2003 holden et al 2001 weber et al 2017 while a review by mccarter et al 2020 found that a pore opening radius of 125 µm was commonly used we used 37 5 µm to be consistent with earlier work done at bois des bel i e gauthier et al 2018 using this smaller pore opening radius may over estimate the proportion of macropores but is a common point of comparison between sites and studies the proportion of macropores was then calculated using the fraction of water filled pores equation 2 ϕ vw θ ψ ϕ where ϕvw is the fraction of water filled pores ϕ is the porosity and θψ is the volumetric moisture content at a given pressure head using the pressure head at which macropores drain as calculated above 25 cm 1 ϕvw gives the proportion of macropores expressed as in a sample vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat was determined after soil water retention using a darcy permeameter under steady state flow conditions samples were saturated then were wrapped in plaster of paris and sealed with paraffin wax around the sides to prevent preferential flow leaving the top and bottom as open flow faces water was added to the top of the sample to maintain a constant head after allowing discharge to equilibrate 20 min discharge was measured at equal intervals to determine a mean rate across the measured hydraulic gradient darcy s law was used to calculate k sat for each sample following k sat measurements the plaster and wax were removed and samples were dried at 80 c for 48 h then weighed to calculate bulk density and total porosity porosity was calculated using a particle density determined for bdb 1 0 g cm 3 by mccarter and price 2015 porosity was also used as the saturated water content assuming all pore spaces are filled 2 5 statistical analyses moss height in the compressed and uncompressed sites in both years was determined to be normally distributed shapiro wilk p 0 05 a one way anova followed by a tukey honest significance difference post hoc test p 0 05 indicated a significant difference was used to determine if moss height was significantly different after compression and after 3 years the hydrophysical properties of the moss were compared using absolute depths below surface and are denoted by their central point throughout the text e g 0 to 5 2 5 5 to 10 7 5 and so on the 5 cm layer directly above the cutover peat was also compared for each site base the 17 5 cm and 22 5 cm depths for the natural site were combined to represent the profile base as these were the equivalent depths for the profile base in the uncompressed site to characterize the hydrophysical properties of moss from each site samples that were broken and or contained cutover peat were removed from the analyses the final number of samples for each site and depth are in table 1 the differences between the hydrophysical properties of moss between each site were assessed using the mean 95 confidence interval at each depth normality for each property was tested at each depth by site using the shapiro wilk test where α 0 05 if all data within each depth by site were normally distributed significant difference was tested using a one way anova followed by a tukey honest significance difference post hoc test where p 0 05 indicated a significant difference if any single depth from any site was not normally distributed significant difference for that property was tested using a kruskal wallis test followed by a dunn s test a p value 0 05 indicated significant difference all statistical tests were performed using r version 4 1 0 3 results 3 1 moss height in 2016 based on destructive field sampling mean moss height at the compressed site was 13 5 0 6 cm n 126 which was significantly lower tukey test p 0 001 than at the uncompressed where the mean was 22 0 1 2 cm n 72 fig 2 the mean difference was 8 5 cm which equated to a 48 difference in moss height between the compressed and uncompressed sites cores taken used to characterize hydrophysical properties at the compressed site had a mean height of 16 9 1 9 cm n 10 which was higher than the upper limit of the 95 confidence interval of the mean moss height for that site moss height survey mean moss height of the cores from the uncompressed site n 6 was 23 0 2 6 cm which was within the 95 confidence interval of values from the field survey in 2019 field mean moss height was similar to 2016 values and remained significantly different between the compressed and uncompressed sites tukey test p 0 001 3 2 in field hydrological monitoring the total precipitation for may august 2016 in rivière du loup quebec 20 km south of bdb was 328 9 mm this was within a standard deviation of the 20 year average 1996 2016 for the area 355 2 69 6 mm environment canada 2018 during the measurement period doy 145 doy 235 the total precipitation measured at bdb was 245 mm approximately 47 115 mm of rain fell between doy 145 and doy 165 whereas only 12 29 8 mm fell between doy 210 and doy 235 the mean water table depth below surface sd at the natural site was 23 7 5 0 cm with a maximum water table depth of 9 9 cm and a minimum of 34 8 cm whereas the compressed site had a mean water table depth of 28 6 11 3 cm with a minimum and maximum depth of 11 0 to 56 3 cm respectively fig 3 the water table depth at the compressed site closely mirrored the natural site from doy 145 210 but decreased at a greater rate during a drier period by the end of the measurement period the water table depth at the compressed site was 20 cm below that at the natural site the water table depth at the uncompressed site was lower than that at both the natural and compressed sites with an average of 36 8 11 2 cm and a range of 18 4 to 61 1 cm for the entire measurement period the water table remained below the cutover peat in the compressed and uncompressed sites except for two days near the beginning doy 161 doy 164 the mean volumetric moisture content θ 2 5 cm below the cutover peat was consistently higher in the compressed site than in the uncompressed site fig 3 by the end of the measurement period doy 235 when the peatland was at its driest the mean θ at the compressed site was 34 higher than at the uncompressed site at 2 5 cm above the cutover peat the mean θ of the uncompressed site was similar to the compressed site until doy 175 after which the mean θ of the compressed site was consistently higher at 2 5 cm below the moss surface the mean θ of the compressed site was between 0 20 and 0 27 which was 10 higher than at the uncompressed site the mean θ 2 5 cm below surface at the compressed site remained lower than at the natural site for the entire measurement period 3 3 moss hydrophysical properties the bulk density of the top 5 cm of moss from all sites was similar although the compressed site moss had significantly lower bulk density than the natural site moss one way anova with a tukey hsd post hoc test p 0 05 fig 4 from 7 5 cm to 12 5 cm bulk density of the moss from the compressed and natural sites increased and was not significantly different between sites while bulk density of the uncompressed moss was significantly lower than at the compressed and natural sites p 0 05 fig 4 when comparing the bulk density of the compressed and uncompressed samples regardless of depth the bulk density of the compressed samples was 15 higher the mean proportion of macropores in the moss from the uncompressed site ranged from 70 to 78 whereas the mean proportion of macropores in the moss from the compressed and natural sites ranged from 53 to 71 and 20 55 respectively table 2 the proportion of macropores decreased with increasing depth in the mosses from both the compressed and the natural sites whereas the proportion of macropores increased from the surface to 12 5 cm in the moss from the uncompressed site as such the uncompressed site had a significantly higher proportion of macropores below 2 5 cm than the natural site dunn s test p 0 05 although the proportion of macropores in the compressed site was 10 the compressed site was not significantly different than the uncompressed site dunn s test p 0 05 at any depth when comparing the proportion of macropores of the compressed and uncompressed samples regardless of depth the compressed site was 15 lower soil water retention of the near surface samples 2 5 cm was similar between all sites fig 5 below this depth the natural site had higher retention than the other sites compression increased water retention throughout the profile especially at the base of the profile despite the increase in water content unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was not significantly different in the compressed mosses compared to the uncompressed mosses as indicated by overlapping 95 confidence intervals fig 6 while the natural mosses had a higher unsaturated hydraulic conductivity below 2 5 cm the 95 confidence interval overlapped with those of the compressed and uncompressed mosses at all depths the natural mosses had a significantly lower mean k sat than both the compressed and uncompressed mosses dunn s test p 0 05 however in all cases the mean k sat was within an order of magnitude fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 changes in hydrophysical properties compression of the unsaturated mosses was undertaken while frozen to increase the likelihood of breaking the moss structure and causing longer lasting compression the approach used frozen and covered in snow achieved compression while causing minimal rutting or tearing of the moss attempting to compress unfrozen or snow free peatlands may cause considerable damage in field compression using a tractor effectively modified the hydrophysical properties of regenerated sphagnum moss the mean moss height was reduced by 48 fig 2 which was 21 more than the compression manifest in a laboratory study 27 using a hydraulic press to compress restored site mosses gauthier et al 2018 re measuring the moss height in 2019 showed that there was no significant rebound after compression over the following three years the lack of rebound is consistent with measurements from seismic lines where heavy machinery compressed the peat during the winter for oil and gas exploration that had a higher bulk density than adjacent undisturbed peat after 11 20 years davidson et al 2020 this suggests that compression when sphagnum peat is frozen causes long lasting changes to hydrophysical properties and can induce long lasting changes to the regenerated sphagnum mosses the in field compression increased bulk density of the mosses to values comparable to those at the natural site p 0 05 unlike in the laboratory study gauthier et al 2018 the largest difference in bulk density between the compressed site and the uncompressed site was at 12 5 cm fig 4 indicating that compression was more effective at depth similar to the lab results of gauthier et al 2018 waddington et al 2010 also found that peat compressibility increased with depth up to 50 cm below ground surface which was correlated to degree of decomposition microform type peat strength and distance to hollows it could be that the partly decomposed fibers lower in the moss profile were unable to absorb the mechanical pressure without deforming resulting in a higher compression and higher bulk density it should be noted that the cores taken from the uncompressed site accurately represented the mean field moss height whereas the mean height of the cores taken from the compressed site was 3 4 cm higher than its respective mean field moss height as such the compressed moss cores represent a conservative estimate of the effect of in field compression on moss hydrophysical properties in peat macropore density has been shown to be an important control on a variety ecohydrological processes holden 2009 holden et al 2001 liu and lennartz 2019 liu et al 2020 mccarter et al 2020 rezanezhad et al 2016 in contrast to previously reported values table 2 the proportion of macropores in the uncompressed mosses was slightly lower than those taken in 2010 mccarter and price 2014 and 2011 gauthier et al 2018 possibly due to variability in moss hydrophysical properties across the site or to naturally occurring decomposition and compression between 2011 and 2016 field compression of the surface layer 2 5 cm resulted in the same proportion of macropores as laboratory compression 71 as depth in the moss profile increased the proportion of macropores decreased with field compression in the laboratory compression the proportion of macropores did not decrease with depth table 2 despite compression causing bulk density to increase to similar values as in the natural site fig 2 it did not similarly reduce the proportion of macropores table 2 while similar bulk densities may have been achieved the compressed mosses were still very fibric von post h1 h2 with distinguishable stems down to the base of the moss profile in contrast at the natural site at depths 1 cm mosses were more decomposed von post h2 h4 and stems were indistinguishable mechanical compression did not create the same proportion of macropores as naturally occurring compression and decomposition consequently soil water retention of the compressed mosses was significantly lower than that of the natural mosses at ψ 100 cm p 0 05 at all depths except the surface fig 5 the movement of water within the sphagnum moss profile is dependent on the distribution of hydraulically connected pores mccarter et al 2020 the lack of large differences in ksat at the compressed site relative to both the uncompressed and natural sites suggest that the distribution and connectivity of the macropores is sufficient regardless of compression to efficiently move water through the saturated moss additionally k unsat was not overly different between sites fig 6 yet due to the reliance of kunsat on the soil water retention of the moss matrix the effective hydraulic conductivity for a given pressure head would be higher with higher soil water retention mccarter et al 2017 mualem 1976 this is similar to the findings of mccarter and price 2014 goetz and price 2015 taylor and price 2015 and golubev and whittington 2018 who showed a large variability in soil water retention and relatively low variability in k unsat thus the observed increase in the proportion of small and inactive pores would change the k θ relationship for a given θ in this study the mosses from the natural site had lower k at any given θ than the mosses from the compressed and uncompressed sites fig 7 which could be due to the higher proportion of small pores table 2 and possibly a higher proportion of inactive pores mccarter et al 2020 at 2 5 cm there was little change due to compression so the mosses from the compressed and uncompressed sites had essentially the same proportion of macropores table 2 and the same k θ relationship fig 7 at the 7 5 and 12 5 cm depths where compression was more effective the proportion of macropores was lower in the compressed site table 2 and the k θ relationship shifted towards that of the natural site mosses fig 7 while the uncompressed mosses have the same k at a lower θ as the compressed and natural mosses fig 7 these lower θ values are experienced at higher pressure heads fig 5 similar to 10 years post restoration mccarter and price 2013 the water table remained below the cutover peat for most of the study period at both the compressed and uncompressed sites fig 3 during wetter periods the water table at the compressed site closely matched that at the natural site however during the drier end of the measurement period it was closer to the uncompressed site during this dry period the water table at the compressed and uncompressed sites continued to have a more pronounced response to precipitation and evaporation as a result of the smaller proportion of active porosity in the underlying cutover peat mccarter and price 2013 the compressed site had a 9 5 cm higher mean water table depth in comparison to the uncompressed site as a consequence of using the surface as the 0 0 cm datum compression brought the surface 8 5 cm closer to the water table which accounts for all but 0 5 cm of the difference in mean water table depth between the sites variability in moss height the slight water table gradient at the site and measurement error could account for the remaining 1 0 cm difference when using the cutover peat as the 0 0 cm datum the water table depth between the compressed and uncompressed sites was nearly identical average difference between sites sd 0 5 1 5 cm it is not surprising that there was no measurable response of the absolute water table elevation to compression as the site water table is controlled by the lateral drainage ditches and not the hydraulic properties of the sphagnum moss mccarter and price 2013 while compression did not affect the absolute water table elevation the reduction in relative water table depth from surface would increase pressure and thus increase water content at the surface lindholm and markkula 1984 4 2 success of compression as a novel restoration technique in restored peatlands a key metric for the success of compression as a novel restoration technique in restored peatlands is the reduction or removal of the capillary barrier identified by mccarter and price 2015 compression decreased the capillary barrier effect at bdb as indicated by a higher soil water retention and higher θ throughout the measurement period the uncompressed site had the lowest soil water retention throughout the moss profile fig 5 and the water table below surface was lower fig 3 and consequently had a lower θ throughout the measurement period than the compressed site fig 3 the θ at 2 5 cm above the cutover peat in the uncompressed site was essentially the same as θ at the surface fig 3 which is an indication that the uncompressed mosses have undergone little structural change and continue to be affected by the capillary barrier that was identified in 2010 mccarter and price 2015 the mosses from the compressed site had higher soil water retention than the mosses from the uncompressed site fig 5 and water table was closer to the surface fig 3 and so maintained a higher θ throughout the measurement period fig 3 increasing their effective hydraulic conductivity the increase in soil water retention in the compressed site improve the conditions that facilitate net carbon sequestration the measurement period fell within a typical summer for the area when the precipitation total was within one standard deviation of the 20 year mean environment canada 2018 although evaporation was not measured the compressed mosses may be better able to maintain pressure heads above ψ 100 cm and better meet evaporative demand than the uncompressed mosses gauthier et al 2018 especially in drier years at pressure heads beyond ψ 100 cm hyaline cells begin to drain causing the moss to desiccate hayward and clymo 1982 lewis 1988 during the measurement period patches of moss in the compressed and uncompressed site desiccated whereas no desiccation was observed in the natural site it may be that the natural site was able to maintain pressure heads above 100 cm whereas the other two sites did not no noticeable differences in the proportion of desiccated mosses were observed between the compressed and uncompressed sites a one dimensional model of variably saturated flow may be useful to quantify the degree to which the altered hydrophysical properties increased the resilience of the moss to evaporative stress and drying compression improved the hydrological condition that has the potential to support a healthier and more resilient moss community by increasing bulk density and by altering the k θ relationship however it is difficult to determine how long these changes would have taken without compression due to intra species variability in growth the bulk density of the mosses from the compressed site were similar to 40 year old regenerated s rubellum in shippagan new brunswick taylor and price 2015 which suggests compression may have accelerated the restoration timeline by 24 years though soil water retention and kunsat of the mosses from all sites in this study were below those of the 40 year old regenerated moss taylor and price 2015 this suggests that the s rubellum growing in bdb quebec and shippagan new brunswick may have different growth patterns possibly in response to differing climatic regimes further there is large variability in the published values for soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity of s rubellum including between samples taken from bdb gauthier et al 2018 mccarter and price 2014 2015 price and whittington 2010 price and whittington et al 2008 taylor and price 2015 waddington et al 2011 while it is widely understood that peatlands are heterogeneous sample size for s rubellum hydrological studies range from 1 to 14 gauthier et al 2018 mccarter and price 2014 2015 price and whittington 2010 price and whittington et al 2008 taylor and price 2015 waddington et al 2011 a more thorough understanding of the drivers of heterogeneity in sphagnum moss hydrophysical properties will enhance our ability to estimate the change in peatland trajectory due to compression turetsky et al 2008 identified a trade off between resource allocation for vertical growth loose and structural growth dense between sphagnum species waddington et al 2011 theorize that the restored mosses at bdb allocated more resources to vertical growth as a response to dry conditions however kettridge et al 2016 argue that sphagnum mosses grow to optimize the balance between water storage and carbon accumulation in drier conditions sphagnum mosses grow more densely to maximize soil water retention and reduce surface roughness hayward and clymo 1983 fenton et al 2011 also proposed that sphagnum colonies establishing in more optimal conditions grow looser as it increases radiation exposure which would increase photosynthetic activity in comparison to densely growing colonies given that the restored mosses at bdb had a relatively low bulk density and were growing loosely fig 4 mccarter and price 2015 it would suggest that once established the restored mosses were not water limited during their initial regeneration as the ditch blocking sufficiently raised the water table to limit soil water pressures 100 cm shantz and price 2006 this is contrary to the theory posed by waddington et al 2011 sphagnum growing in a high resource environment can also have sustained vertical growth turetsky et al 2008 an alternative theory may be that the regenerated s rubellum at bdb allocated more resources to sustained vertical growth as a result of high nutrient availability especially in the earlier years post restoration when the phosphorus fertilizer was applied and still available to the regenerated mosses andersen et al 2010 while this may be the case the analysis done by turetsky et al 2008 is an interspecific comparison of carbohydrate allocation little is known about the intraspecific relationships between key moss traits and environmental parameters turetsky et al 2008 and whether the same species of moss can alter its retention properties or if it will be outcompeted by a species better suited for its environment future studies should investigate the intraspecific variability in growth rate carbohydrate allocation and morphology as it applies to hydrological function to better manage restored cutover peatlands understanding and managing these functions could prevent the formation of a capillary barrier and reduce the need for active management like mechanical compression 5 conclusions mechanical compression reduced moss height by 48 which effectively increased bulk density to be similar to naturally occurring s rubellum compression resulted in a lower proportion of macropores and increased soil water retention which reduced the capillary barrier effect and increased moisture content throughout the moss profile the increase in soil water retention improved connectivity to deeper water stores thus decreasing the probability of desiccation of the capitula in drier periods but potentially increasing the overall system water loss by evaporation the magnitude and consequence of managing the hydraulic performance of a regenerating moss layer needs to be systematically evaluated which could be approached with a numeric model for a range of moss layer thicknesses and weather scenarios while compression may improve the hydrological conditions that support more resilient mosses it is necessary to confirm the impact on short and long term carbon sequestration compression may be an effective option for restored sites that experience frequent and or prolonged desiccation events which clearly lower carbon sequestration and may become more prevalent in a warming climate despite the apparent success of this novel restoration technique compression did not produce the same pore network in a restored peatland as naturally occurring compression and decomposition resulting in lower soil water retention throughout the moss profile in comparison to the natural site further decomposition over time is needed to decrease the proportion of macropores to be similar to that of the natural site furthermore it is difficult to assess how long changes in the hydrophysical properties would have taken to manifest without compression revisiting the compressed and uncompressed sites 10 years post compression will give insight into the progression of moss hydrophysical properties over time and the long term success of compression as a restoration technique uncertainties in intra and interspecific variability in the relationship between key moss traits and environmental parameters should also be characterized to better understand the impact of compression on the restoration timeline and to potentially promote growth patterns similar to the natural site credit authorship contribution statement

3096,the restoration and subsequent regeneration of sphagnum moss on harvested peatlands can result in poor hydrological connectivity between the regenerated sphagnum moss and the remnant cutover peat due to the formation of a capillary barrier that favours retention of water in the underlying cutover peat in a restored cutover peatland in québec canada this resulted in a lower soil water content of the regenerated sphagnum moss compared to a natural analogue which may limit carbon sequestration potential previous work has shown it may take 40 years for the regenerated moss layer to overcome this capillary barrier effect however mechanical compression may provide a novel restoration technique to weaken the capillary barrier in restored peatlands this study evaluated the effectiveness of field based mechanical compression to ameliorate the capillary barrier effect and increase the moisture content in a restored cutover peatland a section of restored bois des bel peatland was compressed using a john deere 6430 series tractor in january 2016 followed by hydrological monitoring may august the compressed site was compared to a nearby uncompressed site and a natural peatland 2 km away to determine relative success of mechanical compression the compression reduced moss height by 48 increasing bulk density by 37 and reducing the proportion of macropores by 15 throughout the moss layer consequently compression increased soil water retention and average soil moisture content at the compressed site was consistently higher throughout the moss profile than in the uncompressed site this increased the resilience of the moss to drying though the degree of increased resilience is unknown despite not having the same hydrophysical properties of the natural site the compressed site was wetter than the uncompressed site due to the lessening of the capillary barrier effect and moving the surface closer to the water table thus decreasing the water stress of the regenerated sphagnum carpet keywords peatland restoration capillary barrier sphagnum rubellum water retention unsaturated hydraulic conductivity compression 1 introduction harvested peatlands in canada are routinely restored with the goal of re establishing the self regulatory mechanisms that will lead back to a naturally functioning peat accumulating ecosystem quinty and rochefort 2003 in undisturbed peatlands a suite of ecohydrological feedbacks are critical to maintaining the self regulatory mechanisms that allow for peat accumulation waddington et al 2015 restoring the hydrological regime is the most important factor in meeting this goal chimner et al 2017 while the carbon accumulation properties of restored peatlands may resemble undisturbed peatlands within 14 years nugent et al 2018 restoring the hydrological regime may take longer mccarter and price 2013 2015 accelerating the return of hydrological functionality post restoration will enhance the sustainable management of peatland resources the peatlands chosen for harvesting are generally dominated by sphagnum mosses which are the species primarily responsible for carbon sequestration limpens et al 2008 and regulating the hydrological regime in these peatlands waddington et al 2015 these mosses are distinguished by a dense cluster of young branches forming the top few centimeters of the plant known as the capitulum plural capitula sunlight penetrates the moss surface between 1 and 2 cm depth and so photosynthesis is essentially limited to the capitulum clymo and hayward 1982 zona et al 2011 as sphagnum mosses grow the branches spread out as the stems elongate and overlap to form carpets like all mosses sphagnum are non vascular and so photosynthesis relies on capillary rise to replace water lost from the moss surface by evaporation mccarter and price 2014 volumetric moisture content is ultimately governed by the pore network of the moss created by the overlapping branches and leaves and subsequent decomposition processes mccarter et al 2020 subject to transient weather conditions in natural sphagnum dominated peatlands surficial mosses are relatively undecomposed and have a lower bulk density with a higher proportion of larger pores balliston and price 2020 carey et al 2007 hayward and clymo 1982 mccarter et al 2020 quinton et al 2008a rezanezhad et al 2010 weber et al 2017 than unrestored peatlands mccarter and price 2015 taylor price and strack 2016 as depth from surface increases the degree of decomposition increases which breaks down the peat structure increasing bulk density and the proportion of smaller pores balliston and price 2020 branham and strack 2014 carey et al 2007 hayward and clymo 1982 mccarter et al 2020 quinton et al 2008a rezanezhad et al 2010 weber et al 2017 these smaller pores have a higher soil water retention than larger pores at a given pressure head and so can maintain a higher water content and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at lower pressure heads at pressure heads above 100 cm the mosses can maintain adequate capillary rise to sustain photosynthesis chivers et al 2009 hayward and clymo 1982 schipperges and rydin 1998 strack et al 2009 and to meet evaporative demand mccarter and price 2014 at pressure heads between 100 cm and 600 cm hyaline cells within the moss leaves begin to drain causing the moss to desiccate hayward and clymo 1982 lewis 1988 these desiccated mosses cannot maintain photosynthesis and thus carbon sequestration potential is lowered peat harvesting removes the living and undecomposed mosses leaving more decomposed peat at the surface this peat has a higher bulk density and soil water retention capacity than the pre harvesting surficial layer price 1997 which creates inhospitable hydrological conditions for sphagnum reestablishment price and whitehead 2001 active restoration is necessary to return ecohydrological function to a near natural state poulin et al 2005 restoration over the last 25 years namely the moss layer transfer technique has been successful in returning representative sphagnum cover as well as many vascular species gonzález and rochefort 2014 karofeld et al 2016 purre et al 2021 carbon accumulation has also been re established 14 16 years post restoration nugent et al 2018 despite these successes the hydrological regime necessary to maintain moss productivity may not always be fully re established the newly regenerated moss in restored peatlands can grow loosely forming large pores directly above the dense cutover peat that do not have the strong interstitial pressures required to attract pore water causing a capillary barrier effect mccarter and price 2015 this capillary barrier decreases the ability of the new moss to draw water from the deeper peat lowering the overall moisture content throughout the moss layer in comparison to a natural peatland mccarter and price 2015 the new moss layer may become stressed quicker during dry periods as a result limiting carbon sequestration potential a chronosequence of moss regeneration suggested that it may take 40 years for restored peatlands to overcome the capillary barrier effect taylor and price 2015 and return ecohydrological function to a more natural state decreasing the proportion of macropores i e pores 75 µm diameter and creating a greater abundance of smaller pores through mechanical compression of sphagnum moss in a laboratory setting has been shown to effectively increase bulk density soil water retention thus unsaturated hydraulic conductivity while decreasing total porosity gauthier et al 2018 in the field setting peat compression along seismic lines resulted in a lasting significant increase in bulk density and volumetric moisture content davidson et al 2020 thus mechanical compression of the regenerated sphagnum moss may have the potential to accelerate the recovery of ecohydrological function in restored peatlands however understanding the practical applications requires in field testing as such the objectives of this study are 1 to ascertain the effectiveness of intentional in field mechanical compression to alter the hydrophysical properties of sphagnum moss and 2 to determine the degree to which the capillary barrier effect can be diminished by this process 2 methods 2 1 study site the bois des bel peatland bdb is a restored bog located approximately 10 km west of rivière du loup quebec on the unceded traditional territory of the wəlastəkwiyik maliseet peoples this territory is covered by the treaties of peace and friendship which wəlastəkwiyik maliseet mi kmaq and passamaquoddy peoples first signed with the british crown in 1726 the canadian encyclopedia 2021 restoration of eight peat fields occurred in fall 1999 where this study took place and spring 2000 19 years after active peat harvesting ceased 1980 bdb was one of the first large scale bog restoration efforts using the moss layer transfer technique outlined by rochefort et al 2003 ten years after restoration 2010 sphagnum rubellum wilson was the dominant species forming a 15 20 cm layer poulin et al 2013 above 1 8 m of remnant cutover peat lavoie et al 2001 despite having representative species composition a capillary barrier limited water availability at the surface of the moss mccarter and price 2013 suggesting its vulnerability to desiccation for the purposes of this study the restored bdb peatland 47 58 02 4 n 69 25 44 3 w was separated into two distinct areas the compressed site fields 1 2 and the uncompressed site field 3 fig 1 field 3 was chosen as a restored uncompressed analogue because it had similar moss species and moss height in 2015 to fields 1 2 prior to compression mean moss height one standard deviation in fields 1 2 was 24 8 cm prior to compression and was 28 6 cm in field 3 peatland ecology research group unpublished data the compressed and uncompressed sites were also compared to an undisturbed portion of bdb natural 47 57 35 6 n 69 26 57 9 w 2 km west the natural site had a similar vegetation composition to the compressed and uncompressed sites poulin et al 2013 but hydrologically was well connected to the water table below mccarter and price 2013 the natural site represents the goal for ecohydrological function post compression 2 2 compression moss height the compressed fields fields 1 2 at bdb were compressed by the weight of a john deere 6430 premium tractor with dual front and back tires fig 1 compression occurred in january 2016 when the moss layer was unsaturated and frozen with the intent of causing the sphagnum fibers to break instead of temporarily deforming gauthier et al 2018 compression was also completed while there was approximately one meter of snow covering the peatland to protect the moss surface from further damage e g rutting from the tractor due to uncertainty 5 cm with the moss height method outlined by poulin et al 2013 a systematic destructive sampling was completed in october 2016 to determine moss height in fields 1 3 similar to poulin et al 2013 transects were laid out in the center of each field with perpendicular transects at every ten meters samples 10 cm 5 cm surface to 3 cm below cutover peat were taken at every five metres along the perpendicular transects starting from the centre samples were gently removed and placed vertically on a flat surface to limit disturbance moss height was then measured from the surface of the sample to the cutover peat on each side n 4 per sample the mean of the four measured values was used for each sample a total of 126 samples were taken in the compressed site and 72 in the uncompressed site in 2019 moss height was remeasured using the same method to determine if the compressed mosses rebounded over a longer time frame 2 3 in field hydrological monitoring hydrological monitoring of the compressed and uncompressed sites was conducted between day of year doy 145 may 24 2016 and doy 235 august 21 2016 precipitation was logged at 30 minute intervals using a campbell scientific te525 m tipping bucket rain gauge 0 1 mm tip installed in field 2 at bdb total precipitation was determined for each day by summing the 30 minute data volumetric moisture content θ was logged at 30 minute intervals using campbell scientific cs650 time domain reflectometer probes tdrs tdr probes were installed horizontally at 2 5 cm below the moss surface 2 5 cm above the cutover peat and 2 5 cm below the cutover peat in three pits at the compressed site field 2 only n 1 3 3 respectively and two pits in the uncompressed site n 2 depth it should be noted that θ in the uncompressed site was not continuously measured until doy 194 prior to doy 194 instantaneous θ was compared between sites the gaps in logged data for the uncompressed site from doy 196 200 and doy 224 232 were due to equipment malfunction the θ in the natural site was measured using a handheld wet sensortm delta t devices cambridge uk the tdrs and wet sensortm were calibrated following the methods outlined by kellner and lundin 2001 for each site and depth figure si1 r 2 0 99 for all regressions wells 100 cm slotted intake 2 5 cm radius pvc pipe were installed within one meter of each of the tdr locations to measure the water table depth water table depth was logged at 30 minute intervals using solinst gold leveloggers accuracy is 0 3 cm at one tdr pit from each of the compressed and uncompressed site the raw levelogger values were barometrically corrected using a solinst barologger gold accuracy is 0 1 cm manual well measurements accuracy is 1 cm using a blowstick were used to verify the logged water table data water table depth was measured manually in wells without a logger at least once a week linear regressions between logged and unlogged well measurements were used to estimate the gaps between the manual measurements of the unlogged wells figure si2 r 2 0 95 for the compressed site regression and r 2 0 87 for the uncompressed site regression these estimates along with the logged data were averaged for each site to determine the mean water table depth at the tdr pits over time 2 4 moss hydrophysical properties hydrophysical properties of the moss were determined using 10 cm diameter cores taken from the compressed n 10 uncompressed n 6 and natural n 6 sites in august 2016 the moss surface was dominated by s rubellum 95 cover with 5 individuals of s fuscum schimper h klinggräff or individuals from the s magellanicum complex present the cores were taken using 10 cm diameter pvc pipe as a guide and cut using a serrated knife to at least 5 cm below the cutover peat in the compressed and uncompressed sites and to 30 cm at the natural site cores were stored in 10 cm diameter pvc pipe then transported back to the wetlands hydrology lab at the university of waterloo where they were frozen until processed first the moss cores were gently removed from the pvc pipe while frozen moss height above cutover peat was measured for the cores taken from the compressed and uncompressed sites to verify against field measured moss height next all cores were sub sectioned into 5 cm thick samples while frozen to represent 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 25 cm below ground surface samples were set into pvc pipe of equivalent size to thaw once thawed samples were wetted for a minimum of 24 hr to ensure complete saturation unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k unsat was then measured for each sample using the method outlined by mccarter et al 2017 using pressure heads ψ of 5 10 15 and 25 cm samples were weighed following each pressure step to gravimetrically determine θ after the 25 cm pressure step samples were frozen until they could be processed for soil water retention samples were first thawed then weighed to determine the moisture content difference due to freezing 0 03 the samples were then placed in a 5 bar pressure plate extractor soil moisture equipment corp model 1600 to characterize the soil water retention curves using pressure heads of 40 60 80 100 160 300 and 700 cm once the mass was stabilized for each sample at a given pressure head 1 g lost over 24 hr the final sample mass was recorded the sample volume was measured before 5 cm after 100 cm and after drying a second order polynomial was used to describe the relationship between sample volume and pressure r 2 1 0 for all this relationship was then used to calculate θ for each pressure head the young laplace equation bear 1972 was used to determine the pressure head for which macropores completely drained 1 r 2 γ cos β ρ g ψ where r is the theoretical pore opening radius m γ is the surface tension of water 72 75 10 3n m 1 β is the contact angle 51 for surficial peat gharedaghloo and price 2019 ρ is the density of water 1 000 kg m 3 g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 8 m s 2 and ψ is pressure head m the theoretical pore opening radius was set to 37 5 µm as it is the minimum macropore radius defined by the soil science society of america 2008 2008 for mineral soils and used by gauthier et al 2018 at the same site there is a large range in theoretical pore opening radius values used to define macropores in organic soils ranging from 150 µm to 37 5 µm equivalent to 6 9 and 24 7 cm of pressure respectively holden 2009 holden and burt 2003 holden et al 2001 weber et al 2017 while a review by mccarter et al 2020 found that a pore opening radius of 125 µm was commonly used we used 37 5 µm to be consistent with earlier work done at bois des bel i e gauthier et al 2018 using this smaller pore opening radius may over estimate the proportion of macropores but is a common point of comparison between sites and studies the proportion of macropores was then calculated using the fraction of water filled pores equation 2 ϕ vw θ ψ ϕ where ϕvw is the fraction of water filled pores ϕ is the porosity and θψ is the volumetric moisture content at a given pressure head using the pressure head at which macropores drain as calculated above 25 cm 1 ϕvw gives the proportion of macropores expressed as in a sample vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat was determined after soil water retention using a darcy permeameter under steady state flow conditions samples were saturated then were wrapped in plaster of paris and sealed with paraffin wax around the sides to prevent preferential flow leaving the top and bottom as open flow faces water was added to the top of the sample to maintain a constant head after allowing discharge to equilibrate 20 min discharge was measured at equal intervals to determine a mean rate across the measured hydraulic gradient darcy s law was used to calculate k sat for each sample following k sat measurements the plaster and wax were removed and samples were dried at 80 c for 48 h then weighed to calculate bulk density and total porosity porosity was calculated using a particle density determined for bdb 1 0 g cm 3 by mccarter and price 2015 porosity was also used as the saturated water content assuming all pore spaces are filled 2 5 statistical analyses moss height in the compressed and uncompressed sites in both years was determined to be normally distributed shapiro wilk p 0 05 a one way anova followed by a tukey honest significance difference post hoc test p 0 05 indicated a significant difference was used to determine if moss height was significantly different after compression and after 3 years the hydrophysical properties of the moss were compared using absolute depths below surface and are denoted by their central point throughout the text e g 0 to 5 2 5 5 to 10 7 5 and so on the 5 cm layer directly above the cutover peat was also compared for each site base the 17 5 cm and 22 5 cm depths for the natural site were combined to represent the profile base as these were the equivalent depths for the profile base in the uncompressed site to characterize the hydrophysical properties of moss from each site samples that were broken and or contained cutover peat were removed from the analyses the final number of samples for each site and depth are in table 1 the differences between the hydrophysical properties of moss between each site were assessed using the mean 95 confidence interval at each depth normality for each property was tested at each depth by site using the shapiro wilk test where α 0 05 if all data within each depth by site were normally distributed significant difference was tested using a one way anova followed by a tukey honest significance difference post hoc test where p 0 05 indicated a significant difference if any single depth from any site was not normally distributed significant difference for that property was tested using a kruskal wallis test followed by a dunn s test a p value 0 05 indicated significant difference all statistical tests were performed using r version 4 1 0 3 results 3 1 moss height in 2016 based on destructive field sampling mean moss height at the compressed site was 13 5 0 6 cm n 126 which was significantly lower tukey test p 0 001 than at the uncompressed where the mean was 22 0 1 2 cm n 72 fig 2 the mean difference was 8 5 cm which equated to a 48 difference in moss height between the compressed and uncompressed sites cores taken used to characterize hydrophysical properties at the compressed site had a mean height of 16 9 1 9 cm n 10 which was higher than the upper limit of the 95 confidence interval of the mean moss height for that site moss height survey mean moss height of the cores from the uncompressed site n 6 was 23 0 2 6 cm which was within the 95 confidence interval of values from the field survey in 2019 field mean moss height was similar to 2016 values and remained significantly different between the compressed and uncompressed sites tukey test p 0 001 3 2 in field hydrological monitoring the total precipitation for may august 2016 in rivière du loup quebec 20 km south of bdb was 328 9 mm this was within a standard deviation of the 20 year average 1996 2016 for the area 355 2 69 6 mm environment canada 2018 during the measurement period doy 145 doy 235 the total precipitation measured at bdb was 245 mm approximately 47 115 mm of rain fell between doy 145 and doy 165 whereas only 12 29 8 mm fell between doy 210 and doy 235 the mean water table depth below surface sd at the natural site was 23 7 5 0 cm with a maximum water table depth of 9 9 cm and a minimum of 34 8 cm whereas the compressed site had a mean water table depth of 28 6 11 3 cm with a minimum and maximum depth of 11 0 to 56 3 cm respectively fig 3 the water table depth at the compressed site closely mirrored the natural site from doy 145 210 but decreased at a greater rate during a drier period by the end of the measurement period the water table depth at the compressed site was 20 cm below that at the natural site the water table depth at the uncompressed site was lower than that at both the natural and compressed sites with an average of 36 8 11 2 cm and a range of 18 4 to 61 1 cm for the entire measurement period the water table remained below the cutover peat in the compressed and uncompressed sites except for two days near the beginning doy 161 doy 164 the mean volumetric moisture content θ 2 5 cm below the cutover peat was consistently higher in the compressed site than in the uncompressed site fig 3 by the end of the measurement period doy 235 when the peatland was at its driest the mean θ at the compressed site was 34 higher than at the uncompressed site at 2 5 cm above the cutover peat the mean θ of the uncompressed site was similar to the compressed site until doy 175 after which the mean θ of the compressed site was consistently higher at 2 5 cm below the moss surface the mean θ of the compressed site was between 0 20 and 0 27 which was 10 higher than at the uncompressed site the mean θ 2 5 cm below surface at the compressed site remained lower than at the natural site for the entire measurement period 3 3 moss hydrophysical properties the bulk density of the top 5 cm of moss from all sites was similar although the compressed site moss had significantly lower bulk density than the natural site moss one way anova with a tukey hsd post hoc test p 0 05 fig 4 from 7 5 cm to 12 5 cm bulk density of the moss from the compressed and natural sites increased and was not significantly different between sites while bulk density of the uncompressed moss was significantly lower than at the compressed and natural sites p 0 05 fig 4 when comparing the bulk density of the compressed and uncompressed samples regardless of depth the bulk density of the compressed samples was 15 higher the mean proportion of macropores in the moss from the uncompressed site ranged from 70 to 78 whereas the mean proportion of macropores in the moss from the compressed and natural sites ranged from 53 to 71 and 20 55 respectively table 2 the proportion of macropores decreased with increasing depth in the mosses from both the compressed and the natural sites whereas the proportion of macropores increased from the surface to 12 5 cm in the moss from the uncompressed site as such the uncompressed site had a significantly higher proportion of macropores below 2 5 cm than the natural site dunn s test p 0 05 although the proportion of macropores in the compressed site was 10 the compressed site was not significantly different than the uncompressed site dunn s test p 0 05 at any depth when comparing the proportion of macropores of the compressed and uncompressed samples regardless of depth the compressed site was 15 lower soil water retention of the near surface samples 2 5 cm was similar between all sites fig 5 below this depth the natural site had higher retention than the other sites compression increased water retention throughout the profile especially at the base of the profile despite the increase in water content unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was not significantly different in the compressed mosses compared to the uncompressed mosses as indicated by overlapping 95 confidence intervals fig 6 while the natural mosses had a higher unsaturated hydraulic conductivity below 2 5 cm the 95 confidence interval overlapped with those of the compressed and uncompressed mosses at all depths the natural mosses had a significantly lower mean k sat than both the compressed and uncompressed mosses dunn s test p 0 05 however in all cases the mean k sat was within an order of magnitude fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 changes in hydrophysical properties compression of the unsaturated mosses was undertaken while frozen to increase the likelihood of breaking the moss structure and causing longer lasting compression the approach used frozen and covered in snow achieved compression while causing minimal rutting or tearing of the moss attempting to compress unfrozen or snow free peatlands may cause considerable damage in field compression using a tractor effectively modified the hydrophysical properties of regenerated sphagnum moss the mean moss height was reduced by 48 fig 2 which was 21 more than the compression manifest in a laboratory study 27 using a hydraulic press to compress restored site mosses gauthier et al 2018 re measuring the moss height in 2019 showed that there was no significant rebound after compression over the following three years the lack of rebound is consistent with measurements from seismic lines where heavy machinery compressed the peat during the winter for oil and gas exploration that had a higher bulk density than adjacent undisturbed peat after 11 20 years davidson et al 2020 this suggests that compression when sphagnum peat is frozen causes long lasting changes to hydrophysical properties and can induce long lasting changes to the regenerated sphagnum mosses the in field compression increased bulk density of the mosses to values comparable to those at the natural site p 0 05 unlike in the laboratory study gauthier et al 2018 the largest difference in bulk density between the compressed site and the uncompressed site was at 12 5 cm fig 4 indicating that compression was more effective at depth similar to the lab results of gauthier et al 2018 waddington et al 2010 also found that peat compressibility increased with depth up to 50 cm below ground surface which was correlated to degree of decomposition microform type peat strength and distance to hollows it could be that the partly decomposed fibers lower in the moss profile were unable to absorb the mechanical pressure without deforming resulting in a higher compression and higher bulk density it should be noted that the cores taken from the uncompressed site accurately represented the mean field moss height whereas the mean height of the cores taken from the compressed site was 3 4 cm higher than its respective mean field moss height as such the compressed moss cores represent a conservative estimate of the effect of in field compression on moss hydrophysical properties in peat macropore density has been shown to be an important control on a variety ecohydrological processes holden 2009 holden et al 2001 liu and lennartz 2019 liu et al 2020 mccarter et al 2020 rezanezhad et al 2016 in contrast to previously reported values table 2 the proportion of macropores in the uncompressed mosses was slightly lower than those taken in 2010 mccarter and price 2014 and 2011 gauthier et al 2018 possibly due to variability in moss hydrophysical properties across the site or to naturally occurring decomposition and compression between 2011 and 2016 field compression of the surface layer 2 5 cm resulted in the same proportion of macropores as laboratory compression 71 as depth in the moss profile increased the proportion of macropores decreased with field compression in the laboratory compression the proportion of macropores did not decrease with depth table 2 despite compression causing bulk density to increase to similar values as in the natural site fig 2 it did not similarly reduce the proportion of macropores table 2 while similar bulk densities may have been achieved the compressed mosses were still very fibric von post h1 h2 with distinguishable stems down to the base of the moss profile in contrast at the natural site at depths 1 cm mosses were more decomposed von post h2 h4 and stems were indistinguishable mechanical compression did not create the same proportion of macropores as naturally occurring compression and decomposition consequently soil water retention of the compressed mosses was significantly lower than that of the natural mosses at ψ 100 cm p 0 05 at all depths except the surface fig 5 the movement of water within the sphagnum moss profile is dependent on the distribution of hydraulically connected pores mccarter et al 2020 the lack of large differences in ksat at the compressed site relative to both the uncompressed and natural sites suggest that the distribution and connectivity of the macropores is sufficient regardless of compression to efficiently move water through the saturated moss additionally k unsat was not overly different between sites fig 6 yet due to the reliance of kunsat on the soil water retention of the moss matrix the effective hydraulic conductivity for a given pressure head would be higher with higher soil water retention mccarter et al 2017 mualem 1976 this is similar to the findings of mccarter and price 2014 goetz and price 2015 taylor and price 2015 and golubev and whittington 2018 who showed a large variability in soil water retention and relatively low variability in k unsat thus the observed increase in the proportion of small and inactive pores would change the k θ relationship for a given θ in this study the mosses from the natural site had lower k at any given θ than the mosses from the compressed and uncompressed sites fig 7 which could be due to the higher proportion of small pores table 2 and possibly a higher proportion of inactive pores mccarter et al 2020 at 2 5 cm there was little change due to compression so the mosses from the compressed and uncompressed sites had essentially the same proportion of macropores table 2 and the same k θ relationship fig 7 at the 7 5 and 12 5 cm depths where compression was more effective the proportion of macropores was lower in the compressed site table 2 and the k θ relationship shifted towards that of the natural site mosses fig 7 while the uncompressed mosses have the same k at a lower θ as the compressed and natural mosses fig 7 these lower θ values are experienced at higher pressure heads fig 5 similar to 10 years post restoration mccarter and price 2013 the water table remained below the cutover peat for most of the study period at both the compressed and uncompressed sites fig 3 during wetter periods the water table at the compressed site closely matched that at the natural site however during the drier end of the measurement period it was closer to the uncompressed site during this dry period the water table at the compressed and uncompressed sites continued to have a more pronounced response to precipitation and evaporation as a result of the smaller proportion of active porosity in the underlying cutover peat mccarter and price 2013 the compressed site had a 9 5 cm higher mean water table depth in comparison to the uncompressed site as a consequence of using the surface as the 0 0 cm datum compression brought the surface 8 5 cm closer to the water table which accounts for all but 0 5 cm of the difference in mean water table depth between the sites variability in moss height the slight water table gradient at the site and measurement error could account for the remaining 1 0 cm difference when using the cutover peat as the 0 0 cm datum the water table depth between the compressed and uncompressed sites was nearly identical average difference between sites sd 0 5 1 5 cm it is not surprising that there was no measurable response of the absolute water table elevation to compression as the site water table is controlled by the lateral drainage ditches and not the hydraulic properties of the sphagnum moss mccarter and price 2013 while compression did not affect the absolute water table elevation the reduction in relative water table depth from surface would increase pressure and thus increase water content at the surface lindholm and markkula 1984 4 2 success of compression as a novel restoration technique in restored peatlands a key metric for the success of compression as a novel restoration technique in restored peatlands is the reduction or removal of the capillary barrier identified by mccarter and price 2015 compression decreased the capillary barrier effect at bdb as indicated by a higher soil water retention and higher θ throughout the measurement period the uncompressed site had the lowest soil water retention throughout the moss profile fig 5 and the water table below surface was lower fig 3 and consequently had a lower θ throughout the measurement period than the compressed site fig 3 the θ at 2 5 cm above the cutover peat in the uncompressed site was essentially the same as θ at the surface fig 3 which is an indication that the uncompressed mosses have undergone little structural change and continue to be affected by the capillary barrier that was identified in 2010 mccarter and price 2015 the mosses from the compressed site had higher soil water retention than the mosses from the uncompressed site fig 5 and water table was closer to the surface fig 3 and so maintained a higher θ throughout the measurement period fig 3 increasing their effective hydraulic conductivity the increase in soil water retention in the compressed site improve the conditions that facilitate net carbon sequestration the measurement period fell within a typical summer for the area when the precipitation total was within one standard deviation of the 20 year mean environment canada 2018 although evaporation was not measured the compressed mosses may be better able to maintain pressure heads above ψ 100 cm and better meet evaporative demand than the uncompressed mosses gauthier et al 2018 especially in drier years at pressure heads beyond ψ 100 cm hyaline cells begin to drain causing the moss to desiccate hayward and clymo 1982 lewis 1988 during the measurement period patches of moss in the compressed and uncompressed site desiccated whereas no desiccation was observed in the natural site it may be that the natural site was able to maintain pressure heads above 100 cm whereas the other two sites did not no noticeable differences in the proportion of desiccated mosses were observed between the compressed and uncompressed sites a one dimensional model of variably saturated flow may be useful to quantify the degree to which the altered hydrophysical properties increased the resilience of the moss to evaporative stress and drying compression improved the hydrological condition that has the potential to support a healthier and more resilient moss community by increasing bulk density and by altering the k θ relationship however it is difficult to determine how long these changes would have taken without compression due to intra species variability in growth the bulk density of the mosses from the compressed site were similar to 40 year old regenerated s rubellum in shippagan new brunswick taylor and price 2015 which suggests compression may have accelerated the restoration timeline by 24 years though soil water retention and kunsat of the mosses from all sites in this study were below those of the 40 year old regenerated moss taylor and price 2015 this suggests that the s rubellum growing in bdb quebec and shippagan new brunswick may have different growth patterns possibly in response to differing climatic regimes further there is large variability in the published values for soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity of s rubellum including between samples taken from bdb gauthier et al 2018 mccarter and price 2014 2015 price and whittington 2010 price and whittington et al 2008 taylor and price 2015 waddington et al 2011 while it is widely understood that peatlands are heterogeneous sample size for s rubellum hydrological studies range from 1 to 14 gauthier et al 2018 mccarter and price 2014 2015 price and whittington 2010 price and whittington et al 2008 taylor and price 2015 waddington et al 2011 a more thorough understanding of the drivers of heterogeneity in sphagnum moss hydrophysical properties will enhance our ability to estimate the change in peatland trajectory due to compression turetsky et al 2008 identified a trade off between resource allocation for vertical growth loose and structural growth dense between sphagnum species waddington et al 2011 theorize that the restored mosses at bdb allocated more resources to vertical growth as a response to dry conditions however kettridge et al 2016 argue that sphagnum mosses grow to optimize the balance between water storage and carbon accumulation in drier conditions sphagnum mosses grow more densely to maximize soil water retention and reduce surface roughness hayward and clymo 1983 fenton et al 2011 also proposed that sphagnum colonies establishing in more optimal conditions grow looser as it increases radiation exposure which would increase photosynthetic activity in comparison to densely growing colonies given that the restored mosses at bdb had a relatively low bulk density and were growing loosely fig 4 mccarter and price 2015 it would suggest that once established the restored mosses were not water limited during their initial regeneration as the ditch blocking sufficiently raised the water table to limit soil water pressures 100 cm shantz and price 2006 this is contrary to the theory posed by waddington et al 2011 sphagnum growing in a high resource environment can also have sustained vertical growth turetsky et al 2008 an alternative theory may be that the regenerated s rubellum at bdb allocated more resources to sustained vertical growth as a result of high nutrient availability especially in the earlier years post restoration when the phosphorus fertilizer was applied and still available to the regenerated mosses andersen et al 2010 while this may be the case the analysis done by turetsky et al 2008 is an interspecific comparison of carbohydrate allocation little is known about the intraspecific relationships between key moss traits and environmental parameters turetsky et al 2008 and whether the same species of moss can alter its retention properties or if it will be outcompeted by a species better suited for its environment future studies should investigate the intraspecific variability in growth rate carbohydrate allocation and morphology as it applies to hydrological function to better manage restored cutover peatlands understanding and managing these functions could prevent the formation of a capillary barrier and reduce the need for active management like mechanical compression 5 conclusions mechanical compression reduced moss height by 48 which effectively increased bulk density to be similar to naturally occurring s rubellum compression resulted in a lower proportion of macropores and increased soil water retention which reduced the capillary barrier effect and increased moisture content throughout the moss profile the increase in soil water retention improved connectivity to deeper water stores thus decreasing the probability of desiccation of the capitula in drier periods but potentially increasing the overall system water loss by evaporation the magnitude and consequence of managing the hydraulic performance of a regenerating moss layer needs to be systematically evaluated which could be approached with a numeric model for a range of moss layer thicknesses and weather scenarios while compression may improve the hydrological conditions that support more resilient mosses it is necessary to confirm the impact on short and long term carbon sequestration compression may be an effective option for restored sites that experience frequent and or prolonged desiccation events which clearly lower carbon sequestration and may become more prevalent in a warming climate despite the apparent success of this novel restoration technique compression did not produce the same pore network in a restored peatland as naturally occurring compression and decomposition resulting in lower soil water retention throughout the moss profile in comparison to the natural site further decomposition over time is needed to decrease the proportion of macropores to be similar to that of the natural site furthermore it is difficult to assess how long changes in the hydrophysical properties would have taken to manifest without compression revisiting the compressed and uncompressed sites 10 years post compression will give insight into the progression of moss hydrophysical properties over time and the long term success of compression as a restoration technique uncertainties in intra and interspecific variability in the relationship between key moss traits and environmental parameters should also be characterized to better understand the impact of compression on the restoration timeline and to potentially promote growth patterns similar to the natural site credit authorship contribution statement

3097,a key goal of hydrological science is to understand the climatic controls on catchment hydrological response behavior progress toward this goal would result in improved model transferability from gauged to gauged catchments in this sense the effectiveness of the model s transferability is contingent on the proper selection of donor and target catchment pairs thus using a rainfall runoff model we evaluate two distinct types of hydrological similarity in this study i the apparent similarity measured by similarity distance based on observable catchments descriptors cds and a euclidean distance based on physical similarity ps method and ii behavioral similarity which is determined by highest performance of transferred model parameters between gauged donor catchment and ungauged target catchment best donor case bd it is believed that catchments that apparently to be similar in terms of cds have a similar hydrological behavior we wish to see if that assumption is valid in this paper spatial proximity sp is also implemented to see if it might be used as an alternative for ps where there is no apparent physical similarity between catchments to test the study s assumptions the hbv conceptual rainfall runoff model is used in 576 catchments across four climate regions in iran the results indicate that 1 as expected the best donor bd case performs the best and the more than 75 of our physically similar catchments have a hydrological similarity the overlap was 70 2 the superiority of ps over sp demonstrates that the cds exert a great influence on transferability within each climate region than geographical distance however we demonstrated that the sp is superior when spatial distance between donor and target catchments is reduced nearest neighbor 20 km 3 consistent with cds when utilizing sp method geographical distance has a varying effect on model transferability within wetter and drier regions such that sp performs better in wetter regions than it does in dry interior regions 4 throughout iran the dominant controls on model transferability differ by region thus the climatic aridity index or pet p topographic mean elevation and physiographic catchment area properties exert a greater influence on parameter transfer to ungauged catchments than do other cds and 5 the runoff ratio streamflow signature confirmed the superiority of the wetter regions over the drier regions in terms of control on the parameters transfer keywords apparent similarity behavioral similarity geographical distance physical similarity spatial proximity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate estimation of hydrological model parameters requires information about continuous streamflow time series for river gauges but this data is incomplete and unavailable in many river basins of the world blöschl et al 2013 oudin et al 2010 regionalization is therefore an important issue in hydrological science sivapalan 2003 we define regionalization in this study as all methods that allow hydrological information to be transferred from gauged to ungauged catchments obtaining model parameters from supposedly similar catchments is an appealing approach to estimate model parameters in ungauged catchments this is the rationale for the physical similarity approach which seeks to detect hydrological similarities based on the physical characteristics of catchments burn and boorman 1993 apart from the arduous task of understanding which catchment descriptors cds influence hydrological behavior there is also the issue of defining hydrological similarity indeed the hydrological similarity is frequently determined by examining the signatures of catchment functional responses e g runoff yield which are influenced to some extent by climate variables oudin et al 2010 currently similarity based approaches established in regionalization studies aim to transfer a model parameter set calibrated on a gauged donor catchment to the target ungauged catchment if the donor catchment is physically similar to the target catchment mcintyre et al 2005 two significant assumptions are made implicitly in this procedure 1 because the calibrated model parameter sets acquired from two different catchments are similar it is expected that their behavior in response to the transformation of rainfall runoff is similar and 2 it is assumed that a catchment s physical similarity as determined by multiple cds reflects a hydrological similarity between the two from a hydrological standpoint assumption 1 is inescapable it does however have limitations the first of which is the potential of compensations between parameters kokkonen et al 2003 over parameterized models are more susceptible to this issue than other types of models secondly while calibrated parameters represent catchment behavior they can also reveal biases in the data used to calculate them andréassian et al 2004 2001 oudin et al 2006 every regionalization study has assumption 2 in summary it assumes that it should be feasible to find specific cds that account for the hydrological catchment behavior given the potential value of various cds in defining catchments hydrological response it is necessary to ascertain which cds are most appropriate wagener et al 2007 particularly for regionalization purposes blöschl 2005 this study aims to identify which gauged catchment s are hydrologically most similar to the ungauged target catchment in order to find out how much readily available cds explain catchment hydrological behavior and hence which are the best donors of model parameters thus employing the relevant cds to establish an appropriate similarity between gauged and ungauged catchments apparent similarity a better presentation of the hydrologic similarity hs can be guaranteed this assumption is similar to those considered by falkenmark and chapman 1989 sivapalan 2009 and oudin et al 2010 by analyzing different catchments located in different climate regions a framework for identifying the most relevant controls can be developed several studies have been conducted in the literatures that have considered this hypothesis and yielded interesting results for example in a comprehensive study parajka et al 2013 reviewed many studies on a wide range of regionalization approaches and concluded that it is easier to simulate streamflow in larger catchments than in smaller ones and in humid catchments as to compared to dry ones in 913 french catchments oudin et al 2008 conclude that cds climatic physiographic and topographic may vary by region and obtaining a unique cd or consistent set of cds to define hs between donor and target catchment may not be possible they determined that in another study that there is a high overlap between apparent physical and behavioral hydrological similarity for 60 of french and uk catchments oudin et al 2010 in 83 catchments across the united states singh et al 2014 concluded that the optimal cds for defining hydrologic similarity differ by region with physical climatic characteristics identified as the most relevant cds for transferring hydrologic model parameters they also concluded that regional analysis of regionalization approaches can aid in identifying the most relevant controls on parameter transfer for each hydro climate region unlike earlier pub research merz and blöschl 2004 oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2005 patil and stieglitz 2015 zhang and chiew 2009 we identified a case of highest performance of transferred model parameters between gauged donor catchment and ungauged target catchments regardless of spatial distance climatic type and or physical properties best donor case bd the term behavioral similarity is referred to this despite two earlier comprehensive investigations of model transferability in iran jahanshahi et al 2022 jahanshahi et al 2021 this can serve as a baseline or reference score for interpreting model transferability when apparent similarity exists we conduct a comprehensive analysis on two scales of a climate regions regional and b throughout iran local the similarity index si is constructed based on a variety of combinations of a dynamic climate and b static physiographic and land use cds in physical similarity ps regionalization method spatial proximity sp is also implemented to see if it might be used as an alternative for ps where there is no apparent physical similarity between catchments the geographical distance gd between gauged and ungauged catchments is employed as a similarity metric for parameter set transfer in this method e g yang et al 2020a jahanshahi et al 2021 thus the degree of relevance of each cds to regionalization is determined in this study as the first and most comprehensive study on identifying the main controls on hs at the national scale of iran this study aims to answer three main questions a do apparent physical similar catchments have a similar hydrological behavior b which metric or metrics cause the high performance of hs parameter transfer approaches physical climatic geographical or a combination of the three c is dominant control s on the transferring of hydrologic model parameters the same across different types of climate regions our innovation in this study are a we moved beyond a variety of single and groups of dynamic climate and static physiographic land use and geographical distance catchment descriptors to establish the optimal case s of hydrologic similarity in terms of parameter transfer performance and then compared it to the highest performance case of parameter transfer this is beneficial because it connects complex catchment responses to relevant catchment descriptors and b we also used information about streamflow signature runoff ratio to interpret parameter transfer results 2 study area model and dataset 2 1 study area iran is our study area according to the de martonne classification system de martonne 1926 jahanshahi et al 2021 iran is divided into four major climate regions the country s climate varies greatly ranging from a humid and semi humid maritime climate along the caspian sea coast to arid and semi arid climates in the interior annual and seasonal rainfall in iran is highly variable with mean annual precipitation map ranging from 360 mm in the middle regions to more than 2000 mm in the north mean 724 mm irimo 2018 this substantial difference in regional variability of precipitation is most noticeable between the country s north northwest west and central regions from 400 to 2000 mm in iran s mountainous regions altitude has a significant effect on the rainfall and runoff hydrographs show quite distinct spatial patterns iem 2018 2 2 tuw model the tuw model was developed by viglione and parajka 2019 as a semi distributed version of the hbv model bergström 1976 it consists of three routines snow soil moisture and flow response and routing with 15 parameters ceola et al 2015 parajka et al 2007 the model treats the elevation zones as discrete entities that contribute to the total output flow in their own right daily precipitation air temperature and potential evapotranspiration are used as inputs fig 1 finally based on the sub catchment areas the different outputs from the elevation zones are averaged neri et al 2020 parajka et al 2007 and ceola et al 2015 respectively provide more details on the model structure and use in r 2 3 forcing data data from the iran meteorological organization irimo irimo 2018 and the iran energy ministry iem iem 2018 is used to create a daily precipitation time series for all catchments the idw and elevation idew technique was used to estimate rainfall fields from point measurements measured at gauge locations in this dataset the idew is an interpolation approach that also allows for the possibility of defining elevation weighting along with the distance weighting making it more suitable for mountainous regions of iran where topographic influences on precipitation are important more details are presented in jahanshahi et al 2021 and masih et al 2011 and masih et al 2010 a regression based approach and elevation as an explanatory variable was used to construct daily temperature time series from irimo iem data the hargreaves method is used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration based on maximum minimum and average temperatures hargreaves et al 1985 missing values in the data sets were estimated using the regression method which relies on values from nearby gauges to calculate the missed records the temperature data from nearby gauges were correlated well enough to be used r2 0 89 in the case of precipitation data the correlation is r2 0 85 for all 576 catchments 6 3 and 9 4 of the temperature and precipitation data respectively required to be filled as depicted in fig 2 the climatic variables of the 576 study catchments were assessed between 1993 and 2012 precipitation temperature pet and snow cover percentage in the study catchments are all subject to some variations between the calibration and validation periods the validation period is slightly drier than the calibration period the annual mean of four climate variables in the research catchments analyzed using hubert s segmentation approach shows no trend or change point from 1993 to 2012 thus the four variables have inter annual fluctuation annual mean values of climate variables for four climate regions are shown in table 1 for the years 1993 2012 2 4 catchment dataset a set of 576 unregulated catchments with a total area of about 407 000 km2 are selected for this study these are the same catchments that used in our previous study jahanshahi et al 2021 the catchment area ranging from 64 7 km2 to 8 432 km2 and a median of 496 km2 there is a decline in the catchment area as one moves from humid to arid environments with the lowest and highest median values occurring in the humid and arid regions respectively table 2 the distribution of meteorological and hydrometric measuring gauges number and distribution per unit area worsens from wet to dry land use digital maps modis land cover product aquifers map iran energy ministry map global soil map based on the fao map and the major geological formations 1 250000 map of usgs are used these digitized maps are merged with catchment boundaries to determine soil type land use type aquifer area and geological unit the study catchments have a continuous daily streamflow time series from water year wy 1992 to 2012 i e september 22 1992 to september 21 2012 all discharge data for all catchments are carefully screened and outliers are removed table 1 summarizes the median values of cds for all 576 study catchments there are correlations between cds for 576 study catchments but most of these correlations are not strong a heatmap of the spearman rank correlations among cds is presented in fig 3 we split the timeline from wy 1993 to 2012 into the following two calibration and validation periods wy 1993 2008 is calibration period and wy 2008 2012 is validation period wy 1992 1993 is used for model warm up fig 4 depicts the locations and classifications of 576 study catchments into four climate regions for each climate region the median cd values are shown in table 2 3 methodology 3 1 strategies to begin the best donor catchment our baseline scenario is selected based on the highest nse value after each catchment is considered in turn as an ungauged target catchment out of 576 catchments while the other catchments are considered a donor 576 1 575 catchments best donor case or behavioral similarity and then the effectiveness of two following strategies termed as apparent similarity in prediction of ungauged catchments is evaluated by comparing them to the best donor case this is the hypothesis that is used in the study to show the differences between parameter transfer methods to clarify the degree of hydrological similarity the following are two strategies strategy 1 using physical similarity ps method tables 3 and 4 scenarios 1 through 20 to select physically similar catchments in terms of 11 selected cds see table 3 potential donor catchments are ranked by ps for each ungauged catchment based on the following a each individual cd rankings and b the sum of the 11 cds rankings strategy 2 using the nearest neighbor nn method to prioritize donor catchments for model parameter transferring to target catchments table 5 experiments 1 through 4 the geographical distance between gauged and ungauged catchments is used in this strategy 3 2 evaluate the consistency of measured hydrological and physical similarities we examine strategy 1 in this section we assess a methodology to evaluate the consistency of the measured hydrological and physical similarities for regionalization based on the assumptions described by oudin et al 2010 here we first establish metric that measure physical and hydrological similarities 3 2 1 measuring the hydrological similarity to define the hs we compared the outlines of two types of models 1 a model with locally calibrated parameters gauged catchment and 2 a model with parameters estimated by calibration on another donor to target ungauged catchment in terms of i catchment descriptors ps and ii the highest nse values in parameter transfer regardless cds best donor case bd parameter transferability can be used to define hs oudin et al 2010 transferring whole parameter sets are preferred to the individual parameters in order to eliminate interactions between parameters mcintyre et al 2005 the ability of parameter sets to simulate streamflow can be taken into account to select hydrologically similar catchments to this end if the model s efficiency on ungauged catchment obtained by the model using the parameters estimated by calibration on gauged catchment is greater than 0 7 of model s efficiency estimated in the bd case on ungauged catchment the gauged catchment is considered as hydrologically similar to ungauged catchment this is our study assumption section 4 3 the value of 0 7 is appointed based on the difference between calibration results and ps achieved after the initial implementation of the parameter transfers thus our assumption is that this distinction was examined in two ways 1 if the difference between calibration and ps is less than 30 and 2 if the difference in performance between ps and bd is less than 30 the performance of hydrologically behavioral similar catchments is considered good oudin et al 2010 adopted the value of 10 in their study 3 2 2 measuring the physical similarity we employ the methodology by kay et al 2007 to measure the ps between catchments in which euclidean distance is used to define the similarity in cds space and cd values are normalized by their standard deviation over the entire catchment set here we considered the following weighting of cds 1 dis t a b j 1 j w j x a j x b j σ x j 2 where j indicates one of a total of j cds xa j is the value of that cd at the a th catchment σx j is the standard deviation of the cd across the entire catchment set and wj is the weight attributed to the jth cd to begin distances involving only one cd were tested i e by setting the weights of the other descriptors to zero following that weights were considered to be identical for all cds as is common in pub studies e g oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2005 last the weights were optimized to maximize the overlap between physically similar catchments and hydrologically similar catchments oudin et al 2010 for the optimization more than 3000 wt combinations were tested reflecting every possible combination with weights ranging from zero to unity with an increment of 0 1 and the sum of the weights being equal to unity we assessed the relevance of eleven physical similarity measures based on eq 1 to evaluate the consistency of physical and hydrological similarity for all cds all weights are set to zero except one that is only one cd is used to assess the physical similarity between the target catchment and the other catchments this set of combinations tests the relevance of each cd in determining hs then we employed multiple cds simultaneously in eq 1 to find the set of cds that produced the highest degree of hs by repeating the process we eventually identified the scenarios table 4 three sets of catchments are determined here as follows 1 a group of catchments that are the most physically similar to each catchment considered in turn consider physical cousin by oudin et al 2010 this group is determined using distance calculation eq 1 the number of catchments in this group is n 478 2 those catchments that produce the highest nse values in bd are likely to be hydrologically similar catchments hydrological cousin the number of catchments in this group is n 437 the overlap between these two sets indicates the ability of the cds to identify the catchments that are hydrologically similar our assumption 3 a group of catchments that are the most spatially similar to each catchment considered in turn spatial cousin the number of catchments in this group is n 494 it s worth mentioning that we incorporate the nn method into the oudin et al 2010 methodology to do so we employed both ps and nn to calculate the hs allowing us to compare the two methods more closely the ps considers individual cds the nn considers different gd between donor and target catchments and the optimum option for each is then compared to the calibration and bd cases compare three approaches to achieve the best solution for model parameter transfer a detailed stepwise implementation of all processes and parameter transfers strategies are presented in fig 5 4 results 4 1 model performance for calibration period at site we used from calibrated parameters estimated in our previous study jahanshahi et al 2021 the median nse values of calibration period 1993 2008 for all 576 gauged were greater than 0 5 the results indicate that the model performs better in wetter catchments than it does in drier ones these findings generally corroborated those of oudin et al 2008 in france and parajka et al 2005 in austria in fig 6 the 576 catchments model performance is shown as a regional distribution according to the model s performance in the northwestern northern and inner western regions of the country they are far superior than the other regions rainfall patterns in interior western and southeast catchments vary in amplitude making streamflow modeling more complex when it comes to model performance highland catchments typically outperform lowland ones 4 2 relating similarity index with transfer performance throughout iran local and climate regions regional we investigate the effect of similarity in catchment descriptors and geographical distance on successful parameter transfer hydrological similarity transferring the best parameter sets between 576 catchments results in 993 600 575 for three approaches cases about 88 7 of the 993 600 cases produced an nse greater than zero the physical similarity and nearest neighbor methods are compared to identify the main controls on parameter transfer at two different scales climate regions regional and the entire iran local to select the most appropriate approach and quantify its performances the calibration and best donor cases are used as the base case and second base respectively here the ps method employed eleven cds to define catchment similarity when it came to hydrological indices computed in pub studies the most variability was explained by these cds e g arsenault and brissette 2014 he et al 2011 petheram et al 2009 skm 2009 yang et al 2020b yang et al 2018 the median distance between gauged and ungauged catchment pairs is shown in table 3 to test the relevance of each cd in determining hydrologic similarity the relevance of eleven ps measures is assessed based on euclidean distance equation section 3 2 2 in ten of them all weights are set to zero except one implying that only one cd is used to assess the ps between target ungauged catchment and the other catchments this set of combination tests examines the utility of each cd in determining hydrological similarity one such combination is a ps measure that assigns equal weights for all cds therefore potential donor catchments are ranked by ps for each target catchment based on 1 one cd and 2 a combination of eleven cds table 3 when only one cd is used in the similarity equation four appear to be more relevant than the others the aridity index ai mean elevation me catchment area ar agriculture cover agr and rangeland cover rang then comes the pet forest cover and residential cover are the two cds that have the least relevant on the selection of hydrologically similar catchments the low performance of similarity in these two cds could possibly be explained by the more variable forest residential characteristics identified in study catchments however this is hypothesis and more research is needed to discover why forest and residential are ineffective as useful characteristics the median distance between donor and target catchment pairs in terms of both cds and gd groups is shown in table 4 si values for sum of the five best cds are also shown in table 4 at two different scales of local and regional sixteen scenarios are examined to ascertain the dominant controls on successful parameter transfer at two scales see tables 3 and 4 fig 7 illustrates the box plot comparison of the ten best ps scenarios as well as the performance of the nn and bd cases in calibration and validation modes as seen in this fig the best performance for ps is achieved with s15 median nse 0 56 in which ai and me are employed to select most similar donor target catchment pairs followed by s2 decline of 17 4 compared to calibration s6 decline of 19 s7 decline of 22 9 s3 decline of 24 5 s5 decline of 28 5 s4 decline of 30 3 s9 decline of 34 3 s11 decline of 39 7 and s20 decline of 43 8 in general we observed that scenarios based on climatic descriptors aridity index performed better in the ps than scenarios based on topographic me physiographic catchment area and land use catchment percent agriculture descriptors me is chosen as the most prominent topographic descriptor on parameter transfer which is also considered the second dominant control hence generally our findings indicated that when we identified the similarity in climate and me particularly at elevations the results resulted in a more successful parameter transfer than with other cds at the regional scale among four land use descriptors examined in ps table 3 the use of catchment percent agricultural and rangeland in define similarity resulted in improved parameter transfer performance the performance ranking of cds in validation mode is similar to that in calibration mode although the difference in performance is significant scenarios 15 and 20 are selected as the best and worst respectively this finding reveals that moving between periods calibration to validation considerably impairs the performance of both transfer methods this conclusion is consistent with pub studies e g jahanshahi et al 2022 2021 oudin et al 2008 patil and stieglitz 2015 petheram et al 2009 zhang and chiew 2009 as expected the best strategy is bd median nse 0 65 its difference from s15 the best scenario in ps is 6 62 for calibration and 2 53 for validation the nn median nse 0 5 is chosen as the third worst strategy this results demonstrated that the gd has a more influence on parameter transfer than temporal gap this effect was significantly enhanced in validation mode significantly impairing the nn performance as a result the nn performance is reduced by 32 12 when compared to bd performance reduces 23 46 for calibration mode this overall finding is consistence with patil and stieglitz 2015 at 294 catchments across us the main reason for the relatively poor performance of the nn is that the median distance between catchment centroids is relatively large greater than 71 km which means that selecting donor target catchment pairs on the basis of sp method will provide no better results than using the ps and bd methods the climatic differences between the calibration and validation periods could also contribute to performance decline from calibration to validation it is a little wetter during the calibration 1993 2008 period than during the validation 2008 2012 period see table 1 the box plots of controls on parameter transfer for wet humid and semi humid and dry arid and semi arid catchments are shown in fig 8 for wet catchments in calibration mode s16 where aridity index and catchment area are used to select most similar donor target catchment pairs produced the best results followed by s7 decline of 17 9 compared to calibration s2 decline of 19 6 s6 decline of 22 6 s3 decline of 26 7 s9 decline of 30 8 s20 decline of 32 4 s5 decline of 36 4 s4 decline of 36 6 s11 decline of 42 8 the cds performance ranking is kept in validation mode just like it is in calibration mode the best and worst results for arid and semi arid regions are obtained using s19 and s20 respectively the spatial distribution of catchments where five best ps scenarios at both regional and local scales are shown in fig 9 left we found that similarity in cds from three categories climate ai topographic me and slope and physiographic area are required for successful parameter transfers in humid and semi humid regions 455 parameter transfers the very northwestern and northern humid catchments as well as northern coastline at southern fringe of caspian sea similarity in agriculture land use is added to those for two aforementioned climate regions for successful parameter transfer in arid and semi arid regions 121 parameter transfers the northeastern and middle mountains as well as middle and southeastern plains as a result for arid region the only land use descriptor used to judge the effectiveness of a parameter transfer for 1 04 of catchments n 6 is similarity in catchment percent agriculture s19 this means that land use descriptors do not have as much of an impact on parameter transfer as climatic topographic and physiographic descriptors which have the most potential for determining parameter transfer similarities the results of singh et al 2014 in 83 catchments across the us show a high potential for successful parameter transfer based on similarities in climate and topographical characteristics they found that similarity in percentage of agriculture has the most potential for parameter transfer for humid and semi humid catchments of the plains our overall findings do not support this conclusion similarity in elevation was found to be the most important control on parameter transfer for humid and semi humid plateaus in their study which is consistent with our high altitude catchments in humid and semi humid regions pet and me are the most relevant controls on a successful parameter transfer in semi arid mountains and plateaus across the us whereas area aridity index and me have the largest impact in our study beyond this other cds do not provide any more useful information in semi arid region s20 similarity in percentage of rangeland was only able to successfully transfer parameters for one catchment we also considered the role of the runoff ratio in determining whether or not a parameters transfer was successful not in similarity for ps the runoff ratio values were found for humid and semi humid regions where parameter transfer is most facilitated by similarity in climatic and topographic characteristics in contrast lower runoff ratio values for arid and semi arid regions drier catchments demonstrates how all four cd types come together to determine the successful of parameters transfer table 4 tables s19 and s20 fig 9 right illustrates the performance of bd in catchments classified as 1 0 4 0 6 2 0 6 0 8 and 3 0 8 by comparing the catchment distribution in the right and left panels of fig 9 we found that the strong performance of s15 s2 and s7 is consistent with the performance of the bd case particularly in humid and semi humid regions this finding revealed that similarity in aridity index and mean elevation plays a significant role in determining hydrological similarity for these wet catchments the s6 and s19 performs relatively well in terms of compliance with two moderate categories of bd 0 4 0 6 and 0 6 0 8 when compared to other scenarios for drier catchments of semi arid and arid regions this finding confirms that the catchment area and agriculture cover are both high relevant cds in the selection of hydrologically similar catchments among these two groups catchments 4 3 evaluating the overlap in physical similarity by blending the catchment descriptors the selection of hydrologically similar catchments improves remarkably when the cds are blended by using their combinations tables 3 and 4 as a result the s15 combination had the best overall performance throughout iran to better understand the role of ps in hs performance we investigate i the difference between calibration best case and ps s15 fig 10 left and ii the overlap between ps and bd second best case fig 10 right we organized the catchments into four groups based on this overlap 1 90 2 70 90 3 50 70 and 50 the results showed that when these categories are considered the overlap is greater than 70 for more than 75 n 431 of the catchments implying that 1 physically apparently similar catchments have a high similar hydrological behavior and 2 the cds in s15 aridity index and me are able to define hydrological behavioral similarity well on the basis of transferability of model parameters fig 10 right out of these 431 catchments 307 71 were wet and 124 29 were dry we also found that the smaller gap between calibration and ps is associated with wetter high altitude catchments in humid and semi humid regions where the aridity index and me are most relevant controls in selecting hydrologically similar catchments fig 10 left two possible reasons for reduction the overlap 50 for 9 n 53 of catchments are 1 the lack of cds that would potentially increase overlap between two hydrological and similar cousins e g groundwater and geologic and 2 the lack of hydrological cousins for some ungauged catchments most of these catchments are located in semi arid and arid very southwestern middle and southeastern plains as well as semi humid middle western and eastern catchments regions which have drier climatic conditions 4 4 evaluation of spatial proximity to calculate catchment similarity the gd between the donor and target catchment is employed as an attribute in the nn approach because of the wide range of climate heterogeneity in iran it is necessary to determine the optimal distance between the centroids of donor target catchment pairs in order to maximize the spatial transfer of parameter sets in order to acquire the most accurate results the nn is used in four experiments to achieve this goal a distance d less than 20 km b d 40 km c d 60 km and d d 90 km are defined as donor target catchment pairs in these experiments results of these experiments are summarized in table 5 rows 1 to 4 fig 11 shows the nses of these experiments in box plots in both calibration and validation modes as shown in fig 11 significant differences occur between the results of experiments and the nn method when compared to nn the performance of e1 0 to 20 km increased by 25 37 and 32 75 for calibration and validation modes respectively table 5 shows that more than half of the study catchments about 63 n 362 are within a distance of 0 to 90 km the gd was subsequently broken into five smaller spatial distances and the nn was re implement under them these new spatial distances are as follows 1 0 10 km 2 10 20 km 3 20 30 km 4 30 40 km and 5 0 68 km table 5 rows 5 to 9 our goal is to conduct a more precise investigation of the optimal gd in the nn method then compare the optimal results to the performance related modifications of blending the cds in defining similarity for ps comparing ps and nn reveals that while the nn performs worse than the ps changing the gd between the donor target catchment pairs has a more complex effect on performance than cd combinations no further details are provided and the optimal gd for model parameter transfer lies between 0 and 10 km n 14 5 discussion we find interesting differences in physical physical similarity method and spatial nearest neighbor method controls on model parameter transfer when investigating our dataset spanning iran local and when dividing it into climate regions regional to investigate the cds geographical distance performance link to transfer parameter sets between the 576 unregulated catchments we apply three strategies ps nn and best donor best donor with highest nse value previous pub studies in iran have not directly made this comparison parameters transfer was successful when employing nse as it was in pub studies chouaib et al 2018 merz and blöschl 2004 oudin et al 2010 2008 parajka et al 2005 zhang and chiew 2009 jahanshahi et al 2021 although the main aim of pub studies was to simulate in ungauged catchment the success of these simulations was not attributed to the catchment descriptors input combinations for ps the main controls for parameter transfer throughout iran the local scale are climate and topographic followed by physiographic other pub studies have found that the importance of i climatic gradients chouaib et al 2018 sawicz et al 2014 ii topographic price 2011 and iii land use form climate descriptors and geologic structure winter 2001 wolock et al 2004 across the usa our results agree with their finding though we also found that climate physiographic and land use are major controls on parameter transfer at regional semi arid and arid regions where that catchments have similar energy conditions and are water limited as well as local scales according to singh et al 2014 climate is not the most relevant control on parameter transfer in humid regions across the us but physical attributes and land used patterns are most dominant their conclusion contradicts our findings me on the other hand was chosen as an important secondary control in mountainous catchments in humid and semi humid regions where energy limited conditions are prevalent the study catchments have high elevation highest variation on elevation the highest percentage slope and largest percentage of land covered by forest see table 2 we can assume that this highly variable topography is associated with a variable climate gradient the difference between our study and a previous regional study in 903 catchments in france and uk by oudin et al 2010 is that 1 we did not seek to find the number n of hydrologically similar catchments instead we compared the most physically similar catchment to the best donor case to determine the overlap percentage and hydrological similarity accuracy and 2 the study models are different hbv versus gr4j and topmo our results demonstrated that more than 75 of our physically similar catchments have a hydrological similarity with a substantial overlap more than 70 whereas only 60 of the hydrologically similar catchments are physically similar in general the following controls appear in sequence when classifying the performance of parameter transfer based on all tested options 1 spatial distance for gd 10 km 2 climate topographic physiographic and land use characteristics therefore geographically similar catchments are found to be more hydrologically similar than physically similar catchments only for gd less than 10 km implying that the ps method provides useful information for spatial distances more than 10 km in comparison to wetter catchments our findings imply that physiographic catchment area and land use percentage of agriculture and rangeland area descriptors are prevalent in drier catchments the overall performance of model transferability corroborated the general pattern of humid catchments outperforming dry catchments observed in the pub reviewed studies of parajka et al 2013 to understand the results more accurately between climate regions we entered the runoff ratio streamflow signature see table 4 we concluded that the catchments with higher runoff ratio have better calibration and regionalization performance as evidenced by 455 wet catchments 79 humid and semi humid regions out of 576 study catchments where the median nse values for calibration and ps cases range from 0 65 to 0 89 and 0 6 to 0 82 respectively and the runoff ratio ranges from 0 17 to 0 78 median 0 43 the runoff ratio ranges from 0 11 to 0 61 median 0 24 for 121 dry catchments 21 semi arid and arid regions with median nse values for calibration and ps cases ranging from 0 5 to 0 64 and 0 5 to 0 59 respectively see table 4 some model regionalization studies have shown that combining streamflow time series from several parameter sets from a multi donors ensemble generally works better than a single donor framework oudin et al 2008 viney et al 2009 yang et al 2020b however our goal was to identify only one donor catchment physically cousin bd spatially cousin most similar to the target catchment different results from using multi donors should be considered in future investigations 6 conclusions in this study in order to explore the links between apparent physical spatial similarity and hydrological similarity we related i physical similarity in several catchment descriptors cds and ii geographical distance gd to behavioral similarity the highest performance in hydrologic model parameter transfer which is considered the best donor case bd by analyzing the overlap between them our aim is to use a simple strategy to determine the most relevant available cds or gd to explain the behavioral similarity on the basis of hbv model parameter transfer to the ungauged catchment the optimal 1 gd and 2 cds were determined in this strategy by comparing three pools of hydrologically hydrological cousins physically physical cousins and spatially spatial cousins similar catchments defined on the basis of available cds and gd throughout iran and subsequently in smaller climate regions we found that gd is the main control on successful transferability at the scale of entire iran local by overlap analysis between physical similarity and best donor case the geographical distance less than 10 km in nearest neighbor followed by a combination of climate aridity index and topographic mean elevation descriptors in ps are selected as dominant controls on parameters transferability to the ungauged catchment thus most relevant cds guarantee the selection of hydrologically similar catchments for 75 of the ungauged catchments for which the overlap was more than 70 by categorizing catchments into climate regions physiographic catchment area and land use agriculture and rangeland classes descriptors are added to the most relevant spatial controls in almost all catchments all four types of cds topographic climate physiographic and land use emerged as important controls on parameter transferability the runoff ratio functional characteristic revealed that higher values are associated with regions where the climate descriptors are main controls thus in general the shortest gd less than 10 km between donor and target catchment emerged as the most prominent control on parameter transferability this implies that the identifying an appropriate metric of hydrologic similarity depend on the i geographical distance and ii cd type this study had some limitations which will be fascinating topics for future research as discussed here first due to lack of data similarity in geology soil and groundwater characteristics is restricted throughout iran second the number of catchments available in dry regions only 28 catchments were limited third there are some possible sources of uncertainty although uncertainty analysis was not part of this study s scope as well as non stationary climate conditions the main advantage of our study is that it is not possible to consider the similarity only in a particular catchment descriptor or geographical distance at iranian catchments to ensure successful model parameters transfer but we must consider a certain combinations or a wide range of them both cds and geographical distance for different climate regions therefore if we are able to establish that similarity at an optimal geographical distance and with particular characteristics it would provide an appropriate model transferability to strengthen the role of physical similarity parameter transferability further research is needed to identify more relevant lithologic geologic groundwater soil descriptors declaration of competing

3097,a key goal of hydrological science is to understand the climatic controls on catchment hydrological response behavior progress toward this goal would result in improved model transferability from gauged to gauged catchments in this sense the effectiveness of the model s transferability is contingent on the proper selection of donor and target catchment pairs thus using a rainfall runoff model we evaluate two distinct types of hydrological similarity in this study i the apparent similarity measured by similarity distance based on observable catchments descriptors cds and a euclidean distance based on physical similarity ps method and ii behavioral similarity which is determined by highest performance of transferred model parameters between gauged donor catchment and ungauged target catchment best donor case bd it is believed that catchments that apparently to be similar in terms of cds have a similar hydrological behavior we wish to see if that assumption is valid in this paper spatial proximity sp is also implemented to see if it might be used as an alternative for ps where there is no apparent physical similarity between catchments to test the study s assumptions the hbv conceptual rainfall runoff model is used in 576 catchments across four climate regions in iran the results indicate that 1 as expected the best donor bd case performs the best and the more than 75 of our physically similar catchments have a hydrological similarity the overlap was 70 2 the superiority of ps over sp demonstrates that the cds exert a great influence on transferability within each climate region than geographical distance however we demonstrated that the sp is superior when spatial distance between donor and target catchments is reduced nearest neighbor 20 km 3 consistent with cds when utilizing sp method geographical distance has a varying effect on model transferability within wetter and drier regions such that sp performs better in wetter regions than it does in dry interior regions 4 throughout iran the dominant controls on model transferability differ by region thus the climatic aridity index or pet p topographic mean elevation and physiographic catchment area properties exert a greater influence on parameter transfer to ungauged catchments than do other cds and 5 the runoff ratio streamflow signature confirmed the superiority of the wetter regions over the drier regions in terms of control on the parameters transfer keywords apparent similarity behavioral similarity geographical distance physical similarity spatial proximity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate estimation of hydrological model parameters requires information about continuous streamflow time series for river gauges but this data is incomplete and unavailable in many river basins of the world blöschl et al 2013 oudin et al 2010 regionalization is therefore an important issue in hydrological science sivapalan 2003 we define regionalization in this study as all methods that allow hydrological information to be transferred from gauged to ungauged catchments obtaining model parameters from supposedly similar catchments is an appealing approach to estimate model parameters in ungauged catchments this is the rationale for the physical similarity approach which seeks to detect hydrological similarities based on the physical characteristics of catchments burn and boorman 1993 apart from the arduous task of understanding which catchment descriptors cds influence hydrological behavior there is also the issue of defining hydrological similarity indeed the hydrological similarity is frequently determined by examining the signatures of catchment functional responses e g runoff yield which are influenced to some extent by climate variables oudin et al 2010 currently similarity based approaches established in regionalization studies aim to transfer a model parameter set calibrated on a gauged donor catchment to the target ungauged catchment if the donor catchment is physically similar to the target catchment mcintyre et al 2005 two significant assumptions are made implicitly in this procedure 1 because the calibrated model parameter sets acquired from two different catchments are similar it is expected that their behavior in response to the transformation of rainfall runoff is similar and 2 it is assumed that a catchment s physical similarity as determined by multiple cds reflects a hydrological similarity between the two from a hydrological standpoint assumption 1 is inescapable it does however have limitations the first of which is the potential of compensations between parameters kokkonen et al 2003 over parameterized models are more susceptible to this issue than other types of models secondly while calibrated parameters represent catchment behavior they can also reveal biases in the data used to calculate them andréassian et al 2004 2001 oudin et al 2006 every regionalization study has assumption 2 in summary it assumes that it should be feasible to find specific cds that account for the hydrological catchment behavior given the potential value of various cds in defining catchments hydrological response it is necessary to ascertain which cds are most appropriate wagener et al 2007 particularly for regionalization purposes blöschl 2005 this study aims to identify which gauged catchment s are hydrologically most similar to the ungauged target catchment in order to find out how much readily available cds explain catchment hydrological behavior and hence which are the best donors of model parameters thus employing the relevant cds to establish an appropriate similarity between gauged and ungauged catchments apparent similarity a better presentation of the hydrologic similarity hs can be guaranteed this assumption is similar to those considered by falkenmark and chapman 1989 sivapalan 2009 and oudin et al 2010 by analyzing different catchments located in different climate regions a framework for identifying the most relevant controls can be developed several studies have been conducted in the literatures that have considered this hypothesis and yielded interesting results for example in a comprehensive study parajka et al 2013 reviewed many studies on a wide range of regionalization approaches and concluded that it is easier to simulate streamflow in larger catchments than in smaller ones and in humid catchments as to compared to dry ones in 913 french catchments oudin et al 2008 conclude that cds climatic physiographic and topographic may vary by region and obtaining a unique cd or consistent set of cds to define hs between donor and target catchment may not be possible they determined that in another study that there is a high overlap between apparent physical and behavioral hydrological similarity for 60 of french and uk catchments oudin et al 2010 in 83 catchments across the united states singh et al 2014 concluded that the optimal cds for defining hydrologic similarity differ by region with physical climatic characteristics identified as the most relevant cds for transferring hydrologic model parameters they also concluded that regional analysis of regionalization approaches can aid in identifying the most relevant controls on parameter transfer for each hydro climate region unlike earlier pub research merz and blöschl 2004 oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2005 patil and stieglitz 2015 zhang and chiew 2009 we identified a case of highest performance of transferred model parameters between gauged donor catchment and ungauged target catchments regardless of spatial distance climatic type and or physical properties best donor case bd the term behavioral similarity is referred to this despite two earlier comprehensive investigations of model transferability in iran jahanshahi et al 2022 jahanshahi et al 2021 this can serve as a baseline or reference score for interpreting model transferability when apparent similarity exists we conduct a comprehensive analysis on two scales of a climate regions regional and b throughout iran local the similarity index si is constructed based on a variety of combinations of a dynamic climate and b static physiographic and land use cds in physical similarity ps regionalization method spatial proximity sp is also implemented to see if it might be used as an alternative for ps where there is no apparent physical similarity between catchments the geographical distance gd between gauged and ungauged catchments is employed as a similarity metric for parameter set transfer in this method e g yang et al 2020a jahanshahi et al 2021 thus the degree of relevance of each cds to regionalization is determined in this study as the first and most comprehensive study on identifying the main controls on hs at the national scale of iran this study aims to answer three main questions a do apparent physical similar catchments have a similar hydrological behavior b which metric or metrics cause the high performance of hs parameter transfer approaches physical climatic geographical or a combination of the three c is dominant control s on the transferring of hydrologic model parameters the same across different types of climate regions our innovation in this study are a we moved beyond a variety of single and groups of dynamic climate and static physiographic land use and geographical distance catchment descriptors to establish the optimal case s of hydrologic similarity in terms of parameter transfer performance and then compared it to the highest performance case of parameter transfer this is beneficial because it connects complex catchment responses to relevant catchment descriptors and b we also used information about streamflow signature runoff ratio to interpret parameter transfer results 2 study area model and dataset 2 1 study area iran is our study area according to the de martonne classification system de martonne 1926 jahanshahi et al 2021 iran is divided into four major climate regions the country s climate varies greatly ranging from a humid and semi humid maritime climate along the caspian sea coast to arid and semi arid climates in the interior annual and seasonal rainfall in iran is highly variable with mean annual precipitation map ranging from 360 mm in the middle regions to more than 2000 mm in the north mean 724 mm irimo 2018 this substantial difference in regional variability of precipitation is most noticeable between the country s north northwest west and central regions from 400 to 2000 mm in iran s mountainous regions altitude has a significant effect on the rainfall and runoff hydrographs show quite distinct spatial patterns iem 2018 2 2 tuw model the tuw model was developed by viglione and parajka 2019 as a semi distributed version of the hbv model bergström 1976 it consists of three routines snow soil moisture and flow response and routing with 15 parameters ceola et al 2015 parajka et al 2007 the model treats the elevation zones as discrete entities that contribute to the total output flow in their own right daily precipitation air temperature and potential evapotranspiration are used as inputs fig 1 finally based on the sub catchment areas the different outputs from the elevation zones are averaged neri et al 2020 parajka et al 2007 and ceola et al 2015 respectively provide more details on the model structure and use in r 2 3 forcing data data from the iran meteorological organization irimo irimo 2018 and the iran energy ministry iem iem 2018 is used to create a daily precipitation time series for all catchments the idw and elevation idew technique was used to estimate rainfall fields from point measurements measured at gauge locations in this dataset the idew is an interpolation approach that also allows for the possibility of defining elevation weighting along with the distance weighting making it more suitable for mountainous regions of iran where topographic influences on precipitation are important more details are presented in jahanshahi et al 2021 and masih et al 2011 and masih et al 2010 a regression based approach and elevation as an explanatory variable was used to construct daily temperature time series from irimo iem data the hargreaves method is used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration based on maximum minimum and average temperatures hargreaves et al 1985 missing values in the data sets were estimated using the regression method which relies on values from nearby gauges to calculate the missed records the temperature data from nearby gauges were correlated well enough to be used r2 0 89 in the case of precipitation data the correlation is r2 0 85 for all 576 catchments 6 3 and 9 4 of the temperature and precipitation data respectively required to be filled as depicted in fig 2 the climatic variables of the 576 study catchments were assessed between 1993 and 2012 precipitation temperature pet and snow cover percentage in the study catchments are all subject to some variations between the calibration and validation periods the validation period is slightly drier than the calibration period the annual mean of four climate variables in the research catchments analyzed using hubert s segmentation approach shows no trend or change point from 1993 to 2012 thus the four variables have inter annual fluctuation annual mean values of climate variables for four climate regions are shown in table 1 for the years 1993 2012 2 4 catchment dataset a set of 576 unregulated catchments with a total area of about 407 000 km2 are selected for this study these are the same catchments that used in our previous study jahanshahi et al 2021 the catchment area ranging from 64 7 km2 to 8 432 km2 and a median of 496 km2 there is a decline in the catchment area as one moves from humid to arid environments with the lowest and highest median values occurring in the humid and arid regions respectively table 2 the distribution of meteorological and hydrometric measuring gauges number and distribution per unit area worsens from wet to dry land use digital maps modis land cover product aquifers map iran energy ministry map global soil map based on the fao map and the major geological formations 1 250000 map of usgs are used these digitized maps are merged with catchment boundaries to determine soil type land use type aquifer area and geological unit the study catchments have a continuous daily streamflow time series from water year wy 1992 to 2012 i e september 22 1992 to september 21 2012 all discharge data for all catchments are carefully screened and outliers are removed table 1 summarizes the median values of cds for all 576 study catchments there are correlations between cds for 576 study catchments but most of these correlations are not strong a heatmap of the spearman rank correlations among cds is presented in fig 3 we split the timeline from wy 1993 to 2012 into the following two calibration and validation periods wy 1993 2008 is calibration period and wy 2008 2012 is validation period wy 1992 1993 is used for model warm up fig 4 depicts the locations and classifications of 576 study catchments into four climate regions for each climate region the median cd values are shown in table 2 3 methodology 3 1 strategies to begin the best donor catchment our baseline scenario is selected based on the highest nse value after each catchment is considered in turn as an ungauged target catchment out of 576 catchments while the other catchments are considered a donor 576 1 575 catchments best donor case or behavioral similarity and then the effectiveness of two following strategies termed as apparent similarity in prediction of ungauged catchments is evaluated by comparing them to the best donor case this is the hypothesis that is used in the study to show the differences between parameter transfer methods to clarify the degree of hydrological similarity the following are two strategies strategy 1 using physical similarity ps method tables 3 and 4 scenarios 1 through 20 to select physically similar catchments in terms of 11 selected cds see table 3 potential donor catchments are ranked by ps for each ungauged catchment based on the following a each individual cd rankings and b the sum of the 11 cds rankings strategy 2 using the nearest neighbor nn method to prioritize donor catchments for model parameter transferring to target catchments table 5 experiments 1 through 4 the geographical distance between gauged and ungauged catchments is used in this strategy 3 2 evaluate the consistency of measured hydrological and physical similarities we examine strategy 1 in this section we assess a methodology to evaluate the consistency of the measured hydrological and physical similarities for regionalization based on the assumptions described by oudin et al 2010 here we first establish metric that measure physical and hydrological similarities 3 2 1 measuring the hydrological similarity to define the hs we compared the outlines of two types of models 1 a model with locally calibrated parameters gauged catchment and 2 a model with parameters estimated by calibration on another donor to target ungauged catchment in terms of i catchment descriptors ps and ii the highest nse values in parameter transfer regardless cds best donor case bd parameter transferability can be used to define hs oudin et al 2010 transferring whole parameter sets are preferred to the individual parameters in order to eliminate interactions between parameters mcintyre et al 2005 the ability of parameter sets to simulate streamflow can be taken into account to select hydrologically similar catchments to this end if the model s efficiency on ungauged catchment obtained by the model using the parameters estimated by calibration on gauged catchment is greater than 0 7 of model s efficiency estimated in the bd case on ungauged catchment the gauged catchment is considered as hydrologically similar to ungauged catchment this is our study assumption section 4 3 the value of 0 7 is appointed based on the difference between calibration results and ps achieved after the initial implementation of the parameter transfers thus our assumption is that this distinction was examined in two ways 1 if the difference between calibration and ps is less than 30 and 2 if the difference in performance between ps and bd is less than 30 the performance of hydrologically behavioral similar catchments is considered good oudin et al 2010 adopted the value of 10 in their study 3 2 2 measuring the physical similarity we employ the methodology by kay et al 2007 to measure the ps between catchments in which euclidean distance is used to define the similarity in cds space and cd values are normalized by their standard deviation over the entire catchment set here we considered the following weighting of cds 1 dis t a b j 1 j w j x a j x b j σ x j 2 where j indicates one of a total of j cds xa j is the value of that cd at the a th catchment σx j is the standard deviation of the cd across the entire catchment set and wj is the weight attributed to the jth cd to begin distances involving only one cd were tested i e by setting the weights of the other descriptors to zero following that weights were considered to be identical for all cds as is common in pub studies e g oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2005 last the weights were optimized to maximize the overlap between physically similar catchments and hydrologically similar catchments oudin et al 2010 for the optimization more than 3000 wt combinations were tested reflecting every possible combination with weights ranging from zero to unity with an increment of 0 1 and the sum of the weights being equal to unity we assessed the relevance of eleven physical similarity measures based on eq 1 to evaluate the consistency of physical and hydrological similarity for all cds all weights are set to zero except one that is only one cd is used to assess the physical similarity between the target catchment and the other catchments this set of combinations tests the relevance of each cd in determining hs then we employed multiple cds simultaneously in eq 1 to find the set of cds that produced the highest degree of hs by repeating the process we eventually identified the scenarios table 4 three sets of catchments are determined here as follows 1 a group of catchments that are the most physically similar to each catchment considered in turn consider physical cousin by oudin et al 2010 this group is determined using distance calculation eq 1 the number of catchments in this group is n 478 2 those catchments that produce the highest nse values in bd are likely to be hydrologically similar catchments hydrological cousin the number of catchments in this group is n 437 the overlap between these two sets indicates the ability of the cds to identify the catchments that are hydrologically similar our assumption 3 a group of catchments that are the most spatially similar to each catchment considered in turn spatial cousin the number of catchments in this group is n 494 it s worth mentioning that we incorporate the nn method into the oudin et al 2010 methodology to do so we employed both ps and nn to calculate the hs allowing us to compare the two methods more closely the ps considers individual cds the nn considers different gd between donor and target catchments and the optimum option for each is then compared to the calibration and bd cases compare three approaches to achieve the best solution for model parameter transfer a detailed stepwise implementation of all processes and parameter transfers strategies are presented in fig 5 4 results 4 1 model performance for calibration period at site we used from calibrated parameters estimated in our previous study jahanshahi et al 2021 the median nse values of calibration period 1993 2008 for all 576 gauged were greater than 0 5 the results indicate that the model performs better in wetter catchments than it does in drier ones these findings generally corroborated those of oudin et al 2008 in france and parajka et al 2005 in austria in fig 6 the 576 catchments model performance is shown as a regional distribution according to the model s performance in the northwestern northern and inner western regions of the country they are far superior than the other regions rainfall patterns in interior western and southeast catchments vary in amplitude making streamflow modeling more complex when it comes to model performance highland catchments typically outperform lowland ones 4 2 relating similarity index with transfer performance throughout iran local and climate regions regional we investigate the effect of similarity in catchment descriptors and geographical distance on successful parameter transfer hydrological similarity transferring the best parameter sets between 576 catchments results in 993 600 575 for three approaches cases about 88 7 of the 993 600 cases produced an nse greater than zero the physical similarity and nearest neighbor methods are compared to identify the main controls on parameter transfer at two different scales climate regions regional and the entire iran local to select the most appropriate approach and quantify its performances the calibration and best donor cases are used as the base case and second base respectively here the ps method employed eleven cds to define catchment similarity when it came to hydrological indices computed in pub studies the most variability was explained by these cds e g arsenault and brissette 2014 he et al 2011 petheram et al 2009 skm 2009 yang et al 2020b yang et al 2018 the median distance between gauged and ungauged catchment pairs is shown in table 3 to test the relevance of each cd in determining hydrologic similarity the relevance of eleven ps measures is assessed based on euclidean distance equation section 3 2 2 in ten of them all weights are set to zero except one implying that only one cd is used to assess the ps between target ungauged catchment and the other catchments this set of combination tests examines the utility of each cd in determining hydrological similarity one such combination is a ps measure that assigns equal weights for all cds therefore potential donor catchments are ranked by ps for each target catchment based on 1 one cd and 2 a combination of eleven cds table 3 when only one cd is used in the similarity equation four appear to be more relevant than the others the aridity index ai mean elevation me catchment area ar agriculture cover agr and rangeland cover rang then comes the pet forest cover and residential cover are the two cds that have the least relevant on the selection of hydrologically similar catchments the low performance of similarity in these two cds could possibly be explained by the more variable forest residential characteristics identified in study catchments however this is hypothesis and more research is needed to discover why forest and residential are ineffective as useful characteristics the median distance between donor and target catchment pairs in terms of both cds and gd groups is shown in table 4 si values for sum of the five best cds are also shown in table 4 at two different scales of local and regional sixteen scenarios are examined to ascertain the dominant controls on successful parameter transfer at two scales see tables 3 and 4 fig 7 illustrates the box plot comparison of the ten best ps scenarios as well as the performance of the nn and bd cases in calibration and validation modes as seen in this fig the best performance for ps is achieved with s15 median nse 0 56 in which ai and me are employed to select most similar donor target catchment pairs followed by s2 decline of 17 4 compared to calibration s6 decline of 19 s7 decline of 22 9 s3 decline of 24 5 s5 decline of 28 5 s4 decline of 30 3 s9 decline of 34 3 s11 decline of 39 7 and s20 decline of 43 8 in general we observed that scenarios based on climatic descriptors aridity index performed better in the ps than scenarios based on topographic me physiographic catchment area and land use catchment percent agriculture descriptors me is chosen as the most prominent topographic descriptor on parameter transfer which is also considered the second dominant control hence generally our findings indicated that when we identified the similarity in climate and me particularly at elevations the results resulted in a more successful parameter transfer than with other cds at the regional scale among four land use descriptors examined in ps table 3 the use of catchment percent agricultural and rangeland in define similarity resulted in improved parameter transfer performance the performance ranking of cds in validation mode is similar to that in calibration mode although the difference in performance is significant scenarios 15 and 20 are selected as the best and worst respectively this finding reveals that moving between periods calibration to validation considerably impairs the performance of both transfer methods this conclusion is consistent with pub studies e g jahanshahi et al 2022 2021 oudin et al 2008 patil and stieglitz 2015 petheram et al 2009 zhang and chiew 2009 as expected the best strategy is bd median nse 0 65 its difference from s15 the best scenario in ps is 6 62 for calibration and 2 53 for validation the nn median nse 0 5 is chosen as the third worst strategy this results demonstrated that the gd has a more influence on parameter transfer than temporal gap this effect was significantly enhanced in validation mode significantly impairing the nn performance as a result the nn performance is reduced by 32 12 when compared to bd performance reduces 23 46 for calibration mode this overall finding is consistence with patil and stieglitz 2015 at 294 catchments across us the main reason for the relatively poor performance of the nn is that the median distance between catchment centroids is relatively large greater than 71 km which means that selecting donor target catchment pairs on the basis of sp method will provide no better results than using the ps and bd methods the climatic differences between the calibration and validation periods could also contribute to performance decline from calibration to validation it is a little wetter during the calibration 1993 2008 period than during the validation 2008 2012 period see table 1 the box plots of controls on parameter transfer for wet humid and semi humid and dry arid and semi arid catchments are shown in fig 8 for wet catchments in calibration mode s16 where aridity index and catchment area are used to select most similar donor target catchment pairs produced the best results followed by s7 decline of 17 9 compared to calibration s2 decline of 19 6 s6 decline of 22 6 s3 decline of 26 7 s9 decline of 30 8 s20 decline of 32 4 s5 decline of 36 4 s4 decline of 36 6 s11 decline of 42 8 the cds performance ranking is kept in validation mode just like it is in calibration mode the best and worst results for arid and semi arid regions are obtained using s19 and s20 respectively the spatial distribution of catchments where five best ps scenarios at both regional and local scales are shown in fig 9 left we found that similarity in cds from three categories climate ai topographic me and slope and physiographic area are required for successful parameter transfers in humid and semi humid regions 455 parameter transfers the very northwestern and northern humid catchments as well as northern coastline at southern fringe of caspian sea similarity in agriculture land use is added to those for two aforementioned climate regions for successful parameter transfer in arid and semi arid regions 121 parameter transfers the northeastern and middle mountains as well as middle and southeastern plains as a result for arid region the only land use descriptor used to judge the effectiveness of a parameter transfer for 1 04 of catchments n 6 is similarity in catchment percent agriculture s19 this means that land use descriptors do not have as much of an impact on parameter transfer as climatic topographic and physiographic descriptors which have the most potential for determining parameter transfer similarities the results of singh et al 2014 in 83 catchments across the us show a high potential for successful parameter transfer based on similarities in climate and topographical characteristics they found that similarity in percentage of agriculture has the most potential for parameter transfer for humid and semi humid catchments of the plains our overall findings do not support this conclusion similarity in elevation was found to be the most important control on parameter transfer for humid and semi humid plateaus in their study which is consistent with our high altitude catchments in humid and semi humid regions pet and me are the most relevant controls on a successful parameter transfer in semi arid mountains and plateaus across the us whereas area aridity index and me have the largest impact in our study beyond this other cds do not provide any more useful information in semi arid region s20 similarity in percentage of rangeland was only able to successfully transfer parameters for one catchment we also considered the role of the runoff ratio in determining whether or not a parameters transfer was successful not in similarity for ps the runoff ratio values were found for humid and semi humid regions where parameter transfer is most facilitated by similarity in climatic and topographic characteristics in contrast lower runoff ratio values for arid and semi arid regions drier catchments demonstrates how all four cd types come together to determine the successful of parameters transfer table 4 tables s19 and s20 fig 9 right illustrates the performance of bd in catchments classified as 1 0 4 0 6 2 0 6 0 8 and 3 0 8 by comparing the catchment distribution in the right and left panels of fig 9 we found that the strong performance of s15 s2 and s7 is consistent with the performance of the bd case particularly in humid and semi humid regions this finding revealed that similarity in aridity index and mean elevation plays a significant role in determining hydrological similarity for these wet catchments the s6 and s19 performs relatively well in terms of compliance with two moderate categories of bd 0 4 0 6 and 0 6 0 8 when compared to other scenarios for drier catchments of semi arid and arid regions this finding confirms that the catchment area and agriculture cover are both high relevant cds in the selection of hydrologically similar catchments among these two groups catchments 4 3 evaluating the overlap in physical similarity by blending the catchment descriptors the selection of hydrologically similar catchments improves remarkably when the cds are blended by using their combinations tables 3 and 4 as a result the s15 combination had the best overall performance throughout iran to better understand the role of ps in hs performance we investigate i the difference between calibration best case and ps s15 fig 10 left and ii the overlap between ps and bd second best case fig 10 right we organized the catchments into four groups based on this overlap 1 90 2 70 90 3 50 70 and 50 the results showed that when these categories are considered the overlap is greater than 70 for more than 75 n 431 of the catchments implying that 1 physically apparently similar catchments have a high similar hydrological behavior and 2 the cds in s15 aridity index and me are able to define hydrological behavioral similarity well on the basis of transferability of model parameters fig 10 right out of these 431 catchments 307 71 were wet and 124 29 were dry we also found that the smaller gap between calibration and ps is associated with wetter high altitude catchments in humid and semi humid regions where the aridity index and me are most relevant controls in selecting hydrologically similar catchments fig 10 left two possible reasons for reduction the overlap 50 for 9 n 53 of catchments are 1 the lack of cds that would potentially increase overlap between two hydrological and similar cousins e g groundwater and geologic and 2 the lack of hydrological cousins for some ungauged catchments most of these catchments are located in semi arid and arid very southwestern middle and southeastern plains as well as semi humid middle western and eastern catchments regions which have drier climatic conditions 4 4 evaluation of spatial proximity to calculate catchment similarity the gd between the donor and target catchment is employed as an attribute in the nn approach because of the wide range of climate heterogeneity in iran it is necessary to determine the optimal distance between the centroids of donor target catchment pairs in order to maximize the spatial transfer of parameter sets in order to acquire the most accurate results the nn is used in four experiments to achieve this goal a distance d less than 20 km b d 40 km c d 60 km and d d 90 km are defined as donor target catchment pairs in these experiments results of these experiments are summarized in table 5 rows 1 to 4 fig 11 shows the nses of these experiments in box plots in both calibration and validation modes as shown in fig 11 significant differences occur between the results of experiments and the nn method when compared to nn the performance of e1 0 to 20 km increased by 25 37 and 32 75 for calibration and validation modes respectively table 5 shows that more than half of the study catchments about 63 n 362 are within a distance of 0 to 90 km the gd was subsequently broken into five smaller spatial distances and the nn was re implement under them these new spatial distances are as follows 1 0 10 km 2 10 20 km 3 20 30 km 4 30 40 km and 5 0 68 km table 5 rows 5 to 9 our goal is to conduct a more precise investigation of the optimal gd in the nn method then compare the optimal results to the performance related modifications of blending the cds in defining similarity for ps comparing ps and nn reveals that while the nn performs worse than the ps changing the gd between the donor target catchment pairs has a more complex effect on performance than cd combinations no further details are provided and the optimal gd for model parameter transfer lies between 0 and 10 km n 14 5 discussion we find interesting differences in physical physical similarity method and spatial nearest neighbor method controls on model parameter transfer when investigating our dataset spanning iran local and when dividing it into climate regions regional to investigate the cds geographical distance performance link to transfer parameter sets between the 576 unregulated catchments we apply three strategies ps nn and best donor best donor with highest nse value previous pub studies in iran have not directly made this comparison parameters transfer was successful when employing nse as it was in pub studies chouaib et al 2018 merz and blöschl 2004 oudin et al 2010 2008 parajka et al 2005 zhang and chiew 2009 jahanshahi et al 2021 although the main aim of pub studies was to simulate in ungauged catchment the success of these simulations was not attributed to the catchment descriptors input combinations for ps the main controls for parameter transfer throughout iran the local scale are climate and topographic followed by physiographic other pub studies have found that the importance of i climatic gradients chouaib et al 2018 sawicz et al 2014 ii topographic price 2011 and iii land use form climate descriptors and geologic structure winter 2001 wolock et al 2004 across the usa our results agree with their finding though we also found that climate physiographic and land use are major controls on parameter transfer at regional semi arid and arid regions where that catchments have similar energy conditions and are water limited as well as local scales according to singh et al 2014 climate is not the most relevant control on parameter transfer in humid regions across the us but physical attributes and land used patterns are most dominant their conclusion contradicts our findings me on the other hand was chosen as an important secondary control in mountainous catchments in humid and semi humid regions where energy limited conditions are prevalent the study catchments have high elevation highest variation on elevation the highest percentage slope and largest percentage of land covered by forest see table 2 we can assume that this highly variable topography is associated with a variable climate gradient the difference between our study and a previous regional study in 903 catchments in france and uk by oudin et al 2010 is that 1 we did not seek to find the number n of hydrologically similar catchments instead we compared the most physically similar catchment to the best donor case to determine the overlap percentage and hydrological similarity accuracy and 2 the study models are different hbv versus gr4j and topmo our results demonstrated that more than 75 of our physically similar catchments have a hydrological similarity with a substantial overlap more than 70 whereas only 60 of the hydrologically similar catchments are physically similar in general the following controls appear in sequence when classifying the performance of parameter transfer based on all tested options 1 spatial distance for gd 10 km 2 climate topographic physiographic and land use characteristics therefore geographically similar catchments are found to be more hydrologically similar than physically similar catchments only for gd less than 10 km implying that the ps method provides useful information for spatial distances more than 10 km in comparison to wetter catchments our findings imply that physiographic catchment area and land use percentage of agriculture and rangeland area descriptors are prevalent in drier catchments the overall performance of model transferability corroborated the general pattern of humid catchments outperforming dry catchments observed in the pub reviewed studies of parajka et al 2013 to understand the results more accurately between climate regions we entered the runoff ratio streamflow signature see table 4 we concluded that the catchments with higher runoff ratio have better calibration and regionalization performance as evidenced by 455 wet catchments 79 humid and semi humid regions out of 576 study catchments where the median nse values for calibration and ps cases range from 0 65 to 0 89 and 0 6 to 0 82 respectively and the runoff ratio ranges from 0 17 to 0 78 median 0 43 the runoff ratio ranges from 0 11 to 0 61 median 0 24 for 121 dry catchments 21 semi arid and arid regions with median nse values for calibration and ps cases ranging from 0 5 to 0 64 and 0 5 to 0 59 respectively see table 4 some model regionalization studies have shown that combining streamflow time series from several parameter sets from a multi donors ensemble generally works better than a single donor framework oudin et al 2008 viney et al 2009 yang et al 2020b however our goal was to identify only one donor catchment physically cousin bd spatially cousin most similar to the target catchment different results from using multi donors should be considered in future investigations 6 conclusions in this study in order to explore the links between apparent physical spatial similarity and hydrological similarity we related i physical similarity in several catchment descriptors cds and ii geographical distance gd to behavioral similarity the highest performance in hydrologic model parameter transfer which is considered the best donor case bd by analyzing the overlap between them our aim is to use a simple strategy to determine the most relevant available cds or gd to explain the behavioral similarity on the basis of hbv model parameter transfer to the ungauged catchment the optimal 1 gd and 2 cds were determined in this strategy by comparing three pools of hydrologically hydrological cousins physically physical cousins and spatially spatial cousins similar catchments defined on the basis of available cds and gd throughout iran and subsequently in smaller climate regions we found that gd is the main control on successful transferability at the scale of entire iran local by overlap analysis between physical similarity and best donor case the geographical distance less than 10 km in nearest neighbor followed by a combination of climate aridity index and topographic mean elevation descriptors in ps are selected as dominant controls on parameters transferability to the ungauged catchment thus most relevant cds guarantee the selection of hydrologically similar catchments for 75 of the ungauged catchments for which the overlap was more than 70 by categorizing catchments into climate regions physiographic catchment area and land use agriculture and rangeland classes descriptors are added to the most relevant spatial controls in almost all catchments all four types of cds topographic climate physiographic and land use emerged as important controls on parameter transferability the runoff ratio functional characteristic revealed that higher values are associated with regions where the climate descriptors are main controls thus in general the shortest gd less than 10 km between donor and target catchment emerged as the most prominent control on parameter transferability this implies that the identifying an appropriate metric of hydrologic similarity depend on the i geographical distance and ii cd type this study had some limitations which will be fascinating topics for future research as discussed here first due to lack of data similarity in geology soil and groundwater characteristics is restricted throughout iran second the number of catchments available in dry regions only 28 catchments were limited third there are some possible sources of uncertainty although uncertainty analysis was not part of this study s scope as well as non stationary climate conditions the main advantage of our study is that it is not possible to consider the similarity only in a particular catchment descriptor or geographical distance at iranian catchments to ensure successful model parameters transfer but we must consider a certain combinations or a wide range of them both cds and geographical distance for different climate regions therefore if we are able to establish that similarity at an optimal geographical distance and with particular characteristics it would provide an appropriate model transferability to strengthen the role of physical similarity parameter transferability further research is needed to identify more relevant lithologic geologic groundwater soil descriptors declaration of competing

3098,bioretention systems have become a leading infiltration based low impact development lid practice to reduce urban stormwater runoff volumes and peak flows although these systems have performed well in many site scale field studies modeling of bioretention systems has received less attention additional studies are needed which calibrate various models to field measurements to investigate and optimize the performance of individual lid practices and effectively scale local interventions to the watershed drainmod urban has been successfully applied to bioretention at the site scale due to its advanced soil water accounting using the soil water characteristic curve and its ability to explicitly model underdrains and internal water storage iws zones at the same time the u s epa stormwater management model swmm has become one of the most widely used urban drainage models the latest version swmm5 included dedicated lid modules including a routine for bioretention modeling in this study drainmod urban and the swmm lid module were compared through detailed analysis of the internal processes of each model as well as through model calibration and output investigation the objective was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each model and compare the performance of both models to a single bioretention cell both swmm and drainmod urban were evaluated in calibrated and uncalibrated scenarios since urban drainage models often remain uncalibrated for planning scenario analysis following calibration drainmod urban was superior for replicating drainage hydrographs nse 0 60 while swmm produced better overflow hydrographs nse 0 57 specifically swmm often output a maximum drainage rate that caused rectangular drainage hydrographs but drainmod urban was better able to match the shape of measured drainage hydrographs while the drainmod urban model output was in good agreement with measured drainage and overflow event volumes when calibrated drainage nse 0 83 overflow nse 0 57 0 66 swmm was closer to measured volumes even when uncalibrated drainage nse 0 70 0 93 overflow nse 0 59 0 81 this study improved existing knowledge of the swmm lid module by calibrating to field collected data from a single bioretention cell for the first time in literature furthermore the results of this study indicate an opportunity for model coupling that could combine the strengths and weaknesses of each model and improve bioretention cell modeling keywords biofilter rain garden stormwater green infrastructure low impact development hydrologic modeling 1 introduction bioretention systems have been widely accepted within the stormwater engineering community due to numerous geographically diverse field studies demonstrating substantial volumetric reductions and generally good pollutant removal tirpak et al 2021 olszewski and davis 2013 brown and hunt 2012 davis et al 2012 brown and hunt 2011 davis 2008 hunt et al 2006 however most bioretention studies have centered on field monitoring and laboratory assessments liu et al 2014 davis et al 2009 computational models have been slower to develop for bioretention systems despite the advantage they provide in quantifying bioretention performance as a function of design prior to implementation specifically bioretention modeling is beneficial to designers by informing bioretention cell design optimizing designs for local conditions and objectives and scaling impacts from a single cell to the larger watershed there are many hydrologic models that have developed tools or routines for bioretention lisenbee et al 2021 low impact development lid models may include bioretention as one of many lid practices but mostly examine lumped performance of lid installations compared to traditional development under uncalibrated and calibrated scenarios kaykhosravi et al 2018 li et al 2017 elliott and trowsdale 2007 often these models focus on runoff volume reduction to describe the performance of bioretention cells however hydrologic pathways within a bioretention cell drainage overflow exfiltration and evapotranspiration should also be evaluated since they play a role in determining the fate of pollutants in bioretention and impact watershed hydrology unfortunately hydrologic pathways are not well represented in many current bioretention models lisenbee et al 2021 underdrains and restrictions to drainage such as internal water storage iws zones are not considered in some models and the hydrologic changes from these features are computationally simplified in other models despite widespread use in field applications lynn et al 2018 liu et al 2014 brown and hunt 2011 further many models use infiltration processes that assume uniform saturation of the media while bioretention systems are variably saturated and unsaturated during and following rain events tu et al 2020 barbu and ballestero 2015 akan 2013 brown et al 2013 finally the hydrologic flow paths in a bioretention model could be calibrated to better represent field measured drainage and overflow from a bioretention cell but these studies have been limited to column studies thus far gülbaz and kazezyılmaz alhan 2017 liu and fassman beck 2017 additional studies are needed to determine how these limitations in model processes may or may not affect the model outcomes the u s epa stormwater management model swmm is one of the most widely used models for bioretention especially since the release of swmm5 which includes dedicated lid modules rossman 2010 swmm has many applications for catchment hydrology provides several methods for hydrologic and hydraulic processes and reports hydrographs from flows in sewers open channels or lid features swmm has been widely applied to watershed studies investigating lumped lid benefits compared to traditional stormwater management bai et al 2018 avellaneda et al 2017 sun et al 2014 mccutcheon and wride 2013 bosley 2008 fewer studies have calibrated swmm to observed total runoff reduction specifically provided by bioretention at the watershed scale bai et al 2018 avellaneda et al 2017 li and lam 2015 rosa et al 2015 however bioretention models must first be evaluated at the site scale to ensure they provide reliable estimations of performance at the watershed scale some studies have focused on performance of a single bioretention cell or rain garden in swmm compared to column or pilot scale studies gülbaz and kazezyılmaz alhan 2017 liu and fassman beck 2017 li and lam 2015 mccutcheon and wride 2013 only a few recent studies have evaluated swmm compared to bioretention cells installed in field but were primarily focused on sensitivity analysis fassman beck and saleh 2021 platz et al 2020 thus evaluation of the swmm lid module performance for site scale bioretention studies is needed to better understand how the model represents internal flow processes of a bioretention cell further studies have compared swmm with other bioretention models such as hydrus 1d tu et al 2020 lynn et al 2018 winslamm tiveron et al 2018 hm rwb gülbaz and kazezyılmaz alhan 2017 recarga sun et al 2011 and hydrocad lucas 2010 these studies have established that swmm is capable of modeling bioretention cells under a variety of conditions but it has limitations such as limited underdrain placement and design simplistic infiltration routines using a bucket model approach and scarce examples of calibration and validation against field lid practices fassman beck and saleh 2021 lisenbee et al 2021 the research herein combined important aspects of each of the aforementioned studies site scale evaluation of the swmm lid module calibration of hydrologic pathways in the swmm lid module using field measured data and comparison of swmm to another promising bioretention model drainmod urban drainmod is an agricultural drainage model that has performed well when applied to urban bioretention systems by addressing some of the limitations of other models related to infiltration modeling and representation of the iws zone winston 2015 hathaway et al 2014 brown et al 2013 another advantage of drainmod is the detailed soil water accounting procedure that estimates water level fluctuations in the cell using the soil water characteristic curve swcc the swcc is a better representation of available pore space in the bioretention cell at various depths compared to the common assumption that storage capacity is simply the difference between water content at saturation and field capacity brown et al 2013 this is important in variably saturated bioretention systems especially those employing iws zones which elevate the internal water level in addition to sophisticated soil moisture accounting the swcc is used in drainmod for determining the volume drained and the green ampt infiltration parameters at various internal water levels within the bioretention cell drainmod urban is a version of drainmod adapted for urban hydrologic response times drainmod urban produces hydrographs at time steps as small as one minute for each hydrologic pathway in the bioretention cell inflow overflow infiltration drainage exfiltration and et drainmod urban has shown good prediction nse 0 60 of observed drainage hydrographs from a bioretention cell lisenbee et al 2020 while drainmod urban appears to be well suited for modeling bioretention it also has some disadvantages compared to swmm swmm has an easy to use graphical user interface gui and graphing functions for built in visualization of outputs conversely drainmod urban outputs text files that must undergo rigorous post processing with an external program furthermore swmm is a watershed scale model that can capture dynamics between catchments sewers hydraulic structures and other bioretention cells upstream and downstream of any given bioretention cell it also incorporates routing procedures to account for travel time and friction losses between these objects at present drainmod urban can only model a single bioretention cell this site scale modeling allows users to evaluate the performance of a specific bioretention cell or design feature whereas watershed scale modeling is useful for determining effects on a larger catchment watershed scale models for bioretention often lump parameters and make simplifications to allow for quick analysis of many contributing factors without cumbersome input requirements to combine the best of these methods site scale models can be incorporated as add in tools for larger watershed models this study addressed the need to understand the performance of the swmm lid module in representing an individual bioretention cell by calibrating swmm to field measured bioretention cell hydrology the resulting model performance was compared with that of drainmod urban evaluating hydrographs produced by each model was important to consider the effect bioretention has on flow dynamics of urban watersheds combined sewer overflow cso mitigation and treatment trains that consist of multiple lid strategies which require accurate hydrographs liu and fassman beck 2017 this study identified strengths and weaknesses of each model s ability to represent event volumes and hydrographs of drainage and overflow pathways in a bioretention cell acknowledging advantages and applications best suited to each model bears potential for combining these strengths in future bioretention modeling efforts 2 material methods 2 1 site description a single site scale model was created in both drainmod urban and swmm and calibrated to the ursuline college uc bioretention cell located near cleveland ohio usa this site was used for previous evaluations of drainmod and drainmod urban performance lisenbee et al 2020 winston 2015 a 3600 m2 drainage area comprised largely of parking lot 77 impervious produced stormwater runoff that entered the uc cell which had a surface area of 182 m2 fig 1 the bioretention media layer 60 cm in the uc cell was 87 sand 4 silt and 9 clay according to sieve analysis astm 2007 the uc cell had a 30 cm ponding zone that was topped with a 7 5 cm layer of mulch below the bioretention media was a choking sand layer 15 cm and a gravel storage layer 30 cm which contained an underdrain with an upturned elbow creating a 60 cm deep iws zone fig 2 the bioretention media was not expected to experience clogging or compaction over the monitoring period due to recent construction a forebay to collect fine sediment entering the cell and the growth of vegetation and roots precipitation was measured on site with a tipping bucket rain gauge at 1 minute intervals inflow to the uc cell was unable to be directly measured on site so catchment properties were entered into swmm to model an inflow hydrograph that was used in both swmm and drainmod urban models the combined drainage and overflow were measured with a 60 degree sharp crested v notch weir and a bubbler flow module attached to an isco 6712 sampler that collected data every two minutes fig 1 drainage and overflow were separated in swmm using a rating curve based on the internal water level winston et al 2016 a total of 12 drainage events and four overflow events were measured over the seven month monitoring period additionally volumetric soil moisture was measured in the uc cell using time domain reflectometer tdr probes at 15 30 60 and 90 cm depths fig 1 the 15 and 30 cm depths described the bioretention media whereas the 60 and 90 cm depths described moisture in the iws and sand gravel storage zones 2 2 model description both drainmod urban and swmm are long term continuous simulation models which account for antecedent moisture conditions swmm also has the benefit of being applicable to the larger urban watershed employing routing procedures such as the kinematic wave equation which accounts for runoff travel time to the bioretention cell the routing procedures in swmm also allow for outflow to be routed to another lid component or pipe network downstream to allow direct comparison to drainmod urban the bioretention lid module in swmm was evaluated as its own subwatershed this reduced the swmm model to a single bioretention cell similar to drainmod urban and provided valuable analysis of the capabilities of the lid module for bioretention cell modeling before modeling these bioretention cells in swmm the governing equations used for various hydrologic pathways in swmm and drainmod urban were compared in the following sections for specific model inputs see table 4 more information on model processes can be found in model documentation rossman and huber 2016 drainmod 6 1 help file 2013 skaggs et al 2012 and the bioretention modeling review paper lisenbee et al 2021 2 2 1 inflow swmm was used to model a continuous runoff hydrograph from the catchment area at 1 min intervals for drainmod urban this runoff hydrograph was entered as inflow to the bioretention cell without modification in the swmm simulations the same method was used to determine bioretention inflow with the addition of a potential evapotranspiration pet file using the penman monteith method which reduced the inflow to the bioretention cell by 10 2 2 2 overflow drainmod urban has a surface storage input that represents the bioretention ponding zone if ponding exceeds this level then overflow is equal to the sum of direct precipitation on the bioretention cell and inflow minus infiltration swmm includes a ponding zone denoted berm height in the lid module for bioretention but also includes a vegetation volume fraction to account for the space that vegetation occupies in the ponding zone overflow is calculated in swmm as the water level above a maximum freeboard for each given timestep 2 2 3 evapotranspiration both drainmod urban and swmm accept user input pet but drainmod urban can also calculate pet using the thornthwaite method in drainmod urban pet is used to represent et from the system when soil water is not limiting if et is limited by soil water conditions then et is equal to the upward flux of water as a function of internal water level determined from the swcc soil input when this upward flux is not enough to meet et demand water is removed from the root zone in swmm et is calculated for the surface soil and storage layers consecutively such that any remaining pet is available to the subsequent layer the surface et is calculated as the minimum of the pet and the ponding depth at a given timestep the et from the soil layer is calculated from the moisture content and the depth of the soil both the soil and storage et are set to zero when surface infiltration is occurring 2 2 4 infiltration the green ampt method was used to represent surface infiltration through the bioretention cell in swmm and drainmod urban this method is a simplification of richards equation which employs certain assumptions such as one dimensional vertical flow and total saturation behind a sharp wetting front these assumptions are not always valid in bioretention cells which operate under variably saturated and unsaturated conditions for the lid module in swmm the green ampt equation was adjusted to account for ponding depth which is an important component of bioretention cells drainmod urban requires the user to input the swcc of the bioretention media to account for variable soil moisture this is especially important for cells with an iws zone where the internal water level may be close to the surface the swcc provides a more detailed relationship between moisture content fluctuations and depth to the internal water level than traditional methods of assuming an initial moisture deficit which is the procedure used in swmm brown et al 2013 this was especially true when the water level was close to the surface as it often is in a bioretention cell during a storm event for swmm infiltration capacity recovery is modeled using the hydraulic conductivity in green ampt instead of a soil accounting method like drainmod urban bosley 2008 swmm assumes all soil moisture is evenly distributed throughout the soil layer rossman and huber 2016 which may not be an appropriate assumption barbu and ballestero 2015 drainmod urban and swmm require different inputs although they both employ the green ampt equation table 4 to estimate infiltration parameters the swmm reference manual provides a table of suggested bioretention soil parameters based on sand loamy sand and sandy loam soil textures using the spaw model rossman and huber 2016 saxton and rawls 2006 in drainmod infiltration parameters are derived automatically from the measured swcc entered in the model but they can be adjusted manually if desired skaggs et al 2012 overall deriving infiltration parameters from a measured swcc is hypothesized to improve infiltration estimation in drainmod urban compared to swmm which does not require sophisticated soil characteristic parameterization but instead relies on empirical estimation based on soil texture 2 2 5 percolation after the initial surface infiltration percolation refers to flow through soil layers within the bioretention cell drainmod urban employs the green ampt parameters derived from the swcc and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat for each soil layer in the model are used to find an effective ksat keff at each time step based on the internal water table depth in swmm darcy s law is used to simulate percolation through subsequent soil layers in the bioretention cell this is applied in the same manner as swmm s groundwater routine using the coefficient hco to describe the exponential decrease in hydraulic conductivity with decreasing moisture content rossman and huber 2016 the equation used for the percolation rate through each soil layers is 1 f 2 k sat e h c o ϕ θ where ksat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil layer hco is the conductivity slope ϕ is the soil porosity and θ is the soil moisture if the native soil layer is saturated the percolation is limited to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bioretention media if the moisture content of the soil layer falls below field capacity then the percolation rate is set to zero rossman and huber 2016 2 2 6 drainage drainmod urban represents drainage in bioretention systems fig 3 using the hooghoudt equation eqn 2 that accounts for flow convergence near drains 2 q 4 k e m 2 d e m l 2 where q is the drainage rate cm h m is the midpoint water level above the drain ke is the equivalent lateral hydraulic conductivity of the profile cm h de is the equivalent depth from the drain to the restrictive layer cm and l is the drain spacing cm drainmod urban s soil moisture accounting is also used to estimate the change in internal water level when water begins to pond on the soil surface and the soil is fully saturated the kirkham equation 1957 is used to calculate drainage instead of the hooghoudt equation skaggs et al 2012 however the drainage rate could be limited by other hydraulic constraints which are accounted for through the drainage coefficient parameter which sets the maximum drainage capacity drainmod urban also provides a controlled drainage option that uses weir settings to control drawdown in the bioretention cell and represent an iws zone a common design in practice swmm can model underdrains in the lid module but the drainage inputs required are not measurable quantities and the drain advisor that assists users in determining the correct values for these inputs is limited in scope epa swmm help file 5 1 2017 according to the swmm lid user manual swmm models the underdrain using an empirical power law weir equation unless the maximum drainage rate is reached 3 q c d h η where q is the drainage rate ft s h is the hydraulic head ft cd is the underdrain discharge coefficient and η is the underdrain discharge exponent rossman and huber 2016 the hydraulic head on the underdrain is defined by the offset height which is an input in the lid module drainage does not begin until the water level in the storage layer reaches the drain offset height the maximum drainage limit is equal to the drainage coefficient as represented in drainmod urban if the exponent is set to zero if the underdrain is not limiting the hydraulics the drainage coefficient can be any number larger than the ksat in this case the drainage rate is equal to the rate of percolation entering the underdrain from the adjoining soil layer minus the seepage rate as long as the maximum drainage limit represented by the drainage coefficient is not reached other drainage restrictions can be incorporated by adjusting the drainage exponent to 0 5 to represent the standard orifice equation rossman and huber 2016 under this scenario the drainage coefficient can be used to represent slotted pipes that act as orifices or an orifice at the outlet of the underdrain these adjustments to equation 3 offer more flexibility in how the drainage hydraulics are calculated by considering multiple drains valves cap orifices slotted pipes etc which are not considered in many bioretention models however an upturned elbow for creation of an iws zone is one drainage configuration that is still not readily modeled in the swmm lid module one study has shown how to represent an elevated outlet in swmm by creating a rating curve using hydrus to represent both unsaturated zones and saturated sections of the bioretention media lynn et al 2018 however this study was conducted using the original swmm framework ours is the first published study to model an iws zone in the swmm5 lid module using the following model setup in the swmm lid module the soil layer or bioretention media can only be placed above the storage layer and the underdrain is typically placed at the top of the storage layer in this study for comparison to drainmod urban the cell configuration had to be adjusted in swmm to account for storage available in the iws zone the storage layer depth was input as the depths of gravel and sand layers 45 cm and the depth of bioretention media remained at 60 cm for this study the underdrain was placed at the top of the iws zone 60 cm above the bottom of cell to accommodate the proper underdrain invert elevation therefore the underdrain was placed in the soil layer 15 cm above the storage layer to match as built conditions fig 2 this representation of the iws zone in swmm is simplified to fit within the constraints of the lid module i e using an elevated underdrain instead of an upturned elbow configuration we anticipate increased use of swmm for iws bioretention designs because iws is becoming a standard design in some states and swmm is a prominent bioretention modeling tool ncdeq 2020 studying model behavior with this iws setup will demonstrate the best possible model outcomes using the model as is and highlight areas for improvement in the lid module updating the swmm model to address iws is paramount to broaden the scope of bioretention practices that can be modeled using swmm 2 2 7 exfiltration in swmm exfiltration from the bottom of the storage layer into the underling soil is simply set to a user supplied saturated hydraulic conductivity of the underlying soil drainmod urban uses darcy s law with the dupuit forchheimer assumptions to calculate vertical seepage at the transition from the storage layer to the underlying soil drainmod urban also requires seepage inputs such as the piezometric head of the aquifer the thickness of the restricting layer and the vertical conductivity of the restricting layer which are often used as calibration parameters since they are difficult to measure 2 3 modeling methods 2 3 1 inputs understanding model inputs aids the user in determining if the model utilizes mechanistic or empirical functions to estimate bioretention hydrology furthermore the complexity and number of required inputs can discourage use of a model especially for designers that are less familiar with hydrologic modeling or have limited access to descriptive data for the system lisenbee et al 2021 the right balance must be struck between accurately representing the system and reducing the effort required to measure or estimate inputs swmm requires fewer inputs than drainmod urban but more inputs are simply estimated with guidance from the model or left as defaults table 1 we described estimated inputs as those using model defaults or documentation whereas measured inputs come from field or laboratory testing of site specific properties soil properties play a big role in both bioretention models in swmm a total of 15 inputs are required for the lid module and six of these are soil parameters table 4 drainmod urban has fewer estimated parameters than swmm but requires more detailed collection of soil characteristics such as the swcc and hydraulic conductivity of each layer which require extensive laboratory testing tables 1 4 2 3 2 calibration parameters the calibration parameters used in drainmod urban were the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the bioretention media ksat of the sand layer the drainage coefficient the piezometric head of the aquifer and the thickness of the restricting layer table 2 the calibration parameters used in swmm were ksat and soil suction of the bioretention media the conductivity slope hco the void ratio of the storage layer and the seepage rate table 2 the ksat was sensitive in both drainmod urban and swmm to the amount of infiltration allowed through the bioretention cell the void ratio for the storage layer and the soil suction also affected the infiltration in swmm but were not as sensitive as ksat the parameters that controlled the exfiltration from the bioretention cell were the piezometric head of the aquifer and the thickness of the restricting layer in drainmod urban and the seepage rate in swmm there were two unique calibration parameters the drainage coefficient and the hco parameter the initial drainage coefficient in drainmod urban was increased to avoid restricting drain flow since measured hydrographs did not show any evidence of drainage restriction for comparison the same was done in swmm the hco parameter is suggested to fall in the range of 30 to 60 based on its soil texture epa swmm help file 5 1 2017 several studies have shown much smaller hco values than suggested by swmm documentation in bioretention simulations lynn et al 2018 liu and fassman beck 2017 rosa et al 2015 therefore although the hco was calculated to be 49 4 based on swmm recommendations several smaller hco values ranging from 7 to 60 were tested during calibration 2 3 3 calibration process when calibrating both models to measured drainage and overflow hydrographs it was important to simultaneously evaluate the effect of calibration on event and total volumes sometimes these processes couple such that calibrating hydrographs also improves event volumes however an attempt to match volumes sometimes distorts the hydrograph shape lisenbee et al 2020 therefore calibrations were performed to optimize fit to either hydrographs hydrograph calibrated or volumes volume calibrated in drainmod urban and swmm results for model performance for matching both hydrographs and volume were recorded regardless of the output being optimized an additional assessment was completed to document performance of each model in an uncalibrated state which is the way bioretention models are commonly used in practice for preliminary design analysis due to limited data availability or modeling experience we believe that the uncalibrated scenario was valuable to provide insight on the model performance in cases where calibration data may be constrained this process resulted in three calibration states for each model uncalibrated volume calibrated and hydrograph calibrated optimization of modeled volumes and hydrographs was determined using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias as goodness of fit tests other statistics such as the index of agreement d its relative error counterparts d1 and the relative nse e1 were calculated as supplements to the nse and pbias during calibration moriasi et al 2007 after these statistics were used to narrow the number of viable scenarios drainage and overflow hydrographs were visually inspected and characteristics such as peak flow time to peak and event duration were compared these assessments aided in determining a final hydrograph calibrated simulation for the uc cell 3 results discussion 3 1 drainmod urban performance 3 1 1 hydrographs when calibrating drainmod urban to measured hydrographs hydrograph calibration good performance was achieved with nse 0 60 for drainage hydrographs at a 2 minute timestep table 3 when the uc cell was calibrated to achieve the best fit to measured drainage and overflow volumes volume calibration the hydrograph performance was reduced to nse 0 31 even smaller than nse 0 39 for the uncalibrated simulation table 3 according to skaggs et al 2012 an nse greater than 0 4 is acceptable model performance at a daily timestep thus for a much smaller 2 minute timestep both the uncalibrated and volume calibrated drainage hydrographs could have acceptable model performance at 0 39 and 0 31 nse for overflow hydrographs however all calibrations performed poorly the lower nse statistics for overflow were likely due to the emphasis on matching peak flow by the nse statistic broekhuizen et al 2020 lisenbee et al 2020 krause et al 2005 for instance modeled timing and duration of overflow were very close to measured but peak flow was overestimated in all drainmod urban simulations fig 5 visualization of drainage and overflow hydrographs is a key step in evaluating drainmod urban performance saraswat et al 2015 moriasi et al 2007 the performance of drainmod urban drainage hydrographs varies depending on the calibration method the volume calibration had the worst drainage hydrograph fit based on visual assessment of a representative storm event fig 4c this simulation had a truncated peak that was much lower than measured and the duration of the first two peaks was extended to compensate for this loss in volume although the peak and duration of the uncalibrated drainage hydrograph was still poorly represented the shape of the hydrograph was better than the rectangular shape observed under the volume calibration fig 4a also notably in both the uncalibrated and volume calibrated simulations the third peak was not detected for the event depicted in fig 4 the hydrograph calibrated drainage hydrograph for this representative event was visually improved in multiple ways the peak drainage was closer to measured albeit still underestimated the timing of rising and falling limbs was much closer to measured and the third peak corresponded well to measured timing and peak drainage fig 4e drainage hydrographs clearly benefited from hydrograph calibration in drainmod urban for overflow hydrographs the improvements across calibrations were less evident in general the peaks were reduced and the timing was improved under hydrograph calibration this is demonstrated in the representative overflow event particularly for the second smaller peak fig 5a c e 3 1 2 volumes higher nses were observed for event volumes than for hydrographs for all calibration sets except for the uncalibrated overflow which showed poor performance for both volumes and hydrographs table 3 this was expected because event volumes were summed over the entire event as opposed to hydrographs which were evaluated at each 2 minute interval moriasi et al 2007 small shifts in the modeled hydrograph compared to the measured hydrograph led to disparities in the hydrograph nse but may have had little impact on the modeled volume the hydrograph calibrated drainmod urban model described in lisenbee et al 2020 achieved an nse 0 83 for drainage event volumes the nse of drainage volumes under the volume calibration was actually the same as the hydrograph calibration 0 83 but with slightly better pbias the uncalibrated drainmod urban simulation has the worst performance for drainage and overflow event volumes among the three calibration methods table 3 drainage and overflow volumes were mostly overestimated when drainmod urban was uncalibrated except for a few storms with the greatest measured volumes fig 6 a b overflow event volumes in drainmod urban showed good performance under the volume and hydrograph calibrations even when overflow hydrograph performance was poor table 3 unexpectedly overflow event volumes under the volume calibration had a lower nse compared to the hydrograph calibration however both volume and hydrograph calibrations substantially improved drainage and overflow volumes suggesting that for drainmod urban calibration is highly recommended both calibration techniques i e volume or hydrograph calibrated yielded reasonable fit between drainage volumes and measured volumes though they were still slightly overestimated fig 6c e with only four overflow events for comparison it was hard to detect trends in overflow volumes across calibration methods fig 6 3 2 swmm model performance 3 2 1 hydrographs the uncalibrated swmm model simulated overflow hydrographs nse 0 54 almost as well as swmm under hydrograph calibration nse 0 57 drainage hydrographs showed greater improvement with hydrograph calibration nse 0 42 from an uncalibrated model nse 0 34 table 3 however when visually examining drainage event hydrographs the difference between the uncalibrated b and hydrograph calibrated f simulations were less obvious with the nse likely improving due to improved prediction of drainage timing fig 4 when ksat and seepage rate were adjusted in swmm to better match drainage and overflow volumes volume calibration the maximum drainage rate was underestimated unlike with other calibration methods fig 4 this change was not represented by the cumulative nse which only changed from 0 42 to 0 47 from hydrograph calibration to volume calibration one noticeable characteristic of swmm drainage hydrographs is that many reach a maximum drainage limit where the peak drainage is truncated the peak drainage rate could be adjusted in swmm by modifying the drainage coefficient ksat or seepage rate but these changes had no effect on the rectangular shape this behavior is explained by the percolation equation in swmm eqn 1 when the water level exceeds the top of the storage layer and the soil moisture of the bioretention media is between field capacity and saturation the drainage can be calculated using the hco parameter eqn 1 this explains the sensitivity of this parameter in swmm despite an ambiguous effect on event hydrographs when the soil layer is saturated the percolation rate eqn 1 is equal to the ksat and the drainage rate becomes the ksat minus the seepage rate this effect was observed in eight out of 12 event hydrographs simulated but when examining soil moisture measured in the bioretention cell over the course of the monitoring period the soil layer was rarely fully saturated the measured soil mositure remained near field capacity during the majority of time the bioretention cell was draining the maximum measured moisture content in the bioretention media was 0 312 cm3 cm3 and in the iws storage layer was 0 354 cm3 cm3 compared to a measured porosity of 0 331 cm3 cm3 for the bioretention media supplementary material one explanation for the lack of saturation in the uc bioretention cell was that it was oversized compared to typical design recommedations in the region fully treating 29 5 mm in the ponding zone without overflow winston et al 2016 in a related study the swmm modeled soil moisture reached saturation multiple times in the 95 predictive uncertaintiy bounds using monte carlo anlysis but the extent of observed soil moisture values across seven bioretention cell never reached saturation avellaneda et al 2017 another explanation is the potential for preferential flow pathways that are not modeled but could drain the bioretention cell faster than assumed with an average soil moisture liu and fassman beck 2017 carpenter and hallam 2010 lastly the cumulative nse for overflow hydrographs dropped substantially under the volume calibration compared to the hydrograph calibration and uncalibrated simulations but other goodness of fit tests do not demonstrate as drastic a decline in performance table 3 again this is likely due to the nse being highly influenced by peak matching the representative event overflow hydrograph produced by swmm in fig 4 b d f do not considerably vary across calibration methods except for a larger second peak in the volume calibration which explained some of the change in nse 3 2 2 volumes statistical evaluation of model fit table 3 demonstrates impressive performance from swmm in estimating event volumes even when uncalibrated all swmm simulations had an nse for drainage and overflow volumes greater than 0 59 which is considered satisfactory model performance at a monthly time step and even stronger model performance at the event level moriasi et al 2007 however the uncalibrated swmm simulation did appear to underestimate event overflow volumes fig 6 which was also found in a study where an uncalibrated swmm model underestimated weekly surface runoff of an lid watershed rosa et al 2015 drainage and overflow event volumes had the best performance nse 0 93 and nse 0 81 respectively when swmm was calibrated specifically for event volumes as opposed to hydrographs similarly a previous study of a pilot scale bioretention system found excellent model performance nse 0 97 for swmm overflow volumes over a range of rainfall depths 58 events approx 0 3 100 mm li and lam 2015 the nse for event drainage volumes decreased from 0 86 uncalibrated to 0 70 under hydrograph calibration of the swmm model due to overestimation table 3 fig 6a and e similarly the nse of overflow event volumes was reduced from an uncalibrated 0 70 to 0 59 under hydrograph calibration for all simulations the measured drainage and overflow volumes closely matched the swmm model outputs as seen by the proximity to the 1 1 line in fig 6 3 3 comparison of swmm and drainmod urban both swmm and drainmod urban performed reasonably for modeling the uc bioretention cell but different advantages existed for each model a decision flowchart was created based on this study to signify model performance under different model objectives fig 7 the following sections describe advantages for each model when evaluating event volumes and hydrographs 3 3 1 hydrograph performance with respect to reproducing drainage hydrographs a hydrograph calibrated drainmod urban nse 0 60 performed better than a hydrograph calibrated swmm nse 0 42 drainmod urban also better mimicked drainage hydrograph shape by visual inspection which was attributed to better timing and response during peak drainage fig 4 swmm produced rectangular drainage hydrographs i e truncated elongated duration peaks when the bioretention cell was saturated which occurred more often in swmm than observed in soil moisture measurements collected in the uc cell conversely swmm performed better than drainmod urban for overflow hydrographs table 3 the overflow peaks predicted by swmm were smaller and closer to measured peaks than those predicted by drainmod urban fig 4 it has been shown that peaks have a large effect on the nse statistic broekhuizen et al 2020 lisenbee et al 2020 krause et al 2005 the calculation of overflow in each model was very similar simply identifying when the water level exceeds the specified maximum ponding depth and attributing excess stormwater to overflow therefore the better prediction of overflow hydrographs by swmm may be due to differences in other hydrologic processes such as percolation and exfiltration or the infiltration capacity at the surface 3 3 2 hydrograph characteristics the peak flow time to peak and event duration were also used to characterize measured and modeled hydrographs for each of these hydrograph characteristics the measured and simulated values from swmm and drainmod urban for each drainage or overflow event were compared against the 1 1 line to find patterns in under and overprediction fig 8 this was only performed for the hydrograph calibration as that simulation provided drainage and overflow hydrographs closest to those measured for both drainmod urban and swmm peak simulated drainage rate reached a maximum threshold in both models fig 8a for swmm the maximum drainage rate was 8 3 l s which is equal to the measured ksat 16 8 cm hr minus the seepage rate 0 44 cm hr this maximum drainage rate occurred during rainfall events with depths greater than 25 mm therefore most drainage events eight out of 12 reached this maximum causing a rectangular shape and overestimated peaks in the drainage hydrographs for drainmod urban the maximum drainage rate was 4 8 l s or 9 5 cm hr over the bioretention area which occurred during events with rainfall depths greater than 42 mm six out of 12 drainage events during drainmod urban calibration this maximum drainage rate was shown to vary with changes in the bioretention media ksat but was not simply equal to the ksat minus the seepage rate as it was with swmm in fact the maximum drainage rate for drainmod urban was smaller than the calibrated ksat used for the bioretention media for overflow the peak flow was overestimated by both models but swmm tended to be closer to measured overflow peaks fig 8d the drainage time to peak was slightly underestimated by both swmm and drainmod urban fig 8b the average difference between the time to peak measured and simulated by drainmod urban was only 19 min with no difference larger than an hour in swmm the average difference between measured and modeled time to peak was 35 min with a maximum difference of 3 3 h this is attributed to the plateaued peaks in many swmm drainage hydrographs which reached a maximum drainage flow rate faster than a single peak flow another consideration is that the iws of the uc cell is not represented in swmm as well as in drainmod urban a column study of free drainage versus iws showed a delay in peak drainage under iws conditions liu and fassman beck 2017 the time to peak for overflow hydrographs was estimated almost perfectly by both models fig 8e the duration of drainage hydrographs seemed to be underpredicted for some storms events with drainmod urban and swmm but overall both models had good results compared to measured values fig 8c for the four overflow hydrographs evaluated it was difficult to detect a pattern among the duration predicted by drainmod urban and swmm fig 8f although studies evaluating drainage and overflow hydrographs from the swmm lid module are rare one study showed similar rectangular hydrographs from swmm compared to a column study under a variety of rainfall intensities and durations gülbaz and kazezyılmaz alhan 2017 in this study swmm underestimated peak drainage rates however the drainage rates from the uc cell were two or three orders of magnitude higher than those in this column study the most notable finding by gulbaz and kazezyilmaz alhan 2017 was that there was no change in the peak flow of swmm predicted drainage hydrographs across different rainfall intensities and durations therefore swmm was predicting the columns would reach saturation and thus their maximum peak drainage regardless of variations in inflow another study showed swmm drainage hydrographs with very sharp peaks slow rising limbs truncated receding limbs and mismatched duration compared to measured drainage from a bioretention cell column liu and fassman beck 2017 these hydrograph characteristics do not align with findings from this research due to the lack of an iws zone in this column 3 3 3 volume performance swmm consistently predicted event volumes better than drainmod urban as shown through goodness of fit tests the exception was drainage volumes under the hydrograph calibration table 3 the best fit for overflow volumes from drainmod urban occurred under hydrograph calibration nse 0 66 which had the worst overflow volume performance in swmm nse 0 59 in drainmod urban drainage volumes improved as the model was calibrated to match the measured and modeled hydrographs but in swmm drainage volume performance decreased as the hydrograph performance improved therefore the user must decide whether to calibrate swmm to achieve more accurate volumes or hydrographs i e timing and rate of flow in drainmod urban calibrating to the hydrograph improved both factors 3 3 4 effect of model processes the differences in hydrographs and event volumes created by drainmod urban and swmm can be explained by internal processes of the models the soil water distribution in each model led to substantial differences in modeling infiltration through the media drainage calculations and representation of the iws layer while drainmod urban and swmm both use the green ampt equation for surface infiltration the green ampt equation in the lid module of swmm was modified to account for the effect of ponding rossman and huber 2016 meanwhile drainmod urban accounts for ponding in its soil water distribution procedures skaggs et al 2012 this means that surface infiltration could be very similar in these two models if there is adequate infiltration capacity in the rest of the bioretention cell which is determined by how easily water flows through the soil layer if this becomes limited then it will influence ponding and eventually overflow for percolation through the bioretention media drainmod urban uses green ampt with a keff at different water level depths which is recalculated at each time step as the water moves through the soil media swmm uses the percolation equation 1 which often is simplified to the ksat when the soil is assumed to be saturated as seen in the truncated drainage hydrographs fig 4 when not saturated the percolation in swmm depends on the average soil moisture and hco parameter which is a highly uncertain empirical parameter that is estimated by most users the change in water holding capacity in the soil layer through each of these methods affects the rate and amount of water reaching the storage layer and the underdrain once water reaches the underdrain differences in drainage equations affect modeled drain output as described in section 3 2 6 without drainage restrictions swmm assumes all percolation that reaches the underdrain minus the user defined seepage rate becomes drainage drainmod urban uses the keff from the soil layer to calculate the drainage rate with more physically based equations swmm overestimated drainage peak flow while drainmod urban often underestimated drainage peak flow fig 8 by overestimating the drainage rate in the bioretention cell swmm provides more infiltration capacity which reduced the volume and intensity of stormwater converted to overflow such that overflow peaks were closer to measured peaks than with drainmod urban fig 5 therefore the improved overflow performance in swmm could be an artefact of the drainage design and leaves the question if drainage is improved will overflow perform as well another consideration regarding drainage and overflow prediction is how the iws zones are represented in each model drainmod urban simply allows for controlled drainage at a given weir height which directly matches to the iws configuration in the uc cell and most bioretention cell with an iws zone the drainage configuration in swmm had to be adjusted to represent the iws which increased the storage zone to include the sand layer and raised the height of the underdrain to the top of the iws layer fig 2 this iws configuration could affect the drainage calculated by swmm but warrants more investigation with the exception of the volume calibration in swmm overestimation in drainage volumes also led to an underestimation of overflow volumes fig 7 therefore the water balance under the uncalibrated and hydrograph calibrated simulations could be better represented in swmm if iws configurations were improved in the model we recommend more testing of underdrain configurations in the swmm lid module to better understand the connection of the iws model representation to the drainage and overflow outputs 4 summary and conclusions the intended application of a bioretention model has a significant impact on model selection and how or if the model is calibrated if the objective of the application is to understand event drainage and overflow volumes from bioretention then swmm is a good choice swmm is capable of modeling event volumes with good to excellent fit in both uncalibrated and calibrated simulations ranging from nse 0 70 to 0 93 for drainage and nse 0 59 to 0 81 for overflow the performance of both models suffered when attempting to model a high temporal resolution time series performing much better for aggregated event volumes however drainage or overflow hydrographs are necessary for applications considering flow dynamics such as stream response combined sewer systems or flooding the hydrograph calibrated drainmod urban performs better than swmm for drainage hydrographs which is not surprising when comparing drainage equations employed by each model swmm performs better than drainmod urban for overflow hydrographs primarily by more closely predicting overflow event peak flow rates drainmod urban benefits more from calibration of drainage and overflow hydrographs in comparison with swmm interestingly in swmm calibration to optimize one hydrologic objective event volumes or hydrographs led to diminished performance of the other objective this presents a choice for swmm users are volumes or hydrographs more important for drainage and or overflow given the application for drainmod urban the hydrograph calibration improves both the volumes and hydrographs of drainage and overflow eliminating a decision between better predicted volumes or hydrographs future bioretention research requires further calibration of drainmod urban and swmm for additional bioretention sites especially with data sets containing more than four overflow events more overflow events need to be analyzed to improve the confidence of statistical conclusions about overflow performance in each model this study only considered one bioretention cell but additional sites need to be modeled to understand how these models behave across a variety of conditions such as storm size drainage configurations and other bioretention design features in particular the iws representation in swmm needs to be investigated further and improved in the model to increase the applicability of the lid module to all bioretention systems sensitivity analysis could also improve understanding of how measurement or estimation of model inputs affect the accuracy of output hydrographs in future work utilizing drainmod urban as an add on tool for swmm would improve drainage hydrographs in swmm and allow for better representation of bioretention cells in watershed scale

3098,bioretention systems have become a leading infiltration based low impact development lid practice to reduce urban stormwater runoff volumes and peak flows although these systems have performed well in many site scale field studies modeling of bioretention systems has received less attention additional studies are needed which calibrate various models to field measurements to investigate and optimize the performance of individual lid practices and effectively scale local interventions to the watershed drainmod urban has been successfully applied to bioretention at the site scale due to its advanced soil water accounting using the soil water characteristic curve and its ability to explicitly model underdrains and internal water storage iws zones at the same time the u s epa stormwater management model swmm has become one of the most widely used urban drainage models the latest version swmm5 included dedicated lid modules including a routine for bioretention modeling in this study drainmod urban and the swmm lid module were compared through detailed analysis of the internal processes of each model as well as through model calibration and output investigation the objective was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each model and compare the performance of both models to a single bioretention cell both swmm and drainmod urban were evaluated in calibrated and uncalibrated scenarios since urban drainage models often remain uncalibrated for planning scenario analysis following calibration drainmod urban was superior for replicating drainage hydrographs nse 0 60 while swmm produced better overflow hydrographs nse 0 57 specifically swmm often output a maximum drainage rate that caused rectangular drainage hydrographs but drainmod urban was better able to match the shape of measured drainage hydrographs while the drainmod urban model output was in good agreement with measured drainage and overflow event volumes when calibrated drainage nse 0 83 overflow nse 0 57 0 66 swmm was closer to measured volumes even when uncalibrated drainage nse 0 70 0 93 overflow nse 0 59 0 81 this study improved existing knowledge of the swmm lid module by calibrating to field collected data from a single bioretention cell for the first time in literature furthermore the results of this study indicate an opportunity for model coupling that could combine the strengths and weaknesses of each model and improve bioretention cell modeling keywords biofilter rain garden stormwater green infrastructure low impact development hydrologic modeling 1 introduction bioretention systems have been widely accepted within the stormwater engineering community due to numerous geographically diverse field studies demonstrating substantial volumetric reductions and generally good pollutant removal tirpak et al 2021 olszewski and davis 2013 brown and hunt 2012 davis et al 2012 brown and hunt 2011 davis 2008 hunt et al 2006 however most bioretention studies have centered on field monitoring and laboratory assessments liu et al 2014 davis et al 2009 computational models have been slower to develop for bioretention systems despite the advantage they provide in quantifying bioretention performance as a function of design prior to implementation specifically bioretention modeling is beneficial to designers by informing bioretention cell design optimizing designs for local conditions and objectives and scaling impacts from a single cell to the larger watershed there are many hydrologic models that have developed tools or routines for bioretention lisenbee et al 2021 low impact development lid models may include bioretention as one of many lid practices but mostly examine lumped performance of lid installations compared to traditional development under uncalibrated and calibrated scenarios kaykhosravi et al 2018 li et al 2017 elliott and trowsdale 2007 often these models focus on runoff volume reduction to describe the performance of bioretention cells however hydrologic pathways within a bioretention cell drainage overflow exfiltration and evapotranspiration should also be evaluated since they play a role in determining the fate of pollutants in bioretention and impact watershed hydrology unfortunately hydrologic pathways are not well represented in many current bioretention models lisenbee et al 2021 underdrains and restrictions to drainage such as internal water storage iws zones are not considered in some models and the hydrologic changes from these features are computationally simplified in other models despite widespread use in field applications lynn et al 2018 liu et al 2014 brown and hunt 2011 further many models use infiltration processes that assume uniform saturation of the media while bioretention systems are variably saturated and unsaturated during and following rain events tu et al 2020 barbu and ballestero 2015 akan 2013 brown et al 2013 finally the hydrologic flow paths in a bioretention model could be calibrated to better represent field measured drainage and overflow from a bioretention cell but these studies have been limited to column studies thus far gülbaz and kazezyılmaz alhan 2017 liu and fassman beck 2017 additional studies are needed to determine how these limitations in model processes may or may not affect the model outcomes the u s epa stormwater management model swmm is one of the most widely used models for bioretention especially since the release of swmm5 which includes dedicated lid modules rossman 2010 swmm has many applications for catchment hydrology provides several methods for hydrologic and hydraulic processes and reports hydrographs from flows in sewers open channels or lid features swmm has been widely applied to watershed studies investigating lumped lid benefits compared to traditional stormwater management bai et al 2018 avellaneda et al 2017 sun et al 2014 mccutcheon and wride 2013 bosley 2008 fewer studies have calibrated swmm to observed total runoff reduction specifically provided by bioretention at the watershed scale bai et al 2018 avellaneda et al 2017 li and lam 2015 rosa et al 2015 however bioretention models must first be evaluated at the site scale to ensure they provide reliable estimations of performance at the watershed scale some studies have focused on performance of a single bioretention cell or rain garden in swmm compared to column or pilot scale studies gülbaz and kazezyılmaz alhan 2017 liu and fassman beck 2017 li and lam 2015 mccutcheon and wride 2013 only a few recent studies have evaluated swmm compared to bioretention cells installed in field but were primarily focused on sensitivity analysis fassman beck and saleh 2021 platz et al 2020 thus evaluation of the swmm lid module performance for site scale bioretention studies is needed to better understand how the model represents internal flow processes of a bioretention cell further studies have compared swmm with other bioretention models such as hydrus 1d tu et al 2020 lynn et al 2018 winslamm tiveron et al 2018 hm rwb gülbaz and kazezyılmaz alhan 2017 recarga sun et al 2011 and hydrocad lucas 2010 these studies have established that swmm is capable of modeling bioretention cells under a variety of conditions but it has limitations such as limited underdrain placement and design simplistic infiltration routines using a bucket model approach and scarce examples of calibration and validation against field lid practices fassman beck and saleh 2021 lisenbee et al 2021 the research herein combined important aspects of each of the aforementioned studies site scale evaluation of the swmm lid module calibration of hydrologic pathways in the swmm lid module using field measured data and comparison of swmm to another promising bioretention model drainmod urban drainmod is an agricultural drainage model that has performed well when applied to urban bioretention systems by addressing some of the limitations of other models related to infiltration modeling and representation of the iws zone winston 2015 hathaway et al 2014 brown et al 2013 another advantage of drainmod is the detailed soil water accounting procedure that estimates water level fluctuations in the cell using the soil water characteristic curve swcc the swcc is a better representation of available pore space in the bioretention cell at various depths compared to the common assumption that storage capacity is simply the difference between water content at saturation and field capacity brown et al 2013 this is important in variably saturated bioretention systems especially those employing iws zones which elevate the internal water level in addition to sophisticated soil moisture accounting the swcc is used in drainmod for determining the volume drained and the green ampt infiltration parameters at various internal water levels within the bioretention cell drainmod urban is a version of drainmod adapted for urban hydrologic response times drainmod urban produces hydrographs at time steps as small as one minute for each hydrologic pathway in the bioretention cell inflow overflow infiltration drainage exfiltration and et drainmod urban has shown good prediction nse 0 60 of observed drainage hydrographs from a bioretention cell lisenbee et al 2020 while drainmod urban appears to be well suited for modeling bioretention it also has some disadvantages compared to swmm swmm has an easy to use graphical user interface gui and graphing functions for built in visualization of outputs conversely drainmod urban outputs text files that must undergo rigorous post processing with an external program furthermore swmm is a watershed scale model that can capture dynamics between catchments sewers hydraulic structures and other bioretention cells upstream and downstream of any given bioretention cell it also incorporates routing procedures to account for travel time and friction losses between these objects at present drainmod urban can only model a single bioretention cell this site scale modeling allows users to evaluate the performance of a specific bioretention cell or design feature whereas watershed scale modeling is useful for determining effects on a larger catchment watershed scale models for bioretention often lump parameters and make simplifications to allow for quick analysis of many contributing factors without cumbersome input requirements to combine the best of these methods site scale models can be incorporated as add in tools for larger watershed models this study addressed the need to understand the performance of the swmm lid module in representing an individual bioretention cell by calibrating swmm to field measured bioretention cell hydrology the resulting model performance was compared with that of drainmod urban evaluating hydrographs produced by each model was important to consider the effect bioretention has on flow dynamics of urban watersheds combined sewer overflow cso mitigation and treatment trains that consist of multiple lid strategies which require accurate hydrographs liu and fassman beck 2017 this study identified strengths and weaknesses of each model s ability to represent event volumes and hydrographs of drainage and overflow pathways in a bioretention cell acknowledging advantages and applications best suited to each model bears potential for combining these strengths in future bioretention modeling efforts 2 material methods 2 1 site description a single site scale model was created in both drainmod urban and swmm and calibrated to the ursuline college uc bioretention cell located near cleveland ohio usa this site was used for previous evaluations of drainmod and drainmod urban performance lisenbee et al 2020 winston 2015 a 3600 m2 drainage area comprised largely of parking lot 77 impervious produced stormwater runoff that entered the uc cell which had a surface area of 182 m2 fig 1 the bioretention media layer 60 cm in the uc cell was 87 sand 4 silt and 9 clay according to sieve analysis astm 2007 the uc cell had a 30 cm ponding zone that was topped with a 7 5 cm layer of mulch below the bioretention media was a choking sand layer 15 cm and a gravel storage layer 30 cm which contained an underdrain with an upturned elbow creating a 60 cm deep iws zone fig 2 the bioretention media was not expected to experience clogging or compaction over the monitoring period due to recent construction a forebay to collect fine sediment entering the cell and the growth of vegetation and roots precipitation was measured on site with a tipping bucket rain gauge at 1 minute intervals inflow to the uc cell was unable to be directly measured on site so catchment properties were entered into swmm to model an inflow hydrograph that was used in both swmm and drainmod urban models the combined drainage and overflow were measured with a 60 degree sharp crested v notch weir and a bubbler flow module attached to an isco 6712 sampler that collected data every two minutes fig 1 drainage and overflow were separated in swmm using a rating curve based on the internal water level winston et al 2016 a total of 12 drainage events and four overflow events were measured over the seven month monitoring period additionally volumetric soil moisture was measured in the uc cell using time domain reflectometer tdr probes at 15 30 60 and 90 cm depths fig 1 the 15 and 30 cm depths described the bioretention media whereas the 60 and 90 cm depths described moisture in the iws and sand gravel storage zones 2 2 model description both drainmod urban and swmm are long term continuous simulation models which account for antecedent moisture conditions swmm also has the benefit of being applicable to the larger urban watershed employing routing procedures such as the kinematic wave equation which accounts for runoff travel time to the bioretention cell the routing procedures in swmm also allow for outflow to be routed to another lid component or pipe network downstream to allow direct comparison to drainmod urban the bioretention lid module in swmm was evaluated as its own subwatershed this reduced the swmm model to a single bioretention cell similar to drainmod urban and provided valuable analysis of the capabilities of the lid module for bioretention cell modeling before modeling these bioretention cells in swmm the governing equations used for various hydrologic pathways in swmm and drainmod urban were compared in the following sections for specific model inputs see table 4 more information on model processes can be found in model documentation rossman and huber 2016 drainmod 6 1 help file 2013 skaggs et al 2012 and the bioretention modeling review paper lisenbee et al 2021 2 2 1 inflow swmm was used to model a continuous runoff hydrograph from the catchment area at 1 min intervals for drainmod urban this runoff hydrograph was entered as inflow to the bioretention cell without modification in the swmm simulations the same method was used to determine bioretention inflow with the addition of a potential evapotranspiration pet file using the penman monteith method which reduced the inflow to the bioretention cell by 10 2 2 2 overflow drainmod urban has a surface storage input that represents the bioretention ponding zone if ponding exceeds this level then overflow is equal to the sum of direct precipitation on the bioretention cell and inflow minus infiltration swmm includes a ponding zone denoted berm height in the lid module for bioretention but also includes a vegetation volume fraction to account for the space that vegetation occupies in the ponding zone overflow is calculated in swmm as the water level above a maximum freeboard for each given timestep 2 2 3 evapotranspiration both drainmod urban and swmm accept user input pet but drainmod urban can also calculate pet using the thornthwaite method in drainmod urban pet is used to represent et from the system when soil water is not limiting if et is limited by soil water conditions then et is equal to the upward flux of water as a function of internal water level determined from the swcc soil input when this upward flux is not enough to meet et demand water is removed from the root zone in swmm et is calculated for the surface soil and storage layers consecutively such that any remaining pet is available to the subsequent layer the surface et is calculated as the minimum of the pet and the ponding depth at a given timestep the et from the soil layer is calculated from the moisture content and the depth of the soil both the soil and storage et are set to zero when surface infiltration is occurring 2 2 4 infiltration the green ampt method was used to represent surface infiltration through the bioretention cell in swmm and drainmod urban this method is a simplification of richards equation which employs certain assumptions such as one dimensional vertical flow and total saturation behind a sharp wetting front these assumptions are not always valid in bioretention cells which operate under variably saturated and unsaturated conditions for the lid module in swmm the green ampt equation was adjusted to account for ponding depth which is an important component of bioretention cells drainmod urban requires the user to input the swcc of the bioretention media to account for variable soil moisture this is especially important for cells with an iws zone where the internal water level may be close to the surface the swcc provides a more detailed relationship between moisture content fluctuations and depth to the internal water level than traditional methods of assuming an initial moisture deficit which is the procedure used in swmm brown et al 2013 this was especially true when the water level was close to the surface as it often is in a bioretention cell during a storm event for swmm infiltration capacity recovery is modeled using the hydraulic conductivity in green ampt instead of a soil accounting method like drainmod urban bosley 2008 swmm assumes all soil moisture is evenly distributed throughout the soil layer rossman and huber 2016 which may not be an appropriate assumption barbu and ballestero 2015 drainmod urban and swmm require different inputs although they both employ the green ampt equation table 4 to estimate infiltration parameters the swmm reference manual provides a table of suggested bioretention soil parameters based on sand loamy sand and sandy loam soil textures using the spaw model rossman and huber 2016 saxton and rawls 2006 in drainmod infiltration parameters are derived automatically from the measured swcc entered in the model but they can be adjusted manually if desired skaggs et al 2012 overall deriving infiltration parameters from a measured swcc is hypothesized to improve infiltration estimation in drainmod urban compared to swmm which does not require sophisticated soil characteristic parameterization but instead relies on empirical estimation based on soil texture 2 2 5 percolation after the initial surface infiltration percolation refers to flow through soil layers within the bioretention cell drainmod urban employs the green ampt parameters derived from the swcc and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat for each soil layer in the model are used to find an effective ksat keff at each time step based on the internal water table depth in swmm darcy s law is used to simulate percolation through subsequent soil layers in the bioretention cell this is applied in the same manner as swmm s groundwater routine using the coefficient hco to describe the exponential decrease in hydraulic conductivity with decreasing moisture content rossman and huber 2016 the equation used for the percolation rate through each soil layers is 1 f 2 k sat e h c o ϕ θ where ksat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil layer hco is the conductivity slope ϕ is the soil porosity and θ is the soil moisture if the native soil layer is saturated the percolation is limited to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bioretention media if the moisture content of the soil layer falls below field capacity then the percolation rate is set to zero rossman and huber 2016 2 2 6 drainage drainmod urban represents drainage in bioretention systems fig 3 using the hooghoudt equation eqn 2 that accounts for flow convergence near drains 2 q 4 k e m 2 d e m l 2 where q is the drainage rate cm h m is the midpoint water level above the drain ke is the equivalent lateral hydraulic conductivity of the profile cm h de is the equivalent depth from the drain to the restrictive layer cm and l is the drain spacing cm drainmod urban s soil moisture accounting is also used to estimate the change in internal water level when water begins to pond on the soil surface and the soil is fully saturated the kirkham equation 1957 is used to calculate drainage instead of the hooghoudt equation skaggs et al 2012 however the drainage rate could be limited by other hydraulic constraints which are accounted for through the drainage coefficient parameter which sets the maximum drainage capacity drainmod urban also provides a controlled drainage option that uses weir settings to control drawdown in the bioretention cell and represent an iws zone a common design in practice swmm can model underdrains in the lid module but the drainage inputs required are not measurable quantities and the drain advisor that assists users in determining the correct values for these inputs is limited in scope epa swmm help file 5 1 2017 according to the swmm lid user manual swmm models the underdrain using an empirical power law weir equation unless the maximum drainage rate is reached 3 q c d h η where q is the drainage rate ft s h is the hydraulic head ft cd is the underdrain discharge coefficient and η is the underdrain discharge exponent rossman and huber 2016 the hydraulic head on the underdrain is defined by the offset height which is an input in the lid module drainage does not begin until the water level in the storage layer reaches the drain offset height the maximum drainage limit is equal to the drainage coefficient as represented in drainmod urban if the exponent is set to zero if the underdrain is not limiting the hydraulics the drainage coefficient can be any number larger than the ksat in this case the drainage rate is equal to the rate of percolation entering the underdrain from the adjoining soil layer minus the seepage rate as long as the maximum drainage limit represented by the drainage coefficient is not reached other drainage restrictions can be incorporated by adjusting the drainage exponent to 0 5 to represent the standard orifice equation rossman and huber 2016 under this scenario the drainage coefficient can be used to represent slotted pipes that act as orifices or an orifice at the outlet of the underdrain these adjustments to equation 3 offer more flexibility in how the drainage hydraulics are calculated by considering multiple drains valves cap orifices slotted pipes etc which are not considered in many bioretention models however an upturned elbow for creation of an iws zone is one drainage configuration that is still not readily modeled in the swmm lid module one study has shown how to represent an elevated outlet in swmm by creating a rating curve using hydrus to represent both unsaturated zones and saturated sections of the bioretention media lynn et al 2018 however this study was conducted using the original swmm framework ours is the first published study to model an iws zone in the swmm5 lid module using the following model setup in the swmm lid module the soil layer or bioretention media can only be placed above the storage layer and the underdrain is typically placed at the top of the storage layer in this study for comparison to drainmod urban the cell configuration had to be adjusted in swmm to account for storage available in the iws zone the storage layer depth was input as the depths of gravel and sand layers 45 cm and the depth of bioretention media remained at 60 cm for this study the underdrain was placed at the top of the iws zone 60 cm above the bottom of cell to accommodate the proper underdrain invert elevation therefore the underdrain was placed in the soil layer 15 cm above the storage layer to match as built conditions fig 2 this representation of the iws zone in swmm is simplified to fit within the constraints of the lid module i e using an elevated underdrain instead of an upturned elbow configuration we anticipate increased use of swmm for iws bioretention designs because iws is becoming a standard design in some states and swmm is a prominent bioretention modeling tool ncdeq 2020 studying model behavior with this iws setup will demonstrate the best possible model outcomes using the model as is and highlight areas for improvement in the lid module updating the swmm model to address iws is paramount to broaden the scope of bioretention practices that can be modeled using swmm 2 2 7 exfiltration in swmm exfiltration from the bottom of the storage layer into the underling soil is simply set to a user supplied saturated hydraulic conductivity of the underlying soil drainmod urban uses darcy s law with the dupuit forchheimer assumptions to calculate vertical seepage at the transition from the storage layer to the underlying soil drainmod urban also requires seepage inputs such as the piezometric head of the aquifer the thickness of the restricting layer and the vertical conductivity of the restricting layer which are often used as calibration parameters since they are difficult to measure 2 3 modeling methods 2 3 1 inputs understanding model inputs aids the user in determining if the model utilizes mechanistic or empirical functions to estimate bioretention hydrology furthermore the complexity and number of required inputs can discourage use of a model especially for designers that are less familiar with hydrologic modeling or have limited access to descriptive data for the system lisenbee et al 2021 the right balance must be struck between accurately representing the system and reducing the effort required to measure or estimate inputs swmm requires fewer inputs than drainmod urban but more inputs are simply estimated with guidance from the model or left as defaults table 1 we described estimated inputs as those using model defaults or documentation whereas measured inputs come from field or laboratory testing of site specific properties soil properties play a big role in both bioretention models in swmm a total of 15 inputs are required for the lid module and six of these are soil parameters table 4 drainmod urban has fewer estimated parameters than swmm but requires more detailed collection of soil characteristics such as the swcc and hydraulic conductivity of each layer which require extensive laboratory testing tables 1 4 2 3 2 calibration parameters the calibration parameters used in drainmod urban were the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the bioretention media ksat of the sand layer the drainage coefficient the piezometric head of the aquifer and the thickness of the restricting layer table 2 the calibration parameters used in swmm were ksat and soil suction of the bioretention media the conductivity slope hco the void ratio of the storage layer and the seepage rate table 2 the ksat was sensitive in both drainmod urban and swmm to the amount of infiltration allowed through the bioretention cell the void ratio for the storage layer and the soil suction also affected the infiltration in swmm but were not as sensitive as ksat the parameters that controlled the exfiltration from the bioretention cell were the piezometric head of the aquifer and the thickness of the restricting layer in drainmod urban and the seepage rate in swmm there were two unique calibration parameters the drainage coefficient and the hco parameter the initial drainage coefficient in drainmod urban was increased to avoid restricting drain flow since measured hydrographs did not show any evidence of drainage restriction for comparison the same was done in swmm the hco parameter is suggested to fall in the range of 30 to 60 based on its soil texture epa swmm help file 5 1 2017 several studies have shown much smaller hco values than suggested by swmm documentation in bioretention simulations lynn et al 2018 liu and fassman beck 2017 rosa et al 2015 therefore although the hco was calculated to be 49 4 based on swmm recommendations several smaller hco values ranging from 7 to 60 were tested during calibration 2 3 3 calibration process when calibrating both models to measured drainage and overflow hydrographs it was important to simultaneously evaluate the effect of calibration on event and total volumes sometimes these processes couple such that calibrating hydrographs also improves event volumes however an attempt to match volumes sometimes distorts the hydrograph shape lisenbee et al 2020 therefore calibrations were performed to optimize fit to either hydrographs hydrograph calibrated or volumes volume calibrated in drainmod urban and swmm results for model performance for matching both hydrographs and volume were recorded regardless of the output being optimized an additional assessment was completed to document performance of each model in an uncalibrated state which is the way bioretention models are commonly used in practice for preliminary design analysis due to limited data availability or modeling experience we believe that the uncalibrated scenario was valuable to provide insight on the model performance in cases where calibration data may be constrained this process resulted in three calibration states for each model uncalibrated volume calibrated and hydrograph calibrated optimization of modeled volumes and hydrographs was determined using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias as goodness of fit tests other statistics such as the index of agreement d its relative error counterparts d1 and the relative nse e1 were calculated as supplements to the nse and pbias during calibration moriasi et al 2007 after these statistics were used to narrow the number of viable scenarios drainage and overflow hydrographs were visually inspected and characteristics such as peak flow time to peak and event duration were compared these assessments aided in determining a final hydrograph calibrated simulation for the uc cell 3 results discussion 3 1 drainmod urban performance 3 1 1 hydrographs when calibrating drainmod urban to measured hydrographs hydrograph calibration good performance was achieved with nse 0 60 for drainage hydrographs at a 2 minute timestep table 3 when the uc cell was calibrated to achieve the best fit to measured drainage and overflow volumes volume calibration the hydrograph performance was reduced to nse 0 31 even smaller than nse 0 39 for the uncalibrated simulation table 3 according to skaggs et al 2012 an nse greater than 0 4 is acceptable model performance at a daily timestep thus for a much smaller 2 minute timestep both the uncalibrated and volume calibrated drainage hydrographs could have acceptable model performance at 0 39 and 0 31 nse for overflow hydrographs however all calibrations performed poorly the lower nse statistics for overflow were likely due to the emphasis on matching peak flow by the nse statistic broekhuizen et al 2020 lisenbee et al 2020 krause et al 2005 for instance modeled timing and duration of overflow were very close to measured but peak flow was overestimated in all drainmod urban simulations fig 5 visualization of drainage and overflow hydrographs is a key step in evaluating drainmod urban performance saraswat et al 2015 moriasi et al 2007 the performance of drainmod urban drainage hydrographs varies depending on the calibration method the volume calibration had the worst drainage hydrograph fit based on visual assessment of a representative storm event fig 4c this simulation had a truncated peak that was much lower than measured and the duration of the first two peaks was extended to compensate for this loss in volume although the peak and duration of the uncalibrated drainage hydrograph was still poorly represented the shape of the hydrograph was better than the rectangular shape observed under the volume calibration fig 4a also notably in both the uncalibrated and volume calibrated simulations the third peak was not detected for the event depicted in fig 4 the hydrograph calibrated drainage hydrograph for this representative event was visually improved in multiple ways the peak drainage was closer to measured albeit still underestimated the timing of rising and falling limbs was much closer to measured and the third peak corresponded well to measured timing and peak drainage fig 4e drainage hydrographs clearly benefited from hydrograph calibration in drainmod urban for overflow hydrographs the improvements across calibrations were less evident in general the peaks were reduced and the timing was improved under hydrograph calibration this is demonstrated in the representative overflow event particularly for the second smaller peak fig 5a c e 3 1 2 volumes higher nses were observed for event volumes than for hydrographs for all calibration sets except for the uncalibrated overflow which showed poor performance for both volumes and hydrographs table 3 this was expected because event volumes were summed over the entire event as opposed to hydrographs which were evaluated at each 2 minute interval moriasi et al 2007 small shifts in the modeled hydrograph compared to the measured hydrograph led to disparities in the hydrograph nse but may have had little impact on the modeled volume the hydrograph calibrated drainmod urban model described in lisenbee et al 2020 achieved an nse 0 83 for drainage event volumes the nse of drainage volumes under the volume calibration was actually the same as the hydrograph calibration 0 83 but with slightly better pbias the uncalibrated drainmod urban simulation has the worst performance for drainage and overflow event volumes among the three calibration methods table 3 drainage and overflow volumes were mostly overestimated when drainmod urban was uncalibrated except for a few storms with the greatest measured volumes fig 6 a b overflow event volumes in drainmod urban showed good performance under the volume and hydrograph calibrations even when overflow hydrograph performance was poor table 3 unexpectedly overflow event volumes under the volume calibration had a lower nse compared to the hydrograph calibration however both volume and hydrograph calibrations substantially improved drainage and overflow volumes suggesting that for drainmod urban calibration is highly recommended both calibration techniques i e volume or hydrograph calibrated yielded reasonable fit between drainage volumes and measured volumes though they were still slightly overestimated fig 6c e with only four overflow events for comparison it was hard to detect trends in overflow volumes across calibration methods fig 6 3 2 swmm model performance 3 2 1 hydrographs the uncalibrated swmm model simulated overflow hydrographs nse 0 54 almost as well as swmm under hydrograph calibration nse 0 57 drainage hydrographs showed greater improvement with hydrograph calibration nse 0 42 from an uncalibrated model nse 0 34 table 3 however when visually examining drainage event hydrographs the difference between the uncalibrated b and hydrograph calibrated f simulations were less obvious with the nse likely improving due to improved prediction of drainage timing fig 4 when ksat and seepage rate were adjusted in swmm to better match drainage and overflow volumes volume calibration the maximum drainage rate was underestimated unlike with other calibration methods fig 4 this change was not represented by the cumulative nse which only changed from 0 42 to 0 47 from hydrograph calibration to volume calibration one noticeable characteristic of swmm drainage hydrographs is that many reach a maximum drainage limit where the peak drainage is truncated the peak drainage rate could be adjusted in swmm by modifying the drainage coefficient ksat or seepage rate but these changes had no effect on the rectangular shape this behavior is explained by the percolation equation in swmm eqn 1 when the water level exceeds the top of the storage layer and the soil moisture of the bioretention media is between field capacity and saturation the drainage can be calculated using the hco parameter eqn 1 this explains the sensitivity of this parameter in swmm despite an ambiguous effect on event hydrographs when the soil layer is saturated the percolation rate eqn 1 is equal to the ksat and the drainage rate becomes the ksat minus the seepage rate this effect was observed in eight out of 12 event hydrographs simulated but when examining soil moisture measured in the bioretention cell over the course of the monitoring period the soil layer was rarely fully saturated the measured soil mositure remained near field capacity during the majority of time the bioretention cell was draining the maximum measured moisture content in the bioretention media was 0 312 cm3 cm3 and in the iws storage layer was 0 354 cm3 cm3 compared to a measured porosity of 0 331 cm3 cm3 for the bioretention media supplementary material one explanation for the lack of saturation in the uc bioretention cell was that it was oversized compared to typical design recommedations in the region fully treating 29 5 mm in the ponding zone without overflow winston et al 2016 in a related study the swmm modeled soil moisture reached saturation multiple times in the 95 predictive uncertaintiy bounds using monte carlo anlysis but the extent of observed soil moisture values across seven bioretention cell never reached saturation avellaneda et al 2017 another explanation is the potential for preferential flow pathways that are not modeled but could drain the bioretention cell faster than assumed with an average soil moisture liu and fassman beck 2017 carpenter and hallam 2010 lastly the cumulative nse for overflow hydrographs dropped substantially under the volume calibration compared to the hydrograph calibration and uncalibrated simulations but other goodness of fit tests do not demonstrate as drastic a decline in performance table 3 again this is likely due to the nse being highly influenced by peak matching the representative event overflow hydrograph produced by swmm in fig 4 b d f do not considerably vary across calibration methods except for a larger second peak in the volume calibration which explained some of the change in nse 3 2 2 volumes statistical evaluation of model fit table 3 demonstrates impressive performance from swmm in estimating event volumes even when uncalibrated all swmm simulations had an nse for drainage and overflow volumes greater than 0 59 which is considered satisfactory model performance at a monthly time step and even stronger model performance at the event level moriasi et al 2007 however the uncalibrated swmm simulation did appear to underestimate event overflow volumes fig 6 which was also found in a study where an uncalibrated swmm model underestimated weekly surface runoff of an lid watershed rosa et al 2015 drainage and overflow event volumes had the best performance nse 0 93 and nse 0 81 respectively when swmm was calibrated specifically for event volumes as opposed to hydrographs similarly a previous study of a pilot scale bioretention system found excellent model performance nse 0 97 for swmm overflow volumes over a range of rainfall depths 58 events approx 0 3 100 mm li and lam 2015 the nse for event drainage volumes decreased from 0 86 uncalibrated to 0 70 under hydrograph calibration of the swmm model due to overestimation table 3 fig 6a and e similarly the nse of overflow event volumes was reduced from an uncalibrated 0 70 to 0 59 under hydrograph calibration for all simulations the measured drainage and overflow volumes closely matched the swmm model outputs as seen by the proximity to the 1 1 line in fig 6 3 3 comparison of swmm and drainmod urban both swmm and drainmod urban performed reasonably for modeling the uc bioretention cell but different advantages existed for each model a decision flowchart was created based on this study to signify model performance under different model objectives fig 7 the following sections describe advantages for each model when evaluating event volumes and hydrographs 3 3 1 hydrograph performance with respect to reproducing drainage hydrographs a hydrograph calibrated drainmod urban nse 0 60 performed better than a hydrograph calibrated swmm nse 0 42 drainmod urban also better mimicked drainage hydrograph shape by visual inspection which was attributed to better timing and response during peak drainage fig 4 swmm produced rectangular drainage hydrographs i e truncated elongated duration peaks when the bioretention cell was saturated which occurred more often in swmm than observed in soil moisture measurements collected in the uc cell conversely swmm performed better than drainmod urban for overflow hydrographs table 3 the overflow peaks predicted by swmm were smaller and closer to measured peaks than those predicted by drainmod urban fig 4 it has been shown that peaks have a large effect on the nse statistic broekhuizen et al 2020 lisenbee et al 2020 krause et al 2005 the calculation of overflow in each model was very similar simply identifying when the water level exceeds the specified maximum ponding depth and attributing excess stormwater to overflow therefore the better prediction of overflow hydrographs by swmm may be due to differences in other hydrologic processes such as percolation and exfiltration or the infiltration capacity at the surface 3 3 2 hydrograph characteristics the peak flow time to peak and event duration were also used to characterize measured and modeled hydrographs for each of these hydrograph characteristics the measured and simulated values from swmm and drainmod urban for each drainage or overflow event were compared against the 1 1 line to find patterns in under and overprediction fig 8 this was only performed for the hydrograph calibration as that simulation provided drainage and overflow hydrographs closest to those measured for both drainmod urban and swmm peak simulated drainage rate reached a maximum threshold in both models fig 8a for swmm the maximum drainage rate was 8 3 l s which is equal to the measured ksat 16 8 cm hr minus the seepage rate 0 44 cm hr this maximum drainage rate occurred during rainfall events with depths greater than 25 mm therefore most drainage events eight out of 12 reached this maximum causing a rectangular shape and overestimated peaks in the drainage hydrographs for drainmod urban the maximum drainage rate was 4 8 l s or 9 5 cm hr over the bioretention area which occurred during events with rainfall depths greater than 42 mm six out of 12 drainage events during drainmod urban calibration this maximum drainage rate was shown to vary with changes in the bioretention media ksat but was not simply equal to the ksat minus the seepage rate as it was with swmm in fact the maximum drainage rate for drainmod urban was smaller than the calibrated ksat used for the bioretention media for overflow the peak flow was overestimated by both models but swmm tended to be closer to measured overflow peaks fig 8d the drainage time to peak was slightly underestimated by both swmm and drainmod urban fig 8b the average difference between the time to peak measured and simulated by drainmod urban was only 19 min with no difference larger than an hour in swmm the average difference between measured and modeled time to peak was 35 min with a maximum difference of 3 3 h this is attributed to the plateaued peaks in many swmm drainage hydrographs which reached a maximum drainage flow rate faster than a single peak flow another consideration is that the iws of the uc cell is not represented in swmm as well as in drainmod urban a column study of free drainage versus iws showed a delay in peak drainage under iws conditions liu and fassman beck 2017 the time to peak for overflow hydrographs was estimated almost perfectly by both models fig 8e the duration of drainage hydrographs seemed to be underpredicted for some storms events with drainmod urban and swmm but overall both models had good results compared to measured values fig 8c for the four overflow hydrographs evaluated it was difficult to detect a pattern among the duration predicted by drainmod urban and swmm fig 8f although studies evaluating drainage and overflow hydrographs from the swmm lid module are rare one study showed similar rectangular hydrographs from swmm compared to a column study under a variety of rainfall intensities and durations gülbaz and kazezyılmaz alhan 2017 in this study swmm underestimated peak drainage rates however the drainage rates from the uc cell were two or three orders of magnitude higher than those in this column study the most notable finding by gulbaz and kazezyilmaz alhan 2017 was that there was no change in the peak flow of swmm predicted drainage hydrographs across different rainfall intensities and durations therefore swmm was predicting the columns would reach saturation and thus their maximum peak drainage regardless of variations in inflow another study showed swmm drainage hydrographs with very sharp peaks slow rising limbs truncated receding limbs and mismatched duration compared to measured drainage from a bioretention cell column liu and fassman beck 2017 these hydrograph characteristics do not align with findings from this research due to the lack of an iws zone in this column 3 3 3 volume performance swmm consistently predicted event volumes better than drainmod urban as shown through goodness of fit tests the exception was drainage volumes under the hydrograph calibration table 3 the best fit for overflow volumes from drainmod urban occurred under hydrograph calibration nse 0 66 which had the worst overflow volume performance in swmm nse 0 59 in drainmod urban drainage volumes improved as the model was calibrated to match the measured and modeled hydrographs but in swmm drainage volume performance decreased as the hydrograph performance improved therefore the user must decide whether to calibrate swmm to achieve more accurate volumes or hydrographs i e timing and rate of flow in drainmod urban calibrating to the hydrograph improved both factors 3 3 4 effect of model processes the differences in hydrographs and event volumes created by drainmod urban and swmm can be explained by internal processes of the models the soil water distribution in each model led to substantial differences in modeling infiltration through the media drainage calculations and representation of the iws layer while drainmod urban and swmm both use the green ampt equation for surface infiltration the green ampt equation in the lid module of swmm was modified to account for the effect of ponding rossman and huber 2016 meanwhile drainmod urban accounts for ponding in its soil water distribution procedures skaggs et al 2012 this means that surface infiltration could be very similar in these two models if there is adequate infiltration capacity in the rest of the bioretention cell which is determined by how easily water flows through the soil layer if this becomes limited then it will influence ponding and eventually overflow for percolation through the bioretention media drainmod urban uses green ampt with a keff at different water level depths which is recalculated at each time step as the water moves through the soil media swmm uses the percolation equation 1 which often is simplified to the ksat when the soil is assumed to be saturated as seen in the truncated drainage hydrographs fig 4 when not saturated the percolation in swmm depends on the average soil moisture and hco parameter which is a highly uncertain empirical parameter that is estimated by most users the change in water holding capacity in the soil layer through each of these methods affects the rate and amount of water reaching the storage layer and the underdrain once water reaches the underdrain differences in drainage equations affect modeled drain output as described in section 3 2 6 without drainage restrictions swmm assumes all percolation that reaches the underdrain minus the user defined seepage rate becomes drainage drainmod urban uses the keff from the soil layer to calculate the drainage rate with more physically based equations swmm overestimated drainage peak flow while drainmod urban often underestimated drainage peak flow fig 8 by overestimating the drainage rate in the bioretention cell swmm provides more infiltration capacity which reduced the volume and intensity of stormwater converted to overflow such that overflow peaks were closer to measured peaks than with drainmod urban fig 5 therefore the improved overflow performance in swmm could be an artefact of the drainage design and leaves the question if drainage is improved will overflow perform as well another consideration regarding drainage and overflow prediction is how the iws zones are represented in each model drainmod urban simply allows for controlled drainage at a given weir height which directly matches to the iws configuration in the uc cell and most bioretention cell with an iws zone the drainage configuration in swmm had to be adjusted to represent the iws which increased the storage zone to include the sand layer and raised the height of the underdrain to the top of the iws layer fig 2 this iws configuration could affect the drainage calculated by swmm but warrants more investigation with the exception of the volume calibration in swmm overestimation in drainage volumes also led to an underestimation of overflow volumes fig 7 therefore the water balance under the uncalibrated and hydrograph calibrated simulations could be better represented in swmm if iws configurations were improved in the model we recommend more testing of underdrain configurations in the swmm lid module to better understand the connection of the iws model representation to the drainage and overflow outputs 4 summary and conclusions the intended application of a bioretention model has a significant impact on model selection and how or if the model is calibrated if the objective of the application is to understand event drainage and overflow volumes from bioretention then swmm is a good choice swmm is capable of modeling event volumes with good to excellent fit in both uncalibrated and calibrated simulations ranging from nse 0 70 to 0 93 for drainage and nse 0 59 to 0 81 for overflow the performance of both models suffered when attempting to model a high temporal resolution time series performing much better for aggregated event volumes however drainage or overflow hydrographs are necessary for applications considering flow dynamics such as stream response combined sewer systems or flooding the hydrograph calibrated drainmod urban performs better than swmm for drainage hydrographs which is not surprising when comparing drainage equations employed by each model swmm performs better than drainmod urban for overflow hydrographs primarily by more closely predicting overflow event peak flow rates drainmod urban benefits more from calibration of drainage and overflow hydrographs in comparison with swmm interestingly in swmm calibration to optimize one hydrologic objective event volumes or hydrographs led to diminished performance of the other objective this presents a choice for swmm users are volumes or hydrographs more important for drainage and or overflow given the application for drainmod urban the hydrograph calibration improves both the volumes and hydrographs of drainage and overflow eliminating a decision between better predicted volumes or hydrographs future bioretention research requires further calibration of drainmod urban and swmm for additional bioretention sites especially with data sets containing more than four overflow events more overflow events need to be analyzed to improve the confidence of statistical conclusions about overflow performance in each model this study only considered one bioretention cell but additional sites need to be modeled to understand how these models behave across a variety of conditions such as storm size drainage configurations and other bioretention design features in particular the iws representation in swmm needs to be investigated further and improved in the model to increase the applicability of the lid module to all bioretention systems sensitivity analysis could also improve understanding of how measurement or estimation of model inputs affect the accuracy of output hydrographs in future work utilizing drainmod urban as an add on tool for swmm would improve drainage hydrographs in swmm and allow for better representation of bioretention cells in watershed scale

3099,solutes and their limited mobilization in heterogeneous porous media may lead to subsurface salinization and contamination evident in various environmental settings previous studies showed that flow and transport driven by pressure waves in porous media under saturated conditions significantly enhance solute displacement compared to drag dominant darcy flow and transport resulting in more thorough remediation however experimental evidence lacks demonstration of such transport under unsaturated conditions we investigate solute leaching in a flow cell experimentally modeling solute displacement from an unsaturated saline fine textured soil region to the surrounding coarse textured soil the extent of mobilization efficiency is evaluated by comparing solute breakthrough measurements between two leaching treatments with drag dominant continuous flux cf and pressure wave pulse flux ppf the results indicate that the ppf treatment provided an additional 75 solute mass that leached from the fine textured region per unit volume of water compared to the cf the effect is partly due to the impact of the pressure waves on water imbibition into the medium the ppf induced relatively high pressure gradients at the wetting front compared to percolation during the cf thus wetting the media in a more spatially uniform pattern consequently the ppf treatment led to higher water content at and behind the front which increased the continuity of the water phase across the fine textured and coarse textured soils and enhanced transport the study is a proof of concept for pressure wave driven flow to enhance local wetting and solute transport in unsaturated soil keywords flow cell leaching pressure pulse solute transport pressure wave unsaturated porous media data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the mechanisms and processes that limit solute mobilization in porous media and in contrast those that may enhance it are an inherent part of environmental issues related to salinization and contamination of the subsurface e g kumar et al 2020 nachshon 2018 limitations of solute displacement in heterogeneous porous formations can be related to the flow regime at different scales with low permeability regions and poorly interconnected pores that limit mobility alongside open pathways that direct transport through preferential flow paths drag dominant darcy flow conditions typical for natural flow in porous media dictate the advection and diffusion dominated zones which can be modeled as mobile and immobile sites respectively šimůnek et al 2003 the mass exchange between such mobile and immobile zones is typically much slower than the mass transport within the mobile region in the context of transport in porous media consider typical soil conditions where the spatial and the temporal scales of advective transport in the mobile phase that most characterize the system are much larger compared to the diffusion dominated exchange rate between the mobile and immobile zones in such scenarios the solutes in the immobile zone are practically stagnant to confront some of the factors limiting the transport of solutes and enhance their mobility from stagnant zones many studies explored ways of altering the flow dynamics by creating abrupt changes in the pore water state and flow some prominent examples of experiments utilizing this concept present the enhanced mobility of solute and tracer transport in columns driven by shockwaves gross et al 2003 acoustic waves vogler chrysikopoulos 2002 and rapidly pulsed flow kahler kabala 2019 similar methods were also successfully employed for mobilizing non aqueous phase liquids napl in porous media to support oil production or aquifer remediation chrysikopoulos vogler 2004 morris 2011 roberts et al 2001 we focus on generating pressure waves compression waves in the soil liquid phase by imposing abrupt pressure perturbations via pulsed water injections into initially unsaturated porous media and studying their impact on wetting dynamics and solute transport this method is based on the notion that a pressure disturbance propagates much faster than the fluid mass although the momentum carried by a pressure fluctuation in the fluid activates mass flow it is limited by the permeability of the medium and requires significantly longer periods than the fast propagating wave does during this pressure wave propagation the pressure fluctuation may attenuate in amplitude still it will continue to propagate at a speed which for incompressible fluids is by orders of magnitude greater than the flow velocity drag dominant fluid velocity is governed by the hydraulic properties that are largely affected by the pore scale geometry and structure of the porous media and therefore susceptible to heterogeneity at different scales in a pressure wave however the wave velocity is significantly influenced by bulk mechanical properties and is practically less affected by the hydraulic properties an abrupt pressure change initiating the wave and propagating in the fluid phase through the porous medium alters the fluid momentum balance and thereby generates a period of inertia dominant flow in stagnant sites sorek bear 1990 under these conditions the flow is no longer laminar therefore the impact of pore size magnitude and distribution on the flow field decreases which reduces the influence of hydraulic properties on the flow consequently with the rise of the inertia the macroscopic fluid velocity field becomes more spatially homogeneous leading to more uniform mass transport nissan berkowitz 2018 the transition to inertia dominant flow and the transient flow conditions also affect pore scale processes by altering streamlines that would otherwise not include poorly connected pores hence increasing the mixing between poorly connected and well connected pores i e immobile and mobile sites respectively kahler kabala 2016 furthermore the propagation of a perturbation in the pore pressure creates unsynchronized displacements of the solid and liquid phases biot 1962 the different pressure wave velocities related to the different elasticities of the bulk porous media and the phases that compose it lead to local changes in the pore volume contributing to flow in otherwise stagnant pores lo et al 2012 previous studies utilized pressure waves in the fluid phase for mobilizing solutes or different constituents only in saturated porous media thus there is a lack of experimental demonstration and knowledge of how pressure waves affect solute displacement under unsaturated conditions altering the overall transport such experiments are essential for understanding the mechanisms and processes of pressure wave driven transport in the vadose zone and provide knowledge for future development of techniques and tools for enhancing solute mobilization in unsaturated conditions despite the higher attenuation of pressure waves in the water phase as the saturation level decreases still a significant pressure increase can be created and propagated by adapting the wave characteristics amplitude frequency to the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the medium at varying water contents kalisman et al 2019 steeb et al 2014 moreover in addition to the effect that pressure waves have in saturated conditions of altering the flow dynamics of the water phase in unsaturated conditions these also impact the water distribution thereby changing the imbibition characteristics of the medium for example in drag dominant infiltration scenarios where the water at the source is at atmospheric pressure the imbibition and redistribution are driven by capillary and gravitational forces hillel 1980 in contrast with abrupt pressure changes at the water source generating pressure waves in the liquid phase water pressure at the source boundary may be above atmospheric and the pressure gradients in the medium can be significantly larger than those under capillary and gravitational forcing consequently different mechanisms such as inertia sorek bear 1990 become dominant players under pressure wave driven flow in unsaturated conditions displacing water into air filled regions and mobilizing solutes within those regions transport in unsaturated media strongly depends on the pore microscopic water distribution and bulk macroscopic water content which dictate the connectivity of the water phase thus water content and distribution are substantial properties that influence solute mobility and the characteristics of the flow itself padilla et al 1999 with the flow regime significantly affecting the transport within the phase and the water distribution setting the geometry of the phase the objective of this study was to experimentally test and demonstrate the ability to enhance solute displacement from low mobility regions by pressure wave driven imbibition and flow in unsaturated soil conditions the study is focused on laboratory experiments in a flow cell filled with sand surrounding a low permeability loess inclusion we examine the possibility of enhancing solute leaching from this initially saline low permeability immobile region during infiltration into the dry media the water flow and solute displacement occur due to either a continuous water flux or pressured water pulses injected at the soil surface the primary purpose of this examination is to elucidate the impact of pressure wave driven flow on the wetting and solute transport in heterogeneous unsaturated porous media eventually achieving more extensive and efficient solute mobilization 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup we used flow cells to study water distribution and solute displacement under two flow applications continuous flux cf and pressure pulse flux ppf with water applied in abrupt pressure pulses the flow cell was 31 5 cm high and 26 5 cm wide with a 2 cm aperture fig 1 between the front and back glass walls the cell was sealed from the sides the bottom was closed for holding the material but had open narrow slits and small holes to allow seepage and leaching and the top part open to the atmosphere the cell was dry packed with clean quartz sand s250 agat minerals ltd surrounding a loess soil sandy clay loam nachshon 2016 inclusion that was mixed with powdered nacl at a mass fraction of 0 04 gr gr the loess inclusion was 2 cm high extending between 6 5 cm and 8 5 cm from the surface top of the cell the inclusion was 6 cm wide in the lateral direction located at the cell s center and filling the entire cell aperture 2 cm a water volume of 5 6 ml which is equivalent to 0 6 pore volume of the loess inclusion is the minimum amount of water required to completely dissolve the salt in the loess at standard conditions hirschfelder et al 1964 the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the sand and loess are 0 5 and 0 02 cm min respectively table s3 supporting information during the experiment after the loess is saturated we expect marginal variations in the hydraulic conductivity of the loess with changes in solute concentration due to the swelling of the clay fraction initially increasing the conductivity due to dissolution of the salts and later decreasing as solutes transport out of the loess these were neglected from the analysis the total pore volume of the sand and the loess in the cell is estimated at 650 cm3 during the experiment both treatments received an average volumetric flow rate of 2 ml min of distilled water applied at the center of the soil surface at the top of the cell the cf was controlled with a peristaltic pump gilson minipuls 3 releasing drops entering the soil at atmospheric pressure in the ppf treatment the water was emitted by pulses through a solenoid valve wic fast response electric solenoid valve connected to a pressurized water container 2 bar the ppf was applied by opening the valve for a 50 ms duration at 1 min intervals with an automatic controller issuing 2 ml per pulse a custom porous cylinder 2 cm length and 1 5 cm diameter average pore radius of 0 1 mm was designed for issuing water into the medium at the top surface the cylinder was positioned horizontally with its circular faces sealed and facing the cell glass walls to minimize flow perpendicular to the direction of the impenetrable walls the bottom half of the cylinder was perforated penetrating the soil to a depth of 0 75 cm from the surface this apparatus enabled water to enter the soil during the short rapid flow periods of the pulses preventing ponding or structural alteration of the soil surface and spreading the water uniformly over the aperture of the cell the distance of the low permeability saline loess inclusion from the pressure pulse source 5 75 7 75 cm from top to bottom of the inclusion was chosen in compliance with the spatial scale of the pressure attenuation and the impact of water content on that attenuation the characteristic pressure wave attenuation in the quartz sand media above and surrounding the loess inclusion was assessed in dedicated column experiments and modeling section 1 in appendix a these assessments show that if the water content is above a certain value expected in the vicinity of the water source significant pressure perturbations can be induced in the pore water over the scale of 10 cm with a sufficiently large pressure perturbation generated at the source we used time domain transmissometry acclima digital tdt sensors to evaluate the leaching of solutes from the loess inclusion downward in the cell two tdt sensors were installed at two depths below the inclusion fig 1 to measure the concentration of solutes that leached out of the loess inclusion the tdt measurement provided the volumetric water content θ l3 l3 and bulk electrical conductivity ecb m 1l 3t3i2 of the sand the electrical conductivity of the pore water ecw was evaluated from ecb using a known calibrated relationship the measurements of each sensor represent approximately a volume average of 7 cm height by 15 cm width by 2 cm cell aperture blonquist et al 2005 the top sensor was placed so that its measurement volume began at a depth of about 2 cm below the bottom of the loess inclusion 10 5 cm from the surface centered and the lower sensor was placed so that its measurement volume was just below the top measurement 17 5 cm from the surface centered a data acquisition system cr6 campbell scientific controlled the solenoid valve and collected the data from the sensors at 1 min intervals complementary to these measurements snapshots of the cell through its glass side using an openmv cam h7 were obtained to track the spatial wetting patterns visually the experiments were repeated seven times for each treatment cf and ppf 2 2 solute mass balance the tdt sensors provide in situ measurements with minimal disturbance to the flow we use these for estimating the solute mass leached down from the inclusion the solute mass at a given volume is calculated from θ and ecw which correlate with solute concentration adamson 1979 the value of θ is determined from the tdt measurement via the bulk soil permittivity topp et al 1980 and ecw is estimated using an empirical relationship that correlates it with the sensor measurements of ecb temperature and permittivity hilhorst 2000 given by 1 e c w ec b ε w ε b ε 0 b where εw m 1l 3t4i2 is the permittivity of water a function of water temperature εb is the permittivity of the bulk porous media and ε 0 b is an empiric soil specific parameter before the flow cell experiment the sensors were calibrated with the quartz sand over the expected experimental concentration range under different water contents thereby estimating ε 0 b as a fixed value details on the calibration procedure and evaluation of ε 0 b are in the supporting information the calibrated measurements provided for a sensor based estimation of the mass of solutes correlated to the estimated water content for each sensor measurement considering local variations in the water content and fluxes within the cell and the measurement volume of the tdt throughout the experiment additional analysis and assumptions are required to assess the solute mass flux in the cell from these measurements thus we added a complementary mass balance evaluation scheme for which we make the following assumptions 1 most of the solutes leached out of the loess inclusion moved downward in the main flow direction within the cell parallel to the walls 2 the measurement volume captured most of the solutes in the horizontal layer of the cell at its depth although the sensor only detects the middle 57 of the cells width we assume that with the width of the inclusion 23 of cell width and the direction of flow assumption 1 the extent of solutes that bypasses the measurement volume close to the sides of the cell is negligible 3 the bottom of the upper measurement volume and the top of the lower measurement volume are bordering neglecting either a slight overlap or gap between the measurements 4 during the experiment most of the solutes that leached downward remained within the measurement volume of the sensors this assumption weakens toward the end of the experiment as the bottom measurement does not reach the bottom of the cell to avoid boundary effects we are aware of this and address it with a complementing numerical model for the analysis under these assumptions we use the joint measurement volumes of the two sensors as a control volume for the balance of the solute mass where the solute input is considered mainly through the surface of the top boundary of the measurement volume of the top sensor fig 1 red the validity of these assumptions is addressed with a numerical model presented in the results and discussion and the supporting information sections 2 3 numerical simulation numerical modeling was conducted to simulate the flow and solute transport under the drag dominant flow treatment to validate the experimental conditions and assess the influence of the flux on solute transport in a cf driven system we considered a two dimensional domain with dimensions of the height and width of the cell modeling flow and transport in the flow cell by numerically solving the richards equation and the advection dispersion equation ade using the hydrus 2d software šimůnek et al 2006 we assumed uniformity across the cell aperture third dimension the supporting information provides a detailed description of the numerical model the simulation scenario and the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 water content and solute concentration results are presented for a duration of 120 min from the beginning of wetting during which 240 ml of water equal to 0 37 pore volume of the cell was applied to the top surface of the flow cell at the end of this period the water did not reach the bottom impermeable boundary of the cell fig 2 depicts the water content and ecw of the two sensors top and bottom orange and blue lines respectively with average and standard error values evaluated from the seven repetitions for each treatment these results are the sensor volume averaged values and are expected not to be uniformly distributed across the measured volume although the experiments were identically prepared using the same protocol for both treatments and their repetitions specifically for dry packing of the soils and placing the sensors in the cell variations from uncontrolled layering are expected however we anticipated that such variations would be consistent between the treatments to allow averaging over multiple experiment repetitions the measured volumetric water content θ is presented as effective saturation se fig 2 a and b top panel defined as 2 se θ θ r θ s θ r with the residual and saturated water contents θr and θs respectively table s3 supporting information a shift in the arrival time of the wetting front at each depth is evident between the treatments with significantly faster propagation for the cf treatment because the average flux entering the cell at the soil surface is equal in both treatments the shift in arrival time implies a difference in the average water content of the wetted region i e the same volume of water in a different bulk volume these differences in the wetting time comply with the measured se values of the wetted area towards the end of the 120 min period both sensors exhibit a steady water content in the cf treatment with similar se values of 0 25 fig 2a in the ppf treatment however the maximal value of se measured by the top sensor is 0 5 fig 2b approximately double the maximal value in the cf treatment in unsaturated conditions higher water content increases the connectivity within the water phase which increases the hydrodynamic dispersion and the mixing between the water in the loess inclusion and the water in the sand freeze cherry 1979 solute concentration in the pore water depicted by the ecw values in fig 2 plots c and d rises simultaneously with the arrival of the wetting front evident in both sensors and treatments thus mobilization of solutes out of the loess inclusion initiates almost immediately with the arrival of the water in the top sensor a sharp rise of ecw is observed in both treatments towards the peak followed by a moderate decline whereas the increase in ecw follows the arrival of the wetting front in both treatments it exhibits significantly higher concentrations ecw values for the ppf treatment a decrease in concentration following the peak can be related to two major processes i mobilization of the solute peak with more solutes transported out from the measured volume than new arrivals and ii smearing of the peak concentration because of dilution with more net water entering the measured volume compared to the net solutes we evaluate the contribution of each of these processes through the ecw values of the bottom sensor in the cf treatment the trends of ecw values are similar in both sensors top and bottom with similar slopes of ecw over time after the arrival of the wetting front fig 2c this implies that in this case of the cf treatment the dominant process is the mobilization of the peak concentration which migrates downward with the propagating wetting front at a moderate pace fig 2a for the ppf treatment however the rise of ecw values that follow the arrival of the wetting front appears blunt at the bottom sensor compared to the sharp increase observed in the top sensor thus although the wetting front reached that depth of the bottom sensor most of the solutes remain in the measured volume of the top sensor consequently we infer that the dominant process responsible for the observed changes in the peak concentrations in the ppf treatment is the smearing of the peak due to dilution considering these differences and the significant disparities in the appearance of ecw between the top and bottom sensor during the ppf treatment we conclude that the solute peak travels separately from the wetting front in the ppf treatment as opposed to their matching appearance in the cf treatment it appears that the solute exchange between the loess and the sand under the cf treatment occurs mainly during the wetting process at the same time the ppf induces significant transport between the regions also post wetting thus in addition to the superior wetting that the ppf treatment achieved it enhanced transport in the wetted region behind the wetting front partly this may be related to the enhanced wetting and connectivity within the wet area yet it is also in line with previous work that studied saturated conditions and showed that abrupt pressure perturbations enhance transport in saturated porous media e g lo et al 2012 kahler kabala 2019 sorek bear 1990 we hypothesize on the mechanisms associated with wetting under the ppf and their impact on the distribution of water and solute displacement leading to the disparities from the results of the drag dominant flow cf treatment first the abrupt change of pressure at the source where the medium is practically saturated creates a disturbance in the momentum of the water phase in the momentum balance the pressure gradient is not in equilibrium with the velocity field and the viscous drag thus initiating a pressure wave sorek bear 1990 under these conditions the momentary mass flux in the water phase is much larger than would be possible under drag dominant flow where permeability limits such high flux magnitudes biot 1962 with the pressure wave propagation relatively high pressure perturbations can reach the vicinity of the wetting front allowing for sharp pressure gradients within the water phase to reach the interface with the air these pressure gradients are significantly larger than those under gravitational and capillary forces wang et al 1998 sorek 1996 since these pressure gradients govern the imbibition they introduce a more spatially uniform and stable wetting pattern philip 1975 under these conditions the impact of the capillary forces on imbibition at the wetting front is relatively low therefore the wetting phase is expected to propagate more homogenously through the pores with less influence of the pore size on the wetting front and the water distribution biswas et al 2018 this can lead to higher saturation levels of the wetted media behind the wetting front by reducing air entrapment during the wetting process and consequently higher water content at the bulk scale than during the cf treatment additionally in unsaturated conditions the pressure rise of the traveling wave temporarily reduces the matric pressure which until the excess pressure dissipates can lead to an increase in water content similarly this can be explained as a nonequilibrium capillarity effect hassanizadeh gray 1990 the pressure buildup following the pressure wave in the liquid water phase causes for local nonequilibrium compared to hydrostatic conditions between the pressures of the water and the air this is balanced with the rate of change of saturation and as the equilibrium is more disturbed the saturation changes more rapidly and accordingly the local saturation will increase until the equilibrium is restored the magnitude of the pressure disturbance in the case herein is much larger compared to capillary flow therefore we observe a relatively large rate of change in saturation which results in higher water contents in the wetting process the pressure waves induced by the pressured water pulses at the source in conjunction with the raised water content within the media have a coupled positive feedback effect the higher water content allows the propagation of the pressure waves with less attenuation over distance kalisman et al 2019 thus as water content elevates the pressure pulses at the source generate more significant pressure perturbations up to and at the wetting front resulting in a more stable propagation of the front and again increasing saturation of the newly wetted area a more detailed description of this mechanism and some sample pressure measurements from preliminary experiments are presented in section 2 of appendix a 3 2 leaching efficiency we use the data from the two sensors to examine the mass of the dissolved solids mds that leached out of the loess inclusion and normalize it relative to the total solute mass mds0 the mds values are evaluated for the control volume at the lower part of the cell under the assumptions 1 4 mentioned in the materials and methods subsection using measured water content and solute concentration in the water from the ecw fig 3 depicts the relative mass as the ratio between mds leached and mds0 the results indicate that the solute mass that leached downward from the loess inclusion is 70 and 40 of the solutes initially placed in the inclusion for the ppf and cf treatments respectively although the solute breakthrough in the ppf treatment begins 10 min later than in cf treatment corresponding to the differences in the wetting front propagation between them eventually the leaching efficiency per volume of water of the ppf treatment significantly exceeds that of the cf treatment in both treatments not all the solutes leached from the inclusion during the experiment some solute mass remained inside the inclusion at the end of the experiment verified by post experiment destructive sampling data not shown however the total amount of salts removed from the inclusion during the experiment period in each treatment indicates that extracting solutes from the inclusion is significantly greater 75 with the ppf treatment than with the cf treatment thus the ppf treatment provides a more efficient method for mobilizing and leaching salts both in solute per water mass during flow and in the overall fraction of the solutes removed comparing the solute breakthrough between the measurements from the cf treatment to those predicted by numerical simulations we conclude that the flow and transport of the cf treatment are well assessed by the richards equation and ade fig 3 and fig s2a supporting information thus complying with conditions of drag dominant flow the numerical model also supports the validity of the mass balance assumptions in section 2 2 solute mass balance sustaining that the significant difference in leaching efficiency between the treatments originates from the different flow regimes to further test this we conducted additional simulations varying the flux to examine the influence of lower or higher flux intensities and pulse fluxes yet under a drag dominant flow model on the leaching efficiency in the system the results show that these variations had an insignificant influence on leaching fig s2b s2c supporting information which remained like the continuous flux treatment across the different variations these results prove that the significant advantage in leaching efficiency gained with the ppf treatment over that of the cf treatment is related to the flow conditions induced by the pressure waves and their different characteristics from drag dominant flow not the variations in flow intensity or experimental setting 3 3 visualization of wetting pattern we complement our findings with a visual assessment of the loess inclusion and its surroundings using a series of snapshots taken from the transparent side of the flow cell during the experiments fig 4 depicts an example from 60 min in the experiment comparing the two treatments cf fig 4a and ppf fig 4b once the water reaches and penetrates the inclusion it is retained there for two main reasons 1 due to the capillary barrier at the bottom interface of the loess inclusion resulting from the difference in the capillary force between it and that of the sand below and 2 the significantly smaller hydraulic conductivity of the dry sand compared to the wet loess delaying water flow down from the inclusion stormont anderson 1999 consequently after the wetting of the loess inclusion the lower boundary of the inclusion at the interface between the wet loess and the dry sand becomes an obstacle for downward water flow limiting the flow and transport in both treatments however while in the ppf treatment most of the flow in the sand is maintained along the boundary with the inclusion including the bottom boundary that is not the case in the cf treatment where the flow appears more spatially dispersed and the wetting pattern exhibits lateral spreading in the direction of the sides of the cell this pattern of imbibition influences the wetting of the sand below the inclusion in the cf treatment the sand below the inclusion remains dry for a more extended period compared to that of the ppf treatment drier conditions in the sand below the interface with the loess inclusion imply that a smaller water interface area exists there through which solutes may transport by advection and dispersion out of the loess as hypothesized previously we relate this to the difference in water distribution in the sand for the cf and ppf in the ppf treatment the pressure gradients of the increased pore water pressure are higher sorek 1996 wang et al 1998 and contribute to a more even spreading of water philip 1975 and consequently to a more moderate propagation of the wetting front biswas et al 2018 thus the wetting front is less disturbed when it encounters an interference such as the inclusion in addition we observe that the size of the wetted area itself is different between treatments although the same average flux is applied in both treatments the observed wetted region is consistently larger for the cf treatment fig 4 this supports the sensor measurements of water content fig 2a b indicating that the water content in the pressure pulse treatment is significantly higher within the wetted regions thus contributing to solute mobility in the water phase 4 summary and conclusions solute leaching in heterogeneous soil is complicated since solutes can be practically trapped in immobile zones such as in low permeability regions with water being the main carrier solute displacement can differ substantially between regions depending on their facilitation of mobility even in cases where intervention in the flow is conducted to impact solutes trapped in immobile sites it is challenging to increase mobilization without investing a significant amount of water and relying on diffusion to spatially even out the concentration we propose a pressure pulses method ppf to generate pressure wave driven wetting flow and transport targeting low mobility regions we demonstrate the solute leaching efficiency of the method by increasing the mass of solutes removed per amount of invested water compared to continuous darcy type drag dominant flow cf to the best of our knowledge this study is the first experimental effort presenting the merits of transport driven by pressure waves in unsaturated and heterogeneous porous media specifically demonstrating the ability to increase solutes leaching from a low mobility zone under these conditions the infiltration displays different wetting patterns under the cf and ppf treatments we show that higher water content is achieved behind the wetting front when pressure pulses are applied compared to the infiltration and redistribution following water application by a continuous flux we relate the higher wetting to the pressure gradients formed at the wetting front following the abrupt pressure changes which enhance the invasion of the water into the air filled pores on top of capillary and gravitational forces that govern the flow in drag dominant conditions the greater pressure gradients at the wetting front during the ppf treatment weaken the impact of the capillary forces on water invasion into the pores therefore the magnitude of pore sizes and the pore size distribution have a relatively small effect on the water imbibition this leads to a more uniform wetting and propagation of the wetting front with fewer air filled pores behind it although the mobilization of solutes under pressure wave driven flow is the immediate context of this study the resulting phenomenon of increasing water content in a low retention porous medium due to pressure pulses application may also be of interest as a practice to decrease deep infiltration in such soils the leaching efficiency gained by applying pressure pulses was assessed by comparing it to the control treatment with a continuous water source the measurements of the control treatment were complemented with a numerical model supporting information showing that the flow and transport of this treatment are well simulated by the richards and ade equations the ppf treatment significantly influenced solute displacement compared to the cf treatment leaching 75 more solutes from the immobile region per volume of water invested 70 and 40 of the solutes initially in the inclusion removed by the pressure pulses and continuous flux treatments respectively we relate the increase in solute leaching driven by ppf to the following mechanisms wetting is less sensitive to the domain geometry and the pore sizes of the media leading to more homogeneous water distribution thus regions below immobile sites which would stay relatively dry under drag dominant flow due to macroscopic heterogeneity display higher water content under pressure wave imbibition increasing solute exchange at the interface the high water content in the medium after imbibition i improves the connectivity of low mobility sites and ii increases the hydraulic conductivity which results in locally higher advective and diffusive fluxes the pressure excitation within the water phase creates local fluxes that increase mass exchange between conductive regions and otherwise stagnant sites noteworthy is that these experiments were conducted under fairly stable conditions especially the initial water content and the geometry for a better understanding of the investigated dynamics different initial water distributions and other experimental scenarios should be considered in the future for quantifying their effect on the pressure wave induced transport previous experimental evidence supports the feasibility of enhancing solute mobilization in porous media through water subject to abrupt pressure excitation however examples of this phenomenon under unsaturated and heterogeneous conditions are absent to date we suggest that the results of this study provide a proof of concept for developing pressure wave driven wetting and

we thank prof ofer dahan for his continuous interest and support and our fruitful discussions appendix a propagation of pore water pressure waves and influence on water distribution a 1 calibrating the experimental setup to the spatial scale of pressure waves in porous media pressure waves in the pore water attenuate almost entirely over a distance of a few decimeters in unsaturated porous media the attenuation increases as the media are drier in our experimental setup we wanted to achieve significant pressure perturbations in the water phase up to at least the distance of the lower conductivity inclusion where the salt is placed see section 2 1 experimental setup thereby affecting the wetting and transport at that region therefore for the pressure pulses created by the solenoid pressure source in the experiment we attempt to predict the spatial attenuation of the wave amplitude and assess the order of magnitude expected for the pressure perturbations in the setup using a 1d analytical equation for the pressure wave amplitude attenuation kalisman et al 2019 we consider the pressure p ml 1t 2 at a given distance d l relative to the magnitude of the source pressure p0 given as a 1 p p 0 1 j i 1 j e γ r i d where γ is an absorption coefficient related to hydraulic and mechanical properties of the medium and wave attributes ri l is a group of characteristic capillary sizes representing the pore size distribution of the medium and j is the number of water filled capillary groups which is a function of water content and the chosen discretization of the medium given the equation parameters and assuming complete continuity of the water phase which limits the model to high water contents we can assess the attenuation at varying water contents to calibrate the equation to the quartz sand used in the experiment we conduct pressure measurements honeywell pressure transducers nbp series of the pore water in a sand packed column using a method similar to the one described in kalisman et al 2019 we can extract the absorption coefficient γ with pressure measurements taken at different distances from the pressure source during a pressure pulse in a saturated medium and measured properties of the quartz sand resulting with ri fig a 1 blue markers once calibrated we use eq a 1 for predicting the spatial pressure attenuation under different water contents for validation additional pressure measurements were conducted in an initially dry setup during a wetting procedure driven by periodic pressured water pulses as described in section 2 1 experimental setup after the passing of the wetting front the water content of the wetted region behind the front stabilized and was estimated using two methods i using the soil matric potential measured with the pressure transducers and calculating the water content through the known water retention curve of the sand and ii by destructive sampling after the experiments and evaluating the water content by oven drying the sand the resulting effective saturation se eq 2 was 0 87 and 0 85 for the first and second methods respectively we used a value of se 0 85 for the model with the resulting attenuation of the pressure pulse magnitude at this water content in good agreement with the measurements fig a 1 red markers in the two dimensional flow cell experiment the attenuation per distance is expected to be more significant due to increased cross section area of the water phase farther from the source however considering these results fig a 1 even with an additional reduction in the pressure magnitude we assume that the perturbations are not completely attenuated at this spatial scale of 10 cm from the source therefore we can potentially achieve significant pressure perturbations in the water phase by adjusting the pressure at the boundary theoretically reaching higher pressure magnitudes farther from the source is possible by accounting for the attenuation and increasing the pressure magnitude at the source however in practice we are limited in the pressure applied at the source in the soil surface vicinity the soil surface is unconfined and higher pressures in this region may intrude the soil structure and or flood the surface near the water source in preliminary experiments we could safely reach pressure pulses at a magnitude of 2 bar above atmospheric and a duration of 50 ms without altering the packed quartz sand as pressure magnitudes increase and pulse durations lengthen from these values we observed that the packing structure close to the source is affected and flooding occurs after the pulse application a 2 impact on wetting and water content aside from the influences of pressure perturbations on flow dynamics within the water phase we use the experimental observations to hypothesize how these perturbations influence the wetting mechanism we examine the profile of the pore water pressure measurements over time during the wetting of the quartz sand column fig a 2 the pressured water pulses are delivered into the sand close to the surface in 1 min intervals the pressure is measured at two distances from the surface steady pressure values are observed before the wetting front reaches the measurement locations around 9 min at 4 5 cm and 12 min at 6 5 cm these values do not represent the pore water pressure because the water in these sensors is not hydraulically connected with the pore water in the column at the beginning of the experiment yet even at this stage we can already identify small excitations in the pressure appearing at the interval of the pulses 1 min they are either transferred through the air or the solid and create fluctuations in the water within the sensor when the area around the sensor is wetted sufficient hydraulic continuity is attained between the sensor and the pore water and the background pressure drops to the value of the matric potential of the soil appearing slightly different between the two measurement points gradually the magnitude of the pressure perturbations from the low value before the jump to the peak pressure is amplified over time as the water content up to the measurement point increases and the wave amplitude is less attenuated eventually the water content stabilizes and the pressure amplitude becomes consistent converting the pressure to units of the hydraulic head reveals the perturbations values are about 10 and 8 cm at a distance of 4 5 and 6 5 cm respectively to assess the possible impact of these perturbations on the resulting local water content we compare it to the water content achieved for the same effective flux but applied as a continuous source for this quartz sand the effective saturation is predicted and measured at about se 0 7 if for example we analyze the depth of 6 5 cm under the described experimental conditions and use the retention curve of this sand to correlate between pressure and water content we can simulate the evolution of the water content as the pressure perturbations alter the effective matric pressure fig a 3 initially the pressure perturbation magnitude reaching this depth is equivalent to about 4 cm head potentially increasing se from 0 7 to 0 73 after a while as the water content is elevated to this higher value the pressure waves would be less attenuated the magnitude of the perturbations will increase and so on if the pressure is not attenuated this positive feedback effect could eventually lead to saturated conditions at any depth however as the pressure is attenuated with distance the pressure perturbations become smaller and their impact on water content decreases and becomes negligible moreover the soil structure is complex and other properties impact pressure propagation and wetting for example because water enters soil regions that are partially wetted the entrance of new water depends on the local geometry it may not increase the water content if there is trapped air and the pressure will generate flow into the less wetted region the water retention curve represents hydrostatic conditions and cannot actually capture the water content and capillary pressure relationship in conditions of rapid water pressure perturbations and flow nevertheless we use it as a conceptual model for representing the potential local water content change that can be achieved under each pressure rise the excess pressure does not attenuate instantaneously so it can impact the wetting of dry pores in the vicinity of the water phase as it disturbs the preexisting capillary balance readdressing the wetting front propagation and its arrival time at the two depths fig a 2 we can observe that the velocity slightly increases with depth 0 5 cm min up to 4 5 cm and about 0 54 cm min at 6 5 cm as the effective flux at the boundary is constant these changes in pore water velocity imply a difference in the water distribution and local changes of water content with higher water content related to lower pore water velocity considering that the magnitudes of the pressure perturbations decrease with distance and in light of the above analysis it is reasonable that the increase in water content is smaller as the wetting front gets farther from the pressure source appendix b supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j

3099,solutes and their limited mobilization in heterogeneous porous media may lead to subsurface salinization and contamination evident in various environmental settings previous studies showed that flow and transport driven by pressure waves in porous media under saturated conditions significantly enhance solute displacement compared to drag dominant darcy flow and transport resulting in more thorough remediation however experimental evidence lacks demonstration of such transport under unsaturated conditions we investigate solute leaching in a flow cell experimentally modeling solute displacement from an unsaturated saline fine textured soil region to the surrounding coarse textured soil the extent of mobilization efficiency is evaluated by comparing solute breakthrough measurements between two leaching treatments with drag dominant continuous flux cf and pressure wave pulse flux ppf the results indicate that the ppf treatment provided an additional 75 solute mass that leached from the fine textured region per unit volume of water compared to the cf the effect is partly due to the impact of the pressure waves on water imbibition into the medium the ppf induced relatively high pressure gradients at the wetting front compared to percolation during the cf thus wetting the media in a more spatially uniform pattern consequently the ppf treatment led to higher water content at and behind the front which increased the continuity of the water phase across the fine textured and coarse textured soils and enhanced transport the study is a proof of concept for pressure wave driven flow to enhance local wetting and solute transport in unsaturated soil keywords flow cell leaching pressure pulse solute transport pressure wave unsaturated porous media data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the mechanisms and processes that limit solute mobilization in porous media and in contrast those that may enhance it are an inherent part of environmental issues related to salinization and contamination of the subsurface e g kumar et al 2020 nachshon 2018 limitations of solute displacement in heterogeneous porous formations can be related to the flow regime at different scales with low permeability regions and poorly interconnected pores that limit mobility alongside open pathways that direct transport through preferential flow paths drag dominant darcy flow conditions typical for natural flow in porous media dictate the advection and diffusion dominated zones which can be modeled as mobile and immobile sites respectively šimůnek et al 2003 the mass exchange between such mobile and immobile zones is typically much slower than the mass transport within the mobile region in the context of transport in porous media consider typical soil conditions where the spatial and the temporal scales of advective transport in the mobile phase that most characterize the system are much larger compared to the diffusion dominated exchange rate between the mobile and immobile zones in such scenarios the solutes in the immobile zone are practically stagnant to confront some of the factors limiting the transport of solutes and enhance their mobility from stagnant zones many studies explored ways of altering the flow dynamics by creating abrupt changes in the pore water state and flow some prominent examples of experiments utilizing this concept present the enhanced mobility of solute and tracer transport in columns driven by shockwaves gross et al 2003 acoustic waves vogler chrysikopoulos 2002 and rapidly pulsed flow kahler kabala 2019 similar methods were also successfully employed for mobilizing non aqueous phase liquids napl in porous media to support oil production or aquifer remediation chrysikopoulos vogler 2004 morris 2011 roberts et al 2001 we focus on generating pressure waves compression waves in the soil liquid phase by imposing abrupt pressure perturbations via pulsed water injections into initially unsaturated porous media and studying their impact on wetting dynamics and solute transport this method is based on the notion that a pressure disturbance propagates much faster than the fluid mass although the momentum carried by a pressure fluctuation in the fluid activates mass flow it is limited by the permeability of the medium and requires significantly longer periods than the fast propagating wave does during this pressure wave propagation the pressure fluctuation may attenuate in amplitude still it will continue to propagate at a speed which for incompressible fluids is by orders of magnitude greater than the flow velocity drag dominant fluid velocity is governed by the hydraulic properties that are largely affected by the pore scale geometry and structure of the porous media and therefore susceptible to heterogeneity at different scales in a pressure wave however the wave velocity is significantly influenced by bulk mechanical properties and is practically less affected by the hydraulic properties an abrupt pressure change initiating the wave and propagating in the fluid phase through the porous medium alters the fluid momentum balance and thereby generates a period of inertia dominant flow in stagnant sites sorek bear 1990 under these conditions the flow is no longer laminar therefore the impact of pore size magnitude and distribution on the flow field decreases which reduces the influence of hydraulic properties on the flow consequently with the rise of the inertia the macroscopic fluid velocity field becomes more spatially homogeneous leading to more uniform mass transport nissan berkowitz 2018 the transition to inertia dominant flow and the transient flow conditions also affect pore scale processes by altering streamlines that would otherwise not include poorly connected pores hence increasing the mixing between poorly connected and well connected pores i e immobile and mobile sites respectively kahler kabala 2016 furthermore the propagation of a perturbation in the pore pressure creates unsynchronized displacements of the solid and liquid phases biot 1962 the different pressure wave velocities related to the different elasticities of the bulk porous media and the phases that compose it lead to local changes in the pore volume contributing to flow in otherwise stagnant pores lo et al 2012 previous studies utilized pressure waves in the fluid phase for mobilizing solutes or different constituents only in saturated porous media thus there is a lack of experimental demonstration and knowledge of how pressure waves affect solute displacement under unsaturated conditions altering the overall transport such experiments are essential for understanding the mechanisms and processes of pressure wave driven transport in the vadose zone and provide knowledge for future development of techniques and tools for enhancing solute mobilization in unsaturated conditions despite the higher attenuation of pressure waves in the water phase as the saturation level decreases still a significant pressure increase can be created and propagated by adapting the wave characteristics amplitude frequency to the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the medium at varying water contents kalisman et al 2019 steeb et al 2014 moreover in addition to the effect that pressure waves have in saturated conditions of altering the flow dynamics of the water phase in unsaturated conditions these also impact the water distribution thereby changing the imbibition characteristics of the medium for example in drag dominant infiltration scenarios where the water at the source is at atmospheric pressure the imbibition and redistribution are driven by capillary and gravitational forces hillel 1980 in contrast with abrupt pressure changes at the water source generating pressure waves in the liquid phase water pressure at the source boundary may be above atmospheric and the pressure gradients in the medium can be significantly larger than those under capillary and gravitational forcing consequently different mechanisms such as inertia sorek bear 1990 become dominant players under pressure wave driven flow in unsaturated conditions displacing water into air filled regions and mobilizing solutes within those regions transport in unsaturated media strongly depends on the pore microscopic water distribution and bulk macroscopic water content which dictate the connectivity of the water phase thus water content and distribution are substantial properties that influence solute mobility and the characteristics of the flow itself padilla et al 1999 with the flow regime significantly affecting the transport within the phase and the water distribution setting the geometry of the phase the objective of this study was to experimentally test and demonstrate the ability to enhance solute displacement from low mobility regions by pressure wave driven imbibition and flow in unsaturated soil conditions the study is focused on laboratory experiments in a flow cell filled with sand surrounding a low permeability loess inclusion we examine the possibility of enhancing solute leaching from this initially saline low permeability immobile region during infiltration into the dry media the water flow and solute displacement occur due to either a continuous water flux or pressured water pulses injected at the soil surface the primary purpose of this examination is to elucidate the impact of pressure wave driven flow on the wetting and solute transport in heterogeneous unsaturated porous media eventually achieving more extensive and efficient solute mobilization 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup we used flow cells to study water distribution and solute displacement under two flow applications continuous flux cf and pressure pulse flux ppf with water applied in abrupt pressure pulses the flow cell was 31 5 cm high and 26 5 cm wide with a 2 cm aperture fig 1 between the front and back glass walls the cell was sealed from the sides the bottom was closed for holding the material but had open narrow slits and small holes to allow seepage and leaching and the top part open to the atmosphere the cell was dry packed with clean quartz sand s250 agat minerals ltd surrounding a loess soil sandy clay loam nachshon 2016 inclusion that was mixed with powdered nacl at a mass fraction of 0 04 gr gr the loess inclusion was 2 cm high extending between 6 5 cm and 8 5 cm from the surface top of the cell the inclusion was 6 cm wide in the lateral direction located at the cell s center and filling the entire cell aperture 2 cm a water volume of 5 6 ml which is equivalent to 0 6 pore volume of the loess inclusion is the minimum amount of water required to completely dissolve the salt in the loess at standard conditions hirschfelder et al 1964 the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the sand and loess are 0 5 and 0 02 cm min respectively table s3 supporting information during the experiment after the loess is saturated we expect marginal variations in the hydraulic conductivity of the loess with changes in solute concentration due to the swelling of the clay fraction initially increasing the conductivity due to dissolution of the salts and later decreasing as solutes transport out of the loess these were neglected from the analysis the total pore volume of the sand and the loess in the cell is estimated at 650 cm3 during the experiment both treatments received an average volumetric flow rate of 2 ml min of distilled water applied at the center of the soil surface at the top of the cell the cf was controlled with a peristaltic pump gilson minipuls 3 releasing drops entering the soil at atmospheric pressure in the ppf treatment the water was emitted by pulses through a solenoid valve wic fast response electric solenoid valve connected to a pressurized water container 2 bar the ppf was applied by opening the valve for a 50 ms duration at 1 min intervals with an automatic controller issuing 2 ml per pulse a custom porous cylinder 2 cm length and 1 5 cm diameter average pore radius of 0 1 mm was designed for issuing water into the medium at the top surface the cylinder was positioned horizontally with its circular faces sealed and facing the cell glass walls to minimize flow perpendicular to the direction of the impenetrable walls the bottom half of the cylinder was perforated penetrating the soil to a depth of 0 75 cm from the surface this apparatus enabled water to enter the soil during the short rapid flow periods of the pulses preventing ponding or structural alteration of the soil surface and spreading the water uniformly over the aperture of the cell the distance of the low permeability saline loess inclusion from the pressure pulse source 5 75 7 75 cm from top to bottom of the inclusion was chosen in compliance with the spatial scale of the pressure attenuation and the impact of water content on that attenuation the characteristic pressure wave attenuation in the quartz sand media above and surrounding the loess inclusion was assessed in dedicated column experiments and modeling section 1 in appendix a these assessments show that if the water content is above a certain value expected in the vicinity of the water source significant pressure perturbations can be induced in the pore water over the scale of 10 cm with a sufficiently large pressure perturbation generated at the source we used time domain transmissometry acclima digital tdt sensors to evaluate the leaching of solutes from the loess inclusion downward in the cell two tdt sensors were installed at two depths below the inclusion fig 1 to measure the concentration of solutes that leached out of the loess inclusion the tdt measurement provided the volumetric water content θ l3 l3 and bulk electrical conductivity ecb m 1l 3t3i2 of the sand the electrical conductivity of the pore water ecw was evaluated from ecb using a known calibrated relationship the measurements of each sensor represent approximately a volume average of 7 cm height by 15 cm width by 2 cm cell aperture blonquist et al 2005 the top sensor was placed so that its measurement volume began at a depth of about 2 cm below the bottom of the loess inclusion 10 5 cm from the surface centered and the lower sensor was placed so that its measurement volume was just below the top measurement 17 5 cm from the surface centered a data acquisition system cr6 campbell scientific controlled the solenoid valve and collected the data from the sensors at 1 min intervals complementary to these measurements snapshots of the cell through its glass side using an openmv cam h7 were obtained to track the spatial wetting patterns visually the experiments were repeated seven times for each treatment cf and ppf 2 2 solute mass balance the tdt sensors provide in situ measurements with minimal disturbance to the flow we use these for estimating the solute mass leached down from the inclusion the solute mass at a given volume is calculated from θ and ecw which correlate with solute concentration adamson 1979 the value of θ is determined from the tdt measurement via the bulk soil permittivity topp et al 1980 and ecw is estimated using an empirical relationship that correlates it with the sensor measurements of ecb temperature and permittivity hilhorst 2000 given by 1 e c w ec b ε w ε b ε 0 b where εw m 1l 3t4i2 is the permittivity of water a function of water temperature εb is the permittivity of the bulk porous media and ε 0 b is an empiric soil specific parameter before the flow cell experiment the sensors were calibrated with the quartz sand over the expected experimental concentration range under different water contents thereby estimating ε 0 b as a fixed value details on the calibration procedure and evaluation of ε 0 b are in the supporting information the calibrated measurements provided for a sensor based estimation of the mass of solutes correlated to the estimated water content for each sensor measurement considering local variations in the water content and fluxes within the cell and the measurement volume of the tdt throughout the experiment additional analysis and assumptions are required to assess the solute mass flux in the cell from these measurements thus we added a complementary mass balance evaluation scheme for which we make the following assumptions 1 most of the solutes leached out of the loess inclusion moved downward in the main flow direction within the cell parallel to the walls 2 the measurement volume captured most of the solutes in the horizontal layer of the cell at its depth although the sensor only detects the middle 57 of the cells width we assume that with the width of the inclusion 23 of cell width and the direction of flow assumption 1 the extent of solutes that bypasses the measurement volume close to the sides of the cell is negligible 3 the bottom of the upper measurement volume and the top of the lower measurement volume are bordering neglecting either a slight overlap or gap between the measurements 4 during the experiment most of the solutes that leached downward remained within the measurement volume of the sensors this assumption weakens toward the end of the experiment as the bottom measurement does not reach the bottom of the cell to avoid boundary effects we are aware of this and address it with a complementing numerical model for the analysis under these assumptions we use the joint measurement volumes of the two sensors as a control volume for the balance of the solute mass where the solute input is considered mainly through the surface of the top boundary of the measurement volume of the top sensor fig 1 red the validity of these assumptions is addressed with a numerical model presented in the results and discussion and the supporting information sections 2 3 numerical simulation numerical modeling was conducted to simulate the flow and solute transport under the drag dominant flow treatment to validate the experimental conditions and assess the influence of the flux on solute transport in a cf driven system we considered a two dimensional domain with dimensions of the height and width of the cell modeling flow and transport in the flow cell by numerically solving the richards equation and the advection dispersion equation ade using the hydrus 2d software šimůnek et al 2006 we assumed uniformity across the cell aperture third dimension the supporting information provides a detailed description of the numerical model the simulation scenario and the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 water content and solute concentration results are presented for a duration of 120 min from the beginning of wetting during which 240 ml of water equal to 0 37 pore volume of the cell was applied to the top surface of the flow cell at the end of this period the water did not reach the bottom impermeable boundary of the cell fig 2 depicts the water content and ecw of the two sensors top and bottom orange and blue lines respectively with average and standard error values evaluated from the seven repetitions for each treatment these results are the sensor volume averaged values and are expected not to be uniformly distributed across the measured volume although the experiments were identically prepared using the same protocol for both treatments and their repetitions specifically for dry packing of the soils and placing the sensors in the cell variations from uncontrolled layering are expected however we anticipated that such variations would be consistent between the treatments to allow averaging over multiple experiment repetitions the measured volumetric water content θ is presented as effective saturation se fig 2 a and b top panel defined as 2 se θ θ r θ s θ r with the residual and saturated water contents θr and θs respectively table s3 supporting information a shift in the arrival time of the wetting front at each depth is evident between the treatments with significantly faster propagation for the cf treatment because the average flux entering the cell at the soil surface is equal in both treatments the shift in arrival time implies a difference in the average water content of the wetted region i e the same volume of water in a different bulk volume these differences in the wetting time comply with the measured se values of the wetted area towards the end of the 120 min period both sensors exhibit a steady water content in the cf treatment with similar se values of 0 25 fig 2a in the ppf treatment however the maximal value of se measured by the top sensor is 0 5 fig 2b approximately double the maximal value in the cf treatment in unsaturated conditions higher water content increases the connectivity within the water phase which increases the hydrodynamic dispersion and the mixing between the water in the loess inclusion and the water in the sand freeze cherry 1979 solute concentration in the pore water depicted by the ecw values in fig 2 plots c and d rises simultaneously with the arrival of the wetting front evident in both sensors and treatments thus mobilization of solutes out of the loess inclusion initiates almost immediately with the arrival of the water in the top sensor a sharp rise of ecw is observed in both treatments towards the peak followed by a moderate decline whereas the increase in ecw follows the arrival of the wetting front in both treatments it exhibits significantly higher concentrations ecw values for the ppf treatment a decrease in concentration following the peak can be related to two major processes i mobilization of the solute peak with more solutes transported out from the measured volume than new arrivals and ii smearing of the peak concentration because of dilution with more net water entering the measured volume compared to the net solutes we evaluate the contribution of each of these processes through the ecw values of the bottom sensor in the cf treatment the trends of ecw values are similar in both sensors top and bottom with similar slopes of ecw over time after the arrival of the wetting front fig 2c this implies that in this case of the cf treatment the dominant process is the mobilization of the peak concentration which migrates downward with the propagating wetting front at a moderate pace fig 2a for the ppf treatment however the rise of ecw values that follow the arrival of the wetting front appears blunt at the bottom sensor compared to the sharp increase observed in the top sensor thus although the wetting front reached that depth of the bottom sensor most of the solutes remain in the measured volume of the top sensor consequently we infer that the dominant process responsible for the observed changes in the peak concentrations in the ppf treatment is the smearing of the peak due to dilution considering these differences and the significant disparities in the appearance of ecw between the top and bottom sensor during the ppf treatment we conclude that the solute peak travels separately from the wetting front in the ppf treatment as opposed to their matching appearance in the cf treatment it appears that the solute exchange between the loess and the sand under the cf treatment occurs mainly during the wetting process at the same time the ppf induces significant transport between the regions also post wetting thus in addition to the superior wetting that the ppf treatment achieved it enhanced transport in the wetted region behind the wetting front partly this may be related to the enhanced wetting and connectivity within the wet area yet it is also in line with previous work that studied saturated conditions and showed that abrupt pressure perturbations enhance transport in saturated porous media e g lo et al 2012 kahler kabala 2019 sorek bear 1990 we hypothesize on the mechanisms associated with wetting under the ppf and their impact on the distribution of water and solute displacement leading to the disparities from the results of the drag dominant flow cf treatment first the abrupt change of pressure at the source where the medium is practically saturated creates a disturbance in the momentum of the water phase in the momentum balance the pressure gradient is not in equilibrium with the velocity field and the viscous drag thus initiating a pressure wave sorek bear 1990 under these conditions the momentary mass flux in the water phase is much larger than would be possible under drag dominant flow where permeability limits such high flux magnitudes biot 1962 with the pressure wave propagation relatively high pressure perturbations can reach the vicinity of the wetting front allowing for sharp pressure gradients within the water phase to reach the interface with the air these pressure gradients are significantly larger than those under gravitational and capillary forces wang et al 1998 sorek 1996 since these pressure gradients govern the imbibition they introduce a more spatially uniform and stable wetting pattern philip 1975 under these conditions the impact of the capillary forces on imbibition at the wetting front is relatively low therefore the wetting phase is expected to propagate more homogenously through the pores with less influence of the pore size on the wetting front and the water distribution biswas et al 2018 this can lead to higher saturation levels of the wetted media behind the wetting front by reducing air entrapment during the wetting process and consequently higher water content at the bulk scale than during the cf treatment additionally in unsaturated conditions the pressure rise of the traveling wave temporarily reduces the matric pressure which until the excess pressure dissipates can lead to an increase in water content similarly this can be explained as a nonequilibrium capillarity effect hassanizadeh gray 1990 the pressure buildup following the pressure wave in the liquid water phase causes for local nonequilibrium compared to hydrostatic conditions between the pressures of the water and the air this is balanced with the rate of change of saturation and as the equilibrium is more disturbed the saturation changes more rapidly and accordingly the local saturation will increase until the equilibrium is restored the magnitude of the pressure disturbance in the case herein is much larger compared to capillary flow therefore we observe a relatively large rate of change in saturation which results in higher water contents in the wetting process the pressure waves induced by the pressured water pulses at the source in conjunction with the raised water content within the media have a coupled positive feedback effect the higher water content allows the propagation of the pressure waves with less attenuation over distance kalisman et al 2019 thus as water content elevates the pressure pulses at the source generate more significant pressure perturbations up to and at the wetting front resulting in a more stable propagation of the front and again increasing saturation of the newly wetted area a more detailed description of this mechanism and some sample pressure measurements from preliminary experiments are presented in section 2 of appendix a 3 2 leaching efficiency we use the data from the two sensors to examine the mass of the dissolved solids mds that leached out of the loess inclusion and normalize it relative to the total solute mass mds0 the mds values are evaluated for the control volume at the lower part of the cell under the assumptions 1 4 mentioned in the materials and methods subsection using measured water content and solute concentration in the water from the ecw fig 3 depicts the relative mass as the ratio between mds leached and mds0 the results indicate that the solute mass that leached downward from the loess inclusion is 70 and 40 of the solutes initially placed in the inclusion for the ppf and cf treatments respectively although the solute breakthrough in the ppf treatment begins 10 min later than in cf treatment corresponding to the differences in the wetting front propagation between them eventually the leaching efficiency per volume of water of the ppf treatment significantly exceeds that of the cf treatment in both treatments not all the solutes leached from the inclusion during the experiment some solute mass remained inside the inclusion at the end of the experiment verified by post experiment destructive sampling data not shown however the total amount of salts removed from the inclusion during the experiment period in each treatment indicates that extracting solutes from the inclusion is significantly greater 75 with the ppf treatment than with the cf treatment thus the ppf treatment provides a more efficient method for mobilizing and leaching salts both in solute per water mass during flow and in the overall fraction of the solutes removed comparing the solute breakthrough between the measurements from the cf treatment to those predicted by numerical simulations we conclude that the flow and transport of the cf treatment are well assessed by the richards equation and ade fig 3 and fig s2a supporting information thus complying with conditions of drag dominant flow the numerical model also supports the validity of the mass balance assumptions in section 2 2 solute mass balance sustaining that the significant difference in leaching efficiency between the treatments originates from the different flow regimes to further test this we conducted additional simulations varying the flux to examine the influence of lower or higher flux intensities and pulse fluxes yet under a drag dominant flow model on the leaching efficiency in the system the results show that these variations had an insignificant influence on leaching fig s2b s2c supporting information which remained like the continuous flux treatment across the different variations these results prove that the significant advantage in leaching efficiency gained with the ppf treatment over that of the cf treatment is related to the flow conditions induced by the pressure waves and their different characteristics from drag dominant flow not the variations in flow intensity or experimental setting 3 3 visualization of wetting pattern we complement our findings with a visual assessment of the loess inclusion and its surroundings using a series of snapshots taken from the transparent side of the flow cell during the experiments fig 4 depicts an example from 60 min in the experiment comparing the two treatments cf fig 4a and ppf fig 4b once the water reaches and penetrates the inclusion it is retained there for two main reasons 1 due to the capillary barrier at the bottom interface of the loess inclusion resulting from the difference in the capillary force between it and that of the sand below and 2 the significantly smaller hydraulic conductivity of the dry sand compared to the wet loess delaying water flow down from the inclusion stormont anderson 1999 consequently after the wetting of the loess inclusion the lower boundary of the inclusion at the interface between the wet loess and the dry sand becomes an obstacle for downward water flow limiting the flow and transport in both treatments however while in the ppf treatment most of the flow in the sand is maintained along the boundary with the inclusion including the bottom boundary that is not the case in the cf treatment where the flow appears more spatially dispersed and the wetting pattern exhibits lateral spreading in the direction of the sides of the cell this pattern of imbibition influences the wetting of the sand below the inclusion in the cf treatment the sand below the inclusion remains dry for a more extended period compared to that of the ppf treatment drier conditions in the sand below the interface with the loess inclusion imply that a smaller water interface area exists there through which solutes may transport by advection and dispersion out of the loess as hypothesized previously we relate this to the difference in water distribution in the sand for the cf and ppf in the ppf treatment the pressure gradients of the increased pore water pressure are higher sorek 1996 wang et al 1998 and contribute to a more even spreading of water philip 1975 and consequently to a more moderate propagation of the wetting front biswas et al 2018 thus the wetting front is less disturbed when it encounters an interference such as the inclusion in addition we observe that the size of the wetted area itself is different between treatments although the same average flux is applied in both treatments the observed wetted region is consistently larger for the cf treatment fig 4 this supports the sensor measurements of water content fig 2a b indicating that the water content in the pressure pulse treatment is significantly higher within the wetted regions thus contributing to solute mobility in the water phase 4 summary and conclusions solute leaching in heterogeneous soil is complicated since solutes can be practically trapped in immobile zones such as in low permeability regions with water being the main carrier solute displacement can differ substantially between regions depending on their facilitation of mobility even in cases where intervention in the flow is conducted to impact solutes trapped in immobile sites it is challenging to increase mobilization without investing a significant amount of water and relying on diffusion to spatially even out the concentration we propose a pressure pulses method ppf to generate pressure wave driven wetting flow and transport targeting low mobility regions we demonstrate the solute leaching efficiency of the method by increasing the mass of solutes removed per amount of invested water compared to continuous darcy type drag dominant flow cf to the best of our knowledge this study is the first experimental effort presenting the merits of transport driven by pressure waves in unsaturated and heterogeneous porous media specifically demonstrating the ability to increase solutes leaching from a low mobility zone under these conditions the infiltration displays different wetting patterns under the cf and ppf treatments we show that higher water content is achieved behind the wetting front when pressure pulses are applied compared to the infiltration and redistribution following water application by a continuous flux we relate the higher wetting to the pressure gradients formed at the wetting front following the abrupt pressure changes which enhance the invasion of the water into the air filled pores on top of capillary and gravitational forces that govern the flow in drag dominant conditions the greater pressure gradients at the wetting front during the ppf treatment weaken the impact of the capillary forces on water invasion into the pores therefore the magnitude of pore sizes and the pore size distribution have a relatively small effect on the water imbibition this leads to a more uniform wetting and propagation of the wetting front with fewer air filled pores behind it although the mobilization of solutes under pressure wave driven flow is the immediate context of this study the resulting phenomenon of increasing water content in a low retention porous medium due to pressure pulses application may also be of interest as a practice to decrease deep infiltration in such soils the leaching efficiency gained by applying pressure pulses was assessed by comparing it to the control treatment with a continuous water source the measurements of the control treatment were complemented with a numerical model supporting information showing that the flow and transport of this treatment are well simulated by the richards and ade equations the ppf treatment significantly influenced solute displacement compared to the cf treatment leaching 75 more solutes from the immobile region per volume of water invested 70 and 40 of the solutes initially in the inclusion removed by the pressure pulses and continuous flux treatments respectively we relate the increase in solute leaching driven by ppf to the following mechanisms wetting is less sensitive to the domain geometry and the pore sizes of the media leading to more homogeneous water distribution thus regions below immobile sites which would stay relatively dry under drag dominant flow due to macroscopic heterogeneity display higher water content under pressure wave imbibition increasing solute exchange at the interface the high water content in the medium after imbibition i improves the connectivity of low mobility sites and ii increases the hydraulic conductivity which results in locally higher advective and diffusive fluxes the pressure excitation within the water phase creates local fluxes that increase mass exchange between conductive regions and otherwise stagnant sites noteworthy is that these experiments were conducted under fairly stable conditions especially the initial water content and the geometry for a better understanding of the investigated dynamics different initial water distributions and other experimental scenarios should be considered in the future for quantifying their effect on the pressure wave induced transport previous experimental evidence supports the feasibility of enhancing solute mobilization in porous media through water subject to abrupt pressure excitation however examples of this phenomenon under unsaturated and heterogeneous conditions are absent to date we suggest that the results of this study provide a proof of concept for developing pressure wave driven wetting and

we thank prof ofer dahan for his continuous interest and support and our fruitful discussions appendix a propagation of pore water pressure waves and influence on water distribution a 1 calibrating the experimental setup to the spatial scale of pressure waves in porous media pressure waves in the pore water attenuate almost entirely over a distance of a few decimeters in unsaturated porous media the attenuation increases as the media are drier in our experimental setup we wanted to achieve significant pressure perturbations in the water phase up to at least the distance of the lower conductivity inclusion where the salt is placed see section 2 1 experimental setup thereby affecting the wetting and transport at that region therefore for the pressure pulses created by the solenoid pressure source in the experiment we attempt to predict the spatial attenuation of the wave amplitude and assess the order of magnitude expected for the pressure perturbations in the setup using a 1d analytical equation for the pressure wave amplitude attenuation kalisman et al 2019 we consider the pressure p ml 1t 2 at a given distance d l relative to the magnitude of the source pressure p0 given as a 1 p p 0 1 j i 1 j e γ r i d where γ is an absorption coefficient related to hydraulic and mechanical properties of the medium and wave attributes ri l is a group of characteristic capillary sizes representing the pore size distribution of the medium and j is the number of water filled capillary groups which is a function of water content and the chosen discretization of the medium given the equation parameters and assuming complete continuity of the water phase which limits the model to high water contents we can assess the attenuation at varying water contents to calibrate the equation to the quartz sand used in the experiment we conduct pressure measurements honeywell pressure transducers nbp series of the pore water in a sand packed column using a method similar to the one described in kalisman et al 2019 we can extract the absorption coefficient γ with pressure measurements taken at different distances from the pressure source during a pressure pulse in a saturated medium and measured properties of the quartz sand resulting with ri fig a 1 blue markers once calibrated we use eq a 1 for predicting the spatial pressure attenuation under different water contents for validation additional pressure measurements were conducted in an initially dry setup during a wetting procedure driven by periodic pressured water pulses as described in section 2 1 experimental setup after the passing of the wetting front the water content of the wetted region behind the front stabilized and was estimated using two methods i using the soil matric potential measured with the pressure transducers and calculating the water content through the known water retention curve of the sand and ii by destructive sampling after the experiments and evaluating the water content by oven drying the sand the resulting effective saturation se eq 2 was 0 87 and 0 85 for the first and second methods respectively we used a value of se 0 85 for the model with the resulting attenuation of the pressure pulse magnitude at this water content in good agreement with the measurements fig a 1 red markers in the two dimensional flow cell experiment the attenuation per distance is expected to be more significant due to increased cross section area of the water phase farther from the source however considering these results fig a 1 even with an additional reduction in the pressure magnitude we assume that the perturbations are not completely attenuated at this spatial scale of 10 cm from the source therefore we can potentially achieve significant pressure perturbations in the water phase by adjusting the pressure at the boundary theoretically reaching higher pressure magnitudes farther from the source is possible by accounting for the attenuation and increasing the pressure magnitude at the source however in practice we are limited in the pressure applied at the source in the soil surface vicinity the soil surface is unconfined and higher pressures in this region may intrude the soil structure and or flood the surface near the water source in preliminary experiments we could safely reach pressure pulses at a magnitude of 2 bar above atmospheric and a duration of 50 ms without altering the packed quartz sand as pressure magnitudes increase and pulse durations lengthen from these values we observed that the packing structure close to the source is affected and flooding occurs after the pulse application a 2 impact on wetting and water content aside from the influences of pressure perturbations on flow dynamics within the water phase we use the experimental observations to hypothesize how these perturbations influence the wetting mechanism we examine the profile of the pore water pressure measurements over time during the wetting of the quartz sand column fig a 2 the pressured water pulses are delivered into the sand close to the surface in 1 min intervals the pressure is measured at two distances from the surface steady pressure values are observed before the wetting front reaches the measurement locations around 9 min at 4 5 cm and 12 min at 6 5 cm these values do not represent the pore water pressure because the water in these sensors is not hydraulically connected with the pore water in the column at the beginning of the experiment yet even at this stage we can already identify small excitations in the pressure appearing at the interval of the pulses 1 min they are either transferred through the air or the solid and create fluctuations in the water within the sensor when the area around the sensor is wetted sufficient hydraulic continuity is attained between the sensor and the pore water and the background pressure drops to the value of the matric potential of the soil appearing slightly different between the two measurement points gradually the magnitude of the pressure perturbations from the low value before the jump to the peak pressure is amplified over time as the water content up to the measurement point increases and the wave amplitude is less attenuated eventually the water content stabilizes and the pressure amplitude becomes consistent converting the pressure to units of the hydraulic head reveals the perturbations values are about 10 and 8 cm at a distance of 4 5 and 6 5 cm respectively to assess the possible impact of these perturbations on the resulting local water content we compare it to the water content achieved for the same effective flux but applied as a continuous source for this quartz sand the effective saturation is predicted and measured at about se 0 7 if for example we analyze the depth of 6 5 cm under the described experimental conditions and use the retention curve of this sand to correlate between pressure and water content we can simulate the evolution of the water content as the pressure perturbations alter the effective matric pressure fig a 3 initially the pressure perturbation magnitude reaching this depth is equivalent to about 4 cm head potentially increasing se from 0 7 to 0 73 after a while as the water content is elevated to this higher value the pressure waves would be less attenuated the magnitude of the perturbations will increase and so on if the pressure is not attenuated this positive feedback effect could eventually lead to saturated conditions at any depth however as the pressure is attenuated with distance the pressure perturbations become smaller and their impact on water content decreases and becomes negligible moreover the soil structure is complex and other properties impact pressure propagation and wetting for example because water enters soil regions that are partially wetted the entrance of new water depends on the local geometry it may not increase the water content if there is trapped air and the pressure will generate flow into the less wetted region the water retention curve represents hydrostatic conditions and cannot actually capture the water content and capillary pressure relationship in conditions of rapid water pressure perturbations and flow nevertheless we use it as a conceptual model for representing the potential local water content change that can be achieved under each pressure rise the excess pressure does not attenuate instantaneously so it can impact the wetting of dry pores in the vicinity of the water phase as it disturbs the preexisting capillary balance readdressing the wetting front propagation and its arrival time at the two depths fig a 2 we can observe that the velocity slightly increases with depth 0 5 cm min up to 4 5 cm and about 0 54 cm min at 6 5 cm as the effective flux at the boundary is constant these changes in pore water velocity imply a difference in the water distribution and local changes of water content with higher water content related to lower pore water velocity considering that the magnitudes of the pressure perturbations decrease with distance and in light of the above analysis it is reasonable that the increase in water content is smaller as the wetting front gets farther from the pressure source appendix b supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j
