imbalance between the available fresh water and water demands is an alarming situation in many countries worldwide this necessitates for analyzing the risk of water scarcity forced with the changing climate land use alterations growing population and industrialization to pave a way for sustainable water resources systems planning and management this study advocates a hydrological model based evaluation approach employing soil water assessment tool swat to identify the dominating drivers on the decadal streamflow patterns and other basin scale water balance components viz blue water flow bwf green water storage gws and green water flow gwf in the brahmani and baitarani river basins of eastern india the results reveal that in these basins the climate change effect has relatively a higher impact on streamflow than the land use change this study surmises that the brahmani and baitarani river basins can be categorized under the high and moderate risk water scarcity zones respectively the developed approach of assessing the water scarcity risk under the non availability of basin scale sectoral water demands could be a reliable tool for many data scarce river basins worldwide keywords brahmani baitarani blue water green water swat water scarcity 1 introduction water scarcity risk a global issue is accelerating as a result of an increase in sectoral water demands and reduced basin scale water availability caused by climate change induced uneven temporal distribution in rainfall and reduced streamflow spatiotemporal inconsistency between availability and demand may create a risk of water scarcity across the earth rapid industrialization urbanization population growth higher living standards and modifications in water consumption patterns by different sectors are the anthropogenic factors for the intensified water demands additionally climate change in terms of altered weather patterns an increase in greenhouse gases and deforestation impact the streamflow variation affecting the basin scale water availability turral et al 2011 according to the world economic forum wef almost every continent is going to face the potential impact of water stress over the next decades collins 2018 although india is not experiencing any water stress situation at present the projected water demand may increase by 24 and 74 by 2025 and 2050 respectively goi 1999 saleth 2011 streamflow is a combined response of many hydrological processes that includes meteorological forcing precipitation and temperature morphologic characteristics of the basin slope elevation geologic attributes of the underground system and anthropogenic activities reservoir dam construction land use change and excessive water exploitation past studies highlight the spatial and temporal disparities of streamflow as the adverse effect of climate change and or different rigorous human interventions ma et al 2009 mango et al 2011 wang et al 2013 zhan et al 2014 mittal et al 2016 sun et al 2016 bu et al 2018 han et al 2019 as a result the streamflow of many river basins decreased considerably as compared to the natural flow regime the threat of water scarcity is expected to be high due to the lack of holistic expertise of basin scale hydrology specifically the causes and effects of streamflow variations li et al 2018 in addition to streamflow the other water balance components are necessary for the agricultural sector industrial demand human consumption food security and energy generation schuol et al 2008 recent studies on basin scale water availability have focused on the quantification of internal renewable water resources irwr in terms of blue water flow bfw crop evapotranspiration in terms of green water flow gfw and green water storage gws with the soil moisture storage component schuol et al 2008 faramarzi et al 2009 vanham 2016 yuan et al 2019 the existing studies of freshwater evaluation at the global and continental scales were applied for water stress analysis vörösmarty et al 2005 climate change and its impact on socioeconomic scenarios alcamo et al 2007 seasonal and inter annual water storage alteration analysis guntner et al 2007 and global water scarcity assessment in light of environmental water demand smakhtin 2004 however the regional scale assessments are important to help the decision makers to propose balanced water resource management strategies with prospective socioeconomic pathways alcamo et al 2017 although few studies highlight the changing pattern of streamflow due to climate variation and or land use conversion effect as well as alteration of different water balance components like baseflow surface runoff groundwater and evapotranspiration et at basin scale in india e g anand et al 2018 das et al 2018 visakh et al 2019 however they do not emphasize the inherent water scarcity risk to the basin scale hydrology with the growing concern of ecological water resources management the key questions arise as a proof of the concept advocated in this study are 1 how significant are the individual influence of climate change and land use land cover alteration for two typical selected data scarce composite river basins 2 how a basin is vulnerable to these driving factors on a decadal time scale 3 are there any variations in basin scale water balance components at a decadal time scale and 4 whether water scarcity issues can be analyzed integrating streamflow variation and water availability components in terms of water balance fluxes when information on basin scale water demands are scarce to address these research questions the main aim of this study is to investigate the dominating influence of climate change and land use alteration to the streamflow of the selected typical brahmani baitarani river basin employing a hydrological modelling framework namely swat at a decadal time scale the basin scale water availability assessment in terms of hydrological flux components incorporating streamflow variation is carried out to portray the risk of water scarcity 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area for the present study the composite brahmani baitarani river basin in eastern india is selected the 799 km long brahmani river basin is bounded in between 83 52 e to 87 50 e longitudes and 20 28 n to 23 35 n latitudes with an extent of 36 790 km2 the baitarani river basin 12 094 km2 extends from 20 30 n to 22 20 n latitudes and 85 05 e to 87 05 e longitudes the elevation of both the river basins ranges from the mean sea level to 1190 m which reduces to 10 m downward of the basin towards the seaside the bay of bengal the locational information of the brahmani baitarani river basin is shown in fig 1 the brahmani river together with the baitarani river forms a large delta before draining into the bay of bengal at dharma which is reported as a flood prone area rai et al 2018 the deltaic region is formed at the jenapur discharge station both the river basins cover the major portions of three states viz odisha jharkhand and a small part of chhattisgarh rengali reservoir is located in the upper basin of the jenapur gauging site of the brahmani river basin similarly the baitarani river basin has a salandi dam in the upper basin of the anandapur gauging site both of the river basins fall within the subtropical monsoon climate zone dahm et al 2016 where nearly 80 of the annual rainfall is received during the south west monsoon season june to september causing floods in the lower reaches the annual rainfall of both the river basins varies from 1400 to 1600 mm year and the average annual temperature lies between 20 and 37 c the main soil types in the brahmani river basin are red and yellow soils red sandy and loamy soils mixed red and black soils and coastal alluvium chaturvedi 2011 in the baitarani river basin it varies from rich red loamy to gravely detritus paul et al 2019a b 2 2 swat hydrological model background swat is a basin scale quasi distributed continuous time step hydrological model that is integrated with the gis platform arnold et al 1993 it is a popular physically based model for estimating hydrological process components in various river basins over the world with quite good performances arnold et al 2000 muttiah and wurbs 2002 di luzio and arnold 2004 secchi et al 2007 gathenya et al 2011 piman et al 2012 norman et al

the influence of different land use practices for agricultural nutrient wash off sediment and water in large ungauged basins arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2002 simulation of different hydrologic processes is analyzed together with the surface runoff generation et groundwater flow lateral flow and percolation by applying swat surface runoff is generated using either the scs curve number method or the green and ampt infiltration model et is quantified by various approaches namely priestley taylor hargreaves and penman monteith methods subsurface flow components such as lateral flow groundwater flow and percolation are evaluated through the mass balance of the subsurface system simulation of hydrological processes in swat is conceptualized by the water balance equation as 1 s w t s w o i 1 t p i q i e t i g i r i where s w t is the residual water content in soil mm s w o is the initial soil water content on i th day mm t is time in days p i is the precipitation on i th day mm q i is the surface runoff on i th day mm eti is the evapotranspiration on i th day mm g i is the water flowing to the subsurface zone from the soil profile on i th day mm and r i is the return flow on i th day mm primarily swat simulates the water balance components of each hydrological response unit hru which is a unique group of soil and vegetation types in the sub basin and modelled to estimate water availability at the main channel of each sub basin for a given time phase then it is routed to regulate the interchange of water through the river system and subsurface system to the basin outlet for the calibration validation sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis of swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup are generally used abbaspour 2012 in this study the popular

agricultural land fallow land urban land deciduous forest shrubland mixed forest and water body which is summarised in table 3 in this study the observed 0 25 gridded rainfall data pai et al 2014 and 1 gridded temperature data are obtained from the india meteorological department imd pune this gridded imd rainfall data has been widely used in the literature mishra et al 2014 deshpande et al 2016 meher et al 2017 sharma and mujumdar 2017 bisht et al 2018 smitha et al 2018 the available 1 gridded temperature information is resampled to 0 25 using the bilinear interpolation technique to ensure uniformity in spatial resolution of the obtained dataset sharma and mujumdar 2017 bisht et al 2019 peng et al 2019 daily observed streamflow data of jenapur brahmani basin and anandapur baitarani basin gauging stations are collected from 1980 to 2009 from the central water commission cwc bhubaneswar due to the unavailability of wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation data for the study area these weather datasets are not used in swat for estimation of the et the hargreaves temperature based approach is used to estimate the et which does not require the above dataset linear trend analysis yue and wang 2004 barua et al 2013 anghileri et al 2014 ji and duan 2019 is performed to detect the variations of hydro meteorological time series viz precipitation temperature and streamflow for this analysis the entire period 1980 2009 is divided into three different climatic sub periods c1 c2 c3 with 10 years of time extent in each sub period which is used for the decadal d1 d2 d3 evaluations of basin scale hydrology 2 4 model based scenario design table 1 shows the details of different model scenarios categorized by different climatic conditions and land use cover by evaluating the hydrological variables under different model performances four scenarios s1 s2 s3 s4 are proposed to study the dominating influence of climate change and land use cover alteration on streamflow of the brahmani baitarani river basin over the study period of 1980 2009 in this study model setups are done separately for both the river basins the influences of the reservoir are neglected due to the unavailability of reservoir operation data the entire brahmani river basin is discretized into 25 sub basins and 637 hrus using swat interface similarly the baitarani river basin is partitioned into 25 sub basins and 466 hrus the model is calibrated and validated at jenapur gauging station which lies in the 25th sub basin of the brahmani river basin and covers about 90 of the total basin area for the baitarani river basin anandapur gauging station is chosen for calibration and validation which lies in the 20th sub basin all the models are calibrated and validated on a monthly scale moreover 2 years of the warm up period has been considered for all the model scenarios 2 5 uncertainty analysis the uncertainty resulting from the sensitive model parameters and scenario performances of climate and lulc is analyzed collectively using a quantile regression technique a stochastic approach koenker and bassett 1978 being widely used in the recent literature e g koenker and hallock 2001 kumar et al 2015 sahoo et al 2018 2020 paul et al 2019a b nanda et al 2019 the monthly observed simulated and residual streamflow can be expressed mathematically as 5 q t q t r t where q t is the observed monthly streamflow q t is the simulated monthly streamflow and r t is the residual a functional relationship is assumed between residuals and estimates in the gaussian domain i e normalized quantile streamflow nqs and normalized quantile residual nqr considering a linear relation between nqs and nqr koenker and hallock 2001 nqr is expressed as 6 nqr a n q s b minimizing the absolute bias by assigning different weights to positive and negative residuals in the gaussian domain different quantile regression lines may be obtained absolute bias is considered in this study as an objective function of which can be expressed mathematically as 7 of m i n ρ τ nqr a n q s b where a slope b intercept and ρ τ quantile regression function that pushes the regression line to the desired location to estimate the streamflow corresponding to a given confidence limit the model simulated monthly streamflow is transformed as nqs first and then using eq 6 the regression line in the gaussian domain is fitted using the pre estimated mean and standard deviation of the residual the estimated residual nqr is transformed back to the original domain finally the estimated residual is added to the monthly simulated streamflow to obtain the uncertainty based streamflow regression lines corresponding to different confidence intervals ci are used to study the uncertainty in simulated streamflow the slope and intercept of these lines are estimated by eq 7 using the model simulated streamflow data further to verify the accuracy of different error models the models are incorporated with different scenarios 2 6 water availability assessment the basin scale water availability in the study area is assessed for different sub periods with 10 years of moving window water availability is categorized into blue and green water the blue water flow bwf which is the internal renewable water resource is quantified from the aggregate of the surface water and the groundwater constituents therefore surface runoff lateral flow and return flow are grouped into bwf components at a basin scale the naturally infiltrated water is the key concept behind the green water component of a basin that is characterized into two parts green water resource storage gws comprising of the available moisture in the soil and green water flows gwf which is the actual evapotranspiration however the actual evapotranspiration is the loss of water freed to the atmosphere through a combined process of transpiration from vegetation covers and evaporation from water bodies and soil profiles thus blue water flow and green water storage are considered as water availability of the basin for the present study 2 7 water scarcity risk analysis water scarcity is generally estimated as the sectoral water demands in excess from the water availability at the basin scale however in many river basins world wide the sectoral water demands are hardly available therefore considering the baseline water demands the water scarcity risk assessment is carried out separately for the brahmani and baitarani river basins based on the relative changes in streamflow δ q and water availability δ w a for this analysis it is assumed that there is almost equilibrium exists between the water demands and water availability the relative changes in streamflow and water availability are calculated as follows 8 δ q q a q b q b 9 δ w a w a a w a b w a b where δ q is the relative change in streamflow q a and q b are the average streamflow for the assessment and baseline periods respectively δ w a is the relative change in water availability and w a a and w a b are the average water availabilities for the assessment and baseline periods respectively based on the above parameter values four different risk zones are identified garrote et al 2018 the criteria for the potential water scarcity risk assessment zoning is outlined below zone 1 z1 δ q 0 δ w a 0 less risk zone 2 z2 δ q 0 δ w a 0 moderate risk zone 3 z3 δ q 0 δ w a 0 high risk zone 4 z4 δ q 0 δ w a 0 extreme risk in zone 1 there is less risk of water scarcity until water demands are higher than the water availability with the positive change scenarios in both the streamflow and water availability in case of zone 2 there is a moderate risk of water scarcity due to a decrease in streamflow which will stress in the water supply system in zone 3 the water scarcity risk is high as there is a reduction in water availability in zone 4 both the streamflow and water availability decrease which would result in an extreme risk for the basin 3 results 3 1 land use cover changes in the basin the percentage of basin area under different land use classes is illustrated in table 2 it is noticed from fig 2 that the agricultural land and deciduous forests are two major land use classes in the composite brahmani baitarani river basins an overall increasing trend is observed in agricultural land shrubland mixed forest and urban land classes during the study period 1980 2009 in both the river basins deciduous forests exhibit a decrease in the areal extent which may be due to human interventions with the conversion into agricultural lands owed to population growth however there is a significant variation in fallow land over the study period in the brahmani river basin further the basin is experiencing a reduction in the water spreading area however water spreading area is increasing in the baitarani river basin these transformations in land use and land cover are expected to influence the water balance of the study area 3 2 hydro meteorological changes the linear trend analysis of three main hydro climatic variables i e precipitation mean temperature and streamflow is carried out at an annual scale as the long term 1980 2009 annual change rate of all the data series is not significant the change rates are listed in the form of the decadal time scale as shown in table 3 table 3 reveals that there is a decreasing trend in the temperature data series c1 1980 1989 climatic sub period for both the brahmani and baitarani river basins similarly streamflow data series of c3 2000 2009 sub period shows a negative linear trend with a decline rate of 3 90 mm 10a for the brahmani river basin precipitation time series represents an increasing trend for both the river basins for all the sub periods these trends for the brahmani and baitarani river basins are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively these figures reveal that overall both the basins experienced variations in precipitation temperature and streamflow for different sub periods 3 3 executing model scenarios in swat the different model scenarios in swat as stated in table 1 are calibrated and validated with the sensitive parameters which are listed in table 4 the comparisons of monthly streamflow series between model simulated and observed streamflow at jenapur and anandapur stations are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively the selection of sensitive parameters and its ranges are finalized based on an in depth model calibration of the present study area as well as model results of eastern india river basins paul et al 2019a b visakh et al 2019 a good agreement between the observed and model simulated streamflow is noticed from the respective graphical representations however the simulated flows of m1 and m2 model of the brahmani river basin and the m1 model of the baitarani basin are not able to capture the high streamflow which may be attributed to the lack of reservoir operation data the statistical performance indices of model performance i e nse values with greater than 0 5 r2 values greater than 0 6 and pbias values within 25 are relevant to test the reliability of the model moriasi et al 2007 the nse r2 and pbias values for the total period calibration period and validation period of the corresponding river basins are shown in table 5 the model evaluation results suggest that the range and fine tuning of the sensitive parameters are up to mark and the swat model is a promising tool for the brahmani and baitarani river basins to analyze the water availability 3 4 assessment of scenarios of lulc and climate as stated in table 1 the scenario s1 s2 s3 and s4 simulations are carried out to capture the major influences of land use land cover transformation and climate change these simulations are carried out using the best fit sensitive parameters from the well validated models m1 m2 and m3 of the respective basins the evaluations of different scenarios are carried out by comparing them with the observed streamflow and estimated nse r2 and pbias as shown in figs 7 and 8 from the analysis the simulated streamflow for the s3 and s4 scenarios shows a good reproduction with the corresponding observed streamflow as shown in figs 7 and 8 it is clear from the figures that the climate change effect is more noticeable in both the river basins form fig 7 the simulated streamflow for scenario s1 of the brahmani river basin underestimates the observed streamflow of the mid decade 1990 1999 although scenario s2 overestimates at the end decade 2000 2009 the simulated scenarios s1 s2 of the baitarani river basin underestimate the observed streamflow of the respective decades however the peak flows of the s1 scenario are significantly high in the years 1992 1993 1995 and 1998 the insignificant changes in lulc as discussed in section 3 1 are likely to affect the agreement of scenario simulations with the observed streamflow 3 5 uncertainty analysis of model and scenarios outcomes in this study the stochastic based quantile regression approach as discussed in section 2 5 is used to ensure the dominating effect of climate change lulc and sensitive model parameters on streamflow variation in the brahmani and baitarani river basins two regression lines with maximum upper and minimum lower limits of 95 confidence band are used to analyze the uncertainty in streamflow variation figs 9 and 10 present the uncertainty of the brahmani and baitarani river basins respectively for d2 1990 1999 and d3 2000 2009 periods it is evident from figs 9 and 10 that most of the observed monthly streamflow data fall within 95 ci bands for sensitive parameters m2 m3 and climate change scenarios s3 s4 which indicate that both the climate change and sensitive model parameters factors play major roles in streamflow variation although the plots of lulc scenarios s1 s2 show that a few data points fall outside the defined bands however the uncertainty needs to be further analyzed to quantify the individual uncertainty of sensitive parameters climate change and lulc on streamflow variation which is beyond the scope of this study 3 6 quantification of basin scale water availability the water balance components are estimated by the calibrated and validated models m1 m2 m3 for both the river basins at the decadal scale table 6 shows the quantity of different water balance components viz precipitation actual evapotranspiration surface runoff lateral flow soil moisture storage and deep aquifer recharge the quantitative assessment of water balance components for the brahmani river basin shows an increase in et 18 water yield 32 and lateral flow 38 during the mid decade as compared with the 1st decade however a declination rate of 22 in the case of surface runoff and 4 in deep aquifer recharge is experienced a significant variation is there in the case of soil moisture storage at a decreasing rate of 257 mm 10a similarly as regards to the comparison of the components during end decade with the mid decade the declining trends are present in et 10 5 water yield 30 lateral flow 49 and deep aquifer recharge 22 while there are increasing rates in surface runoff 25 and soil moisture content 32 the water balance components of the baitarani river basin experiences variations in et 1 10 water yield 0 69 11 surface runoff 29 7 5 lateral flow 47 0 5 soil moisture storage 0 1 91 and deep aquifer recharge 64 87 during the mid decade as compared with the 1st decade and end decade to mid decade respectively the comparative assessment of basin scale water availability in terms of bwf gwf and gws are evaluated at a decadal time slice for both the river basins as gwf results in major losses from the basins in terms of evaporation and transpiration water availability for this analysis includes gws which is the available moisture in the soil and bwf which is cumulative of water yields and deep aquifer recharge the variations of different water availability components are presented in fig 11 it is revealed in fig 11 that there are fluctuations in the bwf gwf and gws components in the brahmani river basin over the three selected decades in the early decade 1980 1989 almost a balance does exist among all the estimated water availability components in the brahmani river basin however the bwf and gwf components show an increasing trend during the mid decade 1990 1999 a decline of gws in the mid decade is also seen which is observed from table 6 after all gws exhibits a considerable increase in its magnitude at the end of the decade 2000 2009 than the previous decade as compared to the brahmani river basin the baitarani river basin shows higher values of bwf overall there are positive variations noticed in the bwf and gwf estimates for the baitarani river basin conversely the gws estimate is decreased towards the end of the decade 2000 2009 further it is observed that the availability of gws in the baitarani river basin is relatively less than that of the brahmani river basin it should be noted that the estimated water balance components are calibrated directly from the model results of the respective river basins as there are no direct available observations 3 7 basin scale water scarcity risk assessment the risk of water scarcity is assessed considering the relative changes in streamflow and water availability of the basin the basin scale assessments of relative changes in streamflow and water availability for the selected river basins are shown in fig 12 the relative changes of streamflow and water availability for different periods are denoted as dij where i is the assessment period and j is the baseline period for this analysis decade 2 1990 1999 has been compared with decade 1 1980 1989 the baseline similarly decade 3 2000 2009 has been compared separately with decades 1 and 2 considering two different baseline periods these results reveal that there is a frequent declination in water availability in the brahmani river basin comparing the relative changes of streamflow the corresponding basin faces a falling trend when d2 is compared with d1 while increasing rates are observed when d3 is compared with d1 and d2 therefore according to the water scarcity risk criteria as defined in section 2 7 the brahmani river basin is categorized under the high risk zone of water scarcity whereas the baitarani river basin is under the moderate risk zone however the tendency of relative change in streamflow of the baitarani river basin is decreasing at the end 4 discussion 4 1 model and scenarios response to climate change and lulc in this study the influence of climate change and lulc has been assessed on the hydrological cycle of the brahmani and baitarani basins in this context the long term hydro climatic variables are divided into 3 decades 1980 1989 1990 1990 2000 2009 linear trend analysis is carried out to examine the variations of hydro climatic variables for different time slices as shown in the studies by ji and duan 2019 a set of four scenarios is defined to study the dominating impacts of climate change and lulc according to past researches li et al 2016 ji and duan 2019 the overall analysis of climate change shows that precipitation has high increasing trends at a rate of 20 75 mm 10a and 40 56 mm 10a for the brahmani and baitarani river basins at the end of the decade respectively further as the brahmani river basin is facing a decline in the areal extent of water bodies which includes river basin and reservoirs reduction in streamflow trends is observed towards the end decades the calibration and validation of swat are performed with sufi2 algorithm at jenapur 20 53 24 n 86 0 36 e and anandapur 21 13 46 n 86 7 30 e gauging stations located in the lower and middle parts of the brahmani and baitarani river basins respectively the calibrated peak flow is adjusted by modifying the sensitive parameters including cn2 mgt curve number and sol awc sol available water capacity of the soil layer based on earlier studies abbaspour et al 2015 veettil and mishra 2016 the parameters like gw delay gw groundwater delay time gwqmn gw threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur and gw revap gw groundwater revamp coefficient are used to adjust the baseflow of the corresponding river basins overall 10 hydrologic parameters are used in model calibration table 2 and the goodness of fit statistics r2 nse and pbias are evaluated between swat simulated flow and observed streamflow table 5 the sensitive parameters of the calibrated and validated models of both the basins show an extreme fluctuation in the subsequent decades the alterations in lulc are expected to affect the variations of sensitive model parameters nejadhashemi et al 2010 welde and gebremariam 2017 das et al 2018 as well as basin responses however the scenario analysis undertaken in this study suggests that climate change has major influences on basin than the lulc transformations figs 7 and 8 for both the river basins while the application of direct interventions dams and reservoirs details to the model is limited the uncertainty analysis figs 9 and 10 reveals that sensitive parameters as well as climate change have some considerable effects on both the basin responses 4 2 water availability in the brahmani and baitarani river basin the spatiotemporal variations of water availability in terms of blue and green water are important for having in depth knowledge of the actual water resources status of a river basin schuol et al 2008 the water balance components such as et water yield surface runoff lateral flow soil moisture storage and deep aquifer recharge are calculated from the well calibrated and validated swat for quantifying the bwf gwf and gws at decadal time scales the temporal distributions of bwf are noticed to be affected by the precipitation pattern for the corresponding river basins the maximum precipitation at a decadal scale is observed during the mid decade in the brahmani river basin 1475 2 mm 10a and the end decade in the baitarani river basin 1595 6 mm 10a the baitarani river basin has a high amount of bwf as compared to the brahmani river basin which could help for sustaining the sectoral water demands the human activities of agronomy and irrigation including climate change are expected to play important roles in the variation of gwf zou et al 2017 the areal extent of agricultural farming for both the river basins varies from 45 to 60 therefore the et from agricultural cultivations is likely to have a strong impact on controlling the gwf in the basin further the decadal gwf of the baitarani river basin follows the varying pattern of temperature however an increased gwf results in major losses from the basins in terms of evaporation and transpiration which can hamper water resource availability in the river basin the study by wenzhi and junliang 2004 indicates that continuous losses in terms of evaporation results in low soil moisture storage the past studies revealed that 60 of total precipitation is consumed by vegetative transpiration and soil evaporation from the upper soil layers oki and kanae 2006 however the shallow layers of arid and semi arid regions hold low soil moisture content mishra and singh 2010 the decadal variability of gws is significant in the brahmani river basin which is followed by the changing patterns of gwf further it is observed that the availability of gws in the baitarani river basin is relatively less than that of the brahmani river basin the warm and humid climate of both the river basins is expected to influence the water availability components 4 3 application of water scarcity risk assessment the water scarcity risk assessment method advocated in this study is an integrated approach of relative changes in streamflow as well as water availability using the assumption of equilibrium condition in between the water demands and water availability the hypothesis of water scarcity risk is analyzed the past study by garrote et al 2018 reveals that basin scale water availability is a combined result of streamflow and other storage components of the basin in this study the conceptual analysis of the developed approach shows that the brahmani river basin is in the high risk zone category with a continuous decrease of basin scale water availability which is a serious threat to rain fed agriculture however there is a falling trend in streamflow in the baitarani river basin which would affect the water supply system in the basin thus the corresponding basin is categorized under a moderate risk zone from the surmise of scenario analysis climate change is expected to influence the water balance components as well as the water scarcity of the basin however the unavailability of sectoral water demands limits this study from realistic scenario analysis while the disparities in the water use economic value in different sectors create challenges for environmental awareness seeking to achieve the water rights kendy et al 2018 5 conclusions in this study the temporal variations of key meteorological factors i e precipitation and temperature of climate including the important hydrological variable i e streamflow of a typical composite brahmani baitarani river basins in eastern india are analyzed further the influence of climate change and lulc alterations on streamflow variations has been explored at a decadal time scale using swat hydrological model the calibrated and validated model results are extended to study the temporal deviations in the basin scale water balance components as well as water availability and water scarcity risk zoning based on this study the following specific conclusions are drawn 1 it is noticed that the streamflow is slightly decreased at a rate of 3 90 m2 s 10a in the brahmani basin at the end decade which shows substantial deviations in bwf of the basin the increasing patterns of precipitation and irregular pattern of temperature are the crucial factors for the varying trend of streamflow in both the river basins 2 the effects of different driving forces i e two major climate factors and lulc on the streamflow are heterogeneous climate change impact and sensitive model parameters are major drivers in streamflow variations than lulc alterations interestingly the transformations of lulc cannot be ignored which affects the water balance components of both the river basins 3 the baitarani river basin has been marked as moderately water scarce whereas the brahmani river basin has been identified under high risk water scarcity zone with a persistent decline of water availability in succeeding decades which is crucial for policymakers to maintain available water for sustainable water demand to our knowledge the overall outcomes of the study may be useful for judicious planning and management of water resources of different data scarce river basins concerning the changing climate and lulc constraints further studies can include direct human interventions like reservoir and dam operation policies which can enhance the model outcomes while the contribution analysis of different driving factors can capture the inherent processes of basin scale hydrology the availability of sectoral water demand information may improve the reliability of the developed model based water scarcity risk zoning credit authorship contribution statement

imbalance between the available fresh water and water demands is an alarming situation in many countries worldwide this necessitates for analyzing the risk of water scarcity forced with the changing climate land use alterations growing population and industrialization to pave a way for sustainable water resources systems planning and management this study advocates a hydrological model based evaluation approach employing soil water assessment tool swat to identify the dominating drivers on the decadal streamflow patterns and other basin scale water balance components viz blue water flow bwf green water storage gws and green water flow gwf in the brahmani and baitarani river basins of eastern india the results reveal that in these basins the climate change effect has relatively a higher impact on streamflow than the land use change this study surmises that the brahmani and baitarani river basins can be categorized under the high and moderate risk water scarcity zones respectively the developed approach of assessing the water scarcity risk under the non availability of basin scale sectoral water demands could be a reliable tool for many data scarce river basins worldwide keywords brahmani baitarani blue water green water swat water scarcity 1 introduction water scarcity risk a global issue is accelerating as a result of an increase in sectoral water demands and reduced basin scale water availability caused by climate change induced uneven temporal distribution in rainfall and reduced streamflow spatiotemporal inconsistency between availability and demand may create a risk of water scarcity across the earth rapid industrialization urbanization population growth higher living standards and modifications in water consumption patterns by different sectors are the anthropogenic factors for the intensified water demands additionally climate change in terms of altered weather patterns an increase in greenhouse gases and deforestation impact the streamflow variation affecting the basin scale water availability turral et al 2011 according to the world economic forum wef almost every continent is going to face the potential impact of water stress over the next decades collins 2018 although india is not experiencing any water stress situation at present the projected water demand may increase by 24 and 74 by 2025 and 2050 respectively goi 1999 saleth 2011 streamflow is a combined response of many hydrological processes that includes meteorological forcing precipitation and temperature morphologic characteristics of the basin slope elevation geologic attributes of the underground system and anthropogenic activities reservoir dam construction land use change and excessive water exploitation past studies highlight the spatial and temporal disparities of streamflow as the adverse effect of climate change and or different rigorous human interventions ma et al 2009 mango et al 2011 wang et al 2013 zhan et al 2014 mittal et al 2016 sun et al 2016 bu et al 2018 han et al 2019 as a result the streamflow of many river basins decreased considerably as compared to the natural flow regime the threat of water scarcity is expected to be high due to the lack of holistic expertise of basin scale hydrology specifically the causes and effects of streamflow variations li et al 2018 in addition to streamflow the other water balance components are necessary for the agricultural sector industrial demand human consumption food security and energy generation schuol et al 2008 recent studies on basin scale water availability have focused on the quantification of internal renewable water resources irwr in terms of blue water flow bfw crop evapotranspiration in terms of green water flow gfw and green water storage gws with the soil moisture storage component schuol et al 2008 faramarzi et al 2009 vanham 2016 yuan et al 2019 the existing studies of freshwater evaluation at the global and continental scales were applied for water stress analysis vörösmarty et al 2005 climate change and its impact on socioeconomic scenarios alcamo et al 2007 seasonal and inter annual water storage alteration analysis guntner et al 2007 and global water scarcity assessment in light of environmental water demand smakhtin 2004 however the regional scale assessments are important to help the decision makers to propose balanced water resource management strategies with prospective socioeconomic pathways alcamo et al 2017 although few studies highlight the changing pattern of streamflow due to climate variation and or land use conversion effect as well as alteration of different water balance components like baseflow surface runoff groundwater and evapotranspiration et at basin scale in india e g anand et al 2018 das et al 2018 visakh et al 2019 however they do not emphasize the inherent water scarcity risk to the basin scale hydrology with the growing concern of ecological water resources management the key questions arise as a proof of the concept advocated in this study are 1 how significant are the individual influence of climate change and land use land cover alteration for two typical selected data scarce composite river basins 2 how a basin is vulnerable to these driving factors on a decadal time scale 3 are there any variations in basin scale water balance components at a decadal time scale and 4 whether water scarcity issues can be analyzed integrating streamflow variation and water availability components in terms of water balance fluxes when information on basin scale water demands are scarce to address these research questions the main aim of this study is to investigate the dominating influence of climate change and land use alteration to the streamflow of the selected typical brahmani baitarani river basin employing a hydrological modelling framework namely swat at a decadal time scale the basin scale water availability assessment in terms of hydrological flux components incorporating streamflow variation is carried out to portray the risk of water scarcity 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area for the present study the composite brahmani baitarani river basin in eastern india is selected the 799 km long brahmani river basin is bounded in between 83 52 e to 87 50 e longitudes and 20 28 n to 23 35 n latitudes with an extent of 36 790 km2 the baitarani river basin 12 094 km2 extends from 20 30 n to 22 20 n latitudes and 85 05 e to 87 05 e longitudes the elevation of both the river basins ranges from the mean sea level to 1190 m which reduces to 10 m downward of the basin towards the seaside the bay of bengal the locational information of the brahmani baitarani river basin is shown in fig 1 the brahmani river together with the baitarani river forms a large delta before draining into the bay of bengal at dharma which is reported as a flood prone area rai et al 2018 the deltaic region is formed at the jenapur discharge station both the river basins cover the major portions of three states viz odisha jharkhand and a small part of chhattisgarh rengali reservoir is located in the upper basin of the jenapur gauging site of the brahmani river basin similarly the baitarani river basin has a salandi dam in the upper basin of the anandapur gauging site both of the river basins fall within the subtropical monsoon climate zone dahm et al 2016 where nearly 80 of the annual rainfall is received during the south west monsoon season june to september causing floods in the lower reaches the annual rainfall of both the river basins varies from 1400 to 1600 mm year and the average annual temperature lies between 20 and 37 c the main soil types in the brahmani river basin are red and yellow soils red sandy and loamy soils mixed red and black soils and coastal alluvium chaturvedi 2011 in the baitarani river basin it varies from rich red loamy to gravely detritus paul et al 2019a b 2 2 swat hydrological model background swat is a basin scale quasi distributed continuous time step hydrological model that is integrated with the gis platform arnold et al 1993 it is a popular physically based model for estimating hydrological process components in various river basins over the world with quite good performances arnold et al 2000 muttiah and wurbs 2002 di luzio and arnold 2004 secchi et al 2007 gathenya et al 2011 piman et al 2012 norman et al

the influence of different land use practices for agricultural nutrient wash off sediment and water in large ungauged basins arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2002 simulation of different hydrologic processes is analyzed together with the surface runoff generation et groundwater flow lateral flow and percolation by applying swat surface runoff is generated using either the scs curve number method or the green and ampt infiltration model et is quantified by various approaches namely priestley taylor hargreaves and penman monteith methods subsurface flow components such as lateral flow groundwater flow and percolation are evaluated through the mass balance of the subsurface system simulation of hydrological processes in swat is conceptualized by the water balance equation as 1 s w t s w o i 1 t p i q i e t i g i r i where s w t is the residual water content in soil mm s w o is the initial soil water content on i th day mm t is time in days p i is the precipitation on i th day mm q i is the surface runoff on i th day mm eti is the evapotranspiration on i th day mm g i is the water flowing to the subsurface zone from the soil profile on i th day mm and r i is the return flow on i th day mm primarily swat simulates the water balance components of each hydrological response unit hru which is a unique group of soil and vegetation types in the sub basin and modelled to estimate water availability at the main channel of each sub basin for a given time phase then it is routed to regulate the interchange of water through the river system and subsurface system to the basin outlet for the calibration validation sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis of swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup are generally used abbaspour 2012 in this study the popular and highly efficient sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup interface is used for the calibration of swat parameters abbaspour 2008 zhou et al 2014 wu and chen 2015 kumar et al 2017 cao et al 2018 based on the sensitivity analysis method model parameters are selected with the latin hypercube one factor at a time technique for each decade seven years of data is used for calibration followed by three years of data for validation of swat under different model scenarios for the brahmani river basin swat is calibrated at jenapur station and for the baitarani river basin it is at anandapur station for performance evaluation of the different climate change and land use alteration scenarios adopted in this study the coefficient of determination r2 the nash

map is obtained from the food and agriculture organization fao dataset at a 1 km 1 km spatial scale decadal land use land cover lulc data is collected from the oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive center ornl daac the national aeronautics and space administration nasa earth observing system data and information system eosdis data centres managed by the earth science data and information system esdis project roy et al 2015 das et al 2018 the spatial resolution of the obtained lulc dataset is 100 m 100 m to capture the effect of land use and land cover change during the study period 1980 2009 the representative land use maps of the years 1985 l1 1995 l2 2005 l3 are used the dominant land use land cover classes of the study area are identified as agricultural land fallow land urban land deciduous forest shrubland mixed forest and water body which is summarised in table 3 in this study the observed 0 25 gridded rainfall data pai et al 2014 and 1 gridded temperature data are obtained from the india meteorological department imd pune this gridded imd rainfall data has been widely used in the literature mishra et al 2014 deshpande et al 2016 meher et al 2017 sharma and mujumdar 2017 bisht et al 2018 smitha et al 2018 the available 1 gridded temperature information is resampled to 0 25 using the bilinear interpolation technique to ensure uniformity in spatial resolution of the obtained dataset sharma and mujumdar 2017 bisht et al 2019 peng et al 2019 daily observed streamflow data of jenapur brahmani basin and anandapur baitarani basin gauging stations are collected from 1980 to 2009 from the central water commission cwc bhubaneswar due to the unavailability of wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation data for the study area these weather datasets are not used in swat for estimation of the et the hargreaves temperature based approach is used to estimate the et which does not require the above dataset linear trend analysis yue and wang 2004 barua et al 2013 anghileri et al 2014 ji and duan 2019 is performed to detect the variations of hydro meteorological time series viz precipitation temperature and streamflow for this analysis the entire period 1980 2009 is divided into three different climatic sub periods c1 c2 c3 with 10 years of time extent in each sub period which is used for the decadal d1 d2 d3 evaluations of basin scale hydrology 2 4 model based scenario design table 1 shows the details of different model scenarios categorized by different climatic conditions and land use cover by evaluating the hydrological variables under different model performances four scenarios s1 s2 s3 s4 are proposed to study the dominating influence of climate change and land use cover alteration on streamflow of the brahmani baitarani river basin over the study period of 1980 2009 in this study model setups are done separately for both the river basins the influences of the reservoir are neglected due to the unavailability of reservoir operation data the entire brahmani river basin is discretized into 25 sub basins and 637 hrus using swat interface similarly the baitarani river basin is partitioned into 25 sub basins and 466 hrus the model is calibrated and validated at jenapur gauging station which lies in the 25th sub basin of the brahmani river basin and covers about 90 of the total basin area for the baitarani river basin anandapur gauging station is chosen for calibration and validation which lies in the 20th sub basin all the models are calibrated and validated on a monthly scale moreover 2 years of the warm up period has been considered for all the model scenarios 2 5 uncertainty analysis the uncertainty resulting from the sensitive model parameters and scenario performances of climate and lulc is analyzed collectively using a quantile regression technique a stochastic approach koenker and bassett 1978 being widely used in the recent literature e g koenker and hallock 2001 kumar et al 2015 sahoo et al 2018 2020 paul et al 2019a b nanda et al 2019 the monthly observed simulated and residual streamflow can be expressed mathematically as 5 q t q t r t where q t is the observed monthly streamflow q t is the simulated monthly streamflow and r t is the residual a functional relationship is assumed between residuals and estimates in the gaussian domain i e normalized quantile streamflow nqs and normalized quantile residual nqr considering a linear relation between nqs and nqr koenker and hallock 2001 nqr is expressed as 6 nqr a n q s b minimizing the absolute bias by assigning different weights to positive and negative residuals in the gaussian domain different quantile regression lines may be obtained absolute bias is considered in this study as an objective function of which can be expressed mathematically as 7 of m i n ρ τ nqr a n q s b where a slope b intercept and ρ τ quantile regression function that pushes the regression line to the desired location to estimate the streamflow corresponding to a given confidence limit the model simulated monthly streamflow is transformed as nqs first and then using eq 6 the regression line in the gaussian domain is fitted using the pre estimated mean and standard deviation of the residual the estimated residual nqr is transformed back to the original domain finally the estimated residual is added to the monthly simulated streamflow to obtain the uncertainty based streamflow regression lines corresponding to different confidence intervals ci are used to study the uncertainty in simulated streamflow the slope and intercept of these lines are estimated by eq 7 using the model simulated streamflow data further to verify the accuracy of different error models the models are incorporated with different scenarios 2 6 water availability assessment the basin scale water availability in the study area is assessed for different sub periods with 10 years of moving window water availability is categorized into blue and green water the blue water flow bwf which is the internal renewable water resource is quantified from the aggregate of the surface water and the groundwater constituents therefore surface runoff lateral flow and return flow are grouped into bwf components at a basin scale the naturally infiltrated water is the key concept behind the green water component of a basin that is characterized into two parts green water resource storage gws comprising of the available moisture in the soil and green water flows gwf which is the actual evapotranspiration however the actual evapotranspiration is the loss of water freed to the atmosphere through a combined process of transpiration from vegetation covers and evaporation from water bodies and soil profiles thus blue water flow and green water storage are considered as water availability of the basin for the present study 2 7 water scarcity risk analysis water scarcity is generally estimated as the sectoral water demands in excess from the water availability at the basin scale however in many river basins world wide the sectoral water demands are hardly available therefore considering the baseline water demands the water scarcity risk assessment is carried out separately for the brahmani and baitarani river basins based on the relative changes in streamflow δ q and water availability δ w a for this analysis it is assumed that there is almost equilibrium exists between the water demands and water availability the relative changes in streamflow and water availability are calculated as follows 8 δ q q a q b q b 9 δ w a w a a w a b w a b where δ q is the relative change in streamflow q a and q b are the average streamflow for the assessment and baseline periods respectively δ w a is the relative change in water availability and w a a and w a b are the average water availabilities for the assessment and baseline periods respectively based on the above parameter values four different risk zones are identified garrote et al 2018 the criteria for the potential water scarcity risk assessment zoning is outlined below zone 1 z1 δ q 0 δ w a 0 less risk zone 2 z2 δ q 0 δ w a 0 moderate risk zone 3 z3 δ q 0 δ w a 0 high risk zone 4 z4 δ q 0 δ w a 0 extreme risk in zone 1 there is less risk of water scarcity until water demands are higher than the water availability with the positive change scenarios in both the streamflow and water availability in case of zone 2 there is a moderate risk of water scarcity due to a decrease in streamflow which will stress in the water supply system in zone 3 the water scarcity risk is high as there is a reduction in water availability in zone 4 both the streamflow and water availability decrease which would result in an extreme risk for the basin 3 results 3 1 land use cover changes in the basin the percentage of basin area under different land use classes is illustrated in table 2 it is noticed from fig 2 that the agricultural land and deciduous forests are two major land use classes in the composite brahmani baitarani river basins an overall increasing trend is observed in agricultural land shrubland mixed forest and urban land classes during the study period 1980 2009 in both the river basins deciduous forests exhibit a decrease in the areal extent which may be due to human interventions with the conversion into agricultural lands owed to population growth however there is a significant variation in fallow land over the study period in the brahmani river basin further the basin is experiencing a reduction in the water spreading area however water spreading area is increasing in the baitarani river basin these transformations in land use and land cover are expected to influence the water balance of the study area 3 2 hydro meteorological changes the linear trend analysis of three main hydro climatic variables i e precipitation mean temperature and streamflow is carried out at an annual scale as the long term 1980 2009 annual change rate of all the data series is not significant the change rates are listed in the form of the decadal time scale as shown in table 3 table 3 reveals that there is a decreasing trend in the temperature data series c1 1980 1989 climatic sub period for both the brahmani and baitarani river basins similarly streamflow data series of c3 2000 2009 sub period shows a negative linear trend with a decline rate of 3 90 mm 10a for the brahmani river basin precipitation time series represents an increasing trend for both the river basins for all the sub periods these trends for the brahmani and baitarani river basins are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively these figures reveal that overall both the basins experienced variations in precipitation temperature and streamflow for different sub periods 3 3 executing model scenarios in swat the different model scenarios in swat as stated in table 1 are calibrated and validated with the sensitive parameters which are listed in table 4 the comparisons of monthly streamflow series between model simulated and observed streamflow at jenapur and anandapur stations are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively the selection of sensitive parameters and its ranges are finalized based on an in depth model calibration of the present study area as well as model results of eastern india river basins paul et al 2019a b visakh et al 2019 a good agreement between the observed and model simulated streamflow is noticed from the respective graphical representations however the simulated flows of m1 and m2 model of the brahmani river basin and the m1 model of the baitarani basin are not able to capture the high streamflow which may be attributed to the lack of reservoir operation data the statistical performance indices of model performance i e nse values with greater than 0 5 r2 values greater than 0 6 and pbias values within 25 are relevant to test the reliability of the model moriasi et al 2007 the nse r2 and pbias values for the total period calibration period and validation period of the corresponding river basins are shown in table 5 the model evaluation results suggest that the range and fine tuning of the sensitive parameters are up to mark and the swat model is a promising tool for the brahmani and baitarani river basins to analyze the water availability 3 4 assessment of scenarios of lulc and climate as stated in table 1 the scenario s1 s2 s3 and s4 simulations are carried out to capture the major influences of land use land cover transformation and climate change these simulations are carried out using the best fit sensitive parameters from the well validated models m1 m2 and m3 of the respective basins the evaluations of different scenarios are carried out by comparing them with the observed streamflow and estimated nse r2 and pbias as shown in figs 7 and 8 from the analysis the simulated streamflow for the s3 and s4 scenarios shows a good reproduction with the corresponding observed streamflow as shown in figs 7 and 8 it is clear from the figures that the climate change effect is more noticeable in both the river basins form fig 7 the simulated streamflow for scenario s1 of the brahmani river basin underestimates the observed streamflow of the mid decade 1990 1999 although scenario s2 overestimates at the end decade 2000 2009 the simulated scenarios s1 s2 of the baitarani river basin underestimate the observed streamflow of the respective decades however the peak flows of the s1 scenario are significantly high in the years 1992 1993 1995 and 1998 the insignificant changes in lulc as discussed in section 3 1 are likely to affect the agreement of scenario simulations with the observed streamflow 3 5 uncertainty analysis of model and scenarios outcomes in this study the stochastic based quantile regression approach as discussed in section 2 5 is used to ensure the dominating effect of climate change lulc and sensitive model parameters on streamflow variation in the brahmani and baitarani river basins two regression lines with maximum upper and minimum lower limits of 95 confidence band are used to analyze the uncertainty in streamflow variation figs 9 and 10 present the uncertainty of the brahmani and baitarani river basins respectively for d2 1990 1999 and d3 2000 2009 periods it is evident from figs 9 and 10 that most of the observed monthly streamflow data fall within 95 ci bands for sensitive parameters m2 m3 and climate change scenarios s3 s4 which indicate that both the climate change and sensitive model parameters factors play major roles in streamflow variation although the plots of lulc scenarios s1 s2 show that a few data points fall outside the defined bands however the uncertainty needs to be further analyzed to quantify the individual uncertainty of sensitive parameters climate change and lulc on streamflow variation which is beyond the scope of this study 3 6 quantification of basin scale water availability the water balance components are estimated by the calibrated and validated models m1 m2 m3 for both the river basins at the decadal scale table 6 shows the quantity of different water balance components viz precipitation actual evapotranspiration surface runoff lateral flow soil moisture storage and deep aquifer recharge the quantitative assessment of water balance components for the brahmani river basin shows an increase in et 18 water yield 32 and lateral flow 38 during the mid decade as compared with the 1st decade however a declination rate of 22 in the case of surface runoff and 4 in deep aquifer recharge is experienced a significant variation is there in the case of soil moisture storage at a decreasing rate of 257 mm 10a similarly as regards to the comparison of the components during end decade with the mid decade the declining trends are present in et 10 5 water yield 30 lateral flow 49 and deep aquifer recharge 22 while there are increasing rates in surface runoff 25 and soil moisture content 32 the water balance components of the baitarani river basin experiences variations in et 1 10 water yield 0 69 11 surface runoff 29 7 5 lateral flow 47 0 5 soil moisture storage 0 1 91 and deep aquifer recharge 64 87 during the mid decade as compared with the 1st decade and end decade to mid decade respectively the comparative assessment of basin scale water availability in terms of bwf gwf and gws are evaluated at a decadal time slice for both the river basins as gwf results in major losses from the basins in terms of evaporation and transpiration water availability for this analysis includes gws which is the available moisture in the soil and bwf which is cumulative of water yields and deep aquifer recharge the variations of different water availability components are presented in fig 11 it is revealed in fig 11 that there are fluctuations in the bwf gwf and gws components in the brahmani river basin over the three selected decades in the early decade 1980 1989 almost a balance does exist among all the estimated water availability components in the brahmani river basin however the bwf and gwf components show an increasing trend during the mid decade 1990 1999 a decline of gws in the mid decade is also seen which is observed from table 6 after all gws exhibits a considerable increase in its magnitude at the end of the decade 2000 2009 than the previous decade as compared to the brahmani river basin the baitarani river basin shows higher values of bwf overall there are positive variations noticed in the bwf and gwf estimates for the baitarani river basin conversely the gws estimate is decreased towards the end of the decade 2000 2009 further it is observed that the availability of gws in the baitarani river basin is relatively less than that of the brahmani river basin it should be noted that the estimated water balance components are calibrated directly from the model results of the respective river basins as there are no direct available observations 3 7 basin scale water scarcity risk assessment the risk of water scarcity is assessed considering the relative changes in streamflow and water availability of the basin the basin scale assessments of relative changes in streamflow and water availability for the selected river basins are shown in fig 12 the relative changes of streamflow and water availability for different periods are denoted as dij where i is the assessment period and j is the baseline period for this analysis decade 2 1990 1999 has been compared with decade 1 1980 1989 the baseline similarly decade 3 2000 2009 has been compared separately with decades 1 and 2 considering two different baseline periods these results reveal that there is a frequent declination in water availability in the brahmani river basin comparing the relative changes of streamflow the corresponding basin faces a falling trend when d2 is compared with d1 while increasing rates are observed when d3 is compared with d1 and d2 therefore according to the water scarcity risk criteria as defined in section 2 7 the brahmani river basin is categorized under the high risk zone of water scarcity whereas the baitarani river basin is under the moderate risk zone however the tendency of relative change in streamflow of the baitarani river basin is decreasing at the end 4 discussion 4 1 model and scenarios response to climate change and lulc in this study the influence of climate change and lulc has been assessed on the hydrological cycle of the brahmani and baitarani basins in this context the long term hydro climatic variables are divided into 3 decades 1980 1989 1990 1990 2000 2009 linear trend analysis is carried out to examine the variations of hydro climatic variables for different time slices as shown in the studies by ji and duan 2019 a set of four scenarios is defined to study the dominating impacts of climate change and lulc according to past researches li et al 2016 ji and duan 2019 the overall analysis of climate change shows that precipitation has high increasing trends at a rate of 20 75 mm 10a and 40 56 mm 10a for the brahmani and baitarani river basins at the end of the decade respectively further as the brahmani river basin is facing a decline in the areal extent of water bodies which includes river basin and reservoirs reduction in streamflow trends is observed towards the end decades the calibration and validation of swat are performed with sufi2 algorithm at jenapur 20 53 24 n 86 0 36 e and anandapur 21 13 46 n 86 7 30 e gauging stations located in the lower and middle parts of the brahmani and baitarani river basins respectively the calibrated peak flow is adjusted by modifying the sensitive parameters including cn2 mgt curve number and sol awc sol available water capacity of the soil layer based on earlier studies abbaspour et al 2015 veettil and mishra 2016 the parameters like gw delay gw groundwater delay time gwqmn gw threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur and gw revap gw groundwater revamp coefficient are used to adjust the baseflow of the corresponding river basins overall 10 hydrologic parameters are used in model calibration table 2 and the goodness of fit statistics r2 nse and pbias are evaluated between swat simulated flow and observed streamflow table 5 the sensitive parameters of the calibrated and validated models of both the basins show an extreme fluctuation in the subsequent decades the alterations in lulc are expected to affect the variations of sensitive model parameters nejadhashemi et al 2010 welde and gebremariam 2017 das et al 2018 as well as basin responses however the scenario analysis undertaken in this study suggests that climate change has major influences on basin than the lulc transformations figs 7 and 8 for both the river basins while the application of direct interventions dams and reservoirs details to the model is limited the uncertainty analysis figs 9 and 10 reveals that sensitive parameters as well as climate change have some considerable effects on both the basin responses 4 2 water availability in the brahmani and baitarani river basin the spatiotemporal variations of water availability in terms of blue and green water are important for having in depth knowledge of the actual water resources status of a river basin schuol et al 2008 the water balance components such as et water yield surface runoff lateral flow soil moisture storage and deep aquifer recharge are calculated from the well calibrated and validated swat for quantifying the bwf gwf and gws at decadal time scales the temporal distributions of bwf are noticed to be affected by the precipitation pattern for the corresponding river basins the maximum precipitation at a decadal scale is observed during the mid decade in the brahmani river basin 1475 2 mm 10a and the end decade in the baitarani river basin 1595 6 mm 10a the baitarani river basin has a high amount of bwf as compared to the brahmani river basin which could help for sustaining the sectoral water demands the human activities of agronomy and irrigation including climate change are expected to play important roles in the variation of gwf zou et al 2017 the areal extent of agricultural farming for both the river basins varies from 45 to 60 therefore the et from agricultural cultivations is likely to have a strong impact on controlling the gwf in the basin further the decadal gwf of the baitarani river basin follows the varying pattern of temperature however an increased gwf results in major losses from the basins in terms of evaporation and transpiration which can hamper water resource availability in the river basin the study by wenzhi and junliang 2004 indicates that continuous losses in terms of evaporation results in low soil moisture storage the past studies revealed that 60 of total precipitation is consumed by vegetative transpiration and soil evaporation from the upper soil layers oki and kanae 2006 however the shallow layers of arid and semi arid regions hold low soil moisture content mishra and singh 2010 the decadal variability of gws is significant in the brahmani river basin which is followed by the changing patterns of gwf further it is observed that the availability of gws in the baitarani river basin is relatively less than that of the brahmani river basin the warm and humid climate of both the river basins is expected to influence the water availability components 4 3 application of water scarcity risk assessment the water scarcity risk assessment method advocated in this study is an integrated approach of relative changes in streamflow as well as water availability using the assumption of equilibrium condition in between the water demands and water availability the hypothesis of water scarcity risk is analyzed the past study by garrote et al 2018 reveals that basin scale water availability is a combined result of streamflow and other storage components of the basin in this study the conceptual analysis of the developed approach shows that the brahmani river basin is in the high risk zone category with a continuous decrease of basin scale water availability which is a serious threat to rain fed agriculture however there is a falling trend in streamflow in the baitarani river basin which would affect the water supply system in the basin thus the corresponding basin is categorized under a moderate risk zone from the surmise of scenario analysis climate change is expected to influence the water balance components as well as the water scarcity of the basin however the unavailability of sectoral water demands limits this study from realistic scenario analysis while the disparities in the water use economic value in different sectors create challenges for environmental awareness seeking to achieve the water rights kendy et al 2018 5 conclusions in this study the temporal variations of key meteorological factors i e precipitation and temperature of climate including the important hydrological variable i e streamflow of a typical composite brahmani baitarani river basins in eastern india are analyzed further the influence of climate change and lulc alterations on streamflow variations has been explored at a decadal time scale using swat hydrological model the calibrated and validated model results are extended to study the temporal deviations in the basin scale water balance components as well as water availability and water scarcity risk zoning based on this study the following specific conclusions are drawn 1 it is noticed that the streamflow is slightly decreased at a rate of 3 90 m2 s 10a in the brahmani basin at the end decade which shows substantial deviations in bwf of the basin the increasing patterns of precipitation and irregular pattern of temperature are the crucial factors for the varying trend of streamflow in both the river basins 2 the effects of different driving forces i e two major climate factors and lulc on the streamflow are heterogeneous climate change impact and sensitive model parameters are major drivers in streamflow variations than lulc alterations interestingly the transformations of lulc cannot be ignored which affects the water balance components of both the river basins 3 the baitarani river basin has been marked as moderately water scarce whereas the brahmani river basin has been identified under high risk water scarcity zone with a persistent decline of water availability in succeeding decades which is crucial for policymakers to maintain available water for sustainable water demand to our knowledge the overall outcomes of the study may be useful for judicious planning and management of water resources of different data scarce river basins concerning the changing climate and lulc constraints further studies can include direct human interventions like reservoir and dam operation policies which can enhance the model outcomes while the contribution analysis of different driving factors can capture the inherent processes of basin scale hydrology the availability of sectoral water demand information may improve the reliability of the developed model based water scarcity risk zoning credit authorship contribution statement

5166,employing a multi model framework we estimate the impacts of contrasting warming levels and uneven regional socio economic development on area population and gross domestic product gdp exposures to flood magnitude and variability in global flood affected regions fars these exposures to flood variability show persistent increases in fars but to flood magnitude only in east and south asia globally the increases in these exposures are not projected in moderate but extreme floods specifically the areal exposure would be decreased increased by 1 8 c 1 9 c for moderate extreme floods the reduced population exposure to extreme floods can be three times higher than that to moderate floods when limiting 2 c to 1 5 c warming rapid regional economic growth of east and south asia whose gdp accounts for 9 8 of fars in year 2000 to 18 5 in year 2025 would shift global gdp exposure from a decrease of 2 5 c to an increase of 1 7 c keywords flood exposures socio economic development multi model framework global warming 1 introduction considering adverse impacts of anthropogenic warming on the society and ecosystems the 2015 paris agreement sets a global target of keeping the warming level below 2 c above preindustrial levels and pursuing to limit the temperature increase to 1 5 c fccc cp 2015 since then potential impacts of the 1 5 c warming relative to the 2 c warming target on natural and man made systems have been widely evaluated at regional and global scales king et al 2017 chevuturi et al 2018 liu et al 2018a b park et al 2018 gu et al 2019a b the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change special report summarized that limiting global warming to 1 5 c compared to the 2 c target can substantially reduce increases in heavy precipitation and hence mitigate the intensification of floods lin et al 2018 liu et al 2018a b park et al 2018 therefore the fraction of global land area affected by floods is projected to be smaller in the 1 5 c warming with medium confidence ipcc 2018 however flood risks are not necessarily proportional to the alleviation of flood hazards in the 1 5 c warming world because flood risks also depend on exposure and vulnerability cardona 2012 lavell 2012 the response of flood properties to anthropogenic warming is twofold changed mean state and variability kiem et al 2003 delgado et al 2010 asadieh and krakauer 2017 although global flood risk assessments have projected changes in flood intensity and evaluated relevant population and gross domestic product gdp exposures jongman et al 2012 winsemius et al 2016 willner et al 2018 few studies have focused on flood risks in terms of changed flood variability kiem et al 2003 delgado et al 2010 over recent years a number of studies have estimated human and economic losses under warming scenarios alfieri et al 2017 dottori et al 2018 however these studies have included no direct quantification of reduced impacts of floods under paris s 0 5 c less warming target or there was no consideration of uneven regional socio economic development in the evaluation of global flood exposure winsemius et al 2016 alfieri et al 2017 dottori et al 2018 willner et al 2018 lai et al 2020 here we evaluate how flood magnitude and variability may change under the 1 5 c and 2 c warming scenarios further we make assessments of future changes in the exposure of land area population and gdp to different flood magnitudes and variabilities under time varying socio economic scenarios which enable us to understand how the uneven regional socio economic development can affect global flood exposure to warming climate to that end we couple anthropogenic warming with socio economic scenarios to quantify the socio economic impacts because of large magnitude or high variability of floods with different return periods under the 1 5 c warming relative to the 2 c warming 2 data and methods 2 1 identification of the major flood affected regions dilley et al 2005 drew four global flood risk maps i e flood hazard frequency flood mortality risk flood proportional economic loss and flood total economic loss risk fig 1 in the four maps flood risk is divided into ten risk deciles from 1th decile low risk to 10th decile high risk the regions where the risk decile is larger than 1th decile are defined as the major flood affected regions fars fig 1 fars account for only 20 of the global land but have far greater extreme precipitation than that over most of the remainder of global land sustain 67 of the global population and produce 54 of the global gross domestic product gdp fig s1 in the supplementary information mitigations or aggravations of flood hazards in fars compared to those in non fars with lower socio economic developments can result in more substantial impacts on flood risks when global scale benefits and effects of the 1 5 c world are assessed 2 2 flood simulations we use daily natural river flow simulations from eight global hydrology and land surface models ghms driven by five coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 global climate models gcms from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip warszawski et al 2014 tables s1 and s2 in the supplementary information li et al 2016a b liang et al 1994 vörösmarty et al 1998 hagemann and gates 2003 tang et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2008 bierkens and van beek 2009 gosling and arnell 2011 pokhrel et al 2012 giuntoli et al 2018 the detail information for the five gcms and their space time resolutions are shown in table s1 in the supplementary information the ability of gcms to reproduce extreme precipitation events is crucial to accurately simulate floods a number of studies have evaluated the performances of cmip5 gcms such as inter annual variability bias and trend in extreme precipitation based on historical observations at global and regional scales kharin et al 2013 sillmann et al 2013 yin et al 2013 mehran et al 2014 kim et al 2019 in isimip the gcm outputs have been bias corrected into a uniform 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution by a statistical method which can adjust probability distributions and reduce departures from observations hempel et al 2013 this bias correction ensures that the long term statistics of the gcm outputs are consistent with the records from the water and global change watch during 1960 1999 weedon et al 2011 warszawski et al 2014 and substantially improves the reproduction of extreme precipitation cannon et al 2015 it is done for precipitation data from gcms under historical and rcp scenarios the non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation for different warming scenarios have been widely assessed and investigated at regional and global scales in previous studies van haren et al 2013 li et al 2016a b 2018a b sarhadi et al 2018 van haren et al 2013 evaluated the modeled changes in extreme precipitation in europe and found that gcms fail to reproduce the observed trend in large parts of europe however from a global perspective the cmip5 gcms have an accepted ability to reproduce the climatological mean state of annual precipitation and its seasonality li et al 2016a b additionally some studies directly employed the projected precipitation from gcms to conduct non stationary extreme value analysis sarhadi et al 2018 li et al 2018a b li et al 2018a b indicated that the 100 year extreme precipitation event in current period would be the 63 year in the period around 2035 based on the future precipitation data from gcms sarhadi et al 2018 conducted a joint probability analysis of the severe warm and dry conditions to evaluate the multidimensional risk in a nonstationary climate these warming signals in the projected extreme precipitation are reserved after the trend preserving bias correction used in the isimip hempel et al 2013 the isimip aims to quantitatively assess the impacts of global climate change on water availability river flooding coastal flooding agriculture ecosystems and energy demands evaluate the basic uncertainty of these assessments and promote the model improvement and intercomparison warszawski et al 2014 therefore isimip presents the potential impacts of climate change on river flooding and doesn t provide specific guidance on adaptation to climate change in an individual river basin dankers et al 2014 additionally the effects of human regulations on river flooding are not considered in the ghms such as land use changes flow control structures flood defenses hirabayashi et al 2013 these human activities may play a crucial role in flood simulations in a specific river basin hence the isimip may overestimate the flood risk in some regions nevertheless the projections from isimip give us a reference on how the global flood risk would change and what is the uncertainty of the changing flood risk only from a perspective of climate change it is still worth conducting this work from a risk management perspective if the change directions of flood risk are consistent in most models and scenarios the regions with projected high flood risk should be paid more attentions and adaptation plans in these regions should be prepared beforehand warszawski et al 2014 2 3 model validation against observations forty simulations i e 5 gcms 8 ghms of daily discharge of 1971 2005 under historical scenario and of 2006 2100 under representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 were obtained from isimip2a warszawski et al 2014 comparing with the original version of isimip i s fast track isimip2a is explicitly designed to evaluate the model s ability to reproduce observed historical variability responses to extreme climatic events such as floods heavy rains and storms the bias correction method is also improved to better preserves variability and extreme events and to apply this method to the rcp climate projections rcp8 5 is a high emission scenario dominated by the large increase in greenhouse gas concentrations because of this dominance changes in floods reflect the primary role of greenhouse gases and can be thought of as the response of the floods to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to enhance the signal detection of anthropogenic warming effect in floods we only choose the flood projections under rcp8 5 the peak discharge simulated by the eight ghms has been widely evaluated by in situ observations on major big rivers across the globe hirabayashi et al 2013 li et al 2018a b zhao et al 2017 dottori et al 2018 willner et al 2018 hirabayashi et al 2013 selected 32 large basins worldwide to compare the flood simulations by matsiro hydrological model one of the eight ghms with observations and indicated that the performance of mean annual maximum daily discharge was acceptable with bias 50 in 17 basins li et al 2016a b validated the discharge with observations in ten major chinese rivers and reported that isimip simulations had acceptable skill in modelling floods we also compared the annual maximum daily discharge from isimip with observations from global runoff data centre grdc in nine large rivers across the fars during 1971 2005 the nine large rivers are chosen due to that they are scattered across the fars and due to their high quality of observations additionally isimip provides a framework to assess the impacts of climate changes at a global scale thus it is a huge challenge for isimip models to accurately simulate the floods in small catchments although large uncertainties and systematic biases are observed in individual simulations of these 40 gcm ghm combinations the median of these simulations shows acceptable performance the coefficient of determination in all nine rivers is larger than 0 66 especially in the amazon orinoco mekong yangtze and pearl basins fig 2 it is difficult to comprehensively evaluate the ability of ghms in isimip to reproduce observed flood characteristics and trends due to the lack of observations in many rivers and the influences of human activities such as water extraction reservoir operation land use land cover change however these ghms can still be considered as the state of the art models dankers et al 2014 2 4 definitions of the present day 1 5 c and 2 c warmer worlds global mean surface temperature gmst during 1861 2100 is an output of the five gcms under historical and rcp8 5 scenarios the reference period 1861 1900 is used to calculate pre industrial gmst the estimated increase in gmst averaged over a 30 year period centered on a particular year is defined as the warming level fig s2 the present day is defined from 1971 to 2000 with 0 7 c warming referring to the pre industrial level the 1 5 c 2 c warming time is defined as the central year in a 30 year period during which the averaged gmst is closest to 1 5 c 2 c it is worth noting that the 30 year period identified as the 1 5 c 2 c warming time varies by gcms see straight dashed lines in fig s2 in the supplementary information 2 5 calculation of return period and variability of floods for each grid we first employ the annual maximum method to sampling the annual maximum daily discharge during 1971 2100 simulated under the historical scenario and the rcp8 5 then for each grid in the fars a time series of flood peaks over 1971 2100 is established over a 30 year period during the 1971 2100 that is this time series of flood peaks over 1971 2100 can be divided into 30 year segments such as 1971 2000 1972 2001 2071 2100 the stationary generalized extreme value gev distribution coles 2001 is employed to fit the annual maximum daily discharge and estimate the return values rv i e 10 20 and 50 year floods n year floods indicate floods on average occur once during n years in each land grid for each experiment under present day and different warming levels dankers et al 2014 have tested the performance of gev fitness to isimip flood simulations through a likelihood ratio method these n year floods are taken as the flood magnitude we use the standard deviation of annual maximum daily discharge over a 30 year period to define the variability of floods before calculating the variability of floods a local detrending with loess fitting function setting span 0 5 is conducted for each land grid zhang et al 2018 the two characteristics i e flood magnitude and variability are used to describe the selected flood events 2 6 areal population and gdp exposures to floods the estimated 10 20 and 50 year floods during the present day i e 1971 2000 are taken as thresholds of flood magnitude hirabayashi et al 2013 dankers et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 similarly the standard deviation σ of annual maximum daily discharge over the present day is calculated and 1 25 σ 1 5 σ and 1 75 σ are taken as thresholds of flood variability over a 30 year period presenting a specific warming level a land grid is exposed to the flood magnitude if the annual maximum daily discharge in the land grid exceeds the estimated i e 10 20 and 50 year floods in the present day likewise if the standard deviation of annual maximum daily discharge in a land grid exceeds the estimated thresholds i e 1 25 σ 1 5 σ and 1 75 σ in the present day the land grid is taken to be exposed to flood variability the area population and gdp in all land grids exposed to flood magnitude variability are summarized with respect to the total area population and gdp respectively over the whole fars population and gdp exposures are estimated not only based on their values fixed in 2000 but also the projected values considering possible future socioeconomic development scenarios the framework of calculating the areal population and gdp exposures to flood magnitude variability is shown in fig 3 the reduced impacts by the 0 5 c less warming are derived as the ratio of the exposure difference between 1 5 c and 2 c warming levels to the exposure in the 1 5 c warming level we integrate the isimip modeling framework with a number of downscaled socio economic scenarios from the shared socio economic pathways ssp o neill et al 2012 to directly quantify the area population and gdp exposed to riverine flood in different warming levels particularly the exposed differences in 1 5 c and 2 c warming it is worth noting that the mappings between rcp8 5 and ssp3 ssp4 and ssp5 are suitable combinations considering the projected atmospheric composition radiative forcing and climate characteristics van vuuren and carter 2014 the global 15 15 minute grids of the downscaled gdp based on the special report on emissions scenarios sres b2 scenario are geospatial distributions of gross domestic product per unit area gdp densities gaffin et al 2004 this projection of gridded gdp is only to the year 2025 nevertheless this projected gdp data have the ability to capture the future global patterns of gdp development such as the increasing proportion of gdp in east asia and south asia to global gdp 3 results as an indicator of floods the annual maximum daily discharge during 1971 2100 simulated under the historical scenario and the rcp8 5 over the fars are decomposed by the rotated empirical orthogonal function reof marvel et al 2019 the anthropogenic warming signal is defined as the spatial mode of the leading mode and is detected out if the temporal mode of the leading mode increases as the increasing temperature marvel et al 2019 thus the anthropogenic warming signal is detected by the multi model ensemble median of floods and in 36 out of 40 model combinations fig 4 and fig s3 corroborating the impacts of anthropogenic warming on flood behavior moreover we found different flood responses to anthropogenic warming across the fars due to the spatial heterogeneity of magnitudes and directions of changes of floods fig 5 shows the areal average change rate of floods per degree celsius increase over the whole and individual fars overall floods response to anthropogenic warming over the fars is almost zero 0 4 c 25th 75th percentile range 1 1 1 3 c however pronounced positive responses are detected in east asia 5 9 c 3 8 8 6 c and south asia 7 9 c 4 9 10 1 c and these two regions are with high population exposure and high vulnerability winsemius et al 2016 willner et al 2018 decreased snow accumulation in warmer winter dankers et al 2014 triggers negative flood responses to warming climate in europe with a response rate of 4 9 c 7 7 2 7 c as the discussion from dankers et al 2014 the areas where the 30 year floods showed decreases are mainly concentrated in the areas where the hydrograph is dominated by snowmelt in spring the signal to noise snr ratios of the change rates in south asia east asia and europe are 1 meanwhile the snr ratios of 1 in other regions imply substantial uncertainties in the simulated flood changes with the isimip hirabayashi et al 2013 dottori et al 2018 willner et al 2018 and the model uncertainties were evaluated in our validation against observations in nine major rivers across the fars see fig 2 it should be noted that the positive response rates in east asia and south asia may overestimate in the real world due to that our ghms doesn t consider the no climate factors dominated by human regulations we observed consistently increasing flood magnitude the mean magnitude of floods over a 30 year period that is flood magnitude is calculated by the average of annual maximum daily discharge over the 30 year periods representing the present day 1 5 c and 2 c warming levels in the 1 5 c and 2 c worlds relative to the present day i e 1971 2000 across 64 of the fars and specifically in north america and south asia milly et al 2002 hirabayashi et al 2013 paltan et al 2018 fig 6 besides a majority of model ensemble simulations agreed with decreased flood magnitudes in europe in the 2 c warming world relative to the 1 5 c warming flood magnitudes are expected to be larger in east asia south asia and africa but smaller in central and west asia europe and north america hirabayashi et al 2013 employed a state of the art global river routing model with an inundation scheme to compute river discharge from the simulations of 11 gcms under rcp8 5 and projected large increase in flood frequency in southeast asia dankers et al 2014 assessed the relative changes in the 30 year floods in the 2070 2099 under rcp8 5 compared with 1971 2010 under historical scenario and they found a consistent increase in parts of southeast asia including india and a general decrease in northern and eastern europe and parts of northwestern north america this spatial pattern of projected flood change is in line with the projecting changes in 100 year floods from 21gcms shown in best 2018 flood variabilities the standard deviation of floods over a 30 year period in 71 1 73 8 of the fars are expected to increase in the 1 5 2 c warming relative to the present day with high model agreements especially in north america africa south asia and northeast asia fig 6 half of the fars is projected to be associated with increasing flood variabilities in the 2 c warming world compared to the 1 5 c warming we further evaluated impacts of flood magnitude i e the 10 20 and 50 year floods by gev distribution in the present day see fig s4 for spatial distributions of the 10 20 and 50 year floods estimated in 1971 2000 on exposures of area population and gdp to floods as the global mean surface temperature increases by 1 3 c the diametric change in the direction of areal and population exposures between moderate i e 10 and 20 year floods and extreme i e 50 year flood floods are identified across the entire fars fig 7 a specifically the areal exposure to the 20 year flood decreases by 1 8 c while the land area exposed to the 50 year flood increases by 1 9 c fig 7a if the areal exposure in the 50 year flood is combined with population fixed at year 2000 the exposed fraction grows faster 4 8 c which is also the case for the projected population under all the three ssps table 1 winsemius et al 2015 pointed out that flood induced damage may increase by up to a factor of 20 by the end of 21st century without any adaptations east and south asia are the only two regions with increased exposure of land area population and gdp to both moderate and extreme floods especially to the 50 year floods fig s5 the increasing rates of future exposures in east and south asia depend on the projected amounts of population and gdp in these two regions which also largely affect the response behavior of global flood exposure under warming as the ratio of projected population between east and south asia and the whole fars increases from 34 5 in ssp3 to 46 8 in ssp4 the changing rate in fars population exposed to the 50 year floods increases from 2 8 c to 4 4 c table 1 jongman et al 2012 showed systematically larger growth in the population living within flood hazard zones compared to total population growth in the future the gdp of east and south asia accounts for 9 8 of that in fars in year 2000 and the percentage is projected to be 18 5 in year 2025 correspondingly the gdp exposed to 50 year floods is increased from 7 3 c to 8 9 c in south asia from 7 8 c to 17 8 c in east asia and shifts from a decrease of 2 5 c to an increase of 1 7 c for the entire fars fig 7b and c hallegatte et al 2013 projected that the flood induced losses may increase from us 6 billion year in 2005 to be us 52 billion year in 2050 in the l36 largest coastal cities willner et al 2018 indicated that the total economic losses caused by river flooding will increase by 17 in 2016 2035 and the increase is strongest in china if large scale structural adaptation is not adopted human activities and adaptation investments can largely reduce these population and gdp losses ward et al 2017 evaluated the benefits of structural flood protection measures in urban areas around the world and pointed out that flood defense investments could reduce future flood losses below today s level if flood protection standards are considered in flood simulations the projected population and gdp exposures will greatly decline in both high and low income countries winsemius et al 2016 jongman et al 2015 we also evaluated differences in exposures to floods between 1 5 c and 2 c warmings to estimate the impacts of the 0 5 c less warming when the warming is reduced by 0 5 c the fars are projected to benefit from robust and substantial decreases in areal and population exposures to extreme floods fig 7d f over the fars the reduced area and population in year 2000 exposed to the 50 year floods are projected to be 2 9 0 3 7 0 and 8 0 4 1 13 8 respectively which are much higher than those for the 20 year floods i e 0 5 1 2 0 5 and 2 8 0 7 5 9 and those for the 10 year floods i e 1 1 1 6 3 0 and 0 4 0 3 1 6 the alleviation of flood risks to extreme floods by limiting warming to the 1 5 c is particularly evident in east and south asia the reduced areal population and gdp exposures to the 50 year floods around 15 are about threefold higher than that to the 20 year floods around 5 in east asia fig 7e and about double higher than that in south asia fig 7f the percentages of impacts in population exposures are comparable among these ssps paltan et al 2018 indicated that the 100 year floods would decrease to be 25 year floods in a 1 5 c world hirabayashi et al 2013 revealed that the global exposure to floods is highly related to the warming levels dottori et al 2018 indicated that the flood induced losses would rise by 70 83 in a 1 5 c warming level and the death toll would be 50 higher in a 2 c warming level floods that deviate substantially from the climatological mean may exceed the tolerable limits of ecological and human systems of a region thus increases in flood variability can cause considerable threats and losses to the local society and ecosystems poff et al 2007 munoz and dee 2017 the spatial heterogeneities of area population and gdp exposures to flood magnitude are not observed in those exposed to flood variability fig 8 the land area population and gdp exposed to flood variability increase consistently among all three thresholds i e the 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 standard deviation σ in the present day and all individual fars although the estimated exposures vary by these thresholds and by regions for the fars as a whole the area exposed to flood variability exceeding the 1 25 σ is projected to be 29 7 23 1 36 9 and 34 2 23 5 39 2 under the 1 5 c and 2 c warming levels respectively the percentages for flood variability exceeding the 1 75 σ are 7 2 5 2 10 3 and 9 4 5 7 12 5 it is worth noting that the area and population exposed to flood variability increase fastest in south asia the areal exposure for example increases by 17 3 c 12 9 c and 8 9 c for the 1 25 σ 1 5 σ and 1 75 σ respectively followed by east asia 11 9 c 8 3 c and 4 4 c table 2 the gdp growth in east and south asia for example in east asia the gdp exposed to flood variability greater than 1 25 σ increases from 12 7 c in year 2000 to 20 1 c in year 2025 accelerates the response rate of gdp exposure in the whole fars to warming i e from 1 6 c to 7 2 c table 2 similarly we also quantify the differences in these exposures to flood variability greater than 1 25 σ 1 5 σ and 1 75 σ between the two warming levels figs 9 and s6 except for north america and europe the whole and other fars show positive avoided impacts of land area population and gdp in the 1 5 c warming compared to the 2 c warming similarly with flood magnitude higher reduced impacts in flood variability exceeding larger threshold are also observed in the whole fars and most of the individual fars however the percentages of reduced impacts for flood variability are precipitously larger than those for flood magnitude over the whole fars the reduced impacts for flood variability exceeding 1 75 σ are estimated to be 27 1 2 8 56 3 in land area 34 7 15 2 72 6 in population and 12 0 16 1 40 5 in gdp in year 2000 the regions where the reduced impacts are larger than those in the whole fars are mainly found in asia i e northeast asia east asia south asia and central and west asia as the above mentions our model framework does not incorporate the impacts of human interventions on the flood exposures to flood magnitude and variability hence these population and gdp exposures may be overestimated globally 4 conclusion and discussion our results signify that extreme floods are more sensitive to anthropogenic warming and their exposures could be markedly alleviated by 0 5 c less warming likewise larger reduced impacts are projected in greater flood variability whose exposures should be paid more attention due to the consistent increases in all individual fars if temperature increases from 1 5 c to 2 c east and south asia would suffer the most serious increases in the exposures given china and india the two major countries in the two regions having more than 2 7 billion of population and producing 14 9 trillion gdp in us dollars per year their fast growth in population and gdp would largely amplify the socio economic exposures to extreme floods and even alter the response behavior of exposures to warming for the whole fars the potentially huge economic damages caused by extreme floods in east and south asia would strongly and indirectly affect the society and economy in north america and europe by global trade network willner et al 2018 our results heavily depend on the ability of isimip to reproduce observed floods although the impacts of large uncertainties and biases are minimized by the ensemble of different gcms and ghms and using relative changes there might be still noticeable deviations in some regions these deviations are mainly derived from gcms and ghms uncertainty scenario uncertainty and internal variability giuntoli et al 2018 although the gcms outputs have been bias corrected before they are taken as the inputs of the ghms this bias correction may alter the climate change signal and introduce new uncertainty pierce et al 2015 dankers et al 2014 quantified the areas where the gcms ghms variance predominates the uncertainty of simulated floods in isimip and they found that the uncertainty is mainly caused by gcms in tropic areas and outside the tropics the uncertainty induced by ghms is much larger than gcms li et al 2016a b also pointed out that the uncertainty of simulated floods over china from gcms predominates giuntoli et al 2018 further evaluated the uncertainties of projected runoff over the conterminous united states in isimip and indicated that the largest fraction of uncertainty is from gcms and ghms followed by internal variability and to a smaller extent rcps we noticed that the 30 year flood peaks are relatively short records which are used to estimate the 10 20 and 50 year floods schulz and bernhardt 2016 showed that estimating n year floods require much longer time series of flood peaks they employed a 30 year moving window from a particular long 186 year record of flood peaks to test the uncertainty of estimated 100 year floods and indicated that the 100 year floods showed drastic fluctuations it is difficult to accurately estimate the 100 year floods even using a 120 year or 300 year window of flood peaks schulz and bernhardt 2016 additionally long term flood peaks are rarely available nevertheless a 30 year window of flood peaks is widely used to estimate n year floods when assessing the impacts of climate change on floods milly et al 2002 hirabayashi et al 2013 dankers et al 2014 li et al 2016a b best 2018 paltan et al 2018 in these previous studies a baseline period e g 1971 2000 represents the current condition and a projection period represents a future condition i e 2071 2100 the stationary gev distribution is used to estimate a given return period based on the baseline period and projection period although it is likely for the simulated flood peaks to have a significant trend there are several reasons why the non stationary gev distribution was not chose by these previous studies first the stationary flood peaks are free of trends shifts or periodicity cyclicity salas 1993 even if the 30 year flood peaks detected out trends and or shifts we can still not decide whether it is stationary or not due to that these trends and or shifts may be the normal fluctuations in a longer period koutsoyiannis 2006 second that whether the non stationary model is better than the stationary model is debatable among the hydrologist milly et al 2008 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 luke et al 2017 milly et al 2008 believe that stationarity is dead while montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 stand by that stationarity is immortal luke et al 2017 tested 1250 annual maximum discharge records in the united states and indicated that evidence supports an updated stationarity thesis third the n year floods estimated by the nonstationary model are time varying and contain a larger uncertainty that that estimated by the stationary model given that the non stationary model is more complex luke et al 2017 as the same with the previous studies we also chose the stationary gev model to estimate the n year floods based on a 30 year window of flood peaks during 1971 2100 another major limitation of this study is that changes in vegetation due to changing climate and hydrologic conditions are not taken into consideration in the ghms variations in vegetation distribution also have considerable impacts on streamflow especially for the flood generating processes liu et al 2017 liu et al 2018a b zhang et al 2011 however the magnitude and direction of these impacts on streamflow are largely disputed among previous studies due to that the interactions and feedbacks between vegetation dynamics and hydrological variables e g precipitation air temperature and evapotranspiration are not fully understood and explained e g gedney et al 2006 piao et al 2007 gedney et al 2006 attributed the increase in global river runoff to the stomatal antitranspirant response of plants under an elevated atmospheric co2 while piao et al 2007 denied this conclusion and owned the global runoff increase to the changes in mean climate and its variability to further solve this conflict many studies deeply explored the response of precipitation air temperature and evapotranspiration to vegetation dynamics under the rising atmospheric co2 ukkola et al 2015 skinner et al 2017 lemordant et al 2018 li et al 2018a b yang et al 2018 fowler et al 2019 lemordant and gentine 2019 model simulations show that vegetation physiological effects with rising co2 globally enhance the annual daily maximum temperature lemordant and gentine 2019 with rising co2 the reduced stomatal conductance of vegetation from projected physiological forcing leads to a decrease in evapotranspiration skinner et al 2017 while the greening vegetation enhances the evapotranspiration by the increased transpiration li et al 2018a b the altered evapotranspiration induced by vegetation dynamics further affects the precipitation change and the strength of this effect varies by regions skinner et al 2017 li et al 2018a b for example li et al 2018a b indicated that greening vegetation induced precipitation increase can largely offset the enhanced evapotranspiration in north and southeast china the changes in streamflow caused by vegetation dynamics is the result of the co effects from precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water storage therefore from a global perspective it doesn t reach an agreement on the change direction of vegetation dynamic induced streamflow ukkola et al 2015 yang et al 2018 fowler et al 2019 fowler et al 2019 indicated that plant physiological effects driven by the effects of co2 will boost streamflow while ukkola et al 2015 suggested the co2 effects on vegetation leads to a decline in streamflow in water stressed climates for our study whether our flood simulations without considering the vegetation dynamics are overestimated or underestimated remains poorly understood due to the discrepancies of the effects vegetation dynamics on streamflow considering the complexity of global river networks topography land use and land cover the flood exposures are not calculated by using flood inundation models and damage curves dottori et al 2018 the directly overlaying population and gdp data on the exposed grids could overestimate the flood exposures furthermore we calculate the flood exposures without considering the installed and maintained flood protection standards which may overestimate the exposures in some regions such as china winsemius et al 2016 however our purpose is not to accurately evaluate the values of flood exposures under future warming but to assess the relative changes in flood exposures this way to assess the impacts of flooding on population and gdp has been widely used in previous studies jongman et al 2012 hirabayashi et al 2013 asadieh and krakauer 2017 another limitation of our study is to use a short period i e 30 years to estimate 50 year floods the estimation uncertainty of 50 year floods will be amplified by using values in the short period which will make the results less solid schulz and bernhardt 2016 nevertheless previous studies still used the values over a short period to estimate rate floods such as 100 year floods e g jongman et al 2012 hirabayashi et al 2013 it is a huge challenge to solve the issue that how to accurately estimate the recurrence of rate floods over the current relatively short period declaration

5166,employing a multi model framework we estimate the impacts of contrasting warming levels and uneven regional socio economic development on area population and gross domestic product gdp exposures to flood magnitude and variability in global flood affected regions fars these exposures to flood variability show persistent increases in fars but to flood magnitude only in east and south asia globally the increases in these exposures are not projected in moderate but extreme floods specifically the areal exposure would be decreased increased by 1 8 c 1 9 c for moderate extreme floods the reduced population exposure to extreme floods can be three times higher than that to moderate floods when limiting 2 c to 1 5 c warming rapid regional economic growth of east and south asia whose gdp accounts for 9 8 of fars in year 2000 to 18 5 in year 2025 would shift global gdp exposure from a decrease of 2 5 c to an increase of 1 7 c keywords flood exposures socio economic development multi model framework global warming 1 introduction considering adverse impacts of anthropogenic warming on the society and ecosystems the 2015 paris agreement sets a global target of keeping the warming level below 2 c above preindustrial levels and pursuing to limit the temperature increase to 1 5 c fccc cp 2015 since then potential impacts of the 1 5 c warming relative to the 2 c warming target on natural and man made systems have been widely evaluated at regional and global scales king et al 2017 chevuturi et al 2018 liu et al 2018a b park et al 2018 gu et al 2019a b the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change special report summarized that limiting global warming to 1 5 c compared to the 2 c target can substantially reduce increases in heavy precipitation and hence mitigate the intensification of floods lin et al 2018 liu et al 2018a b park et al 2018 therefore the fraction of global land area affected by floods is projected to be smaller in the 1 5 c warming with medium confidence ipcc 2018 however flood risks are not necessarily proportional to the alleviation of flood hazards in the 1 5 c warming world because flood risks also depend on exposure and vulnerability cardona 2012 lavell 2012 the response of flood properties to anthropogenic warming is twofold changed mean state and variability kiem et al 2003 delgado et al 2010 asadieh and krakauer 2017 although global flood risk assessments have projected changes in flood intensity and evaluated relevant population and gross domestic product gdp exposures jongman et al 2012 winsemius et al 2016 willner et al 2018 few studies have focused on flood risks in terms of changed flood variability kiem et al 2003 delgado et al 2010 over recent years a number of studies have estimated human and economic losses under warming scenarios alfieri et al 2017 dottori et al 2018 however these studies have included no direct quantification of reduced impacts of floods under paris s 0 5 c less warming target or there was no consideration of uneven regional socio economic development in the evaluation of global flood exposure winsemius et al 2016 alfieri et al 2017 dottori et al 2018 willner et al 2018 lai et al 2020 here we evaluate how flood magnitude and variability may change under the 1 5 c and 2 c warming scenarios further we make assessments of future changes in the exposure of land area population and gdp to different flood magnitudes and variabilities under time varying socio economic scenarios which enable us to understand how the uneven regional socio economic development can affect global flood exposure to warming climate to that end we couple anthropogenic warming with socio economic scenarios to quantify the socio economic impacts because of large magnitude or high variability of floods with different return periods under the 1 5 c warming relative to the 2 c warming 2 data and methods 2 1 identification of the major flood affected regions dilley et al 2005 drew four global flood risk maps i e flood hazard frequency flood mortality risk flood proportional economic loss and flood total economic loss risk fig 1 in the four maps flood risk is divided into ten risk deciles from 1th decile low risk to 10th decile high risk the regions where the risk decile is larger than 1th decile are defined as the major flood affected regions fars fig 1 fars account for only 20 of the global land but have far greater extreme precipitation than that over most of the remainder of global land sustain 67 of the global population and produce 54 of the global gross domestic product gdp fig s1 in the supplementary information mitigations or aggravations of flood hazards in fars compared to those in non fars with lower socio economic developments can result in more substantial impacts on flood risks when global scale benefits and effects of the 1 5 c world are assessed 2 2 flood simulations we use daily natural river flow simulations from eight global hydrology and land surface models ghms driven by five coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 global climate models gcms from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip warszawski et al 2014 tables s1 and s2 in the supplementary information li et al 2016a b liang et al 1994 vörösmarty et al 1998 hagemann and gates 2003 tang et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2008 bierkens and van beek 2009 gosling and arnell 2011 pokhrel et al 2012 giuntoli et al 2018 the detail information for the five gcms and their space time resolutions are shown in table s1 in the supplementary information the ability of gcms to reproduce extreme precipitation events is crucial to accurately simulate floods a number of studies have evaluated the performances of cmip5 gcms such as inter annual variability bias and trend in extreme precipitation based on historical observations at global and regional scales kharin et al 2013 sillmann et al 2013 yin et al 2013 mehran et al 2014 kim et al 2019 in isimip the gcm outputs have been bias corrected into a uniform 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution by a statistical method which can adjust probability distributions and reduce departures from observations hempel et al 2013 this bias correction ensures that the long term statistics of the gcm outputs are consistent with the records from the water and global change watch during 1960 1999 weedon et al 2011 warszawski et al 2014 and substantially improves the reproduction of extreme precipitation cannon et al 2015 it is done for precipitation data from gcms under historical and rcp scenarios the non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation for different warming scenarios have been widely assessed and investigated at regional and global scales in previous studies van haren et al 2013 li et al 2016a b 2018a b sarhadi et al 2018 van haren et al 2013 evaluated the modeled changes in extreme precipitation in europe and found that gcms fail to reproduce the observed trend in large parts of europe however from a global perspective the cmip5 gcms have an accepted ability to reproduce the climatological mean state of annual precipitation and its seasonality li et al 2016a b additionally some studies directly employed the projected precipitation from gcms to conduct non stationary extreme value analysis sarhadi et al 2018 li et al 2018a b li et al 2018a b indicated that the 100 year extreme precipitation event in current period would be the 63 year in the period around 2035 based on the future precipitation data from gcms sarhadi et al 2018 conducted a joint probability analysis of the severe warm and dry conditions to evaluate the multidimensional risk in a nonstationary climate these warming signals in the projected extreme precipitation are reserved after the trend preserving bias correction used in the isimip hempel et al 2013 the isimip aims to quantitatively assess the impacts of global climate change on water availability river flooding coastal flooding agriculture ecosystems and energy demands evaluate the basic uncertainty of these assessments and promote the model improvement and intercomparison warszawski et al 2014 therefore isimip presents the potential impacts of climate change on river flooding and doesn t provide specific guidance on adaptation to climate change in an individual river basin dankers et al 2014 additionally the effects of human regulations on river flooding are not considered in the ghms such as land use changes flow control structures flood defenses hirabayashi et al 2013 these human activities may play a crucial role in flood simulations in a specific river basin hence the isimip may overestimate the flood risk in some regions nevertheless the projections from isimip give us a reference on how the global flood risk would change and what is the uncertainty of the changing flood risk only from a perspective of climate change it is still worth conducting this work from a risk management perspective if the change directions of flood risk are consistent in most models and scenarios the regions with projected high flood risk should be paid more attentions and adaptation plans in these regions should be prepared beforehand warszawski et al 2014 2 3 model validation against observations forty simulations i e 5 gcms 8 ghms of daily discharge of 1971 2005 under historical scenario and of 2006 2100 under representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 were obtained from isimip2a warszawski et al 2014 comparing with the original version of isimip i s fast track isimip2a is explicitly designed to evaluate the model s ability to reproduce observed historical variability responses to extreme climatic events such as floods heavy rains and storms the bias correction method is also improved to better preserves variability and extreme events and to apply this method to the rcp climate projections rcp8 5 is a high emission scenario dominated by the large increase in greenhouse gas concentrations because of this dominance changes in floods reflect the primary role of greenhouse gases and can be thought of as the response of the floods to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to enhance the signal detection of anthropogenic warming effect in floods we only choose the flood projections under rcp8 5 the peak discharge simulated by the eight ghms has been widely evaluated by in situ observations on major big rivers across the globe hirabayashi et al 2013 li et al 2018a b zhao et al 2017 dottori et al 2018 willner et al 2018 hirabayashi et al 2013 selected 32 large basins worldwide to compare the flood simulations by matsiro hydrological model one of the eight ghms with observations and indicated that the performance of mean annual maximum daily discharge was acceptable with bias 50 in 17 basins li et al 2016a b validated the discharge with observations in ten major chinese rivers and reported that isimip simulations had acceptable skill in modelling floods we also compared the annual maximum daily discharge from isimip with observations from global runoff data centre grdc in nine large rivers across the fars during 1971 2005 the nine large rivers are chosen due to that they are scattered across the fars and due to their high quality of observations additionally isimip provides a framework to assess the impacts of climate changes at a global scale thus it is a huge challenge for isimip models to accurately simulate the floods in small catchments although large uncertainties and systematic biases are observed in individual simulations of these 40 gcm ghm combinations the median of these simulations shows acceptable performance the coefficient of determination in all nine rivers is larger than 0 66 especially in the amazon orinoco mekong yangtze and pearl basins fig 2 it is difficult to comprehensively evaluate the ability of ghms in isimip to reproduce observed flood characteristics and trends due to the lack of observations in many rivers and the influences of human activities such as water extraction reservoir operation land use land cover change however these ghms can still be considered as the state of the art models dankers et al 2014 2 4 definitions of the present day 1 5 c and 2 c warmer worlds global mean surface temperature gmst during 1861 2100 is an output of the five gcms under historical and rcp8 5 scenarios the reference period 1861 1900 is used to calculate pre industrial gmst the estimated increase in gmst averaged over a 30 year period centered on a particular year is defined as the warming level fig s2 the present day is defined from 1971 to 2000 with 0 7 c warming referring to the pre industrial level the 1 5 c 2 c warming time is defined as the central year in a 30 year period during which the averaged gmst is closest to 1 5 c 2 c it is worth noting that the 30 year period identified as the 1 5 c 2 c warming time varies by gcms see straight dashed lines in fig s2 in the supplementary information 2 5 calculation of return period and variability of floods for each grid we first employ the annual maximum method to sampling the annual maximum daily discharge during 1971 2100 simulated under the historical scenario and the rcp8 5 then for each grid in the fars a time series of flood peaks over 1971 2100 is established over a 30 year period during the 1971 2100 that is this time series of flood peaks over 1971 2100 can be divided into 30 year segments such as 1971 2000 1972 2001 2071 2100 the stationary generalized extreme value gev distribution coles 2001 is employed to fit the annual maximum daily discharge and estimate the return values rv i e 10 20 and 50 year floods n year floods indicate floods on average occur once during n years in each land grid for each experiment under present day and different warming levels dankers et al 2014 have tested the performance of gev fitness to isimip flood simulations through a likelihood ratio method these n year floods are taken as the flood magnitude we use the standard deviation of annual maximum daily discharge over a 30 year period to define the variability of floods before calculating the variability of floods a local detrending with loess fitting function setting span 0 5 is conducted for each land grid zhang et al 2018 the two characteristics i e flood magnitude and variability are used to describe the selected flood events 2 6 areal population and gdp exposures to floods the estimated 10 20 and 50 year floods during the present day i e 1971 2000 are taken as thresholds of flood magnitude hirabayashi et al 2013 dankers et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 similarly the standard deviation σ of annual maximum daily discharge over the present day is calculated and 1 25 σ 1 5 σ and 1 75 σ are taken as thresholds of flood variability over a 30 year period presenting a specific warming level a land grid is exposed to the flood magnitude if the annual maximum daily discharge in the land grid exceeds the estimated i e 10 20 and 50 year floods in the present day likewise if the standard deviation of annual maximum daily discharge in a land grid exceeds the estimated thresholds i e 1 25 σ 1 5 σ and 1 75 σ in the present day the land grid is taken to be exposed to flood variability the area population and gdp in all land grids exposed to flood magnitude variability are summarized with respect to the total area population and gdp respectively over the whole fars population and gdp exposures are estimated not only based on their values fixed in 2000 but also the projected values considering possible future socioeconomic development scenarios the framework of calculating the areal population and gdp exposures to flood magnitude variability is shown in fig 3 the reduced impacts by the 0 5 c less warming are derived as the ratio of the exposure difference between 1 5 c and 2 c warming levels to the exposure in the 1 5 c warming level we integrate the isimip modeling framework with a number of downscaled socio economic scenarios from the shared socio economic pathways ssp o neill et al 2012 to directly quantify the area population and gdp exposed to riverine flood in different warming levels particularly the exposed differences in 1 5 c and 2 c warming it is worth noting that the mappings between rcp8 5 and ssp3 ssp4 and ssp5 are suitable combinations considering the projected atmospheric composition radiative forcing and climate characteristics van vuuren and carter 2014 the global 15 15 minute grids of the downscaled gdp based on the special report on emissions scenarios sres b2 scenario are geospatial distributions of gross domestic product per unit area gdp densities gaffin et al 2004 this projection of gridded gdp is only to the year 2025 nevertheless this projected gdp data have the ability to capture the future global patterns of gdp development such as the increasing proportion of gdp in east asia and south asia to global gdp 3 results as an indicator of floods the annual maximum daily discharge during 1971 2100 simulated under the historical scenario and the rcp8 5 over the fars are decomposed by the rotated empirical orthogonal function reof marvel et al 2019 the anthropogenic warming signal is defined as the spatial mode of the leading mode and is detected out if the temporal mode of the leading mode increases as the increasing temperature marvel et al 2019 thus the anthropogenic warming signal is detected by the multi model ensemble median of floods and in 36 out of 40 model combinations fig 4 and fig s3 corroborating the impacts of anthropogenic warming on flood behavior moreover we found different flood responses to anthropogenic warming across the fars due to the spatial heterogeneity of magnitudes and directions of changes of floods fig 5 shows the areal average change rate of floods per degree celsius increase over the whole and individual fars overall floods response to anthropogenic warming over the fars is almost zero 0 4 c 25th 75th percentile range 1 1 1 3 c however pronounced positive responses are detected in east asia 5 9 c 3 8 8 6 c and south asia 7 9 c 4 9 10 1 c and these two regions are with high population exposure and high vulnerability winsemius et al 2016 willner et al 2018 decreased snow accumulation in warmer winter dankers et al 2014 triggers negative flood responses to warming climate in europe with a response rate of 4 9 c 7 7 2 7 c as the discussion from dankers et al 2014 the areas where the 30 year floods showed decreases are mainly concentrated in the areas where the hydrograph is dominated by snowmelt in spring the signal to noise snr ratios of the change rates in south asia east asia and europe are 1 meanwhile the snr ratios of 1 in other regions imply substantial uncertainties in the simulated flood changes with the isimip hirabayashi et al 2013 dottori et al 2018 willner et al 2018 and the model uncertainties were evaluated in our validation against observations in nine major rivers across the fars see fig 2 it should be noted that the positive response rates in east asia and south asia may overestimate in the real world due to that our ghms doesn t consider the no climate factors dominated by human regulations we observed consistently increasing flood magnitude the mean magnitude of floods over a 30 year period that is flood magnitude is calculated by the average of annual maximum daily discharge over the 30 year periods representing the present day 1 5 c and 2 c warming levels in the 1 5 c and 2 c worlds relative to the present day i e 1971 2000 across 64 of the fars and specifically in north america and south asia milly et al 2002 hirabayashi et al 2013 paltan et al 2018 fig 6 besides a majority of model ensemble simulations agreed with decreased flood magnitudes in europe in the 2 c warming world relative to the 1 5 c warming flood magnitudes are expected to be larger in east asia south asia and africa but smaller in central and west asia europe and north america hirabayashi et al 2013 employed a state of the art global river routing model with an inundation scheme to compute river discharge from the simulations of 11 gcms under rcp8 5 and projected large increase in flood frequency in southeast asia dankers et al 2014 assessed the relative changes in the 30 year floods in the 2070 2099 under rcp8 5 compared with 1971 2010 under historical scenario and they found a consistent increase in parts of southeast asia including india and a general decrease in northern and eastern europe and parts of northwestern north america this spatial pattern of projected flood change is in line with the projecting changes in 100 year floods from 21gcms shown in best 2018 flood variabilities the standard deviation of floods over a 30 year period in 71 1 73 8 of the fars are expected to increase in the 1 5 2 c warming relative to the present day with high model agreements especially in north america africa south asia and northeast asia fig 6 half of the fars is projected to be associated with increasing flood variabilities in the 2 c warming world compared to the 1 5 c warming we further evaluated impacts of flood magnitude i e the 10 20 and 50 year floods by gev distribution in the present day see fig s4 for spatial distributions of the 10 20 and 50 year floods estimated in 1971 2000 on exposures of area population and gdp to floods as the global mean surface temperature increases by 1 3 c the diametric change in the direction of areal and population exposures between moderate i e 10 and 20 year floods and extreme i e 50 year flood floods are identified across the entire fars fig 7 a specifically the areal exposure to the 20 year flood decreases by 1 8 c while the land area exposed to the 50 year flood increases by 1 9 c fig 7a if the areal exposure in the 50 year flood is combined with population fixed at year 2000 the exposed fraction grows faster 4 8 c which is also the case for the projected population under all the three ssps table 1 winsemius et al 2015 pointed out that flood induced damage may increase by up to a factor of 20 by the end of 21st century without any adaptations east and south asia are the only two regions with increased exposure of land area population and gdp to both moderate and extreme floods especially to the 50 year floods fig s5 the increasing rates of future exposures in east and south asia depend on the projected amounts of population and gdp in these two regions which also largely affect the response behavior of global flood exposure under warming as the ratio of projected population between east and south asia and the whole fars increases from 34 5 in ssp3 to 46 8 in ssp4 the changing rate in fars population exposed to the 50 year floods increases from 2 8 c to 4 4 c table 1 jongman et al 2012 showed systematically larger growth in the population living within flood hazard zones compared to total population growth in the future the gdp of east and south asia accounts for 9 8 of that in fars in year 2000 and the percentage is projected to be 18 5 in year 2025 correspondingly the gdp exposed to 50 year floods is increased from 7 3 c to 8 9 c in south asia from 7 8 c to 17 8 c in east asia and shifts from a decrease of 2 5 c to an increase of 1 7 c for the entire fars fig 7b and c hallegatte et al 2013 projected that the flood induced losses may increase from us 6 billion year in 2005 to be us 52 billion year in 2050 in the l36 largest coastal cities willner et al 2018 indicated that the total economic losses caused by river flooding will increase by 17 in 2016 2035 and the increase is strongest in china if large scale structural adaptation is not adopted human activities and adaptation investments can largely reduce these population and gdp losses ward et al 2017 evaluated the benefits of structural flood protection measures in urban areas around the world and pointed out that flood defense investments could reduce future flood losses below today s level if flood protection standards are considered in flood simulations the projected population and gdp exposures will greatly decline in both high and low income countries winsemius et al 2016 jongman et al 2015 we also evaluated differences in exposures to floods between 1 5 c and 2 c warmings to estimate the impacts of the 0 5 c less warming when the warming is reduced by 0 5 c the fars are projected to benefit from robust and substantial decreases in areal and population exposures to extreme floods fig 7d f over the fars the reduced area and population in year 2000 exposed to the 50 year floods are projected to be 2 9 0 3 7 0 and 8 0 4 1 13 8 respectively which are much higher than those for the 20 year floods i e 0 5 1 2 0 5 and 2 8 0 7 5 9 and those for the 10 year floods i e 1 1 1 6 3 0 and 0 4 0 3 1 6 the alleviation of flood risks to extreme floods by limiting warming to the 1 5 c is particularly evident in east and south asia the reduced areal population and gdp exposures to the 50 year floods around 15 are about threefold higher than that to the 20 year floods around 5 in east asia fig 7e and about double higher than that in south asia fig 7f the percentages of impacts in population exposures are comparable among these ssps paltan et al 2018 indicated that the 100 year floods would decrease to be 25 year floods in a 1 5 c world hirabayashi et al 2013 revealed that the global exposure to floods is highly related to the warming levels dottori et al 2018 indicated that the flood induced losses would rise by 70 83 in a 1 5 c warming level and the death toll would be 50 higher in a 2 c warming level floods that deviate substantially from the climatological mean may exceed the tolerable limits of ecological and human systems of a region thus increases in flood variability can cause considerable threats and losses to the local society and ecosystems poff et al 2007 munoz and dee 2017 the spatial heterogeneities of area population and gdp exposures to flood magnitude are not observed in those exposed to flood variability fig 8 the land area population and gdp exposed to flood variability increase consistently among all three thresholds i e the 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 standard deviation σ in the present day and all individual fars although the estimated exposures vary by these thresholds and by regions for the fars as a whole the area exposed to flood variability exceeding the 1 25 σ is projected to be 29 7 23 1 36 9 and 34 2 23 5 39 2 under the 1 5 c and 2 c warming levels respectively the percentages for flood variability exceeding the 1 75 σ are 7 2 5 2 10 3 and 9 4 5 7 12 5 it is worth noting that the area and population exposed to flood variability increase fastest in south asia the areal exposure for example increases by 17 3 c 12 9 c and 8 9 c for the 1 25 σ 1 5 σ and 1 75 σ respectively followed by east asia 11 9 c 8 3 c and 4 4 c table 2 the gdp growth in east and south asia for example in east asia the gdp exposed to flood variability greater than 1 25 σ increases from 12 7 c in year 2000 to 20 1 c in year 2025 accelerates the response rate of gdp exposure in the whole fars to warming i e from 1 6 c to 7 2 c table 2 similarly we also quantify the differences in these exposures to flood variability greater than 1 25 σ 1 5 σ and 1 75 σ between the two warming levels figs 9 and s6 except for north america and europe the whole and other fars show positive avoided impacts of land area population and gdp in the 1 5 c warming compared to the 2 c warming similarly with flood magnitude higher reduced impacts in flood variability exceeding larger threshold are also observed in the whole fars and most of the individual fars however the percentages of reduced impacts for flood variability are precipitously larger than those for flood magnitude over the whole fars the reduced impacts for flood variability exceeding 1 75 σ are estimated to be 27 1 2 8 56 3 in land area 34 7 15 2 72 6 in population and 12 0 16 1 40 5 in gdp in year 2000 the regions where the reduced impacts are larger than those in the whole fars are mainly found in asia i e northeast asia east asia south asia and central and west asia as the above mentions our model framework does not incorporate the impacts of human interventions on the flood exposures to flood magnitude and variability hence these population and gdp exposures may be overestimated globally 4 conclusion and discussion our results signify that extreme floods are more sensitive to anthropogenic warming and their exposures could be markedly alleviated by 0 5 c less warming likewise larger reduced impacts are projected in greater flood variability whose exposures should be paid more attention due to the consistent increases in all individual fars if temperature increases from 1 5 c to 2 c east and south asia would suffer the most serious increases in the exposures given china and india the two major countries in the two regions having more than 2 7 billion of population and producing 14 9 trillion gdp in us dollars per year their fast growth in population and gdp would largely amplify the socio economic exposures to extreme floods and even alter the response behavior of exposures to warming for the whole fars the potentially huge economic damages caused by extreme floods in east and south asia would strongly and indirectly affect the society and economy in north america and europe by global trade network willner et al 2018 our results heavily depend on the ability of isimip to reproduce observed floods although the impacts of large uncertainties and biases are minimized by the ensemble of different gcms and ghms and using relative changes there might be still noticeable deviations in some regions these deviations are mainly derived from gcms and ghms uncertainty scenario uncertainty and internal variability giuntoli et al 2018 although the gcms outputs have been bias corrected before they are taken as the inputs of the ghms this bias correction may alter the climate change signal and introduce new uncertainty pierce et al 2015 dankers et al 2014 quantified the areas where the gcms ghms variance predominates the uncertainty of simulated floods in isimip and they found that the uncertainty is mainly caused by gcms in tropic areas and outside the tropics the uncertainty induced by ghms is much larger than gcms li et al 2016a b also pointed out that the uncertainty of simulated floods over china from gcms predominates giuntoli et al 2018 further evaluated the uncertainties of projected runoff over the conterminous united states in isimip and indicated that the largest fraction of uncertainty is from gcms and ghms followed by internal variability and to a smaller extent rcps we noticed that the 30 year flood peaks are relatively short records which are used to estimate the 10 20 and 50 year floods schulz and bernhardt 2016 showed that estimating n year floods require much longer time series of flood peaks they employed a 30 year moving window from a particular long 186 year record of flood peaks to test the uncertainty of estimated 100 year floods and indicated that the 100 year floods showed drastic fluctuations it is difficult to accurately estimate the 100 year floods even using a 120 year or 300 year window of flood peaks schulz and bernhardt 2016 additionally long term flood peaks are rarely available nevertheless a 30 year window of flood peaks is widely used to estimate n year floods when assessing the impacts of climate change on floods milly et al 2002 hirabayashi et al 2013 dankers et al 2014 li et al 2016a b best 2018 paltan et al 2018 in these previous studies a baseline period e g 1971 2000 represents the current condition and a projection period represents a future condition i e 2071 2100 the stationary gev distribution is used to estimate a given return period based on the baseline period and projection period although it is likely for the simulated flood peaks to have a significant trend there are several reasons why the non stationary gev distribution was not chose by these previous studies first the stationary flood peaks are free of trends shifts or periodicity cyclicity salas 1993 even if the 30 year flood peaks detected out trends and or shifts we can still not decide whether it is stationary or not due to that these trends and or shifts may be the normal fluctuations in a longer period koutsoyiannis 2006 second that whether the non stationary model is better than the stationary model is debatable among the hydrologist milly et al 2008 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 luke et al 2017 milly et al 2008 believe that stationarity is dead while montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 stand by that stationarity is immortal luke et al 2017 tested 1250 annual maximum discharge records in the united states and indicated that evidence supports an updated stationarity thesis third the n year floods estimated by the nonstationary model are time varying and contain a larger uncertainty that that estimated by the stationary model given that the non stationary model is more complex luke et al 2017 as the same with the previous studies we also chose the stationary gev model to estimate the n year floods based on a 30 year window of flood peaks during 1971 2100 another major limitation of this study is that changes in vegetation due to changing climate and hydrologic conditions are not taken into consideration in the ghms variations in vegetation distribution also have considerable impacts on streamflow especially for the flood generating processes liu et al 2017 liu et al 2018a b zhang et al 2011 however the magnitude and direction of these impacts on streamflow are largely disputed among previous studies due to that the interactions and feedbacks between vegetation dynamics and hydrological variables e g precipitation air temperature and evapotranspiration are not fully understood and explained e g gedney et al 2006 piao et al 2007 gedney et al 2006 attributed the increase in global river runoff to the stomatal antitranspirant response of plants under an elevated atmospheric co2 while piao et al 2007 denied this conclusion and owned the global runoff increase to the changes in mean climate and its variability to further solve this conflict many studies deeply explored the response of precipitation air temperature and evapotranspiration to vegetation dynamics under the rising atmospheric co2 ukkola et al 2015 skinner et al 2017 lemordant et al 2018 li et al 2018a b yang et al 2018 fowler et al 2019 lemordant and gentine 2019 model simulations show that vegetation physiological effects with rising co2 globally enhance the annual daily maximum temperature lemordant and gentine 2019 with rising co2 the reduced stomatal conductance of vegetation from projected physiological forcing leads to a decrease in evapotranspiration skinner et al 2017 while the greening vegetation enhances the evapotranspiration by the increased transpiration li et al 2018a b the altered evapotranspiration induced by vegetation dynamics further affects the precipitation change and the strength of this effect varies by regions skinner et al 2017 li et al 2018a b for example li et al 2018a b indicated that greening vegetation induced precipitation increase can largely offset the enhanced evapotranspiration in north and southeast china the changes in streamflow caused by vegetation dynamics is the result of the co effects from precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water storage therefore from a global perspective it doesn t reach an agreement on the change direction of vegetation dynamic induced streamflow ukkola et al 2015 yang et al 2018 fowler et al 2019 fowler et al 2019 indicated that plant physiological effects driven by the effects of co2 will boost streamflow while ukkola et al 2015 suggested the co2 effects on vegetation leads to a decline in streamflow in water stressed climates for our study whether our flood simulations without considering the vegetation dynamics are overestimated or underestimated remains poorly understood due to the discrepancies of the effects vegetation dynamics on streamflow considering the complexity of global river networks topography land use and land cover the flood exposures are not calculated by using flood inundation models and damage curves dottori et al 2018 the directly overlaying population and gdp data on the exposed grids could overestimate the flood exposures furthermore we calculate the flood exposures without considering the installed and maintained flood protection standards which may overestimate the exposures in some regions such as china winsemius et al 2016 however our purpose is not to accurately evaluate the values of flood exposures under future warming but to assess the relative changes in flood exposures this way to assess the impacts of flooding on population and gdp has been widely used in previous studies jongman et al 2012 hirabayashi et al 2013 asadieh and krakauer 2017 another limitation of our study is to use a short period i e 30 years to estimate 50 year floods the estimation uncertainty of 50 year floods will be amplified by using values in the short period which will make the results less solid schulz and bernhardt 2016 nevertheless previous studies still used the values over a short period to estimate rate floods such as 100 year floods e g jongman et al 2012 hirabayashi et al 2013 it is a huge challenge to solve the issue that how to accurately estimate the recurrence of rate floods over the current relatively short period declaration

5167,many uncertainties are associated with real time reservoir flood control operation and introduce risks for decision making a multi objective risk management model is proposed to optimize the real time flood control operation of a parallel reservoir system during flood season the model considers the combined impact of reservoir inflow and lateral inflow uncertainties and flood control operation risks it consists of three key components a risk optimal operation submodel a risk assessment submodel and an optimization submodel the risk optimal operation submodel takes into account the uncertainties and establishes an operation model that considers two competing objectives of minimizing the risk of upstream flooding and minimizing the risk of downstream flooding the risk assessment submodel calculates the risks based on a stochastic differential equation sde the final optimization submodel embeds the risk assessment model in the risk optimal operation model and is solved by the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii the proposed methodology is applied to a real flood control system in the middle reaches of the huaihe river basin in china the results show that the developed multi objective risk management model can provide operation schedules that satisfy flood control objectives and simultaneously minimize the overall risks the pareto front of the proposed objectives demonstrates the tradeoff among the competing objectives the model can be used as a decision making tool for conducting risk management for real time reservoir flood control operation during flood season the decision makers can choose the operation schedule according to their risk preference and updated hydrological information keywords reservoirs real time flood control operation uncertainty analysis risk assessment multi objective optimization nsga iii 1 introduction generally a multi reservoir flood control system has to account for not only the safety of the dam and the upstream area of the reservoirs but also the safety of the downstream cities the flood control objectives of the upstream and downstream areas of a reservoir usually are influenced by each other and even can be in conflict with each other che and mays 2015 qin et al 2010 jia et al 2016 therefore it may not be possible to find a single optimal operation schedule that simultaneously optimizes all the flood control objectives the problem must be formulated as a multi objective optimization problem in the past many researchers have used mathematical programming algorithms such as linear programing nonlinear programming and dynamic programming with techniques that rely on prior articulation of preferences or techniques that foster iterative definition of preference to solve multi objective optimization problems for reservoir management and operation cohon and marks 1975 the weighting method and the constraint method commonly are used in the weighting method weights are introduced to combine the objectives to form a composite scalar objective function kim and de weck 2005 marler and arora 2010 in principle weights can be varied systematically to trace out the tradeoff curves pareto fronts if the fronts are convex the constraint method chooses one of the objectives as a scalar objective to be optimized and adds the other objectives to the constraint set liang et al 1996 wang et al 2005 yeh and becker 1982 parametric variation of the objectives that are in the constraint set from the lower bound to the upper bound traces out the pareto fronts if the fronts are convex this requires determining the lower and upper bounds of each objective in the constraint set and solving a series of scalar optimization problems however the weighting method and constraint method often fail to find the true pareto fronts when the objective function is nonlinear and non convex deb 2001 reddy and kumar 2007 in recent years multi objective evolutionary algorithms have been utilized to solve multi objective optimization problems in many fields such as water resources planning reservoir operations and hydropower generation reed et al 2013 kollat and reed 2006 chen et al 2007 multi objective evolutionary algorithms are biologically inspired algorithms that are capable of generating an approximation of the pareto front in a single run luo et al 2015 established a multi objective model for reservoir flood control operation and optimized the model with an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm chen et al 2017 proposed a multi objective model for reservoir flood control operation that was optimized by an improved non dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii qi et al 2016 also proposed a self adaptive multi objective evolutionary algorithm for reservoir flood control operation however most of the above mentioned studies focused on a single reservoir and did not consider the uncertainties associated with real time flood control operations the uncertainties stem from observations of precipitation and water level parameter estimation of hydrological models structure of hydrologic models for assessing the true physical mechanisms of the hydrologic process and environmental change over time rosenberg and madani 2014 melching 1992 lund 2002 zhou et al 2016 these uncertainties create great risks for flood control operations influence flood control decisions and affect flood control project benefits hsu et al 2010 wu et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 therefore the problem of real time reservoir flood control operation must be formulated as a multi objective optimization problem that considers uncertainties wang et al 2012 proposed an ensemble hydrological prediction based method that combines ensemble hydrological predictions with multi objective reservoir optimization during the flood season considering streamflow uncertainties however the method is used for a single reservoir and the objective functions proposed are minimizing the maximum reservoir water level minimizing the maximum downstream flood peak and minimizing the difference between the calculated terminal water level and the targeted water level additionally the method does not directly minimize the risks the results provide an ensemble of possible reservoir water levels and releases but not an operation schedule that minimizes the risks huang et al 2018 proposed a risk analysis method using stochastic simulation to evaluate the risk of reservoir flood control operation schedules derived from operation rules considering uncertainties related to flood hydrograph storage water level and outflow discharge diao et al 2010 established an integrated risk analysis model for reservoirs based on monte carlo simulation and flood control operation rules considering the hydrological hydraulic stage storage and time delay uncertainties however the above mentioned risk analysis methods only can be used to assess the risks for given operation schedules and are not suitable for deriving the optimal operation schedules that minimize the flood risks wang et al 2011 developed a chance constrained method for risk analysis and reservoir operation which carries out optimization by adding the risks or uncertainties with probabilities to the constraint set however the constraint method often fails to find the true pareto fronts when the objective function is nonlinear and non convex literature review indicates that there exists a large amount of research dealing with multi objective flood control operations and risk management of reservoirs wang 1996 chen et al 2016 however literature on the combination of multi objective optimal flood control operations and risk management is sparse especially in terms of minimizing the overall risks caused by the uncertainties moreover the objectives considered in previous studies usually include minimizing the highest reservoir water level and minimizing the largest reservoir discharge wang et al 2012 qi et al 2016 chen et al 2017 luo et al 2015 which do not directly optimize the flood risks by contrast in our study we formulate a multi objective risk management model of a parallel reservoir system for real time flood control optimal operation during flood season considering the uncertainties related to reservoir inflows and lateral inflows the proposed model takes the objectives as minimizing the risks of both upstream flooding and downstream flooding it imbeds a probabilistic risk assessment submodel in an optimal operation submodel and determines the optimal operation schedules that simultaneously satisfy the flood control objectives and minimize overall flood risks finally we use nsga iii to optimize the multi objective model and present several applications to real time multistage recourse flood control operations the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 formulates the optimization of the multi objective risk management model section 3 presents the results and discussion of a case study as well as the potential applications of the proposed model finally we present conclusions in section 4 2 methodology the uncertainties associated with real time operation of a multi reservoir system create risks in flood control decision making we propose a multi objective risk management model for real time flood control optimal operation of a multi reservoir system the framework of the model is presented in fig 1 as fig 1 shows the management model consists of a risk optimal operation submodel a risk assessment submodel and an optimization submodel the risk optimal operation submodel develops measures of risks and establishes an operation model that considers the two competing objectives minimizing the risks of both upstream flooding and downstream flooding risk is defined as the probability that the reservoir water level or flood flow at a downstream control point at any time during a flood exceeds a selected safety level the risk assessment submodel estimates the uncertainties and calculates the risks based on a stochastic differential equation sde the final optimization submodel optimizes the proposed risks by embedding the risk assessment submodel in the risk optimal operation submodel and is solved by nsga iii in the following we explain the three submodels in detail 2 1 risk optimal operation submodel we consider a typical flood control system that consists of two parallel reservoirs and a common downstream flood control point shown in fig 2 2 1 1 analysis of uncertainties the uncertainties considered include the reservoir and lateral inflow forecast errors the stochastic errors of reservoir water levels and releases resulting from inflow forecast errors we present their mathematical descriptions below the uncertainties associated with hydrological model structure and parameter estimation lead to reservoir and lateral inflow forecast errors zhao et al 2013 the stochastic reservoir inflow is equal to the forecasted inflow plus the forecast error chen et al 2014 expressed as 1 q i t q i t ξ q i t where q i t is the stochastic inflow of reservoir i at time t q i t is the forecasted inflow of reservoir i at time t and ξ q i t is the inflow forecast error of reservoir i at time t the inflow forecast error is a function of forecast accuracy lettenmaier 1984 maurer and lettenmaier 2004 and is assumed to be normally distributed ministry of water resources mwr of china 2000 the normality assumption has been verified for both humid and semihumid regions by diao et al 2007 and diao et al 2010 the variance of inflow forecast error is derived based on its relationship with the forecast accuracy and is formulated as eq 2 for more details refer to li et al 2010 2 σ ξ q i t σ ξ q i t q i t ε ω ϕ 1 ω q i t 2 q i t where σ ξ q i t is the standard deviation of the inflow forecast errors at time t σ ξ q i t is the standard deviation of the relative errors of the forecasted inflows ω q i t represents the forecast accuracy and is defined as the qualified rate of the forecasted inflows and ε ω 0 2 and ϕ 1 ω q i t 2 is the standard normal quantile corresponding to a 1 ω q i t 2 exceedance probability similarly the stochastic lateral inflow can be expressed as 3 i t i t ξ i t where i t is the stochastic lateral inflow at time t i t is the forecasted lateral inflow at time t and ξ i t is the forecast error of lateral inflow at time t which also can be derived from the same approach in eq 2 the uncertainties of reservoir inflows lead to the randomness of the reservoir water levels and the corresponding releases jiang 1994 the stochastic reservoir water level can be considered a stochastic process expressed as 4 z i t z i t ξ z i t where ξ z i t is the stochastic error of the water level of reservoir i at time t resulting from the reservoir inflow forecast errors z i t is the stochastic reservoir water level and z i t is the mean value of the stochastic reservoir water level at time t which is determined by the operation schedules the stochastic reservoir release is expressed as 5 q i t q i t ξ q i t where ξ q i t is the stochastic error of the release of reservoir i at time t resulting from the reservoir inflow forecast errors q i t is the stochastic reservoir release and q i t is the mean value of the stochastic reservoir release at time t note that q i t and z i t are derived from i t based on reservoir flood routing and the water balance equation with detailed optimization steps shown in section 2 3 2 1 2 risk definition the uncertainties in real time operation of the multi reservoir system create risks in flood control decision making in this paper we consider the risk of upstream reservoir flooding and the risk of downstream flooding the risk of a hydraulic component is defined as the overtopping probability which is the probability that the loading l exceeds the resistance r i e the probability of failure tung and mays 1981 fema 2015 therefore the risk of upstream reservoir flooding is defined as the probability that the stochastic water level in the reservoir exceeds a selected safe level expressed as 6 p 1 i t p z i t z i r where z i r is the selected safe water level of reservoir i which can be the reservoir design flood water level the overtopping flood water level and so on the risk of downstream flooding is defined as the probability that the flood flow at the downstream control point exceeds a selected safe discharge this can be expressed as 7 p 2 t p q c t q c r where qc t is the stochastic flood flow at the downstream control point at time t and q c r is the selected safe flood flow for downstream protection the term q c r can represent the safe discharge or the levee elevation at the downstream control point 2 1 3 multi objective risk optimal operation model there are basically three safety issues to consider in risk management of flood control operations the safety of the dam the upstream area of the reservoir and the downstream city the safety of the dam and upstream area of a reservoir are mainly associated with the reservoir water level the safety of the downstream city is related to the reservoir release and the river stage at a selected downstream location generally the safety of the dam and reservoir upstream area require that the reservoir store less water and release more water however the downstream city would be safer if more water is stored in the reservoir since these objectives are competing it would be difficult to find a single solution hence we propose a multi objective risk management model the two competing objectives considered are 1 minimizing the risk of upstream flooding and 2 minimizing the risk of downstream flooding we establish the objective functions below 1 objective functions the first objective f 1 is to minimize the risk of upstream flooding of the first reservoir in other words to minimize the maximum probability that the stochastic water level in the reservoir exceeds a selected safe level during a flood event according to eq 6 this can be expressed as 8 f 1 m i n m a x t 1 t p 1 1 t m i n m a x t 1 t p z 1 t z 1 r where t is the time duration of the flood the second objective f 2 is to minimize the risk of upstream flooding of the second reservoir expressed as 9 f 2 m i n m a x t 1 t p 1 2 t m i n m a x t 1 t p z 2 t z 2 r the third objective f 3 is to minimize the risk of downstream flooding at the common flood control point of the two upstream reservoirs specifically we seek to minimize the maximum probability that the stochastic flood flow at the downstream control point exceeds a selected safe discharge during the entire flood event according to eq 7 this can be expressed as 10 f 3 m i n m a x t 1 t p 2 t m i n m a x t 1 t p q c t q c r 2 constraints ① water balance equation of reservoirs 11 v i t v i t 1 q i t q i t 1 2 q i t q i t 1 2 δ t where v i t is the storage of reservoir i at time t and δ t is the time interval note that evaporation and seepage losses are not considered during flood season li et al 2010 huang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 ② reservoir water level limits 12 z i m 1 z i t z i m 2 where z i m 1 and z i m 2 are the lower and upper bounds of the water level of reservoir i respectively note that z i m 2 is usually set at the design flood water level or overtopping flood water level to ensure the reservoir safety ③ reservoir discharge limits 13 q i m 1 q i t min q i m 2 q i m a x t where q i m 1 is the minimum release of reservoir i for the downstream instream requirement q i m 2 is the maximum release of reservoir i for downstream safety and q i m a x t is the reservoir release capacity which is a function of z i t ④ final time target water level 14 z i t z i e ε i where z i e is the target water level of reservoir i at time t and ε i is a small tolerance value ⑤ reservoir release variation constraint 15 q i t q i t 1 δ q i m m where δ q i m m is the acceptable maximum variation of the release of reservoir i across two consecutive time periods ⑥ river flood routing constraint 16 q i t c 0 i q i t c 1 i q i t 1 c 2 i q i t 1 i 1 2 where q i t is the stochastic response flow of the release of reservoir i at the downstream control point and c 0 i c 1 i and c 2 i are the river flood routing parameters of the muskingum method ⑦ water balance equation of downstream flood control point 17 qc t i 1 2 q i t i t where qc t is the stochastic flood flow at the downstream control point note that the river flood routing of reservoir outflows and lateral inflows are calculated separately and then their results are combined chen et al 2015 the forecasted later inflows are applied to the downstream control point 2 2 risk assessment submodel 1 calculation formula for the risk of reservoir overtopping we use the stochastic differential equation method to derive the calculation formula for the risk of upstream flooding chen et al 2014 the main idea is to calculate the risk by integrating the probability distribution function of the stochastic reservoir water level error the steps are as follows 1 establish the stochastic differential equation of reservoir flood routing expressed as 18 d v i t dt q i t q i t 2 the stochastic reservoir release and storage at time t are respectively fitted piecewise linear functions of z i t at time t chen et al 2014 expressed as 19 q i t μ i t z i t ν i t v i t α i t z t β i t where μ i t ν i t α i t and β i t are the fitting parameters substituting eqs 1 4 and 19 into eq 18 yields the calculation formulas for the stochastic reservoir water level error expressed as 20 ξ z i t 1 a i t ξ z i t b i t c i t δ t ξ q i t ξ q i t 1 where a i t 2 α i t μ i t δ t 2 α i t 1 μ i t 1 δ t c i t 1 2 α i t 1 μ i t 1 δ t and b i t 2 α i t μ i t δ t 2 α i t 1 μ i t 1 δ t z i t z i t 1 δ t 2 α i t 1 μ i t 1 δ t q i t q i

error 21 e ξ z i t 1 a i t e ξ z i t b i t c i t δ t e ξ q i t c i t δ t e ξ q i t 1 4 the variance of the stochastic reservoir water level error is expressed as 22 var ξ z i t 1 e ξ z i t 1 e ξ z i t 1 2 we substitute eqs 20 and 21 into eq 22 and calculate the formula of var ξ z i t 1 expressed as 23 var ξ z i t 1 e ξ z i t 1 e ξ z i t 1 2 a i 2 t var ξ z i t c i 2 t δ 2 t var ξ q i t c i 2 t δ 2 t var ξ q i t 1 2 c i 2 t δ 2 t c o v ξ q i t ξ q i t 1 where c o v ξ q i t ξ q i t 1 is the covariance of ξ q i t and ξ q i t 1 and c o v ξ q i t ξ q i t 1 ρ ξ q i t ξ q i t 1 var ξ q i t var ξ q i t 1 and ρ ξ q i t ξ q i t 1 is the correlation coefficient of the inflow forecast errors ξ q i t and ξ q i t 1 at two consecutive time periods 5 we assume that the reservoir water level error at any given time is normally distributed chen et al 2014 and use eq 4 eq 21 and eq 23 to calculate the risk of upstream flooding expressed as 24 p 1 i t p z i t z i r i 1 2 p z i t ξ z i t z i r p ξ z i t z

downstream flooding is calculated by integrating the probability distribution function of the stochastic flood flow at the downstream control point the steps for deriving the calculation formula 1 we take the expectation and variance of eq 19 to obtain the expected value and variance of the reservoir release 25 q i t μ i t z i t ν i t var q i t μ i t 2 var z i t where q i t and var q i t are the expected value and variance of the stochastic reservoir release respectively 2 we take the expectation and variance of eq 16 to obtain the expected value and variance of the stochastic response flow

of the stochastic response flow of the reservoir release at the downstream control point respectively note that the correlation between the reservoir releases is not considered in the equation 3 we take the expectation and variance of eq 17 to obtain the expected value and variance of the stochastic flood flow at the downstream control point 27 e q c t i 1 2 c 0 i q i t c 1 i q i t 1 c 2 i q i t

flow at the downstream control point respectively and var i t is the variance of the stochastic lateral inflows 4 we assume that the stochastic flood flow is normally distributed at any given time chen et al 2015 and use eq 7 and eq 27 to calculate the risk of downstream flooding expressed as 28 p 2 t p q c t q c r q c r f q c t d q c t q c r 1 2 π var q c t exp q c t e q c t 2 2 var q c t d q c t 2 3 optimization based on nsga iii the multi objective risk management model embeds the probabilistic risk assessment submodel of section 2 2 into the risk optimal operation submodel of section 2 1 the model is solved using non dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii deb and jain 2014 jain and deb 2014 the flow chart for the optimization of the proposed multi objective risk management model is presented in fig 3 according to fig 3 the step by step procedure for the optimization is as follows 1 an initial parent population p j j 0 is created with population size m the decision variables in the multi objective risk management model are the releases at each time period of the reservoirs during the entire flood event to minimize undesirable fluctuations of reservoir releases we code half the decision variables u d i i e the reservoir releases at the odd time periods and then randomly initialize them during optimization the rest of the decision variables e d i i e the reservoir releases at the even time periods are obtained by interpolation from u d i finally we conduct the moving average filter for all decision variables to get the final decision sequence d i the detailed calculation formulas are 29 d i t r a n d o m d i m 1 d i m 2 t 1 3 5 t u d i d i t t 1 3 5 t where u d i is the set of decision variables at the odd time periods and d i t is randomly initialized between d i m 1 and d i m 2 30 d i t d i t 1 d i t 1 2 t 2 4 t 1 e d i d i t t 2 4 t 1 where e d i is the set of decision variables at the even time periods 31 d i t d i t t 1 t d i t d i t 1 d i t d i t 1 3 t 2 t 1 d i t d i t 2 d i t 1 d i t d i t 1 d i t 2 5 t 3 4 5 t 2 where d i t t 1 2 t is the set of all final decision variables 2 for the j th generation the fitness value of the parent population p j is calculated and the offspring population s j of size m is created from p j by binary tournament selection recombination and mutation operators 3 a population ps j of size 2 m is formed by combining the parent population p j and the offspring population s j then the new population p j 1 of size m is chosen according to the selection operator with a set of reference points to find the near pareto optimal solutions corresponding to the supplied reference points 4 set j j 1 if j n n is the maximum number of evolution generations then the calculation is completed otherwise return to step 2 for constraint handling we use the ranking method proposed by deb et al 2002 any feasible solution has a better non domination rank than any infeasible solution and between two infeasible solutions the solution with a smaller constraint violation has a better rank we use the hypervolume hv index to evaluate the performance of the multi objective optimization the index provides a metric for the integrated evaluation of the convergence and diversity of the pareto front for the non dominated solution set s the hypervolome of s is defined as the volume of the hypercube enclosed by the individuals in s and the reference points in the target space zitzler and thiele 1999 expressed as 32 hv s l e b x s f 1 x r 1 f 2 x r 2 f r x r r where l e b is the lebesgue measure of the non dominated solution set s and f 1 x r 1 f 2 x r 2 f r x r r refers to the hypercube enclosed by the individuals in x and the reference points in the target space based on the definition of hypervolome the hv index in optimization by nsga iii is expressed as 33 hv j 1 m hv v o l u m e j where m hv is the number of the obtained non dominated solutions and volum e j is the hypervolume of the objective space enclosed by the j th non dominated solution and the reference points we note that the higher the hv index the better the quality of the obtained non dominated solutions 3 case study 3 1 data and parameters for the proposed model we perform a case study in the middle reaches of huaihe river basin which is located in the north and south climate transition zones of eastern china its north area has a warm temperate climate and its south area features a continental climate we focus on the flood control system that consists of nianyushan reservoir meishan reservoir and the jiangjiaji flood control point as shown in fig 4 table 1 shows the main characteristics of the two reservoirs in the case study we use a forecasted flood with a lead time of 99 h that was provided by the inflow forecast model of the reservoirs as shown in fig 5 d the time step δ t used in the analysis is three hours and the total number of time periods t is 33 according to eq 2 the standard deviation σ ξ q i t of the relative errors of the stochastic inflows is 0 12 with the qualified rate of 90 according to eqs 1 and 3 we simulate the stochastic reservoir inflows and lateral inflows with the results shown in the box plots on fig 5 a 5 b and 5 c according to the constraints outlined in section 2 1 the parameter values for real time operation of the reservoirs are set as shown in table 2 the selected safe flood flow at the jiangjiaji flood control point is 3 580 m3 s the values of z i 0 are set at the actual initial water levels of the two reservoirs and z i e are used as the terminal reservoir water levels the values of z i m 1 are set at the reservoir flood limited water levels and z i m 2 are obtained as the reservoir design flood water levels the values of q i m 1 and q i m 2 are obtained according to the downstream ecological and flood control requirements the terms c 0 i c 1 i c 2 i are the river flood routing parameters of the muskingum method the values of z i r are applied as the selected safe reservoir water levels note that z i r can be increased dynamically during the flood season rather than directly set at the overtopping flood water level in order to ensure the gradual usage of the reservoir storage and prepare for the upcoming floods the crossover probability and the distribution index of the simulated binary crossover in nsga iii are 1 and 20 respectively the expectation number of bits for mutation and the distribution index of the polynomial mutation are 1 and 20 respectively we set four experiments for comparison table 3 shows the other relevant parameter values used in the nsga iii and in the numerical experiments as table 3 shows we set different population sizes and function evaluations in experiment 1 to assess their impacts on the performance of the multi objective risk management model we analyze the results of the reservoir releases water levels and the three objectives in experiment 2 we evaluate the impacts of the uncertainty level and the correlation coefficient of the inflow forecast errors on the results in experiments 3 and 4 we provide detailed results and discussion of the four experiments below 3 2 results and discussion 1 experiment 1 selection of population size and evolution generations with the data and parameter values in section 3 1 we carry out the calculation for the multi objective risk management model according to the steps outlined in fig 3 the model was run five times independently to evaluate the performance of the algorithm fig 6 shows the average hv index of different population sizes and function evaluations as fig 6 shows the hv increases with the population size and evolution generation and it remains stable after 100 generations the multi objective risk management model was written in matlab and executed on a laptop with intel r i7 5 600u cpu 2 60 ghz four cores 8 0 gb ram the calculation time for the experiment of 100 population size and 10 000 function evaluations is about 348 s it is about 632 s for 100 population size and 20 000 function evaluations 721 s for 200 population size and 20 000 function evaluations and 1421 s for 200 population size and 40 000 function evaluations we use the results of 200 population size and 40 000 function evaluations for detailed discussion in the following sections 2 experiment 2 trade off between the objectives in experiment 2 we analyze the trade off among the three objectives fig 7 a and 7 b show the three dimensional scatterplot and histogram of the three objectives f 1 f 2 and f 3 fig 8 shows the plane projections of the three dimensional trade off of the three objectives shown in fig 7 as evident in figs 7 and 8 the pareto front shows the tradeoff among the three competing objectives the risk of downstream flooding can be reduced only at the expense of increasing the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs and vice versa as presented in fig 8 a in general under the condition of the fixed risk f 3 of downstream flooding at the jiangjiaji control point the risk f 1 of nianyushan reservoir can be reduced only at the expense of increasing the risk f 2 of meishan reservoir flooding as shown in fig 8 b with the fixed risk f 1 of nianyushan reservoir the risk f 2 of meishan reservoir flooding increases while the risk f 3 of downstream flooding at the jiangjiaji control point decreases and with the fixed risk f 2 of meishan reservoir the risk f 1 of nianyushan reservoir flooding decreases while the risk f 3 of downstream flooding at the jiangjiaji control point increases as shown in fig 8 c as shown in fig 7 a there are 200 solutions and it is difficult to rank them by a single criterion as we have three objectives in general the multi criteria decision making methods can be adopted to rank the solutions or define the optimal operation schedule according to the preference of the decision makers for the purpose of discussion we select five representative points on the pareto fronts a b c d e on fig 7 1 solution 1 point a on fig 7 a represents the operation schedule with large risks in the two upstream reservoirs nianyushan and meishan and lower downstream risk 2 solution 2 point b on fig 7 a represents the operation schedule with large risks in the downstream control point and lower risks in upstream reservoirs 3 solution 3 point c on fig 7 a refers to the operation schedule with large risk in the nianyushan reservoir 4 solution 4 point d on fig 7 a refers to the operation schedule with large risk in the meishan reservoir and 5 solution 5 point e on fig 7 a is the operation schedule with balanced risks in the upstream reservoirs and downstream control point with this information the decision makers can select the operation schedule according to their risk preference from the five representative solutions or the other solutions on the tradeoff curve figs 9 and 10 show the reservoir water levels and releases of the five solutions for the nianyushan and meishan reservoirs respectively note that q refers to the reservoir release and z represents the reservoir water level fig 11 shows the flood flows of the jiangjiaji flood control point for the five solutions we present the characteristic values for five representative solutions in table 4 including the multi objective values f 1 f 2 and f 3 maximum reservoir water levels max z 1 t and max z 2 t and maximum flood flow at the downstream control point max qc t as solution 1 point a on fig 7 a shows the risks of upstream flooding of the nianyushan and meishan reservoirs are both 100 this implies that the probability that the stochastic water level of the nianyushan reservoir exceeds the selected safe water level of 108 60 m is 100 due to the uncertainty factors it is also 100 for the meishan reservoir when the selected safe water level is 134 80 m the risk of downstream flooding at the jiangjiaji control point is 1 2 which implies that the probability that the stochastic flood flow exceeds the selected safe flood flow of 3 580 m3 s is 1 2 as solution 2 point b on fig 7 a shows the risk of downstream flooding is 91 3 while the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs are both 0 0 solution 5 point e on fig 7 a shows the risks of upstream flooding of the nianyushan and meishan reservoirs and the risk of downstream flooding at the jiangjiaji control point are approximately balanced at 40 8 36 9 and 44 1 respectively by comparing solutions 3 and 1 under the condition of a fixed risk at the nianyushan reservoir the risk of the meishan reservoir increases from 0 8 to 100 while the risk of the jiangjiaji control point decreases from 35 7 to 1 2 this is because the maximum water level of the meishan reservoir increases by 1 12 m while the maximum flood flow of jiangjiaji decreases by 447 m3 s therefore solution 2 minimizes the risk of downstream flooding at the expense of increasing the maximum reservoir water level and risk of upstream flooding of the meishan reservoir by comparing solutions 4 and 1 under the condition of a fixed risk at the meishan reservoir the risk of the nianyushan reservoir decreases from 100 to 1 3 while the risk of the jiangjiaji control point increases from 1 2 to 37 2 the maximum water level of the nianyushan reservoir decreases by 0 86 m while the maximum flood flow of jiangjiaji increases by 451 m3 s therefore solution 4 minimizes the maximum water level and the risk of upstream flooding of the nianyushan reservoir at the expense of increasing the risk of downstream flooding 3 experiment 3 evaluating the impact of the inflow forecast accuracy in order to evaluate the influence of the inflow forecast accuracy on the trade off of the three objectives we set the standard deviation of the relative errors of the forecasted flood peak discharge at 0 12 0 16 and 0 2 for a comparative analysis for each standard deviation we follow the steps in fig 3 to produce the pareto front fig 12 shows the plane projections of the three dimensional trade off of the three objectives with different inflow forecast accuracy as fig 12 shows in general the plane projections of the three dimensional trade off move to the lower left corner while the standard deviation σ of the relative errors of the forecasted inflows decreases as a result the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs as well as the risk of downstream flooding both decrease while the standard deviation of the relative errors of the forecasted inflows decreases therefore in order to reduce the risks of upstream flooding and downstream flooding at the same time it is necessary to reduce the uncertainty degree of the uncertainty factors such as improving the accuracy of reservoir inflow forecasting 4 experiment 4 evaluating the impact of the inflow forecast error correlations in order to evaluate the influence of the inflow forecast error correlations on the trade off of the three objectives we set the correlation coefficients of the inflow forecast errors at 0 0 25 and 0 50 for comparative analysis for each standard deviation we follow the steps outlined in fig 3 to produce the pareto front fig 13 shows the plane projections of the three dimensional trade off of the proposed objectives with different inflow forecast error correlations as fig 13 shows in general the plane projections of the three dimensional trade off move to the lower left corner while the correlation coefficient ρ of the inflow forecast errors decreases as a result the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs as well as the risk of downstream flooding both decrease while the correlation coefficient of the inflow forecast errors decreases this is because the variance of the stochastic reservoir water level errors increases with the correlation coefficient ρ of the inflow forecast errors as shown in eq 23 therefore the stochastic reservoir water levels fluctuate around the mean value in a wider range which creates larger risks 3 3 applications and limitations of the proposed model 3 3 1 applications real time flood control operation and decision making is a multistage process the decision makers can change their risk preference at different time periods during the flood for example 1 at the onset of the flood pre release from the reservoir can be used to ensure that adequate flood control storage is available for the impending flood if this is preferred decision makers can choose the optimal operation schedule of solution 2 as the lower the reservoir water level the lower the risk of upstream flooding 2 during the flood peak period decision makers can choose the optimal operation schedule with a compromise solution such as solution 5 that balances the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs with the risk of downstream flooding at the jiangjiaji control point 3 in the later period of the flood more water can be stored for future utilization consequently decision makers can choose the optimal operation schedule of solution 1 as the relatively larger risk of upstream flooding is acceptable in this period if the forecast information shows the nianyushan reservoir still has a large amount of subsequent precipitation decision makers can select solution 4 in order to reserve sufficient reservoir storage to store future inflows note that real time flood control operation and decision making is a recourse process as time proceeds the forecast information of inflow and precipitation in the river basin is updated dynamically in real time therefore we update the safe water levels for the reservoirs based on the updated precipitation forecasts expressed as 34 z i r t g v z i p r e c i p i t a t i o n i t f i where z i is the design flood water level or the overtopping flood water level of the reservoir v z i is the corresponding reservoir storage to z i which can be derived from the reservoir storage capacity curve precipitatio n i t is the forecasted subsequent precipitation of reservoir i g refers to the reservoir storage capacity curve and f i is the drainage area of reservoir i then the multi objective risk management model can be re optimized with the updated information as shown in the outlined steps of fig 14 the optimization results can provide decision makers with comprehensive operation schedules for the purpose of making flood control operation plans in real time flood control operations 3 3 2 limitations there is room for future research on the proposed multi objective risk management model for multi reservoir flood control systems in this study we analyzed the uncertainties of inflows with normally distributed errors in future research other probability distribution functions of the forecast errors can be considered for comparative study if sufficient historical and forecasted flood data are available the distribution parameters of the forecast errors can be obtained through a standard statistical analysis or forecast ensembles yan et al 2014 nayak et al 2018 in addition in this study we considered the uncertainties of forecasted reservoir inflows and lateral inflows more uncertainties can be taken into consideration in future research of the multi objective risk management model further research also can be conducted on how to combine the multi criteria decision making methods with the proposed model to rank the optimization solutions in order to assist in decision making 4 conclusions many uncertainties are associated with real time reservoir flood control operation which create risks in flood control decisions in this paper we undertook research on risk management for the real time flood control operation of a parallel reservoir system the main works are summarized as follows 1 we developed a multi objective risk management model for real time flood control optimal operation for a parallel reservoir system during flood season considering the uncertainties of reservoir inflows and lateral inflows the key improvements of the proposed model include 1 treating the objectives as minimizing the risks of both upstream flooding and downstream flooding hence flood risks are directly optimized 2 imbedding a probabilistic risk assessment submodel in an optimal operation submodel to determine the optimal operation schedules that simultaneously satisfy the flood control objectives and minimize overall flood risks thereby combining multi objective optimal flood control operations and risk management 3 coupling nsga iii with a smooth filter in the multi objective optimization submodel to produce smooth reservoir release policies 2 we applied the proposed model to a parallel reservoir system located in the middle reaches of the huaihe river basin in china the results show 1 the model solutions provide decision makers with a number of comprehensive operation schedules that satisfy the given flood control objectives and simultaneously minimize the risks of upstream flooding of the reservoirs as well as the risk of downstream flooding 2 the pareto front of the three objectives demonstrates the tradeoff among them e g the risk of downstream flooding can be reduced only at the expense of increasing the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs and vice versa therefore decision makers can choose the operation schedule according to their risk preference and updated hydrological information to conduct flood control management and plans 3 we conducted several comparative analyses to evaluate the influence of inflow forecast accuracy and forecast error correlations on the proposed model the results show that 1 the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs as well as the risk of downstream flooding both increase while the inflow forecast accuracy decreases 2 the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs as well as the risk of downstream flooding both decrease while the correlation coefficient of the inflow forecast errors decreases therefore it is necessary to reduce the uncertainty degree of the uncertainty factors such as improving the accuracy of reservoir inflow forecasting in order to reduce

5167,many uncertainties are associated with real time reservoir flood control operation and introduce risks for decision making a multi objective risk management model is proposed to optimize the real time flood control operation of a parallel reservoir system during flood season the model considers the combined impact of reservoir inflow and lateral inflow uncertainties and flood control operation risks it consists of three key components a risk optimal operation submodel a risk assessment submodel and an optimization submodel the risk optimal operation submodel takes into account the uncertainties and establishes an operation model that considers two competing objectives of minimizing the risk of upstream flooding and minimizing the risk of downstream flooding the risk assessment submodel calculates the risks based on a stochastic differential equation sde the final optimization submodel embeds the risk assessment model in the risk optimal operation model and is solved by the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii the proposed methodology is applied to a real flood control system in the middle reaches of the huaihe river basin in china the results show that the developed multi objective risk management model can provide operation schedules that satisfy flood control objectives and simultaneously minimize the overall risks the pareto front of the proposed objectives demonstrates the tradeoff among the competing objectives the model can be used as a decision making tool for conducting risk management for real time reservoir flood control operation during flood season the decision makers can choose the operation schedule according to their risk preference and updated hydrological information keywords reservoirs real time flood control operation uncertainty analysis risk assessment multi objective optimization nsga iii 1 introduction generally a multi reservoir flood control system has to account for not only the safety of the dam and the upstream area of the reservoirs but also the safety of the downstream cities the flood control objectives of the upstream and downstream areas of a reservoir usually are influenced by each other and even can be in conflict with each other che and mays 2015 qin et al 2010 jia et al 2016 therefore it may not be possible to find a single optimal operation schedule that simultaneously optimizes all the flood control objectives the problem must be formulated as a multi objective optimization problem in the past many researchers have used mathematical programming algorithms such as linear programing nonlinear programming and dynamic programming with techniques that rely on prior articulation of preferences or techniques that foster iterative definition of preference to solve multi objective optimization problems for reservoir management and operation cohon and marks 1975 the weighting method and the constraint method commonly are used in the weighting method weights are introduced to combine the objectives to form a composite scalar objective function kim and de weck 2005 marler and arora 2010 in principle weights can be varied systematically to trace out the tradeoff curves pareto fronts if the fronts are convex the constraint method chooses one of the objectives as a scalar objective to be optimized and adds the other objectives to the constraint set liang et al 1996 wang et al 2005 yeh and becker 1982 parametric variation of the objectives that are in the constraint set from the lower bound to the upper bound traces out the pareto fronts if the fronts are convex this requires determining the lower and upper bounds of each objective in the constraint set and solving a series of scalar optimization problems however the weighting method and constraint method often fail to find the true pareto fronts when the objective function is nonlinear and non convex deb 2001 reddy and kumar 2007 in recent years multi objective evolutionary algorithms have been utilized to solve multi objective optimization problems in many fields such as water resources planning reservoir operations and hydropower generation reed et al 2013 kollat and reed 2006 chen et al 2007 multi objective evolutionary algorithms are biologically inspired algorithms that are capable of generating an approximation of the pareto front in a single run luo et al 2015 established a multi objective model for reservoir flood control operation and optimized the model with an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm chen et al 2017 proposed a multi objective model for reservoir flood control operation that was optimized by an improved non dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii qi et al 2016 also proposed a self adaptive multi objective evolutionary algorithm for reservoir flood control operation however most of the above mentioned studies focused on a single reservoir and did not consider the uncertainties associated with real time flood control operations the uncertainties stem from observations of precipitation and water level parameter estimation of hydrological models structure of hydrologic models for assessing the true physical mechanisms of the hydrologic process and environmental change over time rosenberg and madani 2014 melching 1992 lund 2002 zhou et al 2016 these uncertainties create great risks for flood control operations influence flood control decisions and affect flood control project benefits hsu et al 2010 wu et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 therefore the problem of real time reservoir flood control operation must be formulated as a multi objective optimization problem that considers uncertainties wang et al 2012 proposed an ensemble hydrological prediction based method that combines ensemble hydrological predictions with multi objective reservoir optimization during the flood season considering streamflow uncertainties however the method is used for a single reservoir and the objective functions proposed are minimizing the maximum reservoir water level minimizing the maximum downstream flood peak and minimizing the difference between the calculated terminal water level and the targeted water level additionally the method does not directly minimize the risks the results provide an ensemble of possible reservoir water levels and releases but not an operation schedule that minimizes the risks huang et al 2018 proposed a risk analysis method using stochastic simulation to evaluate the risk of reservoir flood control operation schedules derived from operation rules considering uncertainties related to flood hydrograph storage water level and outflow discharge diao et al 2010 established an integrated risk analysis model for reservoirs based on monte carlo simulation and flood control operation rules considering the hydrological hydraulic stage storage and time delay uncertainties however the above mentioned risk analysis methods only can be used to assess the risks for given operation schedules and are not suitable for deriving the optimal operation schedules that minimize the flood risks wang et al 2011 developed a chance constrained method for risk analysis and reservoir operation which carries out optimization by adding the risks or uncertainties with probabilities to the constraint set however the constraint method often fails to find the true pareto fronts when the objective function is nonlinear and non convex literature review indicates that there exists a large amount of research dealing with multi objective flood control operations and risk management of reservoirs wang 1996 chen et al 2016 however literature on the combination of multi objective optimal flood control operations and risk management is sparse especially in terms of minimizing the overall risks caused by the uncertainties moreover the objectives considered in previous studies usually include minimizing the highest reservoir water level and minimizing the largest reservoir discharge wang et al 2012 qi et al 2016 chen et al 2017 luo et al 2015 which do not directly optimize the flood risks by contrast in our study we formulate a multi objective risk management model of a parallel reservoir system for real time flood control optimal operation during flood season considering the uncertainties related to reservoir inflows and lateral inflows the proposed model takes the objectives as minimizing the risks of both upstream flooding and downstream flooding it imbeds a probabilistic risk assessment submodel in an optimal operation submodel and determines the optimal operation schedules that simultaneously satisfy the flood control objectives and minimize overall flood risks finally we use nsga iii to optimize the multi objective model and present several applications to real time multistage recourse flood control operations the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 formulates the optimization of the multi objective risk management model section 3 presents the results and discussion of a case study as well as the potential applications of the proposed model finally we present conclusions in section 4 2 methodology the uncertainties associated with real time operation of a multi reservoir system create risks in flood control decision making we propose a multi objective risk management model for real time flood control optimal operation of a multi reservoir system the framework of the model is presented in fig 1 as fig 1 shows the management model consists of a risk optimal operation submodel a risk assessment submodel and an optimization submodel the risk optimal operation submodel develops measures of risks and establishes an operation model that considers the two competing objectives minimizing the risks of both upstream flooding and downstream flooding risk is defined as the probability that the reservoir water level or flood flow at a downstream control point at any time during a flood exceeds a selected safety level the risk assessment submodel estimates the uncertainties and calculates the risks based on a stochastic differential equation sde the final optimization submodel optimizes the proposed risks by embedding the risk assessment submodel in the risk optimal operation submodel and is solved by nsga iii in the following we explain the three submodels in detail 2 1 risk optimal operation submodel we consider a typical flood control system that consists of two parallel reservoirs and a common downstream flood control point shown in fig 2 2 1 1 analysis of uncertainties the uncertainties considered include the reservoir and lateral inflow forecast errors the stochastic errors of reservoir water levels and releases resulting from inflow forecast errors we present their mathematical descriptions below the uncertainties associated with hydrological model structure and parameter estimation lead to reservoir and lateral inflow forecast errors zhao et al 2013 the stochastic reservoir inflow is equal to the forecasted inflow plus the forecast error chen et al 2014 expressed as 1 q i t q i t ξ q i t where q i t is the stochastic inflow of reservoir i at time t q i t is the forecasted inflow of reservoir i at time t and ξ q i t is the inflow forecast error of reservoir i at time t the inflow forecast error is a function of forecast accuracy lettenmaier 1984 maurer and lettenmaier 2004 and is assumed to be normally distributed ministry of water resources mwr of china 2000 the normality assumption has been verified for both humid and semihumid regions by diao et al 2007 and diao et al 2010 the variance of inflow forecast error is derived based on its relationship with the forecast accuracy and is formulated as eq 2 for more details refer to li et al 2010 2 σ ξ q i t σ ξ q i t q i t ε ω ϕ 1 ω q i t 2 q i t where σ ξ q i t is the standard deviation of the inflow forecast errors at time t σ ξ q i t is the standard deviation of the relative errors of the forecasted inflows ω q i t represents the forecast accuracy and is defined as the qualified rate of the forecasted inflows and ε ω 0 2 and ϕ 1 ω q i t 2 is the standard normal quantile corresponding to a 1 ω q i t 2 exceedance probability similarly the stochastic lateral inflow can be expressed as 3 i t i t ξ i t where i t is the stochastic lateral inflow at time t i t is the forecasted lateral inflow at time t and ξ i t is the forecast error of lateral inflow at time t which also can be derived from the same approach in eq 2 the uncertainties of reservoir inflows lead to the randomness of the reservoir water levels and the corresponding releases jiang 1994 the stochastic reservoir water level can be considered a stochastic process expressed as 4 z i t z i t ξ z i t where ξ z i t is the stochastic error of the water level of reservoir i at time t resulting from the reservoir inflow forecast errors z i t is the stochastic reservoir water level and z i t is the mean value of the stochastic reservoir water level at time t which is determined by the operation schedules the stochastic reservoir release is expressed as 5 q i t q i t ξ q i t where ξ q i t is the stochastic error of the release of reservoir i at time t resulting from the reservoir inflow forecast errors q i t is the stochastic reservoir release and q i t is the mean value of the stochastic reservoir release at time t note that q i t and z i t are derived from i t based on reservoir flood routing and the water balance equation with detailed optimization steps shown in section 2 3 2 1 2 risk definition the uncertainties in real time operation of the multi reservoir system create risks in flood control decision making in this paper we consider the risk of upstream reservoir flooding and the risk of downstream flooding the risk of a hydraulic component is defined as the overtopping probability which is the probability that the loading l exceeds the resistance r i e the probability of failure tung and mays 1981 fema 2015 therefore the risk of upstream reservoir flooding is defined as the probability that the stochastic water level in the reservoir exceeds a selected safe level expressed as 6 p 1 i t p z i t z i r where z i r is the selected safe water level of reservoir i which can be the reservoir design flood water level the overtopping flood water level and so on the risk of downstream flooding is defined as the probability that the flood flow at the downstream control point exceeds a selected safe discharge this can be expressed as 7 p 2 t p q c t q c r where qc t is the stochastic flood flow at the downstream control point at time t and q c r is the selected safe flood flow for downstream protection the term q c r can represent the safe discharge or the levee elevation at the downstream control point 2 1 3 multi objective risk optimal operation model there are basically three safety issues to consider in risk management of flood control operations the safety of the dam the upstream area of the reservoir and the downstream city the safety of the dam and upstream area of a reservoir are mainly associated with the reservoir water level the safety of the downstream city is related to the reservoir release and the river stage at a selected downstream location generally the safety of the dam and reservoir upstream area require that the reservoir store less water and release more water however the downstream city would be safer if more water is stored in the reservoir since these objectives are competing it would be difficult to find a single solution hence we propose a multi objective risk management model the two competing objectives considered are 1 minimizing the risk of upstream flooding and 2 minimizing the risk of downstream flooding we establish the objective functions below 1 objective functions the first objective f 1 is to minimize the risk of upstream flooding of the first reservoir in other words to minimize the maximum probability that the stochastic water level in the reservoir exceeds a selected safe level during a flood event according to eq 6 this can be expressed as 8 f 1 m i n m a x t 1 t p 1 1 t m i n m a x t 1 t p z 1 t z 1 r where t is the time duration of the flood the second objective f 2 is to minimize the risk of upstream flooding of the second reservoir expressed as 9 f 2 m i n m a x t 1 t p 1 2 t m i n m a x t 1 t p z 2 t z 2 r the third objective f 3 is to minimize the risk of downstream flooding at the common flood control point of the two upstream reservoirs specifically we seek to minimize the maximum probability that the stochastic flood flow at the downstream control point exceeds a selected safe discharge during the entire flood event according to eq 7 this can be expressed as 10 f 3 m i n m a x t 1 t p 2 t m i n m a x t 1 t p q c t q c r 2 constraints ① water balance equation of reservoirs 11 v i t v i t 1 q i t q i t 1 2 q i t q i t 1 2 δ t where v i t is the storage of reservoir i at time t and δ t is the time interval note that evaporation and seepage losses are not considered during flood season li et al 2010 huang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 ② reservoir water level limits 12 z i m 1 z i t z i m 2 where z i m 1 and z i m 2 are the lower and upper bounds of the water level of reservoir i respectively note that z i m 2 is usually set at the design flood water level or overtopping flood water level to ensure the reservoir safety ③ reservoir discharge limits 13 q i m 1 q i t min q i m 2 q i m a x t where q i m 1 is the minimum release of reservoir i for the downstream instream requirement q i m 2 is the maximum release of reservoir i for downstream safety and q i m a x t is the reservoir release capacity which is a function of z i t ④ final time target water level 14 z i t z i e ε i where z i e is the target water level of reservoir i at time t and ε i is a small tolerance value ⑤ reservoir release variation constraint 15 q i t q i t 1 δ q i m m where δ q i m m is the acceptable maximum variation of the release of reservoir i across two consecutive time periods ⑥ river flood routing constraint 16 q i t c 0 i q i t c 1 i q i t 1 c 2 i q i t 1 i 1 2 where q i t is the stochastic response flow of the release of reservoir i at the downstream control point and c 0 i c 1 i and c 2 i are the river flood routing parameters of the muskingum method ⑦ water balance equation of downstream flood control point 17 qc t i 1 2 q i t i t where qc t is the stochastic flood flow at the downstream control point note that the river flood routing of reservoir outflows and lateral inflows are calculated separately and then their results are combined chen et al 2015 the forecasted later inflows are applied to the downstream control point 2 2 risk assessment submodel 1 calculation formula for the risk of reservoir overtopping we use the stochastic differential equation method to derive the calculation formula for the risk of upstream flooding chen et al 2014 the main idea is to calculate the risk by integrating the probability distribution function of the stochastic reservoir water level error the steps are as follows 1 establish the stochastic differential equation of reservoir flood routing expressed as 18 d v i t dt q i t q i t 2 the stochastic reservoir release and storage at time t are respectively fitted piecewise linear functions of z i t at time t chen et al 2014 expressed as 19 q i t μ i t z i t ν i t v i t α i t z t β i t where μ i t ν i t α i t and β i t are the fitting parameters substituting eqs 1 4 and 19 into eq 18 yields the calculation formulas for the stochastic reservoir water level error expressed as 20 ξ z i t 1 a i t ξ z i t b i t c i t δ t ξ q i t ξ q i t 1 where a i t 2 α i t μ i t δ t 2 α i t 1 μ i t 1 δ t c i t 1 2 α i t 1 μ i t 1 δ t and b i t 2 α i t μ i t δ t 2 α i t 1 μ i t 1 δ t z i t z i t 1 δ t 2 α i t 1 μ i t 1 δ t q i t q i

error 21 e ξ z i t 1 a i t e ξ z i t b i t c i t δ t e ξ q i t c i t δ t e ξ q i t 1 4 the variance of the stochastic reservoir water level error is expressed as 22 var ξ z i t 1 e ξ z i t 1 e ξ z i t 1 2 we substitute eqs 20 and 21 into eq 22 and calculate the formula of var ξ z i t 1 expressed as 23 var ξ z i t 1 e ξ z i t 1 e ξ z i t 1 2 a i 2 t var ξ z i t c i 2 t δ 2 t var ξ q i t c i 2 t δ 2 t var ξ q i t 1 2 c i 2 t δ 2 t c o v ξ q i t ξ q i t 1 where c o v ξ q i t ξ q i t 1 is the covariance of ξ q i t and ξ q i t 1 and c o v ξ q i t ξ q i t 1 ρ ξ q i t ξ q i t 1 var ξ q i t var ξ q i t 1 and ρ ξ q i t ξ q i t 1 is the correlation coefficient of the inflow forecast errors ξ q i t and ξ q i t 1 at two consecutive time periods 5 we assume that the reservoir water level error at any given time is normally distributed chen et al 2014 and use eq 4 eq 21 and eq 23 to calculate the risk of upstream flooding expressed as 24 p 1 i t p z i t z i r i 1 2 p z i t ξ z i t z i r p ξ z i t z

downstream flooding is calculated by integrating the probability distribution function of the stochastic flood flow at the downstream control point the steps for deriving the calculation formula 1 we take the expectation and variance of eq 19 to obtain the expected value and variance of the reservoir release 25 q i t μ i t z i t ν i t var q i t μ i t 2 var z i t where q i t and var q i t are the expected value and variance of the stochastic reservoir release respectively 2 we take the expectation and variance of eq 16 to obtain the expected value and variance of the stochastic response flow

of the stochastic response flow of the reservoir release at the downstream control point respectively note that the correlation between the reservoir releases is not considered in the equation 3 we take the expectation and variance of eq 17 to obtain the expected value and variance of the stochastic flood flow at the downstream control point 27 e q c t i 1 2 c 0 i q i t c 1 i q i t 1 c 2 i q i t

flow at the downstream control point respectively and var i t is the variance of the stochastic lateral inflows 4 we assume that the stochastic flood flow is normally distributed at any given time chen et al 2015 and use eq 7 and eq 27 to calculate the risk of downstream flooding expressed as 28 p 2 t p q c t q c r q c r f q c t d q c t q c r 1 2 π var q c t exp q c t e q c t 2 2 var q c t d q

1 the model is solved using non dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii deb and jain 2014 jain and deb 2014 the flow chart for the optimization of the proposed multi objective risk management model is presented in fig 3 according to fig 3 the step by step procedure for the optimization is as follows 1 an initial parent population p j j 0 is created with population size m the decision variables in the multi objective risk management model are the releases at each time period of the reservoirs during the entire flood event to minimize undesirable fluctuations of reservoir releases we code half the decision variables u d i i e the reservoir releases at the odd time periods and then randomly initialize them during optimization the rest of the decision variables e d i i e the reservoir releases at the even time periods are obtained by interpolation from u d i finally we conduct the moving average filter for all decision variables to get the final decision sequence d i the detailed calculation formulas are 29 d i t r a n d o m d i m 1 d i m 2 t 1 3 5 t u d i d i t t 1 3 5 t where u d i is the set of decision variables at the odd time periods and d i t is randomly initialized between d i m 1 and d i m 2 30 d i t d i t 1 d i t 1 2 t 2 4 t 1 e d i d i t t 2 4 t 1 where e d i is the set of decision variables at the even time periods 31 d i t d i t t 1 t d i t d i t 1 d i t d i t 1 3 t 2 t 1 d i t d i t 2 d i t 1 d i t d i t 1 d i t 2 5 t 3 4 5 t 2 where d i t t 1 2 t is the set of all final decision variables 2 for the j th generation the fitness value of the parent population p j is calculated and the offspring population s j of size m is created from p j by binary tournament selection recombination and mutation operators 3 a population ps j of size 2 m is formed by combining the parent population p j and the offspring population s j then the new population p j 1 of size m is chosen according to the selection operator with a set of reference points to find the near pareto optimal solutions corresponding to the supplied reference points 4 set j j 1 if j n n is the maximum number of evolution generations then the calculation is completed otherwise return to step 2 for constraint handling we use the ranking method proposed by deb et al 2002 any feasible solution has a better non domination rank than any infeasible solution and between two infeasible solutions the solution with a smaller constraint violation has a better rank we use the hypervolume hv index to evaluate the performance of the multi objective optimization the index provides a metric for the integrated evaluation of the convergence and diversity of the pareto front for the non dominated solution set s the hypervolome of s is defined as the volume of the hypercube enclosed by the individuals in s and the reference points in the target space zitzler and thiele 1999 expressed as 32 hv s l e b x s f 1 x r 1 f 2 x r 2 f r x r r where l e b is the lebesgue measure of the non dominated solution set s and f 1 x r 1 f 2 x r 2 f r x r r refers to the hypercube enclosed by the individuals in x and the reference points in the target space based on the definition of hypervolome the hv index in optimization by nsga iii is expressed as 33 hv j 1 m hv v o l u m e j where m hv is the number of the obtained non dominated solutions and volum e j is the hypervolume of the objective space enclosed by the j th non dominated solution and the reference points we note that the higher the hv index the better the quality of the obtained non dominated solutions 3 case study 3 1 data and parameters for the proposed model we perform a case study in the middle reaches of huaihe river basin which is located in the north and south climate transition zones of eastern china its north area has a warm temperate climate and its south area features a continental climate we focus on the flood control system that consists of nianyushan reservoir meishan reservoir and the jiangjiaji flood control point as shown in fig 4 table 1 shows the main characteristics of the two reservoirs in the case study we use a forecasted flood with a lead time of 99 h that was provided by the inflow forecast model of the reservoirs as shown in fig 5 d the time step δ t used in the analysis is three hours and the total number of time periods t is 33 according to eq 2 the standard deviation σ ξ q i t of the relative errors of the stochastic inflows is 0 12 with the qualified rate of 90 according to eqs 1 and 3 we simulate the stochastic reservoir inflows and lateral inflows with the results shown in the box plots on fig 5 a 5 b and 5 c according to the constraints outlined in section 2 1 the parameter values for real time operation of the reservoirs are set as shown in table 2 the selected safe flood flow at the jiangjiaji flood control point is 3 580 m3 s the values of z i 0 are set at the actual initial water levels of the two reservoirs and z i e are used as the terminal reservoir water levels the values of z i m 1 are set at the reservoir flood limited water levels and z i m 2 are obtained as the reservoir design flood water levels the values of q i m 1 and q i m 2 are obtained according to the downstream ecological and flood control requirements the terms c 0 i c 1 i c 2 i are the river flood routing parameters of the muskingum method the values of z i r are applied as the selected safe reservoir water levels note that z i r can be increased dynamically during the flood season rather than directly set at the overtopping flood water level in order to ensure the gradual usage of the reservoir storage and prepare for the upcoming floods the crossover probability and the distribution index of the simulated binary crossover in nsga iii are 1 and 20 respectively the expectation number of bits for mutation and the distribution index of the polynomial mutation are 1 and 20 respectively we set four experiments for comparison table 3 shows the other relevant parameter values used in the nsga iii and in the numerical experiments as table 3 shows we set different population sizes and function evaluations in experiment 1 to assess their impacts on the performance of the multi objective risk management model we analyze the results of the reservoir releases water levels and the three objectives in experiment 2 we evaluate the impacts of the uncertainty level and the correlation coefficient of the inflow forecast errors on the results in experiments 3 and 4 we provide detailed results and discussion of the four experiments below 3 2 results and discussion 1 experiment 1 selection of population size and evolution generations with the data and parameter values in section 3 1 we carry out the calculation for the multi objective risk management model according to the steps outlined in fig 3 the model was run five times independently to evaluate the performance of the algorithm fig 6 shows the average hv index of different population sizes and function evaluations as fig 6 shows the hv increases with the population size and evolution generation and it remains stable after 100 generations the multi objective risk management model was written in matlab and executed on a laptop with intel r i7 5 600u cpu 2 60 ghz four cores 8 0 gb ram the calculation time for the experiment of 100 population size and 10 000 function evaluations is about 348 s it is about 632 s for 100 population size and 20 000 function evaluations 721 s for 200 population size and 20 000 function evaluations and 1421 s for 200 population size and 40 000 function evaluations we use the results of 200 population size and 40 000 function evaluations for detailed discussion in the following sections 2 experiment 2 trade off between the objectives in experiment 2 we analyze the trade off among the three objectives fig 7 a and 7 b show the three dimensional scatterplot and histogram of the three objectives f 1 f 2 and f 3 fig 8 shows the plane projections of the three dimensional trade off of the three objectives shown in fig 7 as evident in figs 7 and 8 the pareto front shows the tradeoff among the three competing objectives the risk of downstream flooding can be reduced only at the expense of increasing the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs and vice versa as presented in fig 8 a in general under the condition of the fixed risk f 3 of downstream flooding at the jiangjiaji control point the risk f 1 of nianyushan reservoir can be reduced only at the expense of increasing the risk f 2 of meishan reservoir flooding as shown in fig 8 b with the fixed risk f 1 of nianyushan reservoir the risk f 2 of meishan reservoir flooding increases while the risk f 3 of downstream flooding at the jiangjiaji control point decreases and with the fixed risk f 2 of meishan reservoir the risk f 1 of nianyushan reservoir flooding decreases while the risk f 3 of downstream flooding at the jiangjiaji control point increases as shown in fig 8 c as shown in fig 7 a there are 200 solutions and it is difficult to rank them by a single criterion as we have three objectives in general the multi criteria decision making methods can be adopted to rank the solutions or define the optimal operation schedule according to the preference of the decision makers for the purpose of discussion we select five representative points on the pareto fronts a b c d e on fig 7 1 solution 1 point a on fig 7 a represents the operation schedule with large risks in the two upstream reservoirs nianyushan and meishan and lower downstream risk 2 solution 2 point b on fig 7 a represents the operation schedule with large risks in the downstream control point and lower risks in upstream reservoirs 3 solution 3 point c on fig 7 a refers to the operation schedule with large risk in the nianyushan reservoir 4 solution 4 point d on fig 7 a refers to the operation schedule with large risk in the meishan reservoir and 5 solution 5 point e on fig 7 a is the operation schedule with balanced risks in the upstream reservoirs and downstream control point with this information the decision makers can select the operation schedule according to their risk preference from the five representative solutions or the other solutions on the tradeoff curve figs 9 and 10 show the reservoir water levels and releases of the five solutions for the nianyushan and meishan reservoirs respectively note that q refers to the reservoir release and z represents the reservoir water level fig 11 shows the flood flows of the jiangjiaji flood control point for the five solutions we present the characteristic values for five representative solutions in table 4 including the multi objective values f 1 f 2 and f 3 maximum reservoir water levels max z 1 t and max z 2 t and maximum flood flow at the downstream control point max qc t as solution 1 point a on fig 7 a shows the risks of upstream flooding of the nianyushan and meishan reservoirs are both 100 this implies that the probability that the stochastic water level of the nianyushan reservoir exceeds the selected safe water level of 108 60 m is 100 due to the uncertainty factors it is also 100 for the meishan reservoir when the selected safe water level is 134 80 m the risk of downstream flooding at the jiangjiaji control point is 1 2 which implies that the probability that the stochastic flood flow exceeds the selected safe flood flow of 3 580 m3 s is 1 2 as solution 2 point b on fig 7 a shows the risk of downstream flooding is 91 3 while the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs are both 0 0 solution 5 point e on fig 7 a shows the risks of upstream flooding of the nianyushan and meishan reservoirs and the risk of downstream flooding at the jiangjiaji control point are approximately balanced at 40 8 36 9 and 44 1 respectively by comparing solutions 3 and 1 under the condition of a fixed risk at the nianyushan reservoir the risk of the meishan reservoir increases from 0 8 to 100 while the risk of the jiangjiaji control point decreases from 35 7 to 1 2 this is because the maximum water level of the meishan reservoir increases by 1 12 m while the maximum flood flow of jiangjiaji decreases by 447 m3 s therefore solution 2 minimizes the risk of downstream flooding at the expense of increasing the maximum reservoir water level and risk of upstream flooding of the meishan reservoir by comparing solutions 4 and 1 under the condition of a fixed risk at the meishan reservoir the risk of the nianyushan reservoir decreases from 100 to 1 3 while the risk of the jiangjiaji control point increases from 1 2 to 37 2 the maximum water level of the nianyushan reservoir decreases by 0 86 m while the maximum flood flow of jiangjiaji increases by 451 m3 s therefore solution 4 minimizes the maximum water level and the risk of upstream flooding of the nianyushan reservoir at the expense of increasing the risk of downstream flooding 3 experiment 3 evaluating the impact of the inflow forecast accuracy in order to evaluate the influence of the inflow forecast accuracy on the trade off of the three objectives we set the standard deviation of the relative errors of the forecasted flood peak discharge at 0 12 0 16 and 0 2 for a comparative analysis for each standard deviation we follow the steps in fig 3 to produce the pareto front fig 12 shows the plane projections of the three dimensional trade off of the three objectives with different inflow forecast accuracy as fig 12 shows in general the plane projections of the three dimensional trade off move to the lower left corner while the standard deviation σ of the relative errors of the forecasted inflows decreases as a result the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs as well as the risk of downstream flooding both decrease while the standard deviation of the relative errors of the forecasted inflows decreases therefore in order to reduce the risks of upstream flooding and downstream flooding at the same time it is necessary to reduce the uncertainty degree of the uncertainty factors such as improving the accuracy of reservoir inflow forecasting 4 experiment 4 evaluating the impact of the inflow forecast error correlations in order to evaluate the influence of the inflow forecast error correlations on the trade off of the three objectives we set the correlation coefficients of the inflow forecast errors at 0 0 25 and 0 50 for comparative analysis for each standard deviation we follow the steps outlined in fig 3 to produce the pareto front fig 13 shows the plane projections of the three dimensional trade off of the proposed objectives with different inflow forecast error correlations as fig 13 shows in general the plane projections of the three dimensional trade off move to the lower left corner while the correlation coefficient ρ of the inflow forecast errors decreases as a result the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs as well as the risk of downstream flooding both decrease while the correlation coefficient of the inflow forecast errors decreases this is because the variance of the stochastic reservoir water level errors increases with the correlation coefficient ρ of the inflow forecast errors as shown in eq 23 therefore the stochastic reservoir water levels fluctuate around the mean value in a wider range which creates larger risks 3 3 applications and limitations of the proposed model 3 3 1 applications real time flood control operation and decision making is a multistage process the decision makers can change their risk preference at different time periods during the flood for example 1 at the onset of the flood pre release from the reservoir can be used to ensure that adequate flood control storage is available for the impending flood if this is preferred decision makers can choose the optimal operation schedule of solution 2 as the lower the reservoir water level the lower the risk of upstream flooding 2 during the flood peak period decision makers can choose the optimal operation schedule with a compromise solution such as solution 5 that balances the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs with the risk of downstream flooding at the jiangjiaji control point 3 in the later period of the flood more water can be stored for future utilization consequently decision makers can choose the optimal operation schedule of solution 1 as the relatively larger risk of upstream flooding is acceptable in this period if the forecast information shows the nianyushan reservoir still has a large amount of subsequent precipitation decision makers can select solution 4 in order to reserve sufficient reservoir storage to store future inflows note that real time flood control operation and decision making is a recourse process as time proceeds the forecast information of inflow and precipitation in the river basin is updated dynamically in real time therefore we update the safe water levels for the reservoirs based on the updated precipitation forecasts expressed as 34 z i r t g v z i p r e c i p i t a t i o n i t f i where z i is the design flood water level or the overtopping flood water level of the reservoir v z i is the corresponding reservoir storage to z i which can be derived from the reservoir storage capacity curve precipitatio n i t is the forecasted subsequent precipitation of reservoir i g refers to the reservoir storage capacity curve and f i is the drainage area of reservoir i then the multi objective risk management model can be re optimized with the updated information as shown in the outlined steps of fig 14 the optimization results can provide decision makers with comprehensive operation schedules for the purpose of making flood control operation plans in real time flood control operations 3 3 2 limitations there is room for future research on the proposed multi objective risk management model for multi reservoir flood control systems in this study we analyzed the uncertainties of inflows with normally distributed errors in future research other probability distribution functions of the forecast errors can be considered for comparative study if sufficient historical and forecasted flood data are available the distribution parameters of the forecast errors can be obtained through a standard statistical analysis or forecast ensembles yan et al 2014 nayak et al 2018 in addition in this study we considered the uncertainties of forecasted reservoir inflows and lateral inflows more uncertainties can be taken into consideration in future research of the multi objective risk management model further research also can be conducted on how to combine the multi criteria decision making methods with the proposed model to rank the optimization solutions in order to assist in decision making 4 conclusions many uncertainties are associated with real time reservoir flood control operation which create risks in flood control decisions in this paper we undertook research on risk management for the real time flood control operation of a parallel reservoir system the main works are summarized as follows 1 we developed a multi objective risk management model for real time flood control optimal operation for a parallel reservoir system during flood season considering the uncertainties of reservoir inflows and lateral inflows the key improvements of the proposed model include 1 treating the objectives as minimizing the risks of both upstream flooding and downstream flooding hence flood risks are directly optimized 2 imbedding a probabilistic risk assessment submodel in an optimal operation submodel to determine the optimal operation schedules that simultaneously satisfy the flood control objectives and minimize overall flood risks thereby combining multi objective optimal flood control operations and risk management 3 coupling nsga iii with a smooth filter in the multi objective optimization submodel to produce smooth reservoir release policies 2 we applied the proposed model to a parallel reservoir system located in the middle reaches of the huaihe river basin in china the results show 1 the model solutions provide decision makers with a number of comprehensive operation schedules that satisfy the given flood control objectives and simultaneously minimize the risks of upstream flooding of the reservoirs as well as the risk of downstream flooding 2 the pareto front of the three objectives demonstrates the tradeoff among them e g the risk of downstream flooding can be reduced only at the expense of increasing the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs and vice versa therefore decision makers can choose the operation schedule according to their risk preference and updated hydrological information to conduct flood control management and plans 3 we conducted several comparative analyses to evaluate the influence of inflow forecast accuracy and forecast error correlations on the proposed model the results show that 1 the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs as well as the risk of downstream flooding both increase while the inflow forecast accuracy decreases 2 the risks of upstream flooding of the two reservoirs as well as the risk of downstream flooding both decrease while the correlation coefficient of the inflow forecast errors decreases therefore it is necessary to reduce the uncertainty degree of the uncertainty factors such as improving the accuracy of reservoir inflow forecasting in order to reduce the risks of upstream flooding and downstream flooding at the same time credit authorship contribution statement juan chen methodology writing original draft software validation ping an zhong

5168,this paper aims to interpret the low velocity nonlinear flow occurring in low permeability reservoirs based on the theories of electrokinetic transport and non newtonian rheology of fluids to achieve this end we simulate the steady state electroviscous flow of bingham papanastasiou bp fluids in circular microtubes by simultaneously solving the poisson boltzmann and the modified navier stokes equations the induced electrical field strength e s velocity profiles and the transport capacity of the non newtonian fluid under the effects of various factors such as capillary radius r zeta potential ζ yield stress τ 0 and stress growth index m were examined the results show that the generated e s of the bp fluid is highly affected by the fluid rheology which is quite different from that of the newtonian liquid the velocity profiles become lower and flatter as m or τ 0 increases and this is more remarkable in smaller microtubes the apparent viscosity of non newtonian fluid declines monotonically with increasing c yet non monotonically with r m τ 0 and ζ in addition the low velocity nonlinear flow in microtubes can be successfully captured when considering the electrokinetic flow of the non newtonian fluid rheology while for the newtonian fluid only involving the electroviscous effect fails to generate the nonlinear flow behavior the contributions of electrokinetic parameters versus rheological properties to the degree of flow nonlinearity are also discussed the impact of electrokinetic parameters ζ c on the flow characteristics is significant at high pressure gradients and becomes trivial when the pressure gradient is relatively low in contrast the fluid rheological parameters m τ 0 greatly determine the magnitude of the flow nonlinearity occurring at the low pressure gradients in sum the electroviscous flow of bp fluids in microchannels provides a possible explanation of the low velocity non darcy flow in porous media keywords non newtonian electroviscous flow microtubes low velocity nonlinear flow 1 introduction fluid flow in porous media is often described by darcy s law which characterizes a linear correlation between flow velocity and the pressure gradient bear 2013 kumar et al 2020 however numerous studies soni et al 1978 coles and hartman 1998 dejam et al 2017 diwu et al 2018 have shown that the darcy velocity in both saturated and unsaturated flows exhibits nonlinear dependence on the pressure gradient in low permeability porous media at low pressure gradients as illustrated in fig 1 a this nonlinear behavior may result from strong liquid solid interactions in a thin layer close to the solid surface due to the combined effects of various interfacial forces whether these forces require a threshold pressure gradient tpg to initiate the flow is still debatable wei et al 2009 wang and sheng 2017 the direct measurement of the tpg is often not practical since the flow rate in low permeable media is always too low to be accurately determined in fact the tpg value is generally obtained by fitting experimental data with considerable uncertainties nevertheless whether the tpg exists remains unanswered to date while the low velocity non darcian flow in low permeability porous media is widely recognized liu et al 2012 to characterize the nonlinear flow in porous media extensive experiments have been conducted using fluids like tap water deionized water or various formation liquids these experimental data allow establishing correlations to describe the nonlinear feature of the flow in porous samples prada and civan 1999 hao et al 2008 zeng et al 2011 an earlier work by miller and low 1963 observed the tpg as a result of water clay interaction when water flows through different clayey specimens prada and civan 1999 performed a series of brine flow tests through sandstones and sandpack samples and proposed a modified darcy s law that the flow velocity is proportional to a power relation of the pressure gradient additionally zeng et al 2011 measured the velocity gradient curves for various types of fluids flowing through ultra low permeability rocks and obtained empirical relations between the tpg and sample permeability recently by critically reviewing the current advances and discussing the nonlinear flow mechanisms wang and sheng 2017 used the boundary layer theory huang et al 2013 including the boundary and bulk fluid shown in fig 2 of their work to describe the nonlinear flow mechanism however a universal mechanism responsible for the nonlinear seepage phenomenon in reservoirs remains elusive an enhanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear flow in tight porous media is of great societal and economic interests in the context of the exploration of unconventional reservoirs such as shale gas and tight oil fluid flow in such tight porous media is typically subjected to low pressure gradients and exhibits strong non darcian behavior diwu et al 2018 this non darcy flow highly affects the well production and the injection operation in tight reservoirs chen et al 2017 therefore to uncover the underlying mechanics of non darcian behaviors of fluids becomes crucial to the successful development of unconventional resources however such reservoir rocks mainly contain micro and nano scale pores loucks et al 2009 zhao et al 2015 cheng et al 2019 which precludes the accuracy of conventional core flooding experiments as mentioned above on the other hand the rapid development of microelectromechanical technology provides an alternative approach to study the diverse physical phenomena such as microfluidic mixing kirby 2010 heat transfer ayoubloo et al 2019 ghalambaz et al 2019 shashikumar et al 2019 and fluid flow at the microscale li 2004 masliyah and bhattacharjee 2006 for instance authors wang et al 2009 yang et al 2011 wu et al 2017a b have performed flow experiments using micro fluidic channels to study the novel features of micro scale flow it has been shown that the observed nonlinear flow at low pressure gradient can be explained by the boundary layer theory assuming the adsorption of polarized water molecules on hydrophilic solid surfaces and the thickness of the boundary layer decreases with increased pressure gradient until a certain thickness cannot be reduced any further even at a higher pressure gradient wu et al 2017a the impact of surface dominated forces in microfluidics originating from the liquid wall interaction on the flow becomes indispensable when the flow channels are at the micro and nano scales brutin and tadrist 2003 one of the surface dominated forces arises from the electrical double layer edl effect hunter 1981 li 2004 edl is essentially a physical structure that spontaneously appears on a solid surface when it is in contact with an electrolyte solution an electrical potential difference at the solid liquid interface leads to the rearrangement of ions within the edl in the presence of an external pressure gradient the solution transport in microfluidics can be greatly influenced by the electroviscous effect in many cases hunter 1981 the primary mechanism of the electroviscous flow is illustrated in fig 1b when an aqueous solution flows through a micro channel driven only by a pressure difference the counterions in the diffuse layer are carried toward the outlet end resulting in the formation of streaming potential along the flow direction subsequently the flow induced streaming potential drives the counterions to move against the liquid flow direction meanwhile the moving counterions in the diffuse layer will drag the liquid molecules to migrate the net effect results in an increase in the fluid viscosity and thus the reduction in the flow rate through a micro channel i e so called the electroviscosity effect wang et al 2006 the impact of generated streaming potential on the flow of formation fluids i e electrolyte solutions through low permeable rocks cannot be arbitrarily neglected bear 2013 donaldson and alam 2013 zhang et al 2015 studied the electrokinetic flow of a newtonian fluid in a capillary tube with periodically varying cross sections and concluded that the electroviscous effects cannot account for the observed nonlinear flow in tight porous media besides we recently examined the flow characteristics of solutions in hydrophilic nanopores considering the electroviscous effects and the enhanced viscosity near the charged wall yet the nonlinear fluid flow was not found cheng et al 2020 additionally the formation liquids generally carry mineral particles and may become non newtonian liquids due to clay water interactions swartzendruber 1962a swartzendruber 1962b liu et al 2012 such fluids have also been considered as bingham fluids in numerical studies jiang et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 published experimental studies also show that clay water suspensions can behave as non newtonian bingham fluids with yield stress rand and melton 1977 torrance 1999 amorós et al 2010 further it has been stated that the nonlinear flow is likely to take place in any surface active porous medium and the non newtonian behavior can be a possible cause of the non darcy flow swartzendruber 1962a b which has not yet been validated based on the above discussion we here consider the formation liquids as the bingham fluids and investigate whether the nonlinear flow found in published experiments can be interpreted by the combined effects of the electrokinetic flow and the non newtonian rheology recently based on the debye huckel linearization theory kirby 2010 a closed form model of the electrokinetic flow of bingham plastic fluid zhang et al 2019 has been proposed to account for the nonlinear flow mechanism in circular pores however it cannot consider the impacts of high zeta potential at the solid wall due to the linearization simplification this study aims to investigate the electroviscous flow in a micro sized capillary tube using a continuous bingham papanastasiou bp fluid papanastasiou 1987 this non newtonian fluid model is chosen to avoid the inherent attribute of discontinuity in the ideal bingham plastic model mitsoulis 2007 after detailed descriptions of the model and model validation we investigate the impacts of fluid rheological properties and electrokinetic parameters on the electrokinetic flow characteristics the results help shed light on the understanding of low velocity nonlinear flow of formation fluids in tight media 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations the fluid viscosity η is a constant for newtonian fluids but a shear dependent variable for non newtonian fluids for the bp fluid η is defined by papanastasiou 1987 1 η τ γ η 0 τ 0 γ 1 exp m γ where η 0 is the plastic viscosity m is the stress growth index that controls the strength of the increasing stress τ 0 denotes the yield stress and τ is the shear stress corresponding to a specific shear rate additionally the shear rate tensor γ is expressed as bird et al 1987 2 γ 2 s s where s is calculated by 3 s u u t 2 in which u is the fluid velocity fig 2 illustrates the rheological behavior of bp fluids with various m values the results are presented in dimensionless shear stress τ τ 0 with increasing shear rate γ an important feature of the bp fluids is that they have a finite stress level at small shear rates unlike the ideal bingham model in which a solid like structure is formed as τ τ 0 furthermore the newtonian fluid is recovered when m approaches 0 or τ 0 0 in the limit of m eq 1 is reduced to the classical bingham plastic model mitsoulis 2007 this study considers the steady state laminar flow of a binary electrolyte i e an incompressible non newtonian fluid with viscosity η flowing through a cylindrical microtube with radius r subjected to a pressure gradient pz the flow velocity u can be characterized by the modified navier stokes n s equation 4 d 2 u d r 2 1 r du dr p z η e s η ρ e where es and ρ e are induced electric field strength and charge density respectively the electrical potential distribution of the solution in a capillary tube is governed by the poisson equation hunter 1981 5 d 2 ψ d r 2 1 r d ψ dr ρ e ε 0 ε r where ψ is the electrostatic potential ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity and εr is the relative permittivity of the fluid the charge density ρe can be determined by 6 ρ e i e z i n i where e is the elementary charge zi and ni denote the valence and the number concentration of the ith species when the advection of ions is neglected by combining the assumption of electro neutrality far away from the walls ni can be given by 7 n i n i exp z i e ψ k b t where ni is the bulk ionic concentration of the ith species kb is the boltzmann constant and t is the environment temperature summarizing eqs 5 7 then leads to the poisson boltzmann pb equation 8 d 2 ψ d r 2 1 r d ψ dr 2 n z e ε 0 ε r sinh z e ψ k b t note that es in eq 4 is determined with the net electrical current being zero in the steady state which means 9 i i c i s 0 where i ic and is are the net electrical current the conduction current and the streaming potential respectively hence es can be given by rice and whitehead 1965 10 e s 2 π 0 r ρ e u r r d r λ eff a c where r is the capillary tube radius ac is the cross sectional area of the microtube and λeff is the effective electric conductivity of the liquid that can be analytically determined by ban et al 2010 11 λ eff 2 π 0 r λ r d r a c where the electric conductivity λ can be expressed as lu et al 2004 ban et al 2010 12 λ z i 2 e 2 d i n i k b t where di is the diffusion constant of the ith species as such the distributions of electrical potential and charge density can be calculated using the pb model and the velocity profile in a microtube is obtained through the modified n s equation eq 4 2 2 the numerical model and model validation to reduce the computational cost of solving the pb and the modified n s equations a two dimensional axisymmetric model is used in the simulations the model fig 3 shows a capillary tube with a radius r a solid wall bc boundary with zeta potential ζ and a pressure difference between the inlet p in ab boundary and outlet p out cd boundary of the capillary tube no slip boundary condition u 0 is assumed at the solid wall bc boundary given that the coupled model incorporating the pb and the modified n s equations are highly nonlinear the comsol package based on the finite element method is employed to numerically solve these equations multiphysics 2012 since no analytical solution to the electrokinetic transport of the bp fluid in a capillary tube exists the validation of the numerical model in this study is confirmed by simulating the electrokinetic flow of a newtonian fluid a 1 1 electrolyte solution in a capillary tube and comparing to its approximate analytical solution regarding eq 8 the term sinh z e ψ k b t can be approximately written as z e ψ k b t when the zeta potential of the charged wall is low z e ψ k b t 1 namely the debye huckel approximation kirby 2010 hence the pb equation is linearized as 13 d 2 ψ d r 2 1 r d ψ dr 2 n z 2 e 2 ε 0 ε r k b t ψ κ 2 ψ where κ 2 n z 2 e 2 ε 0 ε r k b t represents the reciprocal of the debye length which is the nominal thickness of the edl as such κr the ratio of the microtube radius over the edl thickness indicates the relative intensity of the electrokinetic effects combing eq 5 and 13 the edl electrical potential and the velocity profile within the microtube can be analytically determined rice and whitehead 1965 14 ψ r ζ i 0 κ r i 0 κ r 15 u r 1 4 η p z r 2 r 2 ω 2 p z 1 i 0 κ r i 0 κ r λ s 1 2 i 1 κ r κ r i 0 κ r 1 β 1 2 i 1 κ r κ r i 0 κ r i 1 2 κ r i 0 2 κ r where i 0 and i 1 are the zero order and first order modified bessel function respectively besides two coefficients are expressed as ω ε ψ 0 η and β ω 2 η κ 2 λ s the following parameter values are assumed for the comparison of analytical and numerical results the electric conductivity λ is taken as a constant 8 10 8 s m and the ionic molar concentration c is 10 6 mol l note that the correlation between n and c is n c na where na is the avogadro constant the density viscosity and relative permittivity of the solution are taken as 1000 kg m3 1 mpa s and 80 respectively the temperature is 298 15 k and the pressure gradient imposed is 1 mpa m fig 4 shows the distribution of electrical potential and the velocity profile using the simulation and the analytical solution the numerical results perfectly agree with that of the debye huckel theory when ζ 20 mv fig 4a however as expected the numerical pb solution gradually departs from the debye huckel prediction when ζ 60 and 100 mv because the debye huckel approximation is only valid under low ζ as for the velocity profiles fig 4b numerical results are lower than that from the hagen poiseuille hp velocity for all ζ values highlighting the electroviscous effect on retarding the fluid flow in microtubes at ζ 20 mv the velocity profile by the pb model is in good agreement with that of the debye huckel method however the differences between the analytical and the simulation results increase with increasing ζ values and the debye huckel approach underestimates the fluid velocity thus the numerical solution of the coupled pb and modified n s equations can not only provide validated results but also capture the electroviscous effect particularly at high zeta potential of the solid wall 3 numerical results the transport characteristics of the bp fluid through a microtube are investigated considering the surface zeta potential ζ the ionic molar concentration c the fluid stress growth index m and the fluid yield stress τ 0 the characteristics of the newtonian fluid flowing through the microtube are also presented as a comparison the following simulations assume a potassium chloride kcl solution which is a common component of the formation fluid in tight reservoirs all other parameters used in the simulations including temperature the pressure gradient and viscosities are listed in table 1 note that the plastic viscosity also represents the viscosity of the newtonian liquid 3 1 induced electrical potential the manifested electroviscous effect on fluid flow through a microtube is caused by the movement of counterions within the edl against the pressure gradient the induced electrokinetic resistance is largely associated with the strength of the generated streaming potential thus we here consider the influence of the yield stress τ 0 on the induced electrical field strength e s a bp fluid can be reduced to the newtonian fluid when the yield stress τ 0 0 see eq 1 as such both newtonian and non newtonian fluids show an identical electrical strength when fluid yield stress τ 0 0 fig 5 the newtonian fluid always holds a constant electrical strength e s and is larger than that of the bp fluid regardless of the changing yield stress this is because the bp fluid has a higher viscosity than the newtonian fluid causing a reduction in the flow velocity the mobility of the electrical charge and thus the induced electrical field strength in other words the bp fluid can lower the streaming potential zhang et al 2019 additionally as the fluid yield stress τ 0 increases the flow velocity also decreases due to increased viscous resistance and thus the induced electrical field e s as shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5c and 5d the induced electrical field e s in a microtube with radius r 10 μm does not show an evident difference as the fluid stress growth index m varies from 0 1 to 1000 s this is mainly because the shear stress of the bp fluid is less dependent on a certain range of shear rate see also fig 2 so that the difference in viscosity becomes negligible when m 0 1 s the induced electrical field e s generally decreases and departs from that of the newtonian fluid as the m value increases the decreasing trend in e s with increasing m values is also affected by the fluid yield stress τ 0 particularly when m 0 1 s this phenomenon is more pronounced in smaller microtubes such as in a 3 μm radius microtube shown in fig 5a and 5c when the fluid yield stress is high say τ 0 1 4 pa the flow velocity is relatively low resulting in a weak electrical field e s while in a r 10 μm microtube the induced electrical field is still relatively high compared to that in the r 3 μm microtube at a high fluid yield stress τ 0 2 pa this is attributed to the higher fluid velocity within the r 10 μm microtube furthermore it is also found that although a larger zeta potential corresponds to a larger net charge density the induced e s in this scenario is lower this finding is similar to the study of jamaati et al 2010 in which a decrease in e s with increasing zeta potential is observed when the zeta potential is higher than a critical value this reflects that the electric field e s is determined by multiple factors according to eq 10 and higher charge density ρe may be counteracted by higher electrical conductivity λeff of the liquid 3 2 velocity profiles fig 6 presents the velocity profiles of non newtonian fluids through microtubes with the consideration of the electrokinetic effect the velocity results are presented in a dimensionless form i e divided by the average bulk velocity ū hp note also that the results for the cases of m 10 s and 1000 s are not shown as they almost overlap with that of the m 0 1 s case as discussed previously in section 3 1 the results show that the newtonian fluid has higher velocities at all radial positions within the capillary tube than that of the non newtonian fluids even though the newtonian fluid has higher electrokinetic resistance as shown in fig 5 this is mainly due to the high viscosity of the bp fluids that outweighs the electroviscous effects additionally as the zeta potential of the wall shifts from 50 mv to 200 mv there is a slight decrease in the velocity due to increased electrokinetic resistance as such the shear rate of the fluid decreases when the yield stress increases particularly near the central region of the capillary tube this leads to flatter velocity profiles of the non newtonian fluids i e no longer parabola profiles fig 6c such velocity profiles can also be found in the published numerical study tang et al 2011 the calculated velocity profiles in the 10 μm microtubes fig 6b 6d and 6f follow a similar pattern as those of the 3 μm microtubes fig 6a 6c and 6e however the latter has more pronounced electroviscous effects and bingham behaviors of fluids the more pronounced electroviscous effect in the 3 μm microtubes is attributed to the thicker edl compared to that in the 10 μm microtubes furthermore the velocity declines more rapidly as the yield stress increases in the 3 μm microtube compared to the 10 μm microtube for instance the maximum dimensionless velocity is only 0 02 when τ 0 1 6 pa and m 0 1 s in the 3 μm microtube indicating enormous flow resistance resulted from the bingham rheology this result further supports the above observation that very low fluid velocity cannot lead to significant streaming potential fig 5a and b 4 analyses and discussion 4 1 apparent viscosity the apparent viscosity of the fluid flow in the microtubes η app is calculated to quantitatively evaluate the strength of the flow resistance induced by the electrokinetic effect the results are presented in dimensionless η app η i e divided by the viscosity of the non newtonian fluid η note that at a constant pressure gradient η app η essentially reflects u non eve u eve where u non eve and u eve are the averaged flow velocity in a microtube without and with the consideration of the electroviscous forces respectively note that the averaged flow velocity also inherently captures the flux in the microtube fig 7 a depicts the effects of the capillary radius on η app η for both the newtonian and the bp liquids with different m values for non newtonian fluids η app η is used for reflecting the effect of streaming potential on fluid flow hence it is always larger than unity the results show that η app η varies non monotonically with the microtube size for instance with the increase in the tube size η app η first experiences a rapid increase followed by a gradual decrease when m 0 1 s overall the electrokinetic effect in the non newtonian fluid is sensitive to the value of m and the resulted viscosity can be higher or lower than that of the newtonian fluid the total flow resistance in a microtube is mainly caused by the viscous drag and the electroviscous force within the edl subjected to a certain pressure gradient the fluid with m 0 01 s or 0 1 s has a relatively low shear rate in a small sized microtube e g r 3 μm that leads to a high viscosity in the microtube in these situations the flow resistance is dominated by the viscous forces leading to a lower η app η value with the increase in the microtube size the electroviscous contribution to the flow resistance will be enhanced due to increased flow shear rate followed by a gradual decrease due to reduced edl thickness compared to the tube size and eventually approaches to one as shown in fig 7a plus the difference in η app η among different m values diminishes as r 15 μm this result may be because the viscosity of the non newtonian fluid is independent of the m value under a certain range of shear rates refer to fig 2 therefore it can be concluded that the variation in η app η with the values of microtube radius and m is not monotonous and η app η has a local maximum at a certain capillary radius which is strongly related to the rheological properties of the fluids furthermore the relationship between η app η and the yield stress of the fluid is presented in fig 7b the newtonian liquid has a constant η app η regardless of τ 0 as expected when m 0 001 s the dimensionless apparent viscosity η app η of the liquid decreases almost linearly and would be close to unity with the yield stress and the difference in η app η between the non newtonian and the newtonian fluids becomes larger as τ 0 increases likewise reducing the m value would reduce the difference in η app η between the two fluids see the case of m 0 0001 s in fig 7b however the effect of τ 0 on the η app η of non newtonian fluids is non monotonic when m 0 001 s and there exists a critical τ 0 that resulting in the largest η app η it is also revealed that the m value has a non monotonic influence on η app η the η app η versus τ 0 trends are different at different m values this is mainly because the increase in η outweighs the electrokinetic resistance at small m values i e m 0 0001 and 0 00001 s herein and a greater electrokinetic contribution to the increases fluid viscosity at larger m values i e m 0 01 and 0 1 s however the very low flow rate will make the electroviscous effect negligible at a larger τ 0 specifically at m 0 1 s and τ 0 2 7 pa the electroviscous effect becomes subtle mainly due to the very low shear rate in the flow the viscous and electroviscous forces accounting for the proportions of the total flow resistance changes as τ 0 increases and the magnitude of the electrokinetic effects is notably dependent on the fluid rheology fig 7c shows the impact of zeta potential ζ on the electroviscous flow of newtonian and non newtonian fluids the apparent viscosity of the newtonian fluid η app η exhibits a non monotonic behavior with increasing ζ this result is qualitatively consistent with previous studies jamaati et al 2010 jing et al 2017 the most remarkable electroviscous effect occurs when m 0 01 s additionally the dependence of η app η on the zeta potential for three cases of non newtonian fluids is also non monotonic also η app η varies non monotonically with the m value in some instances fig 7a the role of the solution concentration c in fluid transport in microtubes is investigated as illustrated in fig 7d a higher m value results in a larger η app η in addition the η app η monotonically decreases with increasing ionic molar concentration c which reduces the edl thickness and thus the electroviscous resistance of fluids there are numerical studies masliyah and bhattacharjee 2006 wang et al 2006 showing the non monotonic dependence of η app η on the solution concentration while bharti et al 2008 and bharti et al 2009 did not observe a local maximum of η app η as presented in this study this inconsistency is likely related to the differences in the boundary conditions i e a constant ζ versus a constant surface charge density or the calculation of the electrical conductivity of the solution in the work of wang et al 2006 λeff was set as a constant however as for the electroviscous flow the electric conductivity of an electrolyte is a key parameter to determine the streaming potential it is a function of the ion type ion concentration and zeta potential thus using a fixed λeff in the simulation may not be appropriate here following ban et al 2010 λeff is determined by using eq 12 which captures the influences of these factors and is also in line with the calculation method of λeff adopted in bharti et al 2008 and bharti et al 2009 4 2 nonlinear flow characteristics fig 8 shows the fluid velocity versus pressure gradient relationship ū p z under various influencing factors the results exhibit the nonlinear characteristics of the flow in microtubes that are successfully captured by considering the bp non newtonian fluid and the electrokinetic effect fig 8a and b show that the ū pz curves nearly coincided indicating the marginal effects of the zeta potential ζ and the ionic molar concentration c particularly when the pressure gradient is low the difference in the ū p z relation becomes more notable at higher pressure gradients the total flow resistance is dominated by the viscous force at low pressure gradients and by the electroviscous force at high pressure gradients this implies that the electrokinetic parameters ζ c have more evident impacts on the electroviscous flow in microtubes at a relatively high pressure gradient as shown in fig 8c and d the rheological parameters m τ 0 have more pronounced impacts on the nonlinearity of the fluid flow i e more concaved ū p z curves at m 0 01 and 0 1 s the fluid velocity at a pressure gradient smaller than 0 5 mpa m is very low as if there exists a threshold pressure gradient fig 8c such flow rates are too low to be accurately measured in a conventional laboratory setting while at m 0 001 s the nonlinear behavior is not remarkable furthermore all the ū p z relations will collapse into a single trend for various m values at high pressure gradients since the role of the m value in determining the fluid rheology becomes insignificant in this situation three curves are nearly parallel to each other also it is again found that for newtonian fluids considering the electroviscous effects alone cannot result in the nonlinearity in the ū p z relation moreover a larger yield stress τ 0 of the fluid leads to a stronger nonlinearity of flow and a lower flow rate fig 8d therefore the results highlight the dominant role of the electrokinetic parameters ζ c at high pressure gradients and the fluid rheological parameters m τ 0 at low pressure gradients on the flow in microtubes 4 3 extension to natural tight formations unconventional resources such as shale gas and tight oil are always stored in ultra low permeable reservoirs with abundant nano to micro pores to understand the unique seepage mechanisms in low permeable reservoirs laboratory tests generally focus on the single phase flow through rock samples as described in the introduction admittedly using the kcl solution representing the formation fluids is a simplification in this study as the formation fluids usually involve oil water and or gases and the compositions of the formation water are complex however given that formation liquids commonly have certain salt concentrations the resulted electroviscous effects on fluid flow need to be seriously considered keep in mind that the edl does not overlap in all microscale flow simulations in this investigation and thus the pb model is still adequate to characterize the distributions of ions and electrical potential furthermore as described in the introduction the fluid rheology may have been altered to be non newtonian fluid with yield stress due to charged particles and the complex interaction between liquid and the mineral surface a recent analytical study investigated the electroviscous flow of a bingham plastic fluid in microsized circular tubes zhang et al 2019 in which the fluid flow occurs only after exceeding the tpg and followed by a linear flow they also stated that such a generated nonlinear flow behavior coincided with the experimental results for deionized water flowing in silica microtubes yang et al 2011 zhu et al 2014 in fact whether the tpg exists is controversial according to the viewpoint in the literature wang and sheng 2017 tpg is generally obtained by fitting the measured ū pz curve and the hydrocarbon migration during the reservoir forming process cannot happen if there is a tpg the utilization of the bp model in our study generates a continuously nonlinear flow in microtubes without involving the conception of tpg moreover the results in this article indicate that the electroviscous flow of the newtonian fluid in microtubes shows the linear feature implying that experiments of deionized water flow in microtubes are probably not ideal for unraveling the mechanism of nonlinear flow in porous materials the possible reason is that the surface characteristic of microtubes used in testing cannot represent that of reservoir minerals the gained new insights can have potential applications for practical reservoir engineering for instance the fluids used for permeability measurement in rock samples can be collected for further rheology tests the viscosity shear rate results can be fitted by the bp model to acquire rheological parameters for reservoir simulators in terms of the electrokinetic effect its significance can be evaluated by the ratio of the edl thickness over the characteristic length of the porous rock or soil which is associated with its permeability the dimensionless apparent viscosity determined in section 4 1 shows that the electroviscous effect is not quite notable in micropores but it could become potentially more significant electroviscous effect in nanopores in this case a more general poisson nernst planck model may be required to characterize the electrokinetic transport because of the overlapped edl zhang and wang 2015 additionally the slip boundary condition should also be considered jing et al 2017 hajmohammadi et al 2018 which depends on the solid liquid interaction and is out of our subject here using the micro flux measuring instrument xue wu et al 2011 acquired the apparent permeability of sandstone cores under different pressure gradients and observed the low velocity non darcy behavior based on the assumption that the core can be simplified by the capillary bundle model bear 2013 we replot the velocity gradient curves of two samples shown in fig 9 the curves are fitted using the non newtonian model adopted in this work all relevant experimental and fitting parameters are listed in table 2 the fitting results are in good accord with the experimental data indicating the nonlinear flow can be generated through the combination of non newtonian rheology and electroviscous effect which may be a possible mechanism responsible for the low velocity non darcy flow of fluids in low permeable formations in sum the insights gained from this paper can enhance current reservoir simulators and provide theoretical foundations to broader fields such as the design of microfluidic devices soil hydrology engineering and geophysical applications 5 conclusions in this study the electrokinetic transport of bp non newtonian fluids through circular microtubes was systematically studied using the coupled pb and n s equations the effects of various electrokinetic and rheological properties on the induced electrical field strength velocity profile and transport capacity of the non newtonian fluid flow in microtubes were examined furthermore the characteristics of the nonlinear flow of fluids in microchanels were analyzed as well the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the induced electrical strength e s is collectively determined by various parameters such as the fluid velocity the electric conductivity and charge density within edl under the same condition e s for the non newtonian fluid is lower since it has a higher viscosity than the newtonian liquid in addition e s will monotonously decrease as τ 0 increases and can almost be ignored especially for the microtube with a small radius besides due to the fluid rheology of the bp model e s is not sensitive to the variation of m when m 0 1 s while decreasing m would enable e s to be closer to that for the newtonian fluid when m 0 1 s as such at a fixed pressure gradient a larger capillary will result in a higher e s 2 the velocity profiles of non newtonian fluids will become lower and flatter when τ 0 or m increases and a region having a higher viscosity would occur near the microtube center this phenomenon is more pronounced for the small capillary in addition the influences of the capillary size r zeta potential ζ stress growth index m and yield stress τ 0 on η app η for both of the newtonian and bp fluids are not monotonous and there is a critical value that leads to the largest η app η for each case while η app η gradually decreases with the increasing ion concentration c due to the thinner edl 3 with consideration of the non newtonian fluid rheology and electroviscous effects the low velocity nonlinear flow in microtubes is successfully captured the electrokinetic parameters ζ c only affect the flow characteristic of fluids at the high pressure gradient but have negligible effects on the fluid flow when the pressure gradient is relatively low in contrast the rheological parameters m τ 0 highly control the magnitude of the flow nonlinearity in particular at the low pressure gradient additionally only considering the electroviscous effects of the newtonian fluid cannot produce the nonlinear regime credit authorship contribution statement zhilin cheng conceptualization methodology software writing original draft zhengfu ning supervision resources sheng

5168,this paper aims to interpret the low velocity nonlinear flow occurring in low permeability reservoirs based on the theories of electrokinetic transport and non newtonian rheology of fluids to achieve this end we simulate the steady state electroviscous flow of bingham papanastasiou bp fluids in circular microtubes by simultaneously solving the poisson boltzmann and the modified navier stokes equations the induced electrical field strength e s velocity profiles and the transport capacity of the non newtonian fluid under the effects of various factors such as capillary radius r zeta potential ζ yield stress τ 0 and stress growth index m were examined the results show that the generated e s of the bp fluid is highly affected by the fluid rheology which is quite different from that of the newtonian liquid the velocity profiles become lower and flatter as m or τ 0 increases and this is more remarkable in smaller microtubes the apparent viscosity of non newtonian fluid declines monotonically with increasing c yet non monotonically with r m τ 0 and ζ in addition the low velocity nonlinear flow in microtubes can be successfully captured when considering the electrokinetic flow of the non newtonian fluid rheology while for the newtonian fluid only involving the electroviscous effect fails to generate the nonlinear flow behavior the contributions of electrokinetic parameters versus rheological properties to the degree of flow nonlinearity are also discussed the impact of electrokinetic parameters ζ c on the flow characteristics is significant at high pressure gradients and becomes trivial when the pressure gradient is relatively low in contrast the fluid rheological parameters m τ 0 greatly determine the magnitude of the flow nonlinearity occurring at the low pressure gradients in sum the electroviscous flow of bp fluids in microchannels provides a possible explanation of the low velocity non darcy flow in porous media keywords non newtonian electroviscous flow microtubes low velocity nonlinear flow 1 introduction fluid flow in porous media is often described by darcy s law which characterizes a linear correlation between flow velocity and the pressure gradient bear 2013 kumar et al 2020 however numerous studies soni et al 1978 coles and hartman 1998 dejam et al 2017 diwu et al 2018 have shown that the darcy velocity in both saturated and unsaturated flows exhibits nonlinear dependence on the pressure gradient in low permeability porous media at low pressure gradients as illustrated in fig 1 a this nonlinear behavior may result from strong liquid solid interactions in a thin layer close to the solid surface due to the combined effects of various interfacial forces whether these forces require a threshold pressure gradient tpg to initiate the flow is still debatable wei et al 2009 wang and sheng 2017 the direct measurement of the tpg is often not practical since the flow rate in low permeable media is always too low to be accurately determined in fact the tpg value is generally obtained by fitting experimental data with considerable uncertainties nevertheless whether the tpg exists remains unanswered to date while the low velocity non darcian flow in low permeability porous media is widely recognized liu et al 2012 to characterize the nonlinear flow in porous media extensive experiments have been conducted using fluids like tap water deionized water or various formation liquids these experimental data allow establishing correlations to describe the nonlinear feature of the flow in porous samples prada and civan 1999 hao et al 2008 zeng et al 2011 an earlier work by miller and low 1963 observed the tpg as a result of water clay interaction when water flows through different clayey specimens prada and civan 1999 performed a series of brine flow tests through sandstones and sandpack samples and proposed a modified darcy s law that the flow velocity is proportional to a power relation of the pressure gradient additionally zeng et al 2011 measured the velocity gradient curves for various types of fluids flowing through ultra low permeability rocks and obtained empirical relations between the tpg and sample permeability recently by critically reviewing the current advances and discussing the nonlinear flow mechanisms wang and sheng 2017 used the boundary layer theory huang et al 2013 including the boundary and bulk fluid shown in fig 2 of their work to describe the nonlinear flow mechanism however a universal mechanism responsible for the nonlinear seepage phenomenon in reservoirs remains elusive an enhanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear flow in tight porous media is of great societal and economic interests in the context of the exploration of unconventional reservoirs such as shale gas and tight oil fluid flow in such tight porous media is typically subjected to low pressure gradients and exhibits strong non darcian behavior diwu et al 2018 this non darcy flow highly affects the well production and the injection operation in tight reservoirs chen et al 2017 therefore to uncover the underlying mechanics of non darcian behaviors of fluids becomes crucial to the successful development of unconventional resources however such reservoir rocks mainly contain micro and nano scale pores loucks et al 2009 zhao et al 2015 cheng et al 2019 which precludes the accuracy of conventional core flooding experiments as mentioned above on the other hand the rapid development of microelectromechanical technology provides an alternative approach to study the diverse physical phenomena such as microfluidic mixing kirby 2010 heat transfer ayoubloo et al 2019 ghalambaz et al 2019 shashikumar et al 2019 and fluid flow at the microscale li 2004 masliyah and bhattacharjee 2006 for instance authors wang et al 2009 yang et al 2011 wu et al 2017a b have performed flow experiments using micro fluidic channels to study the novel features of micro scale flow it has been shown that the observed nonlinear flow at low pressure gradient can be explained by the boundary layer theory assuming the adsorption of polarized water molecules on hydrophilic solid surfaces and the thickness of the boundary layer decreases with increased pressure gradient until a certain thickness cannot be reduced any further even at a higher pressure gradient wu et al 2017a the impact of surface dominated forces in microfluidics originating from the liquid wall interaction on the flow becomes indispensable when the flow channels are at the micro and nano scales brutin and tadrist 2003 one of the surface dominated forces arises from the electrical double layer edl effect hunter 1981 li 2004 edl is essentially a physical structure that spontaneously appears on a solid surface when it is in contact with an electrolyte solution an electrical potential difference at the solid liquid interface leads to the rearrangement of ions within the edl in the presence of an external pressure gradient the solution transport in microfluidics can be greatly influenced by the electroviscous effect in many cases hunter 1981 the primary mechanism of the electroviscous flow is illustrated in fig 1b when an aqueous solution flows through a micro channel driven only by a pressure difference the counterions in the diffuse layer are carried toward the outlet end resulting in the formation of streaming potential along the flow direction subsequently the flow induced streaming potential drives the counterions to move against the liquid flow direction meanwhile the moving counterions in the diffuse layer will drag the liquid molecules to migrate the net effect results in an increase in the fluid viscosity and thus the reduction in the flow rate through a micro channel i e so called the electroviscosity effect wang et al 2006 the impact of generated streaming potential on the flow of formation fluids i e electrolyte solutions through low permeable rocks cannot be arbitrarily neglected bear 2013 donaldson and alam 2013 zhang et al 2015 studied the electrokinetic flow of a newtonian fluid in a capillary tube with periodically varying cross sections and concluded that the electroviscous effects cannot account for the observed nonlinear flow in tight porous media besides we recently examined the flow characteristics of solutions in hydrophilic nanopores considering the electroviscous effects and the enhanced viscosity near the charged wall yet the nonlinear fluid flow was not found cheng et al 2020 additionally the formation liquids generally carry mineral particles and may become non newtonian liquids due to clay water interactions swartzendruber 1962a swartzendruber 1962b liu et al 2012 such fluids have also been considered as bingham fluids in numerical studies jiang et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 published experimental studies also show that clay water suspensions can behave as non newtonian bingham fluids with yield stress rand and melton 1977 torrance 1999 amorós et al 2010 further it has been stated that the nonlinear flow is likely to take place in any surface active porous medium and the non newtonian behavior can be a possible cause of the non darcy flow swartzendruber 1962a b which has not yet been validated based on the above discussion we here consider the formation liquids as the bingham fluids and investigate whether the nonlinear flow found in published experiments can be interpreted by the combined effects of the electrokinetic flow and the non newtonian rheology recently based on the debye huckel linearization theory kirby 2010 a closed form model of the electrokinetic flow of bingham plastic fluid zhang et al 2019 has been proposed to account for the nonlinear flow mechanism in circular pores however it cannot consider the impacts of high zeta potential at the solid wall due to the linearization simplification this study aims to investigate the electroviscous flow in a micro sized capillary tube using a continuous bingham papanastasiou bp fluid papanastasiou 1987 this non newtonian fluid model is chosen to avoid the inherent attribute of discontinuity in the ideal bingham plastic model mitsoulis 2007 after detailed descriptions of the model and model validation we investigate the impacts of fluid rheological properties and electrokinetic parameters on the electrokinetic flow characteristics the results help shed light on the understanding of low velocity nonlinear flow of formation fluids in tight media 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations the fluid viscosity η is a constant for newtonian fluids but a shear dependent variable for non newtonian fluids for the bp fluid η is defined by papanastasiou 1987 1 η τ γ η 0 τ 0 γ 1 exp m γ where η 0 is the plastic viscosity m is the stress growth index that controls the strength of the increasing stress τ 0 denotes the yield stress and τ is the shear stress corresponding to a specific shear rate additionally the shear rate tensor γ is expressed as bird et al 1987 2 γ 2 s s where s is calculated by 3 s u u t 2 in which u is the fluid velocity fig 2 illustrates the rheological behavior of bp fluids with various m values the results are presented in dimensionless shear stress τ τ 0 with increasing shear rate γ an important feature of the bp fluids is that they have a finite stress level at small shear rates unlike the ideal bingham model in which a solid like structure is formed as τ τ 0 furthermore the newtonian fluid is recovered when m approaches 0 or τ 0 0 in the limit of m eq 1 is reduced to the classical bingham plastic model mitsoulis 2007 this study considers the steady state laminar flow of a binary electrolyte i e an incompressible non newtonian fluid with viscosity η flowing through a cylindrical microtube with radius r subjected to a pressure gradient pz the flow velocity u can be characterized by the modified navier stokes n s equation 4 d 2 u d r 2 1 r du dr p z η e s η ρ e where es and ρ e are induced electric field strength and charge density respectively the electrical potential distribution of the solution in a capillary tube is governed by the poisson equation hunter 1981 5 d 2 ψ d r 2 1 r d ψ dr ρ e ε 0 ε r where ψ is the electrostatic potential ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity and εr is the relative permittivity of the fluid the charge density ρe can be determined by 6 ρ e i e z i n i where e is the elementary charge zi and ni denote the valence and the number concentration of the ith species when the advection of ions is neglected by combining the assumption of electro neutrality far away from the walls ni can be given by 7 n i n i exp z i e ψ k b t where ni is the bulk ionic concentration of the ith species kb is the boltzmann constant and t is the environment temperature summarizing eqs 5 7 then leads to the poisson boltzmann pb equation 8 d 2 ψ d r 2 1 r d ψ dr 2 n z e ε 0 ε r sinh z e ψ k b t note that es in eq 4 is determined with the net electrical current being zero in the steady state which means 9 i i c i s 0 where i ic and is are the net electrical current the conduction current and the streaming potential respectively hence es can be given by rice and whitehead 1965 10 e s 2 π 0 r ρ e u r r d r λ eff a c where r is the capillary tube radius ac is the cross sectional area of the microtube and λeff is the effective electric conductivity of the liquid that can be analytically determined by ban et al 2010 11 λ eff 2 π 0 r λ r d r a c where the electric conductivity λ can be expressed as lu et al 2004 ban et al 2010 12 λ z i 2 e 2 d i n i k b t where di is the diffusion constant of the ith species as such the distributions of electrical potential and charge density can be calculated using the pb model and the velocity profile in a microtube is obtained through the modified n s equation eq 4 2 2 the numerical model and model validation to reduce the computational cost of solving the pb and the modified n s equations a two dimensional axisymmetric model is used in the simulations the model fig 3 shows a capillary tube with a radius r a solid wall bc boundary with zeta potential ζ and a pressure difference between the inlet p in ab boundary and outlet p out cd boundary of the capillary tube no slip boundary condition u 0 is assumed at the solid wall bc boundary given that the coupled model incorporating the pb and the modified n s equations are highly nonlinear the comsol package based on the finite element method is employed to numerically solve these equations multiphysics 2012 since no analytical solution to the electrokinetic transport of the bp fluid in a capillary tube exists the validation of the numerical model in this study is confirmed by simulating the electrokinetic flow of a newtonian fluid a 1 1 electrolyte solution in a capillary tube and comparing to its approximate analytical solution regarding eq 8 the term sinh z e ψ k b t can be approximately written as z e ψ k b t when the zeta potential of the charged wall is low z e ψ k b t 1 namely the debye huckel approximation kirby 2010 hence the pb equation is linearized as 13 d 2 ψ d r 2 1 r d ψ dr 2 n z 2 e 2 ε 0 ε r k b t ψ κ 2 ψ where κ 2 n z 2 e 2 ε 0 ε r k b t represents the reciprocal of the debye length which is the nominal thickness of the edl as such κr the ratio of the microtube radius over the edl thickness indicates the relative intensity of the electrokinetic effects combing eq 5 and 13 the edl electrical potential and the velocity profile within the microtube can be analytically determined

the zero order and first order modified bessel function respectively besides two coefficients are expressed as ω ε ψ 0 η and β ω 2 η κ 2 λ s the following parameter values are assumed for the comparison of analytical and numerical results the electric conductivity λ is taken as a constant 8 10 8 s m and the ionic molar concentration c is 10 6 mol l note that the correlation between n and c is n c na where na is the avogadro constant the density viscosity and relative permittivity of the solution are taken as 1000 kg m3 1 mpa s and 80 respectively the temperature is 298 15 k and the pressure gradient imposed is 1 mpa m fig 4 shows the distribution of electrical potential and the velocity profile using the simulation and the analytical solution the numerical results perfectly agree with that of the debye huckel theory when ζ 20 mv fig 4a however as expected the numerical pb solution gradually departs from the debye huckel prediction when ζ 60 and 100 mv because the debye huckel approximation is only valid under low ζ as for the velocity profiles fig 4b numerical results are lower than that from the hagen poiseuille hp velocity for all ζ values highlighting the electroviscous effect on retarding the fluid flow in microtubes at ζ 20 mv the velocity profile by the pb model is in good agreement with that of the debye huckel method however the differences between the analytical and the simulation results increase with increasing ζ values and the debye huckel approach underestimates the fluid velocity thus the numerical solution of the coupled pb and modified n s equations can not only provide validated results but also capture the electroviscous effect particularly at high zeta potential of the solid wall 3 numerical results the transport characteristics of the bp fluid through a microtube are investigated considering the surface zeta potential ζ the ionic molar concentration c the fluid stress growth index m and the fluid yield stress τ 0 the characteristics of the newtonian fluid flowing through the microtube are also presented as a comparison the following simulations assume a potassium chloride kcl solution which is a common component of the formation fluid in tight reservoirs all other parameters used in the simulations including temperature the pressure gradient and viscosities are listed in table 1 note that the plastic viscosity also represents the viscosity of the newtonian liquid 3 1 induced electrical potential the manifested electroviscous effect on fluid flow through a microtube is caused by the movement of counterions within the edl against the pressure gradient the induced electrokinetic resistance is largely associated with the strength of the generated streaming potential thus we here consider the influence of the yield stress τ 0 on the induced electrical field strength e s a bp fluid can be reduced to the newtonian fluid when the yield stress τ 0 0 see eq 1 as such both newtonian and non newtonian fluids show an identical electrical strength when fluid yield stress τ 0 0 fig 5 the newtonian fluid always holds a constant electrical strength e s and is larger than that of the bp fluid regardless of the changing yield stress this is because the bp fluid has a higher viscosity than the newtonian fluid causing a reduction in the flow velocity the mobility of the electrical charge and thus the induced electrical field strength in other words the bp fluid can lower the streaming potential zhang et al 2019 additionally as the fluid yield stress τ 0 increases the flow velocity also decreases due to increased viscous resistance and thus the induced electrical field e s as shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5c and 5d the induced electrical field e s in a microtube with radius r 10 μm does not show an evident difference as the fluid stress growth index m varies from 0 1 to 1000 s this is mainly because the shear stress of the bp fluid is less dependent on a certain range of shear rate see also fig 2 so that the difference in viscosity becomes negligible when m 0 1 s the induced electrical field e s generally decreases and departs from that of the newtonian fluid as the m value increases the decreasing trend in e s with increasing m values is also affected by the fluid yield stress τ 0 particularly when m 0 1 s this phenomenon is more pronounced in smaller microtubes such as in a 3 μm radius microtube shown in fig 5a and 5c when the fluid yield stress is high say τ 0 1 4 pa the flow velocity is relatively low resulting in a weak electrical field e s while in a r 10 μm microtube the induced electrical field is still relatively high compared to that in the r 3 μm microtube at a high fluid yield stress τ 0 2 pa this is attributed to the higher fluid velocity within the r 10 μm microtube furthermore it is also found that although a larger zeta potential corresponds to a larger net charge density the induced e s in this scenario is lower this finding is similar to the study of jamaati et al 2010 in which a decrease in e s with increasing zeta potential is observed when the zeta potential is higher than a critical value this reflects that the electric field e s is determined by multiple factors according to eq 10 and higher charge density ρe may be counteracted by higher electrical conductivity λeff of the liquid 3 2 velocity profiles fig 6 presents the velocity profiles of non newtonian fluids through microtubes with the consideration of the electrokinetic effect the velocity results are presented in a dimensionless form i e divided by the average bulk velocity ū hp note also that the results for the cases of m 10 s and 1000 s are not shown as they almost overlap with that of the m 0 1 s case as discussed previously in section 3 1 the results show that the newtonian fluid has higher velocities at all radial positions within the capillary tube than that of the non newtonian fluids even though the newtonian fluid has higher electrokinetic resistance as shown in fig 5 this is mainly due to the high viscosity of the bp fluids that outweighs the electroviscous effects additionally as the zeta potential of the wall shifts from 50 mv to 200 mv there is a slight decrease in the velocity due to increased electrokinetic resistance as such the shear rate of the fluid decreases when the yield stress increases particularly near the central region of the capillary tube this leads to flatter velocity profiles of the non newtonian fluids i e no longer parabola profiles fig 6c such velocity profiles can also be found in the published numerical study tang et al 2011 the calculated velocity profiles in the 10 μm microtubes fig 6b 6d and 6f follow a similar pattern as those of the 3 μm microtubes fig 6a 6c and 6e however the latter has more pronounced electroviscous effects and bingham behaviors of fluids the more pronounced electroviscous effect in the 3 μm microtubes is attributed to the thicker edl compared to that in the 10 μm microtubes furthermore the velocity declines more rapidly as the yield stress increases in the 3 μm microtube compared to the 10 μm microtube for instance the maximum dimensionless velocity is only 0 02 when τ 0 1 6 pa and m 0 1 s in the 3 μm microtube indicating enormous flow resistance resulted from the bingham rheology this result further supports the above observation that very low fluid velocity cannot lead to significant streaming potential fig 5a and b 4 analyses and discussion 4 1 apparent viscosity the apparent viscosity of the fluid flow in the microtubes η app is calculated to quantitatively evaluate the strength of the flow resistance induced by the electrokinetic effect the results are presented in dimensionless η app η i e divided by the viscosity of the non newtonian fluid η note that at a constant pressure gradient η app η essentially reflects u non eve u eve where u non eve and u eve are the averaged flow velocity in a microtube without and with the consideration of the electroviscous forces respectively note that the averaged flow velocity also inherently captures the flux in the microtube fig 7 a depicts the effects of the capillary radius on η app η for both the newtonian and the bp liquids with different m values for non newtonian fluids η app η is used for reflecting the effect of streaming potential on fluid flow hence it is always larger than unity the results show that η app η varies non monotonically with the microtube size for instance with the increase in the tube size η app η first experiences a rapid increase followed by a gradual decrease when m 0 1 s overall the electrokinetic effect in the non newtonian fluid is sensitive to the value of m and the resulted viscosity can be higher or lower than that of the newtonian fluid the total flow resistance in a microtube is mainly caused by the viscous drag and the electroviscous force within the edl subjected to a certain pressure gradient the fluid with m 0 01 s or 0 1 s has a relatively low shear rate in a small sized microtube e g r 3 μm that leads to a high viscosity in the microtube in these situations the flow resistance is dominated by the viscous forces leading to a lower η app η value with the increase in the microtube size the electroviscous contribution to the flow resistance will be enhanced due to increased flow shear rate followed by a gradual decrease due to reduced edl thickness compared to the tube size and eventually approaches to one as shown in fig 7a plus the difference in η app η among different m values diminishes as r 15 μm this result may be because the viscosity of the non newtonian fluid is independent of the m value under a certain range of shear rates refer to fig 2 therefore it can be concluded that the variation in η app η with the values of microtube radius and m is not monotonous and η app η has a local maximum at a certain capillary radius which is strongly related to the rheological properties of the fluids furthermore the relationship between η app η and the yield stress of the fluid is presented in fig 7b the newtonian liquid has a constant η app η regardless of τ 0 as expected when m 0 001 s the dimensionless apparent viscosity η app η of the liquid decreases almost linearly and would be close to unity with the yield stress and the difference in η app η between the non newtonian and the newtonian fluids becomes larger as τ 0 increases likewise reducing the m value would reduce the difference in η app η between the two fluids see the case of m 0 0001 s in fig 7b however the effect of τ 0 on the η app η of non newtonian fluids is non monotonic when m 0 001 s and there exists a critical τ 0 that resulting in the largest η app η it is also revealed that the m value has a non monotonic influence on η app η the η app η versus τ 0 trends are different at different m values this is mainly because the increase in η outweighs the electrokinetic resistance at small m values i e m 0 0001 and 0 00001 s herein and a greater electrokinetic contribution to the increases fluid viscosity at larger m values i e m 0 01 and 0 1 s however the very low flow rate will make the electroviscous effect negligible at a larger τ 0 specifically at m 0 1 s and τ 0 2 7 pa the electroviscous effect becomes subtle mainly due to the very low shear rate in the flow the viscous and electroviscous forces accounting for the proportions of the total flow resistance changes as τ 0 increases and the magnitude of the electrokinetic effects is notably dependent on the fluid rheology fig 7c shows the impact of zeta potential ζ on the electroviscous flow of newtonian and non newtonian fluids the apparent viscosity of the newtonian fluid η app η exhibits a non monotonic behavior with increasing ζ this result is qualitatively consistent with previous studies jamaati et al 2010 jing et al 2017 the most remarkable electroviscous effect occurs when m 0 01 s additionally the dependence of η app η on the zeta potential for three cases of non newtonian fluids is also non monotonic also η app η varies non monotonically with the m value in some instances fig 7a the role of the solution concentration c in fluid transport in microtubes is investigated as illustrated in fig 7d a higher m value results in a larger η app η in addition the η app η monotonically decreases with increasing ionic molar concentration c which reduces the edl thickness and thus the electroviscous resistance of fluids there are numerical studies masliyah and bhattacharjee 2006 wang et al 2006 showing the non monotonic dependence of η app η on the solution concentration while bharti et al 2008 and bharti et al 2009 did not observe a local maximum of η app η as presented in this study this inconsistency is likely related to the differences in the boundary conditions i e a constant ζ versus a constant surface charge density or the calculation of the electrical conductivity of the solution in the work of wang et al 2006 λeff was set as a constant however as for the electroviscous flow the electric conductivity of an electrolyte is a key parameter to determine the streaming potential it is a function of the ion type ion concentration and zeta potential thus using a fixed λeff in the simulation may not be appropriate here following ban et al 2010 λeff is determined by using eq 12 which captures the influences of these factors and is also in line with the calculation method of λeff adopted in bharti et al 2008 and bharti et al 2009 4 2 nonlinear flow characteristics fig 8 shows the fluid velocity versus pressure gradient relationship ū p z under various influencing factors the results exhibit the nonlinear characteristics of the flow in microtubes that are successfully captured by considering the bp non newtonian fluid and the electrokinetic effect fig 8a and b show that the ū pz curves nearly coincided indicating the marginal effects of the zeta potential ζ and the ionic molar concentration c particularly when the pressure gradient is low the difference in the ū p z relation becomes more notable at higher pressure gradients the total flow resistance is dominated by the viscous force at low pressure gradients and by the electroviscous force at high pressure gradients this implies that the electrokinetic parameters ζ c have more evident impacts on the electroviscous flow in microtubes at a relatively high pressure gradient as shown in fig 8c and d the rheological parameters m τ 0 have more pronounced impacts on the nonlinearity of the fluid flow i e more concaved ū p z curves at m 0 01 and 0 1 s the fluid velocity at a pressure gradient smaller than 0 5 mpa m is very low as if there exists a threshold pressure gradient fig 8c such flow rates are too low to be accurately measured in a conventional laboratory setting while at m 0 001 s the nonlinear behavior is not remarkable furthermore all the ū p z relations will collapse into a single trend for various m values at high pressure gradients since the role of the m value in determining the fluid rheology becomes insignificant in this situation three curves are nearly parallel to each other also it is again found that for newtonian fluids considering the electroviscous effects alone cannot result in the nonlinearity in the ū p z relation moreover a larger yield stress τ 0 of the fluid leads to a stronger nonlinearity of flow and a lower flow rate fig 8d therefore the results highlight the dominant role of the electrokinetic parameters ζ c at high pressure gradients and the fluid rheological parameters m τ 0 at low pressure gradients on the flow in microtubes 4 3 extension to natural tight formations unconventional resources such as shale gas and tight oil are always stored in ultra low permeable reservoirs with abundant nano to micro pores to understand the unique seepage mechanisms in low permeable reservoirs laboratory tests generally focus on the single phase flow through rock samples as described in the introduction admittedly using the kcl solution representing the formation fluids is a simplification in this study as the formation fluids usually involve oil water and or gases and the compositions of the formation water are complex however given that formation liquids commonly have certain salt concentrations the resulted electroviscous effects on fluid flow need to be seriously considered keep in mind that the edl does not overlap in all microscale flow simulations in this investigation and thus the pb model is still adequate to characterize the distributions of ions and electrical potential furthermore as described in the introduction the fluid rheology may have been altered to be non newtonian fluid with yield stress due to charged particles and the complex interaction between liquid and the mineral surface a recent analytical study investigated the electroviscous flow of a bingham plastic fluid in microsized circular tubes zhang et al 2019 in which the fluid flow occurs only after exceeding the tpg and followed by a linear flow they also stated that such a generated nonlinear flow behavior coincided with the experimental results for deionized water flowing in silica microtubes yang et al 2011 zhu et al 2014 in fact whether the tpg exists is controversial according to the viewpoint in the literature wang and sheng 2017 tpg is generally obtained by fitting the measured ū pz curve and the hydrocarbon migration during the reservoir forming process cannot happen if there is a tpg the utilization of the bp model in our study generates a continuously nonlinear flow in microtubes without involving the conception of tpg moreover the results in this article indicate that the electroviscous flow of the newtonian fluid in microtubes shows the linear feature implying that experiments of deionized water flow in microtubes are probably not ideal for unraveling the mechanism of nonlinear flow in porous materials the possible reason is that the surface characteristic of microtubes used in testing cannot represent that of reservoir minerals the gained new insights can have potential applications for practical reservoir engineering for instance the fluids used for permeability measurement in rock samples can be collected for further rheology tests the viscosity shear rate results can be fitted by the bp model to acquire rheological parameters for reservoir simulators in terms of the electrokinetic effect its significance can be evaluated by the ratio of the edl thickness over the characteristic length of the porous rock or soil which is associated with its permeability the dimensionless apparent viscosity determined in section 4 1 shows that the electroviscous effect is not quite notable in micropores but it could become potentially more significant electroviscous effect in nanopores in this case a more general poisson nernst planck model may be required to characterize the electrokinetic transport because of the overlapped edl zhang and wang 2015 additionally the slip boundary condition should also be considered jing et al 2017 hajmohammadi et al 2018 which depends on the solid liquid interaction and is out of our subject here using the micro flux measuring instrument xue wu et al 2011 acquired the apparent permeability of sandstone cores under different pressure gradients and observed the low velocity non darcy behavior based on the assumption that the core can be simplified by the capillary bundle model bear 2013 we replot the velocity gradient curves of two samples shown in fig 9 the curves are fitted using the non newtonian model adopted in this work all relevant experimental and fitting parameters are listed in table 2 the fitting results are in good accord with the experimental data indicating the nonlinear flow can be generated through the combination of non newtonian rheology and electroviscous effect which may be a possible mechanism responsible for the low velocity non darcy flow of fluids in low permeable formations in sum the insights gained from this paper can enhance current reservoir simulators and provide theoretical foundations to broader fields such as the design of microfluidic devices soil hydrology engineering and geophysical applications 5 conclusions in this study the electrokinetic transport of bp non newtonian fluids through circular microtubes was systematically studied using the coupled pb and n s equations the effects of various electrokinetic and rheological properties on the induced electrical field strength velocity profile and transport capacity of the non newtonian fluid flow in microtubes were examined furthermore the characteristics of the nonlinear flow of fluids in microchanels were analyzed as well the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the induced electrical strength e s is collectively determined by various parameters such as the fluid velocity the electric conductivity and charge density within edl under the same condition e s for the non newtonian fluid is lower since it has a higher viscosity than the newtonian liquid in addition e s will monotonously decrease as τ 0 increases and can almost be ignored especially for the microtube with a small radius besides due to the fluid rheology of the bp model e s is not sensitive to the variation of m when m 0 1 s while decreasing m would enable e s to be closer to that for the newtonian fluid when m 0 1 s as such at a fixed pressure gradient a larger capillary will result in a higher e s 2 the velocity profiles of non newtonian fluids will become lower and flatter when τ 0 or m increases and a region having a higher viscosity would occur near the microtube center this phenomenon is more pronounced for the small capillary in addition the influences of the capillary size r zeta potential ζ stress growth index m and yield stress τ 0 on η app η for both of the newtonian and bp fluids are not monotonous and there is a critical value that leads to the largest η app η for each case while η app η gradually decreases with the increasing ion concentration c due to the thinner edl 3 with consideration of the non newtonian fluid rheology and electroviscous effects the low velocity nonlinear flow in microtubes is successfully captured the electrokinetic parameters ζ c only affect the flow characteristic of fluids at the high pressure gradient but have negligible effects on the fluid flow when the pressure gradient is relatively low in contrast the rheological parameters m τ 0 highly control the magnitude of the flow nonlinearity in particular at the low pressure gradient additionally only considering the electroviscous effects of the newtonian fluid cannot produce the nonlinear regime credit authorship contribution statement zhilin cheng conceptualization methodology software writing original draft zhengfu ning supervision resources sheng

5169,the main purpose of this work is to evaluate diffuse groundwater recharge and its temporal dynamics at sites with different landscapes and soil profiles under observed and projected climate variability three typical sites with different landscapes and topsoil profiles were chosen for the field study field work consisted of pit development and soil sample collection for laboratory study using the centrifuge method soil hydraulic parameters were obtained by the retc code using the observed values of volumetric water content vs pressure head hydrus 1d code was used to estimate groundwater recharge based on a 70 year 1945 2015 meteorological dataset with daily resolution including values of precipitation air temperature wind speed and humidity this dataset was preprocessed using our surfbal code to calculate the surface and topsoil water and energy balance retrospective historical simulation results showed that there was a considerable variation in the mean annual groundwater recharge values 49 104 mm year for the three studied profiles the temporal change in groundwater recharge occurred relatively synchronously at all sites and was governed by the change in the current annual aridity index the results of this historical simulation did not reveal any traces of climate change in the groundwater recharge of the studied region in the last 30 40 years to predict the recharge variations in the second half of the 21st century the larswg forecast weather generator with the climate projections of the 5th general circulation models gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 family was used on average in the case of climate development under the maximum greenhouse gas emissions rcp8 5 scenario there will be a reduction in groundwater recharge in the studied region in 2060 2080 caused by two factors change of aridity index which determines evapotranspiration during a warm season and the accumulation of snow and subsequent meltwater infiltration during the snowmelt periods keywords recharge black soil climate change historical simulation projected simulation general circulation models 1 introduction diffuse recharge due to the infiltration of precipitation p through the unsaturated zone towards the groundwater table plays an important role in the formation of the water resources of shallow aquifers and the transport of near surface contaminants to the groundwater meixner et al 2016 many applications of soil and water environmental management require the knowledge of recharge from point to watershed scales thus assessing the recharge rate at different temporal and spatial scales is one of the most challenging issues in groundwater hydrology generally the magnitudes of groundwater recharge are relatively low and difficult to measure directly therefore instead of direct measurements field investigations such as tracers and geophysics are often applied for estimating groundwater recharge at different spatial scales in addition one of the most promising methods for estimating recharge is the simulation of the water balance in the unsaturated zone above the groundwater table doble and crosbie 2017 keese et al 2005 such simulations make it possible to establish the relationships among groundwater recharge and p and potential evapotranspiration pet vegetation local topography the properties of surface soils and groundwater depth for site specific conditions for recharge simulation the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2009 is commonly used the methodology of the application of hydrus 1d for recharge estimation is summarized in šimůnek 2015 examples of evaluations of the near surface water balance and estimations of groundwater recharge for specific soil vegetation and climatic conditions with hydrus 1d can be found in adane et al 2019 de silva 2015 leterme et al 2012 lu et al 2011 wang et al 2009 and others the interaction between surface and shallow groundwater in boreal regions with winter snow cover is determined by the seasonality of groundwater recharge the typical seasonal recharge patterns are associated with seasonal predominantly spring infiltration of meltwater ireson et al 2013 for recharge simulation in a boreal climate with the essential effects of snow accumulation and melting topsoil freezing and refreezing on the near surface water balance a supplement to hydrus 1 d code named surfbal has been developed grinevskiy and pozdniakov 2013 2017 this code allows the generation of atmospheric boundary conditions for hydrus 1d on the top of soil considering the physical processes of surface p transformation including snow accumulation and melting surface evapotranspiration and topsoil freezing pozdniakov et al 2019 thus the use of the two codes together allows the consideration of important processes of hydrology that affect runoff generation and the infiltration of meltwater current and potential climate change and its impact on groundwater resources are now being widely discussed see for example crosbie et al 2013 gunduz and simsek 2011 kumar 2012 leterme et al 2012 grinevskiy and pozdniakov 2017 adane et al 2019 herrmannet al 2016 one of the methods to assess the future influence of climate change on groundwater resources is to simulate recharge by using meteorological data from past decades and data from the downscaling of climatic projections semenov and stratonovitch 2015 for the studied region the goal of this work is to study the relationship between historical and predicted future climatic phenomena and groundwater recharge of the regional aquifer in the voronezh region southwest european part of russia this region is the area of the development of classical black soil chernozems of eastern europe thus the objectives of the present research are 1 estimation of groundwater recharge by surfbal hydrus 1d simulation with different landscapes and soil profile characteristics 2 correlation of groundwater recharge temporal dynamics with observed climate variability and 3 projections of groundwater recharge using downscaling data from selected coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 models 2 study area the study area is located to the south of voronezh city on the left bank of the don river this region is in the central part of the black soil chernozem belt of the european part of russia fig 1 black soils in the voronezh region have been studied since the end of the 19th century starting with the works of the soil scientist vasily dokuchayev moon 2005 geomorphologically the area represents a slightly hilly plain with gentle landforms the shallow subsurface deposits are alluvial fluvioglacial and moraine formations the typical natural landscape in this territory is steppes with small forests that are located in river valleys the prevailing type of topsoil is ordinary chernozems with thicknesses up to 2 m in addition sandy soils can be found on river terraces and fluvioglacial formations pozdniakov et al 2015 the climate in the study area is characterized by hot and dry summers and moderately cold winters with steady snow cover and well expressed transitional seasons to characterize the meteorological conditions of the study area and to simulate the transformation of p a 70 year continuous series from 1945 to 2015 of meteorological data from the nearest voronezh meteorological station was collected the absolute minimum air temperature reaches 36 c the absolute maximum is 40 c the average annual temperature for this period was 6 5 c with a visible increasing trend from the middle of the 20th century fig 2 the annual p varies from year to year between 330 and 840 mm averaging 560 mm over the last 70 years there is no observed temporal trend of annual p amounts fig 2 in the last 70 years the estimated annual prisley taylor pet varies from year to year from 570 to 810 mm with an average of 720 mm the calculated annual aridity index p pet for the observed period varied from 0 44 to 1 45 with an average of 0 77 seasonal soil freezing changes from year to year from 15 to 100 cm the winter maximum snow water equivalent swe varies from 15 to 200 mm with an average value of approximately 80 mm pozdniakov et al 2015 the regional confined unconfined neogene quaternary aquifer is widespread in the investigated region muromets et al 2018 this aquifer is composed of alluvial sediments of the don river palaeo valley represented mainly by sand and gravels groundwater resources of the aquifer are formed by diffuse recharge through the infiltration of p and melted snow in spring the groundwater of the neogene quaternary aquifer discharges to the regional drainage system the don river and its tributary the hvorostan river fig 1 measurements of the summer low flow periods of 2014 2018 in the hvorostan river showed that the groundwater discharge into this river varied from 13 to 29 mm per year muromets et al 2018 this aquifer is widely used for drinking water supply by domestic wells 3 field investigations and lab studies 3 1 soil sampling to study the spatial temporal variation in recharge three typical sites with different representative natural landscapes and soil profiles were selected for water budget simulation within the study area fig 1 site a is located in a pine forest and topsoil is represented by sandy chernozem on fine sand site b and site c are located in the natural grassland steppe with sandy soil on loamy sand and medium sand and chernozem on silt loam respectively at these sites open pits were made for the sampling of the topsoil profile the first pit was made to a depth of 1 25 m the second pit was made to a depth of 1 05 m and the third pit was made to a depth of 0 8 m the vadose zone profiles of the investigated sites are presented in table 1 and fig 3 three soil samples of undisturbed soils were collected from each pit one sample from each layer soil samples were collected with a cutting ring to avoid disturbing the natural compositions of the soils 3 2 assessment of the unsaturated zone hydraulic parameters the hydraulic parameters of soils for unsaturated flow simulation were obtained during the laboratory study of collected samples the main hydrophysical characteristics water retention curve and dependence of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity from volumetric water content k θ were obtained by a centrifuge method smagin et al 1998 initially the soil samples were fully saturated and placed in containers on the rotor of the laboratory centrifuge samples were rotated at high speed up to 9800 rpm which corresponds to a suction pressure of 11 bar during rotation the samples lost part of the water which was withdrawn by drainage to the lower parts of the containers each rotation speed of the rotor corresponded to a certain value of the suction pressure the samples were rotated at speeds from 300 rpm corresponding to a suction pressure of 0 02 bar to 9800 rpm corresponding to a suction pressure of 11 bar the samples were rotated at 300 rpm for 10 min and at 9800 rpm for 1 5 h in total the samples were rotated at 14 speeds the hydraulic conductivity of each sample at a certain moisture content was obtained by sample rotation at the same speed for different times and measurements of the kinetics of volumetric moisture content loss smagin et al 1998 for fitting experimental data we used the van genuchten 1980 equation for water retention and the mualem model mualem 1976 for unsaturated conductivity in the form 1 s h θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m for h 0 1 for h 0 k θ s k s l 1 1 s 1 m m 2 m 1 n 1 l 2 m where h pressure head k hydraulic conductivity of the saturated medium θ h moisture content for the given pressure head θ s moisture content for full saturation θ r residual moisture content s saturation of the pore space by drainable water kθ s unsaturated hydraulic conductivity α and n van genuchten fitted parameters and l mualem parameter that accounts for pore connectivity and tortuosity the value of θ s for each sample was assumed to be equal to its porosity which was determined by the laboratory method van genuchten parameters θ r α n l and hydraulic conductivity k were estimated by the retc code van genuchten et al 1991 using experimentally obtained water retention curves and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities for different moisture contents together many publications following mualem 1976 use a fixed value of l 1 2 however using the constant parameter l 1 2 we failed to achieve satisfactory similarity of the experimental and calculated curves therefore the parameter l was also matched using the limitations on the monotonicity of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l m 2 curve the resulting fitted retc van genuchten parameters and hydraulic conductivity at full saturation are shown in table 2 the fitted parameter l for almost all samples is less than zero which corresponds to the characteristic values for the studied lithological soil types published in the literature see for example schaap and leij 2000 it should be noted that van genuchten s parameters of the water retention curve α and n for chernozems obtained as a result of the lab experiments fall into the characteristic intervals of these parameters for typical russian chernozems given in shein et al 2012 bolotov et al 2019 4 the simulation approach to point scale groundwater recharge estimation groundwater recharge was estimated by point scale simulation of the surface and subsurface water balance the surface water balance was calculated using the surfbal code based on daily observed values of p air temperature wind speed and humidity during 70 years of observations at the voronezh meteorological station the surfbal code calculates the water balance influenced by the following processes the interception of p by the canopy surface leaf and snow evaporation snow accumulation the consolidation of snowpack and its melting topsoil freezing and thawing and surface runoff surfbal allows calculation of the daily pet using several methods including the shuttleworth wallace zhou et al 2006 and priestley taylor allen et al 1998 techniques to account for the difference in field and forest leaf area index lai and aerodynamic canopy resistance the pet was calculated using the shuttleworth wallace sw model with seasonally changed canopy parameters as shown in table 3 the obtained daily values of pet sw are divided according to the sw model into potential transpiration and potential evaporation from the soil together with the intensity of water inflow to the surface due to p and snow melting the potential transpiration and evaporation were used as an atmospheric boundary condition šimůnek et al 2009 for the simulation of variably saturated flow with root water uptake using the hydrus 1d code one model was developed for each site the depth of each profile was 10 m with node vertical steps of 0 05 m root water uptake was simulated using the s shape model šimůnek et al 2009 the parameters of the s shape model p50 and τ were accepted as equal to the typical values for certain types of plants and topsoil according to grinevskiy 2011 the root zone depth for each site is shown in table 3 model layers represent cross sections of the studied sites van genuchten parameters and hydraulic conductivity at full saturation of the soils were accepted according to the results of the laboratory study of samples the hydraulic parameters of the lowermost layer obtained during field testing were extended down to a depth of 9 m the lowest one meter to the lower boundary of each simulated profile is used as additional hydraulic resistance to simulate the lateral groundwater flow to the discharge zone according to the lumped parameter model hydraulic resistance to 1 d groundwater flow in the aquifer with transmissivity t and distance from the watershed to the discharge zone l is l 2 3t pozdniakov and shestakov 1998 this formula makes it possible to use the hydraulic resistance of the lowest layer of the simulated profile as a virtual resistance to the lateral flow of groundwater and to consider the constant head boundary condition šimůnek et al 2009 at the profile bottom as the hydraulic head in the discharge area therefore the constant head boundary condition equal to 2 m šimůnek et al 2009 was used at the lower boundary of the simulated profile and the hydraulic conductivity of the lowest one meter of the profile was 10 4 m day for all sites since the initial soil water content of the soil profiles is unknown one preliminary run of the model with hydrostatic initial conditions was made the pressure head profile obtained at the end of this run was then used as the initial condition for the main simulation run historical simulation was conducted using atmospheric records from 1945 to 2015 the value of annual groundwater recharge was estimated as the sum of daily outflow through the lower boundary of the profile the mean annual groundwater recharge was calculated by averaging the last 70 annual values to predict the recharge variations in the second half of the 21st century we used the larswg forecast weather generator semenov and stratonovitch 2010 which makes it possible to generate meteorological parameters with a

70 years of simulation for every site are presented in table 4 the maximum value of 104 mm year was obtained for site a and the minimum value of 49 mm year was obtained for site b as shown in table 4 significant variation variation coefficient 0 49 in annual groundwater recharge was obtained at site c the variation coefficients at sites a and b are smaller but they also exceed typical variations in annual p 0 16 and annual priestley taylor pet 0 1 for the study region the correlation matrix of the annual recharge shown in table 4 indicate a sufficiently high correlation of simulated recharge for all investigated sites fig 4 shows that the temporal dynamics of annual recharge at site c are more variable than those at sites a and b this variability is confirmed by the calculated coefficients of the autocorrelation of adjacent years given in table 4 fig 4 shows the correlation between recharge and the annual aridity index p pet which was calculated for the current year using the annual sum of the daily value of priestley taylor pet computed by the surfbal code the meteodata from the nearest voronezh meteorological station was used for the aridity index calculations as it shown in table 5 groundwater recharge responds to changes in the aridity index with a time lag from 1 year site c to 3 years sites a and b the smaller time lag for site c is due to the loam layer with high water retention van genuchten α 0 005 m 1 which is located below the root zone in the soil profile this high retention leads to the fact that this layer during the whole simulation period is wet enough and has a low hydraulic capacity this feature results in wetting fronts moving down the profile quickly during surface infiltration periods this process is well illustrated in fig 5 this figure shows model variations in the daily groundwater level depth for all three sites the depth to the groundwater level was calculated from the condition that at the free groundwater surface pressure head h 0 from this figure one can see narrow and high amplitude rises of the groundwater level at site c these rises are mainly due to spring infiltration of meltwater on sites a and b these rises are much less evident and in general the groundwater levels fluctuate quite synchronously both figs 4 and 5 do not show visible trends in changes in the model average annual recharge and average annual groundwater levels since the 1980s caused by the increase in surface temperatures fig 2 that is the results of the simulation did not reveal any traces of climate change in the groundwater recharge of the studied region in the last 30 40 years probably because there are no such traces in the calculated aridity index fig 4 which determines the long term dynamics of groundwater recharge 5 2 predictive recharge simulation the predicted mean average annual p and air temperature obtained in the study area for the 2060 2080 period based on five climatic models are shown in table 6 the last column of this table presents the averaged values of annual presley taylor pet for each model calculated with surfbal using the same length of time as for historical simulation 70 year time series of daily p temperatures and solar radiation were generated for each gcm model projection the choice of such a long period is explained by the need to obtain stable long term average annual recharge values in the surfbal and hydrus 1d simulations the time series generated for each gcm were used as input meteorological conditions on the earth s surface for the groundwater recharge simulation fig 6 shows that all gcms predict an increase in average air temperature compared to that in the reference period for the studied region this increase leads to the fact that the pet value calculated for all models is higher than that in the reference period however the expected average annual p for three models is significantly higher than that in the reference period while two models give almost the same values as those in the reference period as a result the projected aridity index for two models corresponds to that of the reference period while for three models the aridity index decreases in the predicted surfbal hydrus 1d simulation using the generated meteorologic time series for all gcms it was assumed that the vegetation parameters given in table 3 would not change average annual recharge values for all sites and each gcm are shown in table 7 the averaged results of simulations for all gcm climate scenarios show a decrease in the predicted groundwater recharge for the investigated region table 7 according to fig 7 the recharge coefficient recharge p for all models has a high negative correlation with the amount of p spent on actual evapotranspiration etact therefore the minimal recharge coefficient is obtained for the gfdl cm3 and hadgem2 es models for sites b and c and their etact p reaches maximum values the relationship between the changes in recharge averaged for the three sites and obtained for all gcm predictions and the average aridity index and swe are presented in fig 8 fig 8 shows that the reduction in recharge is determined by two factors the first factor is the aridity index which determines evapotranspiration during a warm season the second factor is the accumulation of snow and subsequent meltwater infiltration during the snowmelt periods 6 discussion the performed simulation of point scale diffuse recharge with the help of physically based models of water balance on the ground surface and variable vertical saturated flow for different landscapes and vadose zone profiles takes into account the main processes of p transformation into evapotranspiration and total runoff as an example of the physically justified results of this simulation fig 9 shows the relationship between the real annual mean evapotranspiration and the pet for all simulation options it can be seen from this figure that the results of both historical and predictive modelling fit well enough to a single curve described by the well known fu equation zhang et al 2004 on the other hand the values of annual average recharge obtained from historical simulations correspond to the recharge interval obtained from the regional groundwater flow model muromets et al 2018 the results of historical simulation showed that the average annual recharge for site a pine forests 104 mm year is almost twice as high as that for site b with grassland landscape 49 mm year despite the similar hydraulic properties of the soil profiles moreover this difference in the predicted simulation results has only increased such differences seem to be related to the ratio of evaporation from the soil to actual transpiration for these two landscapes in the pine forest the model root water uptakes exceed the root water uptakes in the grassland landscape however due to the year round shade of the soil annual soil evaporation in pine forests is less than that in grasslands in the predicted simulations due to increasing annual pet and longer evaporation periods from bare soil in the grassland landscape soil evaporation increased even more table 8 this increase results in a decrease in the groundwater recharge for sites b and c located in the same landscapes differences in the average annual recharge values in the historical simulation were insignificant this insignificance is due to the similar conditions of surface water budget formation and in the root zone however the water retention characteristics of the vadose zone below the root zone for these two sites are significantly different as a result the time series of recharge and simulated groundwater levels are essentially different for these sites that is the temporal dynamics of recharge are sensitive to the hydraulic parameters of the vadose zone table 8 shows that despite the close values of total etact for these two sites its components transpiration and soil evaporation are very different these results demonstrate the importance of accounting for vadose zone water retention characteristics in recharge simulations 7 conclusions the study of point scale diffuse recharge through simulation of the water balance on the ground surface and in the unsaturated zone made the following conclusions as a result of the historical simulation there are no visible trends for all three sites in the obtained recharge time series and groundwater level dynamics despite the observed increase in surface temperatures since the mid 1980s the absence of these trends is because based on the simulation results the annual recharge time series is mainly determined by the dynamics of the annual aridity index the dynamics of this index show only its random fluctuations during the simulated historical period in other words the trace of climate change is not yet visible in the formation of groundwater recharge in the studied region the projected simulation showed that on average for all gcms used groundwater recharge would decrease however for the studied region the reduction in mean annual recharge obtained as a result of predictive simulation for the end of the 21st century should not be considered a defensive result the weakness of these predictions is primarily due to the ambiguity of the forecasts made by the gcms under consideration all models confidently predict the increase in surface temperatures but the differences in the gcm forecast p values are still too great these differences make the predictions of groundwater recharge very uncertain the results of the simulation confirmed that both surface conditions and hydrophysical characteristics of the soil profile influence both the annual mean values of the point scale recharge and its long term dynamics therefore on a watershed scale groundwater recharge may have a mosaic structure and temporal dynamics these findings are approved for the studied site which represents a shallow groundwater system

5169,the main purpose of this work is to evaluate diffuse groundwater recharge and its temporal dynamics at sites with different landscapes and soil profiles under observed and projected climate variability three typical sites with different landscapes and topsoil profiles were chosen for the field study field work consisted of pit development and soil sample collection for laboratory study using the centrifuge method soil hydraulic parameters were obtained by the retc code using the observed values of volumetric water content vs pressure head hydrus 1d code was used to estimate groundwater recharge based on a 70 year 1945 2015 meteorological dataset with daily resolution including values of precipitation air temperature wind speed and humidity this dataset was preprocessed using our surfbal code to calculate the surface and topsoil water and energy balance retrospective historical simulation results showed that there was a considerable variation in the mean annual groundwater recharge values 49 104 mm year for the three studied profiles the temporal change in groundwater recharge occurred relatively synchronously at all sites and was governed by the change in the current annual aridity index the results of this historical simulation did not reveal any traces of climate change in the groundwater recharge of the studied region in the last 30 40 years to predict the recharge variations in the second half of the 21st century the larswg forecast weather generator with the climate projections of the 5th general circulation models gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 family was used on average in the case of climate development under the maximum greenhouse gas emissions rcp8 5 scenario there will be a reduction in groundwater recharge in the studied region in 2060 2080 caused by two factors change of aridity index which determines evapotranspiration during a warm season and the accumulation of snow and subsequent meltwater infiltration during the snowmelt periods keywords recharge black soil climate change historical simulation projected simulation general circulation models 1 introduction diffuse recharge due to the infiltration of precipitation p through the unsaturated zone towards the groundwater table plays an important role in the formation of the water resources of shallow aquifers and the transport of near surface contaminants to the groundwater meixner et al 2016 many applications of soil and water environmental management require the knowledge of recharge from point to watershed scales thus assessing the recharge rate at different temporal and spatial scales is one of the most challenging issues in groundwater hydrology generally the magnitudes of groundwater recharge are relatively low and difficult to measure directly therefore instead of direct measurements field investigations such as tracers and geophysics are often applied for estimating groundwater recharge at different spatial scales in addition one of the most promising methods for estimating recharge is the simulation of the water balance in the unsaturated zone above the groundwater table doble and crosbie 2017 keese et al 2005 such simulations make it possible to establish the relationships among groundwater recharge and p and potential evapotranspiration pet vegetation local topography the properties of surface soils and groundwater depth for site specific conditions for recharge simulation the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2009 is commonly used the methodology of the application of hydrus 1d for recharge estimation is summarized in šimůnek 2015 examples of evaluations of the near surface water balance and estimations of groundwater recharge for specific soil vegetation and climatic conditions with hydrus 1d can be found in adane et al 2019 de silva 2015 leterme et al 2012 lu et al 2011 wang et al 2009 and others the interaction between surface and shallow groundwater in boreal regions with winter snow cover is determined by the seasonality of groundwater recharge the typical seasonal recharge patterns are associated with seasonal predominantly spring infiltration of meltwater ireson et al 2013 for recharge simulation in a boreal climate with the essential effects of snow accumulation and melting topsoil freezing and refreezing on the near surface water balance a supplement to hydrus 1 d code named surfbal has been developed grinevskiy and pozdniakov 2013 2017 this code allows the generation of atmospheric boundary conditions for hydrus 1d on the top of soil considering the physical processes of surface p transformation including snow accumulation and melting surface evapotranspiration and topsoil freezing pozdniakov et al 2019 thus the use of the two codes together allows the consideration of important processes of hydrology that affect runoff generation and the infiltration of meltwater current and potential climate change and its impact on groundwater resources are now being widely discussed see for example crosbie et al 2013 gunduz and simsek 2011 kumar 2012 leterme et al 2012 grinevskiy and pozdniakov 2017 adane et al 2019 herrmannet al 2016 one of the methods to assess the future influence of climate change on groundwater resources is to simulate recharge by using meteorological data from past decades and data from the downscaling of climatic projections semenov and stratonovitch 2015 for the studied region the goal of this work is to study the relationship between historical and predicted future climatic phenomena and groundwater recharge of the regional aquifer in the voronezh region southwest european part of russia this region is the area of the development of classical black soil chernozems of eastern europe thus the objectives of the present research are 1 estimation of groundwater recharge by surfbal hydrus 1d simulation with different landscapes and soil profile characteristics 2 correlation of groundwater recharge temporal dynamics with observed climate variability and 3 projections of groundwater recharge using downscaling data from selected coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 models 2 study area the study area is located to the south of voronezh city on the left bank of the don river this region is in the central part of the black soil chernozem belt of the european part of russia fig 1 black soils in the voronezh region have been studied since the end of the 19th century starting with the works of the soil scientist vasily dokuchayev moon 2005 geomorphologically the area represents a slightly hilly plain with gentle landforms the shallow subsurface deposits are alluvial fluvioglacial and moraine formations the typical natural landscape in this territory is steppes with small forests that are located in river valleys the prevailing type of topsoil is ordinary chernozems with thicknesses up to 2 m in addition sandy soils can be found on river terraces and fluvioglacial formations pozdniakov et al 2015 the climate in the study area is characterized by hot and dry summers and moderately cold winters with steady snow cover and well expressed transitional seasons to characterize the meteorological conditions of the study area and to simulate the transformation of p a 70 year continuous series from 1945 to 2015 of meteorological data from the nearest voronezh meteorological station was collected the absolute minimum air temperature reaches 36 c the absolute maximum is 40 c the average annual temperature for this period was 6 5 c with a visible increasing trend from the middle of the 20th century fig 2 the annual p varies from year to year between 330 and 840 mm averaging 560 mm over the last 70 years there is no observed temporal trend of annual p amounts fig 2 in the last 70 years the estimated annual prisley taylor pet varies from year to year from 570 to 810 mm with an average of 720 mm the calculated annual aridity index p pet for the observed period varied from 0 44 to 1 45 with an average of 0 77 seasonal soil freezing changes from year to year from 15 to 100 cm the winter maximum snow water equivalent swe varies from 15 to 200 mm with an average value of approximately 80 mm pozdniakov et al 2015 the regional confined unconfined neogene quaternary aquifer is widespread in the investigated region muromets et al 2018 this aquifer is composed of alluvial sediments of the don river palaeo valley represented mainly by sand and gravels groundwater resources of the aquifer are formed by diffuse recharge through the infiltration of p and melted snow in spring the groundwater of the neogene quaternary aquifer discharges to the regional drainage system the don river and its tributary the hvorostan river fig 1 measurements of the summer low flow periods of 2014 2018 in the hvorostan river showed that the groundwater discharge into this river varied from 13 to 29 mm per year muromets et al 2018 this aquifer is widely used for drinking water supply by domestic wells 3 field investigations and lab studies 3 1 soil sampling to study the spatial temporal variation in recharge three typical sites with different representative natural landscapes and soil profiles were selected for water budget simulation within the study area fig 1 site a is located in a pine forest and topsoil is represented by sandy chernozem on fine sand site b and site c are located in the natural grassland steppe with sandy soil on loamy sand and medium sand and chernozem on silt loam respectively at these sites open pits were made for the sampling of the topsoil profile the first pit was made to a depth of 1 25 m the second pit was made to a depth of 1 05 m and the third pit was made to a depth of 0 8 m the vadose zone profiles of the investigated sites are presented in table 1 and fig 3 three soil samples of undisturbed soils were collected from each pit one sample from each layer soil samples were collected with a cutting ring to avoid disturbing the natural compositions of the soils 3 2 assessment of the unsaturated zone hydraulic parameters the hydraulic parameters of soils for unsaturated flow simulation were obtained during the laboratory study of collected samples the main hydrophysical characteristics water retention curve and dependence of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity from volumetric water content k θ were obtained by a centrifuge method smagin et al 1998 initially the soil samples were fully saturated and placed in containers on the rotor of the laboratory centrifuge samples were rotated at high speed up to 9800 rpm which corresponds to a suction pressure of 11 bar during rotation the samples lost part of the water which was withdrawn by drainage to the lower parts of the containers each rotation speed of the rotor corresponded to a certain value of the suction pressure the samples were rotated at speeds from 300 rpm corresponding to a suction pressure of 0 02 bar to 9800 rpm corresponding to a suction pressure of 11 bar the samples were rotated at 300 rpm for 10 min and at 9800 rpm for 1 5 h in total the samples were rotated at 14 speeds the hydraulic conductivity of each sample at a certain moisture content was obtained by sample rotation at the same speed for different times and measurements of the kinetics of volumetric moisture content loss smagin et al 1998 for fitting experimental data we used the van genuchten 1980 equation for water retention and the mualem model mualem 1976 for unsaturated conductivity in the form 1 s h θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m for h 0 1 for h 0 k θ s k s l 1 1 s 1 m m 2 m 1 n 1 l 2 m where h pressure head k hydraulic conductivity of the saturated medium θ h moisture content for the given pressure head θ s moisture content for full saturation θ r residual moisture content s saturation of the pore space by drainable water kθ s unsaturated hydraulic conductivity α and n van genuchten fitted parameters and l mualem parameter that accounts for pore connectivity and tortuosity the value of θ s for each sample was assumed to be equal to its porosity which was determined by the laboratory method van genuchten parameters θ r α n l and hydraulic conductivity k were estimated by the retc code van genuchten et al 1991 using experimentally obtained water retention curves and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities for different moisture contents together many publications following mualem 1976 use a fixed value of l 1 2 however using the constant parameter l 1 2 we failed to achieve satisfactory similarity of the experimental and calculated curves therefore the parameter l was also matched using the limitations on the monotonicity of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l m 2 curve the resulting fitted retc van genuchten parameters and hydraulic conductivity at full saturation are shown in table 2 the fitted parameter l for almost all samples is less than zero which corresponds to the characteristic values for the studied lithological soil types published in the literature see for example schaap and leij 2000 it should be noted that van genuchten s parameters of the water retention curve α and n for chernozems obtained as a result of the lab experiments fall into the characteristic intervals of these parameters for typical russian chernozems given in shein et al 2012 bolotov et al 2019 4 the simulation approach to point scale groundwater recharge estimation groundwater recharge was estimated by point scale simulation of the surface and subsurface water balance the surface water balance was calculated using the surfbal code based on daily observed values of p air temperature wind speed and humidity during 70 years of observations at the voronezh meteorological station the surfbal code calculates the water balance influenced by the following processes the interception of p by the canopy surface leaf and snow evaporation snow accumulation the consolidation of snowpack and its melting topsoil freezing and thawing and surface runoff surfbal allows calculation of the daily pet using several methods including the shuttleworth wallace zhou et al 2006 and priestley taylor allen et al 1998 techniques to account for the difference in field and forest leaf area index lai and aerodynamic canopy resistance the pet was calculated using the shuttleworth wallace sw model with seasonally changed canopy parameters as shown in table 3 the obtained daily values of pet sw are divided according to the sw model into potential transpiration and potential evaporation from the soil together with the intensity of water inflow to the surface due to p and snow melting the potential transpiration and evaporation were used as an atmospheric boundary condition šimůnek et al 2009 for the simulation of variably saturated flow with root water uptake using the hydrus 1d code one model was developed for each site the depth of each profile was 10 m with node vertical steps of 0 05 m root water uptake was simulated using the s shape model šimůnek et al 2009 the parameters of the s shape model p50 and τ were accepted as equal to the typical values for certain types of plants and topsoil according to grinevskiy 2011 the root zone depth for each site is shown in table 3 model layers represent cross sections of the studied sites van genuchten parameters and hydraulic conductivity at full saturation of the soils were accepted according to the results of the laboratory study of samples the hydraulic parameters of the lowermost layer obtained during field testing were extended down to a depth of 9 m the lowest one meter to the lower boundary of each simulated profile is used as additional hydraulic resistance to simulate the lateral groundwater flow to the discharge zone according to the lumped parameter model hydraulic resistance to 1 d groundwater flow in the aquifer with transmissivity t and distance from the watershed to the discharge zone l is l 2 3t pozdniakov and shestakov 1998 this formula makes it possible to use the hydraulic resistance of the lowest layer of the simulated profile as a virtual resistance to the lateral flow of groundwater and to consider the constant head boundary condition šimůnek et al 2009 at the profile bottom as the hydraulic head in the discharge area therefore the constant head boundary condition equal to 2 m šimůnek et al 2009 was used at the lower boundary of the simulated profile and the hydraulic conductivity of the lowest one meter of the profile was 10 4 m day for all sites since the initial soil water content of the soil profiles is unknown one preliminary run of the model with hydrostatic initial conditions was made the pressure head profile obtained at the end of this run was then used as the initial condition for the main simulation run historical simulation was conducted using atmospheric records from 1945 to 2015 the value of annual groundwater recharge was estimated as the sum of daily outflow through the lower boundary of the profile the mean annual groundwater recharge was calculated by averaging the last 70 annual values to predict the recharge variations in the second half of the 21st century we used the larswg forecast weather generator semenov and stratonovitch 2010 which makes it possible to generate meteorological parameters with a daily resolution based on specified statistical characteristics of long term observations at a specific weather station the fifth version of this generator takes into account the climate projections for the given region made with selected general circulation models gcms from the cmip5 family semenov and stratonovitch 2015 in this study forecast meteorological time series were generated based on

the annual sum of the daily value of priestley taylor pet computed by the surfbal code the meteodata from the nearest voronezh meteorological station was used for the aridity index calculations as it shown in table 5 groundwater recharge responds to changes in the aridity index with a time lag from 1 year site c to 3 years sites a and b the smaller time lag for site c is due to the loam layer with high water retention van genuchten α 0 005 m 1 which is located below the root zone in the soil profile this high retention leads to the fact that this layer during the whole simulation period is wet
