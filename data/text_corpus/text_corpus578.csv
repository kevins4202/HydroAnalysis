2890,drought has become a major threat to regional sustainable development in drylands ecological drought emphasizing the process of drought impacts on ecosystems in coupled human natural systems has been posing large risks to the stability of groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes in drylands yet the interconnected avenues via which ecological drought drives vegetation transition ecological resilience and ecosystem services in gdes with species specific traits remain elusive especially in arid endorheic basins here we combine comprehensive field measurements derived from representative groundwater depth transects in central asia and simulations obtained from the stochastic eco hydrological models and the langevin approach we find that two groundwater dependent species the salt tolerant haloxylon ammodendron and salt sensitive haloxylon persicum exhibit contrasting water use strategies being driven by variations in eco physiological traits and environmental regimes nonetheless both the low resilient h ammodendron and high resilient h persicum vegetation tend to show bistable transition corresponding to vegetated and bare soils under drought stress with stochastic noises and time delays alarmingly ecological drought is accelerating catastrophic transitions in both haloxylon ecosystems induced by diminishing ecological flows depleting soil moisture and aggravating salinization together with climate forcing in particular exacerbated drought stress reduces ecological resilience enhances the likelihood of catastrophic shifts and reduces ecosystem services of gdes in arid endorheic basins our results highlight that ecological drought adaptation strategies must account for resilience maintenance by balancing water scarcity water overuse and water soil quality to avoid accelerating regime shifts in dryland ecosystems keywords groundwater dependent ecosystems haloxylon ecological drought vegetation transition ecological resilience data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drylands cover 41 of the earth s land surface and host more than 38 of the world s human population berdugo et al 2017 are the largest source of interannual variability in the global carbon sink yao et al 2020 during the current state of anthropocene drought stress is one of the most severe environmental constraints to plant productivity and ecosystem stability munson et al 2021 drought occurrences and their characteristics are largely attributed to both natural and anthropogenic forcings chiang et al 2021 and drought events in globe drylands will become more rampant in the coming decades under current development trajectories and climate change patterns li et al 2017 moreover drought is a creeping multidimensional multiscale phenomenon within human water systems that must be understood as a process as opposed to a product aghakouchak et al 2021 particularly ecological drought i e the process of drought impacts on ecosystems considers the full spectrum of dynamic feedbacks and responses an organism or ecosystem may experience during the intensification of water deficit within a coupled human nature system munson et al 2021 thus insight into how dryland ecosystems respond to increasing drought intensity is extremely relevant as projected increases in aridity across many global regions could drive future dryland expansion and degradation huang et al 2017 especially in arid endorheic hydrologically landlocked basins central asia comprises a large fraction of the world s drylands and more than 80 of the global temperate deserts are located in here zhang et al 2016 is one of the most sensitive areas to climate change and human activities huang et al 2017 yin et al 2021 existing widely in arid endorheic basins of central asia groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes i e aquatic and terrestrial regions whose ecological components rely on groundwater for at least some period of time during their life history are considered fragile and prone to regime shifts orellana et al 2012 eamus et al 2015 liu et al 2021 importantly ecological drought has profound effects on the resilience and stability of such ecosystems ridolfi et al 2006 qin et al 2021 alongside negative ecohydrological and environmental consequences wu et al 2019a yin et al 2022 and potentially diminish the resources and services these ecosystems provide to human societies munson et al 2021 previously paleo ecological records isotope and pollen indicated that the intensification of central asia aridification around 12 ma and triggered the transition of forest vegetation to grassland and desert vegetation zhuang et al 2011 yao et al 2015 in recent decades the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases have influenced natural climate variability which is changing the frequency and intensity of dry spells in central asia huang et al 2017 further anthropogenic pressures e g human induced climate change over development of water land resources and soil water salinization will likely induce more frequent severe and prolonged droughts than currently observed lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 li et al 2017 as drought intensifies plants and ecosystems experience stress which reduces the drought tolerance of plants and increases the vulnerability of ecosystems to drought including a rise in drought driven plant mortality and anticipated ecosystem transformations from one state to another munson et al 2021 thus a more comprehensive understanding of the ecological resilience and regime shifts in gdes driven by ecological drought is critical to sustainable management and effective restoration of such ecosystems regime shifts or catastrophic shifts typically occur when resilience is exceeded and perturbations dramatically alter ecosystem function and structure scheffer et al 2001 ecological resilience the maximum perturbation amplitude that a system can absorb and still recover to its initial stable state holling 1973 is a key indicator for understanding and managing ecosystems subject to regime changes folke et al 2010 the combination of extrinsic and intrinsic noises and deterministic and random time delays is ubiquitous in nature and often fundamentally alters the dynamics of dryland ecosystems gu et al 2007 jia et al 2014 although it is broadly accepted that dryland ecosystems prone to exhibit bistable dynamics with two preferential stable states of desert and vegetated land under natural and anthropogenic induced perturbations d odorico et al 2005 the implications of ecological drought governed by the interplay of changing precipitation evapotranspiration regimes declining groundwater tables diminishing ecological flows intensifying salinization and soil water depletion in coupled natural human systems in plant adaptation strategies e g water use patterns vegetation dynamics ecological stability and ecosystem services of gdes in arid endorheic basins remains mostly unknown moreover the effects of drought stress on species specific resilience in gdes have received limited attention often plants and ecosystems may respond to intensifying drought intensity through gradual or linear changes in performance or may experience thresholds or abrupt nonlinear changes munson et al 2021 also plant species vary in their adaptive capacity and plasticity to withstand drought stress berdugo et al 2017 thus assessing the impact of ecological drought on gdes should accurately and systematically consider the collective differences in drought intensity plant and ecosystem performance and how ecological performance is related to water deficits munson et al 2021 in addition comparing ecological drought responses among plant species or ecosystems in gdes can reveal differences in drought intensity at different stages of regime transitions as well as relative performances of species or ecosystems broadly distributed in central asia haloxylon ammodendron c a mey bunge and h persicum chenopodiaceae bunge are sister taxa in the haloxylon genus with c4 photosynthetic pathway unique morphological and physiological traits have strong resistance to drought high temperatures and other stresses both perennial xero halophytic shrubs have dimorphic root systems and therefore constitute typical gdes xu and li 2006 li et al 2019 wu et al 2019b compared with h ammodendron h persicum is less tolerant to salinity but more drought resistant wu et al 2019a both haloxylon species are of great ecological and economic importance such as sequestering soil carbon supplying food for livestock providing ethnopharmacological resources and sustaining biodiversity and are essential for stabilizing sand dunes to ensure the stable provision of ecosystem services xu et al 2017 li et al 2019 wu et al 2019a already similar to multiple groundwater dependent vegetation intensified drought stress by climate change warming and drying and human activities e g increasing water consumption diminishing ecological flows and aggravating salinization has caused both haloxylon vegetation degradation and further triggered both ecosystems transformations in central asia especially in vegetated desert ecoregions li et al 2019 wu et al 2019a b yin et al 2022 although some recent studies have evaluated the vegetation risks from projected changes in climate regime across central asia zhang et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 li et al 2019 qin et al 2021 liu et al 2021 much less is known about the effects of ecological drought on both haloxylon ecosystems with noises and time delays and how such ecosystems under drought stress lose ecological resilience undergo catastrophic shifts and diminish ecosystem services within coupled human water systems which greatly hampers the prediction of possible future abrupt and irreversible shifts in plants or ecosystems and the feasibility of vegetation restoration projects in dryland environments ridolfi et al 2006 borgogno et al 2012 in light of this issue using field comprehensive measurements and meaningful modelling approaches by comparing the relative susceptibility of plants and ecosystems to drought stress across a environmental gradient our study aims to achieve the following objectives 1 revealing the distinct water use strategies among the two haloxylon species 2 characterizing the bistable transition of two haloxylon vegetation with noises and time delays and 3 evaluating the stability and resilience in the groundwater dependent haloxylon ecosystems finally we demonstrate the implications of drought stress caused or intensified by groundwater levels drop soil water deficit and salinization together with human induced climate forcing in regime shifts and ecological services of the haloxylon ecosystems in arid endorheic basins across central asia in particular we test the hypothesis that changes in ecological resilience resulting from both natural and anthropogenic drivers may be an intermediate cause of subsequent changes in groundwater dependent ecosystems functioning in arid endorheic basins capitalizing on these research knowledges we would provide feasible management and restoration directives for maintaining the sustainability of gdes by resilient decision making under future global changes in drylands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design our study area central asia 46 45 e 96 18 e 35 5 n 52 33 n is located in the hinterland of eurasia fig 1 a the region is characterized by complicated arid and semi arid natural environments e g water limited salt affected groundwater fed that comprise a delicate ecological zone jiang et al 2017 the study area has a temperate continental climate with scarce precipitation and strong evaporation dry and hot summers and cold and freezing winters fig s1 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 major types of vegetation include grasslands 39 34 shrubs 22 27 crops 18 98 sparse vegetation 17 31 and forests 1 50 qin et al 2021 in particular common plants in the vegetated desert ecoregions include haloxylon spp artemisia spp anabasis spp and tamarix spp zhang et al 2016 of which the haloxylon vegetation alone contributes to 21 of the desert biomass li et al 2019 from the paleo ecological records and future scenario simulations yao et al 2015 li et al 2017 climate change has triggered observable vegetation degradation in central asia and intensified further by anthropogenic environmental changes e g groundwater table drops soil moisture deficit and soil water salinization especially in arid endorheic basins in addition the presence of natural and anthropogenic forcings are increasing the drought frequency duration and intensity in the study area fig 1a our research site fig 1b is located in the gurbantunggut desert 4 88 104 km2 which is a typical saline desert in central asia and the largest fixed and semi fixed desert in china the region is covered with massive dendritic sand dunes approximately 1 10 km long and 5 50 m high and orientate from north to south and the predominant soil type is stable or semi stable aeolian sand soil the average annual temperature annual pan evaporation pan diameter 20 cm and annual precipitation are 6 6 c 42 2 44 2 c 2000 mm and 70 150 mm respectively and the 25 precipitation is generally snowfall 24 7 cm deep during november to march wu et al 2019b the groundwater table depth gtd and salinization are gradually increasing from the edge to the hinterland yin et al 2022 the dominant natural vegetation is salt tolerant h ammodendron and salt sensitive h persicum and the former grows at the inter dune lowland and the later settles at the sand dune both showing a seasonal facultative dependence on groundwater according to precipitation variability xu and li 2006 to investigate the responses of h ammodendron and h persicum s water use strategies and the two haloxylon species s eco hydrological feedbacks to drought stress using the space for time substitution approach blois et al 2013 6 representative sites with different groundwater depths forming a gtd gradient were selected and numbered consecutively from south to north by site d1 d6 in this desert ecoregion fig 1b specifically the mean gtd during 2017 2018 from site d1 to site d6 were 7 1 10 3 11 4 12 5 14 2 and 15 9 m at the inter dune lowlands and 11 1 13 4 14 5 16 8 18 6 and 20 5 m at the dune crests respectively the gtd transects cover a total length of 16 km and the differences in physiographic conditions would be negligible additionally vegetation cover is gradually decreasing and desertification is progressively increasing from site d1 to site d6 fig 1c the basic characteristics of each site in the gtd transects are shown in table 1 and fig 1d it is important to note that from site d1 to site d6 the ecological drought caused or intensified by groundwater depletion soil water deficit and salinization due to the overexploitation related to regional modern irrigated agriculture and industrial development together with anthropogenic induced climate forcing gradually exacerbated 2 2 data collection along the gtd transects soil samples were collected within 0 20 20 100 and 100 300 cm soil layer at 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm intervals respectively using a hand auger 5 cm inner diameter with 3 replicates at the inter dune lowland and dune crest of each site from april to october 2017 2018 once collected after quartering each soil sample was immediately divided into two portions one portion quickly refrigerated and taken to the laboratory for measuring gravimetric soil water content swc by the oven dry method 24 h at 105 c the other portion was sealed in a thickened valve bag then air dried removed debris and sieved to pass through a 2 mm mesh for measured soil electrical conductivity sec by a conductivity meter fe 30 mettler toledo switzerland in the paste extracts with soil water ratio of 1 5 correspondingly soil physicochemical properties table 1 along a soil profile 0 150 cm at a 10 cm interval with 3 replications were determined following the standard methods bao 2000 groundwater signatures were obtained from observation wells fig s1 constructed by the cas at the inter dune lowland in each site the gtds were measured three times per month during 2018 2019 using a groundwater meter model 101 solinst

coordinates of site location were determined by a gps receiver etrex vistacx garmin usa with approximately 3 m accuracy the vegetation investigations table 1 in 20 m 20 m quadrat with three replications at the inter dune lowland and dune crest in each site were conducted in early summer 2020 besides this root distributions the base diameter is 4 8 cm of h ammodendron and h persicum were investigated using the whole root excavation method fig s1 and detailed in situ excavation and comprehensive measurements have been reported in previous studies xu and li 2006 further daily meteorological data were obtained from an automatic weather station campbell scientific logan utah usa installed near the site d1 also an eddy covariance flux tower at this site was installed to obtain direct field evapotranspiration measurements additionally the stable isotope δ 2h and δ 18o data for soil water and groundwater samples as well as eco physiological indicators of two haloxylon species were got in previous studies xu et al 2007 wu et al 2019b 2 3 model development 2 3 1 stochastic salinity dependent root water uptake model in order to reveal the distinct water use strategies among the two haloxylon species by considering the effect of salinity on evapotranspiration et and the feedback between direct shallow groundwater uptake and upper root zone saturation we introduce a simple but realistic stochastic root water uptake model for water limited halophytes that extract water with dimorphic root systems fig 2 a on the basis of the earlier model suweis et al 2010 we consider a homogeneous soil column with root zone depth zr averaged soil porosity n relative soil moisture s salt mass m and salt concentration c m n z r s and groundwater table depth zg the water balance of salt affected soils can be written as 1 n z r ds dt r t e t s t c t l s t t where r t is the infiltration rate from precipitation e t s t c t is the evapotranspiration rate and l s t t is the deep infiltration rate following perri et al 2018 the limiting effect of salinity on et is modeled through a simple plant response function depending on both salt concentration in the soil and plant salt tolerance in the form 2 e t c e t max 1 β c c t c c t e t max c c t where et max is the estimated maximum rate of et cm d 1 ct is the salt stress threshold g l 1 β is the rate of transpiration decline above ct l g 1 according to rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 and perri et al 2018 the probability density function of s under the influence of m p s m is given by 3 p s m n t e γ s s θ s θ s t θ λ η χ θ s s t n t χ e γ s s s s t λ η s t s s 1 where λ is the average time between precipitation events exceeding interception capacity d 1 λ λe δ α the dimensionless parameter γ n z r α

nt is the normalization constant throughout this study we following the equation given by teuling and troch 2005 to calculate the vertically integrated root water uptake s as follows 4 s f r b s e t max f r b s 1 exp 0 45 ξ e p where fr is the root fraction in the layer of depth l b s is a soil moisture stress function ξ is the leaf area index a value of 0 45 is the light use efficiency coefficient ep is the potential evapotranspiration for phreatophyte vegetation with dimorphic root systems following tamea et al 2009 the defined soil column is split into three potential water source zones based on the local degree of soil saturation fig 2d i shallow root zone i e 0 z zr hereafter z is the distance from the soil surface and positive downward ii deep stable unsaturated zone i e zr z zc hereafter zc is the maximum height of capillary rise and varies with the water table and iii shallow groundwater subsidy zone i e zc z zg further following vervoort and van der zee 2009 the

discretization errors especially in dry climates and for deep water tables teuling and troch 2005 vervoort and van der zee 2009 2 3 2 stochastic time delayed vegetation dynamics model in order to characterize the bistable transition of two haloxylon vegetation and to investigate the effect of the feedback between drought stress and vegetation dynamics according to the field observed phenomena by considering the influence of multiple noise factors e g hydrological fluctuations grazing and pests interferences extreme temperatures and saline stress and time delays e g hysteresis effect between the groundwater table decline and soil water depletion and the plant root water uptake process due to root growth in the interplays between vegetation and environmental changes we develop a stochastic delay differential equation for modelling vegetation dynamics in groundwater dependent ecosystems following noy meir 1975 and ridolfi et al 2006 changes in groundwater dependent vegetation are modeled by a logical curve that describes the growth death process with noises and time delays the ecosystem carrying capacity vcc is described by a piecewise function of water stress ws that takes into account drought stress induced by groundwater and soil water deficits salinity stress together with climate forcing fig 2b and the influence of groundwater pumping on vegetation dynamics is also considered therefore the stochastic time delayed vegetation dynamics model is given by 6 dv dt α 0 v v cc v v ϑ ψ t φ t 7 v cc a 1 1 w s a 1 z g z inf q z g z inf a 1 z inf z g z sup a 1 κ z g z sup 1 q z g z sup 8 z g t k v τ z 0 a cos ψ t where v is dimensionless vegetation biomass t is dimensionless time α 0 regulates the temporal response of the system v ϑ indicates the random time delayed variable with v ϑ v t ϑ ϑ is the delay time in the random force ψ t is the extrinsic noise with ψ t ψ t 2 ε δ t t and φ t is the intrinsic noise with φ t φ t 2 d δ t t inhere ε and d are the strength of extrinsic and intrinsic fluctuations respectively δ is the dirac delta function a 1 represents the maximum value of vcc under a specific environment regime zg is the water table depth z inf and z sup are the adimensional thresholds of vegetation tolerance to shallow and deep water tables respectively κ is a shape coefficient q is a measure of the non linearity of the effects of other water stresses excluding groundwater deficit on plant conditions k is the sensitivity coefficient representing the influence of groundwater pumping on zg v τ indicates the time delayed variable with v τ v t τ τ is the delay time in the deterministic force z 0 is the long term zg in the absence of vegetation interference and anthropogenic pumping a and ψ are the amplitude and frequency of the seasonal oscillations of zg respectively a detailed derivation of this model can be found in supplementary text s2 overall the stochastic time delayed vegetation dynamics model linking groundwater table dynamics and vegetation stress with explicit consideration of climate soil and plant characteristics that is the combination of k and q controls ecological resilience regime shifts and ecosystem services in groundwater dependent ecosystems porporato et al 2001 according to the measured vegetation data along the defined groundwater depth transects fig 1b we performed a series of direct numerical simulations for the time delayed stochastic model using the euler maruyama scheme with a integration step of 0 001 and the data of probability distribution are saved over 500 different trajectories also we generated gaussian white noise gwn from two random numbers uniformly distributed in the unit interval by the box mueller algorithm we conducted 1000 simulations to determine this limit of stability the deterministic potential u v with d v dt d u dv associated with the different regimes of the vegetation dynamics can be used to determine the stable equilibrium states of the system d odorico et al 2005 the quasi steady state probability distribution function of vegetation biomass pst v is provided in supplementary text s3 2 3 3 langevin approach for ecological resilience estimation in order to assess the ecological stability of the groundwater dependent haloxylon ecosystems in response to exacerbating drought stress we estimate the mean exit time using the langevin approach to measure ecological resilience fig 2c in such ecosystems and further the changes in ecological resilience under intensified drought stress are compared using the space for time substitution approach blois et al 2013 importantly the mean exit time i e the expected time required to cross a threshold such as the border of an attraction basin proposed by arani et al 2021 provides a new angle for anticipating critical transitions under both natural and anthropogenic drivers across diverse ecosystems according to arani et al 2021 the mean exit time of the ecosystem is estimated by the following steps i standardize the v time series by the dynamic linear models ii test the markov hypothesis for standardized time series iii detect the stationarity of the standardized time series by the augmented dickey fuller test iv system reconstruction i e estimate the deterministic and stochastic components of a langevin model and v estimate the mean exit time and its confidence limits from the basin of attraction for the ecosystem states importantly the standardized time series is used as state variable vt to estimate the drift diffusion model known as the langevin equation 9 dv d 1 v d t 2 d 2 v d w where d 1 v is the drift term d 2 v is the diffusion term and describes as d 2 v σ v 2 2 with σ v is the noise intensity fluctuation in the langevin model we use absorbing boundaries for the unstable edge between two basins of attraction and reflecting conditions at the left and right boundaries to indicate that no shift occurs by solving the fokker planck equation the mean exit time t v for state variable v is derived as arani et al 2021 10 d 1 v d t dv d 2 v d 2 t d v 2 1 further we estimated the probability weighted mean of t v using probabilities extracted from the normalized stationary density of the fokker planck equation arani et al 2021 particularly a detailed description of the full details mathematical proofs and related formulas and matlab codes of the langevin approach for measuring the ecological resilience is presented by arani et al 2021 2 4 model parameterization in this study the model parameterization involves two haloxylon species i e h ammodendron at the inter dune lowland and h persicum at the dune crest in six different groundwater depth sites i e site d1 to site d6 during the growing season i e from april to october rainfall is modeled at the daily timescale as a marked poisson process with frequency of occurrence λ exponentially distributed rainfall depths with mean α and interception threshold δ laio et al 2001 specifically from long term daily rainfall data 2000 2020 the α λ from april to october was 0 15 1 21 0 14 1 20 0 25 1 23 0 14 1 25 0 23 2 12 0 25 3 12 and 0 12 2 13 cm d 1 respectively the average soil saturation s of the deep stable unsaturated zone zr z zc and the czc and czg in each site were estimated from the measured deep soil moisture and soil salinity fig 2e f the threshold of rainfall interception δ for shrub is set to 0 2 cm d 1 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 we indirectly estimated the leaf area index ξ based on the allometric method and vegetation coverage yan et al 2019 the rooting zone depth zr and soil porosity n were determined from the in situ measurements the etmax is assumed to decrease linearly with depth daly et al 2009 and was determined using the ec measurements in every month during 2011 2020 the values of s and other soil characteristic parameters were adapted from laio et al 2001 the parameter c in the function rc z was obtained by fitting field survey data xu and li 2006 xu et al 2017 and as shown in fig 2g the values of ε d σ and τ are referenced and modified from borgogno et al 2012 and jia et al 2014 the parameters a ψ a 1 and α 0 are derived from ridolfi et al 2006 and borgogno et al 2012 the values of k z 0 z inf z sup q and κ are adapted and modified from porporato et al 2001 jia et al 2014 and yin et al 2022 the measured v at inter dune lowland dune crest from site d1 to site d6 is 0 410 0 120 0 397 0 050 0 248 0 045 0 314 0 039 0 038 0 027 and 0 016 0 011 respectively the parameters of the langevin model are obtained and modified from arani et al 2021 note that due to the lack of high resolution time series of v we replaced it with the model generated data by the stochastic time delayed model equations 6 8 tables 2 s2 s3 summarize the parameter values used in this study groundwater related parameterization has carefully considered dune height additionality we validated the stochastic root water uptake model with stable isotope data and calibrated the stochastic vegetation dynamics model with field survey data 3 results 3 1 seasonal variation in plant water use strategies the stochastic salinity dependent root water uptake model revealed that the h ammodendron and h persicum had different water use patterns over the growing season in this study area fig 3 a b as shown the two species possessed distinct dominant water sources with h ammodendron dependent more heavily on shallow groundwater 65 1 93 4 yet the contribution of root zone water and deep soil water were in the range of 4 7 19 9 and 1 9 19 9 respectively whereas h persicum relying more on root zone water 83 4 97 5 but the contribution of deep soil water and groundwater accounted for 1 1 1 6 and 1 4 15 5 respectively moreover both plants exhibited similar seasonal water uptake patterns at the different studied sites with the utilization rate of root zone water was the highest in april the isotopic data from field studies fig s2 also demonstrated similar findings in this study area carried out sensitivity analysis showed that the interplay of precipitation regimes α and λ and water table dynamics zg has a considerable influence on water use strategies of both haloxylon species in this study area fig 3c f as illustrated for h ammodendron groundwater subsidy increases clearly with precipitation decreases and groundwater depth increases and deep soil water uptake also increased slightly while root zone water use decreases sharply for h persicum as the climate becomes strongly drier α 0 2 d 1 and λ 0 15 cm root zone water uptake decreases dramatically but the utilization of groundwater increases significantly in contrast h ammodendron is more sensitive to variations in water table whereas h persicum is more sensitive to changes in precipitation regimes corresponding root zone soil moisture status figs s3 s4 further the root morphology i e parameter c see fig 2g is a key determinant of water availability thereby is fundamental in dominating the water use strategies of these two desert shrubs and in buffering or delaying the effects of increasing drought stress importantly both root zone salinity and groundwater salinity table 1 and fig 1d also had clear effects on the root water uptake of these two plants in the study area particularly for salt sensitive h persicum fig s5 suggesting that the effect of salinity on water use patterns depends on plant salt tolerance and can evidently vary across species interestingly by using the space for time substitution approach across site d1 to site d6 we found that the interplay of groundwater degradation zg gec and soil water salt stress of root zone czr szr has a significant ecohydrological control on the vegetation dynamics of the two haloxylon species fig 3g h these results indicate that plant water use strategies is substantially influenced by governing environmental conditions and species specific traits which in turn affects vegetation dynamics and the stability of plant ecosystems 3 2 vegetation dynamics with noises and time delays the numerical simulation results of the temporal evolution and probability distribution of the vegetation biomass v for h ammodendron and h persicum from site d1 to site d6 demonstrated that groundwater table fluctuations are acting as a source of disturbance on the groundwater dependent plant ecosystems and affecting their stability especially for h ammodendron fig 4 a b as presented under given the combination of noises periodic signal as well as time delays the v of h ammodendron mainly revolves around the relatively high coverage vegetated state when the water table is shallow but the drop in water table causes the system to transition between two alternative stable states corresponding to vegetated and bare soils whereas for h persicum the v initially fluctuates around the low coverage vegetated desert state and the decline in water table leads to the desert state to become populated fig 4c d illustrates the influences of time delays τ and ϑ drought inducible factors q and k extrinsic and intrinsic noises ε and d on the vegetation dynamics pst v of these two haloxylon plants it is clear that the effect of time delay in fluctuation force is opposite to that in deterministic force ϑ can enhance while τ can suppress the fluctuation and τ is more sensitive further as the increase of q i e the increase in drought stress induced by factors other than the water table the height of peak in pst v increases significantly v is more concentrated and vcc decreases notably fig s6 however as the increase of k i e the gtd drops the position of peak in pst v shifts dramatically to low v and the peak height increases clearly for a small noise intensity ε or d the pst v shows a single peak yet as the value of ε or d increases the height and position of peak at a larger v decrease also a new peak appears at a smaller v these results suggest that the interplay of drought stress with noises and time delays can cause the groundwater dependent ecosystems exhibit bistable dynamics in this study area from the potential u v point of view we investigated the effects of drought stress induced by both natural and anthropogenic forcings on the bifurcation diagram of the two haloxylon vegetation fig 4e f as shown both haloxylon ecosystems exhibited a bistable transition corresponding to vegetated and bare soils separated by a sharp breakpoint involving a saddle node bifurcation and catastrophic transition occurring at the critical value i e the tipping point of the drought stress notably the critical value of the combination of k and q of h persicum is clearly greater than that of h ammodendron indicating that the vegetation h persicum has clearly higher ecological resilience with larger temporal autocorrelation and variance fig s7 overall these findings seem to suggest that the ecological drought governed by the groundwater levels drop soil water deficit and salinization together with human induced climate forcing could play an important role in determining future stability and resilience of gdes in drylands especially in arid endorheic basins with human overexploitation 3 3 ecological resilience and catastrophic transitions the mean exit time of vegetation h ammodendron and h persicum was estimated based on the langevin approach using model generated data to measure ecological resilience in the study area figs 5 and s8 as illustrated both long term highly resolved datasets approximately meet the assumptions for the langevin approach and the effective potential revealed two stable basins and the low v basin appears shallower than the high v basin for both haloxylon vegetation fig s8 it is intriguing that the mean exit times of the low and high v basins are 17 years with confidence limits 95 of 14 21 and 292 years with 254 355 for h ammodendron respectively but are 75 years with confidence limits 62 89 and 749 years with confidence limits 660 837 for h persicum fig 5 c d this results suggest that once both haloxylon vegetation flips the high v basin into the low v basin both ecosystems can soon catastrophic shifts to bare soil state especially the h ammodendron ecosystem we further investigated the implications of ecological drought in the stability and ecosystem services of gdes and characterized the catastrophic transitions of both haloxylon ecosystems under the control of different drought stress scenarios the space for time substitution approach across central asia fig 5 as presented the interactions and feedbacks between human induced climate change increasing water consumption land use cover change and aggravating river basin salinization over time and space are causing or intensifing the ecological drought which are exacerbating catastrophic regime shifts in both haloxylon ecosystems and degrading a range of ecosystem service functions e g carbon sequestration biodiversity wind prevention and sand fixation in particular declining groundwater tables diminishing ecological flows changing precipitation and snowmelt patterns and intensifying soil water salinization induced by human footprint are threatening the sustainability of gdes in arid endorheic basins fig 5a b ultimately these ecological service impacts will feedback to both natural and human systems nonetheless groundwater dependent vegetation can acclimate to increasing drought intensity by changing water use strategies physiological responses as well as morphological adjustments alarmingly drought stress can be aggravated in the future due to the compounding effects of human activities and climatic changes carried out scenario analysis showed that drought stress reduces the resilience of gdes and enhances the likelihood of catastrophic transitions fig 5 accordingly with the intensification of ecological drought the h ammodendron ecosystem will degrade dramatically with low resilience and the h persicum ecosystem will slowly collapse with high resilience fig 5e f as well as a sequence of eco hydrological and eco environmental consequences e g shrinking lakes desertification saltstorms and sandstorms will be triggered across central asia these results suggest that exacerbated drought accelerates catastrophic shifts in both haloxylon ecosystems via reducing ecological resilience and conservation policies for such ecosystems should encourage management procedures that maintain or restore ecological resilience or minimize the negative impacts of anthropogenic environmental changes on the loss of resilience to ensure the stable provision of ecosystem services 4 discussion 4 1 ecohydrological model reveal contrasting water use strategies among two haloxylon species modelling root water uptake provides a powerful tool for studying the close association of groundwater dependent vegetation with spatiotemporal variations in soil water and groundwater feddes et al 2001 and helps to better assess future shifts in dryland vegetation structure and composition in response to predicted environmental changes wu et al 2019b our simulations revealed that the two haloxylon species had contrasting water use strategies over the growth period fig 3 i e the h ammodendron largely depended on groundwater while the h persicum relied mainly on root zone water which was replenished by precipitation this finding is basically consistent with the isotopic results of wu etal 2019a suggesting that the stochastic ecohydrological model equation 5 is effective in simulating root water uptake in gdes however we assume complete compensation below zr in this model and do not make any limiting assumptions about the roots depth below zr this means that the deep roots will use the maximum available water to access the location either groundwater or another deep store at any depth this is inconsistent with plant water uptake strategies by trading off water carbon costs guswa 2010 thus this limitation warrants further studies to optimize the results presented here additionally the space for time substitution approach blois et al 2013 is widely and effectively applied in ecological modelling to infer past or future trajectories of ecosystems from contemporary spatial patterns coexisting plant species often adopt contrasting resource use strategies via differences in key traits moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 and water available for root uptake is influenced by a suite of factors e g climatic hydrogeologic root architecture feddes et al 2001 lowry and loheide ii 2010 pierret et al 2017 our results show that plant water use strategies is substantially controlled by governing environmental conditions and species specific traits eco physiological traits specifically the interplay of precipitation regimes and water table dynamics has a great impact on the water use strategies of both haloxylon species vervoort and van der zee 2009 grossiord et al 2017 soil physical properties differed across dune micro topography table 1 and the role of soil texture in plant water uptake can be understood by how it regulates the downward infiltration and the upward capillary rise though root zone wu et al 2019a cai et al 2021 also plant rooting patterns e g dimorphic root systems affect the resilience of ecosystems to environmental stresses such as drought fan et al 2017 further the effect of salinity on evapotranspiration depend on plant salt tolerance and may vary remarkably across species perri et al 2018 this may be a strong evidence for why the use of groundwater high salinity water fig 1d by deep roots of h persicum salt sensitive plant is very limited and this plant rarely settle at inter dune lowland high salinity soil fig s9 in our study area thorburn et al 1995 wu et al 2019a together our results suggest that to a certain extent water use strategies strongly influence the responses of the two haloxylon species to their fluctuating environmental conditions 4 2 vegetation transition and ecological resilience under drought stress with noises and time delays quantitatively assessing the effects of noise correlations and time delays on dryland ecosystems has significant implications to understand the complex dynamics of such ecosystems under environmental stress conditions zeng and wang 2012 our findings suggest that although there is notable differences in water use strategies between the salt tolerant h ammodendron and salt sensitive h persicum both groundwater dependent haloxylon vegetation prone to exhibit bistable dynamics with two alternative states of vegetated and bare soils under compounding effects of noises and time delays the delay time τ appears in the deterministic force can suppress while ϑ presents in the fluctuation force can enhance the fluctuation of system gu et al 2007 it is important to note that time delays can also induce changes in bistability in the presence of noises e g for smaller time delays noises enhances ecosystem stability but for larger time delays noises accelerates ecosystem catastrophic transitions zeng and wang 2012 groundwater table fluctuations i e the parameter k and other environmental perturbations i e the parameter q have significant effects on vegetation dynamics of both haloxylon species particularly the vegetation groundwater salinity dynamics greatly control the resilience of dryland plant ecosystems runyan and d odorico 2010 these results highlight the central role of drought stress induced by both natural and anthropogenic forcings i e the combination of k and q in controlling the long term vegetation dynamics of gdes in drylands additionally although the stochastic time delayed vegetation dynamics model equations 6 8 simplifies the complex ecohydrological mechanisms that driving these ecosystems as well as neglecting interspecies interactions this model capturing some major aspects of the interplay between environmental fluctuations and vegetation dynamics exit time as an intuitive and realistic measure of ecological resilience depends not only on the environmental perturbations but also on the size of the attraction basin improves our understanding of the dynamical properties e g regime transitions of complex and fragile ecosystems under environmental perturbations arani et al 2021 one of the main challenges of the langevin approach equations 9 10 in practical applications is that it requires long high resolution time series in order to reduce the uncertainty of mean exit time estimates as arani et al 2021 revealed although the model generated datasets tend to overestimate randomness around unstable points the mean exit time is closely related to the time that can be derived directly from the original model thus the results of langevin approach based on the model generated datasets by the stochastic time delayed model are reliable in this study xie 2001 reported that the abandoning cycle of oases i e the oases evolved into deserts in xinjiang is 500 to 600 years with the lagging time 300 to 400 years and the stability of oasis is negatively correlated with the degree of agricultural development this is basically in accordance with the mean exit time of 749 years with confidence limits 660 837 for gdes under drought stress in this study area fig 5d we demonstrate that in contrast vegetation h persicum has higher resilience i e the larger mean exit time but the h ammodendron ecosystem is more prone to catastrophic shifts particularly in the low v state importantly the early warning signals for critical transitions were captured in this study fig 4e f this findings highlight the potential of applying the critical thresholds to avoid such ecosystems collapse and provides opportunities for positive changes scheffer et al 2009 berdugo et al 2017 further the regime shifts of both vegetation between adjacent studied sites is closely connected and the coexistence of the two haloxylon species may increase the resilience of the gdes in arid endorheic basins 4 3 exacerbated drought impacts on ecological stability of gdes and management implications our findings suggest that ecological drought is exacerbating catastrophic shifts in both haloxylon ecosystems and weakening ecological services of vegetated desert ecoregions in arid endorheic basins driven by diminishing ecological flows depleting soil moisture and aggravating salinization together with human induced climate forcing in particular the overexploitation related to the development of modern intensive irrigated agriculture has dramatically altered the water salt balance among oasis desert system in arid endorheic basins yin et al 2022 the projected intensification and expansion of irrigated agriculture would invariably increase the risk of salinization and groundwater degradation due to the growing reliance on marginal land and water sources in drylands assouline et al 2015 moreover because of salinization acts as an aridity enhancer perri et al 2020 thereby the drastic soil and water salinization shifts maybe trigger the transition of ecosystems to more stable permanent degradation states in drylands d odorico et al 2013 in addition owing to snowpack stores cold season precipitation is to fulfill warm season water demand qin et al 2020 the variations in the amount of snowfall and the timing of snowmelt as well as rising temperatures may reduce the availability of soil moisture and affect the drought resilience of such ecosystems jobbágy et al 2011 wu et al 2019a together ecological drought is believed to reduce the resilience of gdes enhance the likelihood of catastrophic shifts and diminish the functioning of ecosystem services in drylands here drought stress may affect resilience by changing both system parameters e g the position of critical thresholds and recovery rates and state variables e g vegetation cover or population size these findings reveal the fundamental and dominant role played by ecological drought in determining the stability and services of gdes in arid endorheic basins it is important to note that drought stress can be intensified in the future due to the compounding effects of climate change and human activities li et al 2017 aghakouchak et al 2021 if climate change intensifies and or prolongs droughts the overall negative impact for gdes will be even greater our study highlights that realistic strategies for sustainable management of such ecosystems in arid endorheic basins should focus on maintaining ecological resilience by balancing water scarcity water overuse and water soil quality in the face of intensifying drought stress for instance the maximum allowable ratio of irrigated land to surrounding desert should be really guaranteed to alleviate the contradiction between water supply and demand and groundwater pumping should be strictly supervised to maintain the continuity of drainage from oasis to desert yin et al 2022 and the principle of preparing for the worst should be applied in the resilient decision making process generally plants can acclimate to increasing drought stress through regulating gene expression and diverse metabolic physiological and structural pathways munson et al 2021 for instance in addition to seasonal differences in water use patterns the h ammodendron exhibits lower photosynthetic capacity and more negative predawn leaf water potential thanthe h persicum during the extreme drought period fig s10 wu et al 2019a also both haloxylon species tend to adjust the number of feeder roots leaves and branches to maintain water carbon balance under water scarcity xu et al 2007 nevertheless as ecological drought becomes widespread the irreversible degradation of these two haloxylon species will be accelerated which may impact the resistance of ecosystem throughout central asia via biodiversity hautier et al 2015 and ultimately catastrophic regime shifts in various ecosystems will be triggered revealingly identifying these impacts and the consequences for ecosystems and human communities are essential for effective drought management equally important is to improve the capacity of nature and humans to prepare for and respond to drought by identifying management strategies that benefit both munson et al 2021 simultaneously multidisciplinary approaches that integrate new scientific knowledge with economic societal and legislative tools as well as coupled models are needed to smarter decisions making for strengthening ecosystem resilience in drylands under global environmental change additionally the development of indicators or comprehensive assessment frameworks for describing ecological drought and the quantitative decomposition of the drivers of ecological drought and their effects in coupled human natural systems in drylands are the focus of future research 5 conclusions our study is conducted to demonstrate the implications of ecological drought induced by both natural and anthropogenic forcings on regime shifts of groundwater dependent ecosystems in arid endorheic basins and ecosystem services of the vegetated desert ecoregions in central asia using modelling approaches in conjunction with field comprehensive measurements we find that two groundwater dependent species the salt tolerant haloxylon ammodendron and salt sensitive haloxylon persicum exhibit contrasting water use strategies being driven by variations in eco physiological traits and environmental regimes nonetheless both vegetation h ammodendron low resilience and h persicum high resilience tend to show bistable transition under drought stress with noises and time delays ecological drought induced by diminishing ecological flows depleting soil moisture and aggravating salinization together with climate forcing is accelerating the catastrophic transitions in both haloxylon ecosystems across central asia in particular intensified drought reduces ecological resilience enhances the likelihood of catastrophic shifts and diminishes ecosystem services of gdes in arid endorheic basins the overall models and results presented here can contribute to more timely and comprehensive management strategies against drought by maintaining resilience for dryland ecosystems in face of ongoing and future

2890,drought has become a major threat to regional sustainable development in drylands ecological drought emphasizing the process of drought impacts on ecosystems in coupled human natural systems has been posing large risks to the stability of groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes in drylands yet the interconnected avenues via which ecological drought drives vegetation transition ecological resilience and ecosystem services in gdes with species specific traits remain elusive especially in arid endorheic basins here we combine comprehensive field measurements derived from representative groundwater depth transects in central asia and simulations obtained from the stochastic eco hydrological models and the langevin approach we find that two groundwater dependent species the salt tolerant haloxylon ammodendron and salt sensitive haloxylon persicum exhibit contrasting water use strategies being driven by variations in eco physiological traits and environmental regimes nonetheless both the low resilient h ammodendron and high resilient h persicum vegetation tend to show bistable transition corresponding to vegetated and bare soils under drought stress with stochastic noises and time delays alarmingly ecological drought is accelerating catastrophic transitions in both haloxylon ecosystems induced by diminishing ecological flows depleting soil moisture and aggravating salinization together with climate forcing in particular exacerbated drought stress reduces ecological resilience enhances the likelihood of catastrophic shifts and reduces ecosystem services of gdes in arid endorheic basins our results highlight that ecological drought adaptation strategies must account for resilience maintenance by balancing water scarcity water overuse and water soil quality to avoid accelerating regime shifts in dryland ecosystems keywords groundwater dependent ecosystems haloxylon ecological drought vegetation transition ecological resilience data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drylands cover 41 of the earth s land surface and host more than 38 of the world s human population berdugo et al 2017 are the largest source of interannual variability in the global carbon sink yao et al 2020 during the current state of anthropocene drought stress is one of the most severe environmental constraints to plant productivity and ecosystem stability munson et al 2021 drought occurrences and their characteristics are largely attributed to both natural and anthropogenic forcings chiang et al 2021 and drought events in globe drylands will become more rampant in the coming decades under current development trajectories and climate change patterns li et al 2017 moreover drought is a creeping multidimensional multiscale phenomenon within human water systems that must be understood as a process as opposed to a product aghakouchak et al 2021 particularly ecological drought i e the process of drought impacts on ecosystems considers the full spectrum of dynamic feedbacks and responses an organism or ecosystem may experience during the intensification of water deficit within a coupled human nature system munson et al 2021 thus insight into how dryland ecosystems respond to increasing drought intensity is extremely relevant as projected increases in aridity across many global regions could drive future dryland expansion and degradation huang et al 2017 especially in arid endorheic hydrologically landlocked basins central asia comprises a large fraction of the world s drylands and more than 80 of the global temperate deserts are located in here zhang et al 2016 is one of the most sensitive areas to climate change and human activities huang et al 2017 yin et al 2021 existing widely in arid endorheic basins of central asia groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes i e aquatic and terrestrial regions whose ecological components rely on groundwater for at least some period of time during their life history are considered fragile and prone to regime shifts orellana et al 2012 eamus et al 2015 liu et al 2021 importantly ecological drought has profound effects on the resilience and stability of such ecosystems ridolfi et al 2006 qin et al 2021 alongside negative ecohydrological and environmental consequences wu et al 2019a yin et al 2022 and potentially diminish the resources and services these ecosystems provide to human societies munson et al 2021 previously paleo ecological records isotope and pollen indicated that the intensification of central asia aridification around 12 ma and triggered the transition of forest vegetation to grassland and desert vegetation zhuang et al 2011 yao et al 2015 in recent decades the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases have influenced natural climate variability which is changing the frequency and intensity of dry spells in central asia huang et al 2017 further anthropogenic pressures e g human induced climate change over development of water land resources and soil water salinization will likely induce more frequent severe and prolonged droughts than currently observed lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 li et al 2017 as drought intensifies plants and ecosystems experience stress which reduces the drought tolerance of plants and increases the vulnerability of ecosystems to drought including a rise in drought driven plant mortality and anticipated ecosystem transformations from one state to another munson et al 2021 thus a more comprehensive understanding of the ecological resilience and regime shifts in gdes driven by ecological drought is critical to sustainable management and effective restoration of such ecosystems regime shifts or catastrophic shifts typically occur when resilience is exceeded and perturbations dramatically alter ecosystem function and structure scheffer et al 2001 ecological resilience the maximum perturbation amplitude that a system can absorb and still recover to its initial stable state holling 1973 is a key indicator for understanding and managing ecosystems subject to regime changes folke et al 2010 the combination of extrinsic and intrinsic noises and deterministic and random time delays is ubiquitous in nature and often fundamentally alters the dynamics of dryland ecosystems gu et al 2007 jia et al 2014 although it is broadly accepted that dryland ecosystems prone to exhibit bistable dynamics with two preferential stable states of desert and vegetated land under natural and anthropogenic induced perturbations d odorico et al 2005 the implications of ecological drought governed by the interplay of changing precipitation evapotranspiration regimes declining groundwater tables diminishing ecological flows intensifying salinization and soil water depletion in coupled natural human systems in plant adaptation strategies e g water use patterns vegetation dynamics ecological stability and ecosystem services of gdes in arid endorheic basins remains mostly unknown moreover the effects of drought stress on species specific resilience in gdes have received limited attention often plants and ecosystems may respond to intensifying drought intensity through gradual or linear changes in performance or may experience thresholds or abrupt nonlinear changes munson et al 2021 also plant species vary in their adaptive capacity and plasticity to withstand drought stress berdugo et al 2017 thus assessing the impact of ecological drought on gdes should accurately and systematically consider the collective differences in drought intensity plant and ecosystem performance and how ecological performance is related to water deficits munson et al 2021 in addition comparing ecological drought responses among plant species or ecosystems in gdes can reveal differences in drought intensity at different stages of regime transitions as well as relative performances of species or ecosystems broadly distributed in central asia haloxylon ammodendron c a mey bunge and h persicum chenopodiaceae bunge are sister taxa in the haloxylon genus with c4 photosynthetic pathway unique morphological and physiological traits have strong resistance to drought high temperatures and other stresses both perennial xero halophytic shrubs have dimorphic root systems and therefore constitute typical gdes xu and li 2006 li et al 2019 wu et al 2019b compared with h ammodendron h persicum is less tolerant to salinity but more drought resistant wu et al 2019a both haloxylon species are of great ecological and economic importance such as sequestering soil carbon supplying food for livestock providing ethnopharmacological resources and sustaining biodiversity and are essential for stabilizing sand dunes to ensure the stable provision of ecosystem services xu et al 2017 li et al 2019 wu et al 2019a already similar to multiple groundwater dependent vegetation intensified drought stress by climate change warming and drying and human activities e g increasing water consumption diminishing ecological flows and aggravating salinization has caused both haloxylon vegetation degradation and further triggered both ecosystems transformations in central asia especially in vegetated desert ecoregions li et al 2019 wu et al 2019a b yin et al 2022 although some recent studies have evaluated the vegetation risks from projected changes in climate regime across central asia zhang et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 li et al 2019 qin et al 2021 liu et al 2021 much less is known about the effects of ecological drought on both haloxylon ecosystems with noises and time delays and how such ecosystems under drought stress lose ecological resilience undergo catastrophic shifts and diminish ecosystem services within coupled human water systems which greatly hampers the prediction of possible future abrupt and irreversible shifts in plants or ecosystems and the feasibility of vegetation restoration projects in dryland environments ridolfi et al 2006 borgogno et al 2012 in light of this issue using field comprehensive measurements and meaningful modelling approaches by comparing the relative susceptibility of plants and ecosystems to drought stress across a environmental gradient our study aims to achieve the following objectives 1 revealing the distinct water use strategies among the two haloxylon species 2 characterizing the bistable transition of two haloxylon vegetation with noises and time delays and 3 evaluating the stability and resilience in the groundwater dependent haloxylon ecosystems finally we demonstrate the implications of drought stress caused or intensified by groundwater levels drop soil water deficit and salinization together with human induced climate forcing in regime shifts and ecological services of the haloxylon ecosystems in arid endorheic basins across central asia in particular we test the hypothesis that changes in ecological resilience resulting from both natural and anthropogenic drivers may be an intermediate cause of subsequent changes in groundwater dependent ecosystems functioning in arid endorheic basins capitalizing on these research knowledges we would provide feasible management and restoration directives for maintaining the sustainability of gdes by resilient decision making under future global changes in drylands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design our study area central asia 46 45 e 96 18 e 35 5 n 52 33 n is located in the hinterland of eurasia fig 1 a the region is characterized by complicated arid and semi arid natural environments e g water limited salt affected groundwater fed that comprise a delicate ecological zone jiang et al 2017 the study area has a temperate continental climate with scarce precipitation and strong evaporation dry and hot summers and cold and freezing winters fig s1 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 major types of vegetation include grasslands 39 34 shrubs 22 27 crops 18 98 sparse vegetation 17 31 and forests 1 50 qin et al 2021 in particular common plants in the vegetated desert ecoregions include haloxylon spp artemisia spp anabasis spp and tamarix spp zhang et al 2016 of which the haloxylon vegetation alone contributes to 21 of the desert biomass li et al 2019 from the paleo ecological records and future scenario simulations yao et al 2015 li et al 2017 climate change has triggered observable vegetation degradation in central asia and intensified further by anthropogenic environmental changes e g groundwater table drops soil moisture deficit and soil water salinization especially in arid endorheic basins in addition the presence of natural and anthropogenic forcings are increasing the drought frequency duration and intensity in the study area fig 1a our research site fig 1b is located in the gurbantunggut desert 4 88 104 km2 which is a typical saline desert in central asia and the largest fixed and semi fixed desert in china the region is covered with massive dendritic sand dunes approximately 1 10 km long and 5 50 m high and orientate from north to south and the predominant soil type is stable or semi stable aeolian sand soil the average annual temperature annual pan evaporation pan diameter 20 cm and annual precipitation are 6 6 c 42 2 44 2 c 2000 mm and 70 150 mm respectively and the 25 precipitation is generally snowfall 24 7 cm deep during november to march wu et al 2019b the groundwater table depth gtd and salinization are gradually increasing from the edge to the hinterland yin et al 2022 the dominant natural vegetation is salt tolerant h ammodendron and salt sensitive h persicum and the former grows at the inter dune lowland and the later settles at the sand dune both showing a seasonal facultative dependence on groundwater according to precipitation variability xu and li 2006 to investigate the responses of h ammodendron and h persicum s water use strategies and the two haloxylon species s eco hydrological feedbacks to drought stress using the space for time substitution approach blois et al 2013 6 representative sites with different groundwater depths forming a gtd gradient were selected and numbered consecutively from south to north by site d1 d6 in this desert ecoregion fig 1b specifically the mean gtd during 2017 2018 from site d1 to site d6 were 7 1 10 3 11 4 12 5 14 2 and 15 9 m at the inter dune lowlands and 11 1 13 4 14 5 16 8 18 6 and 20 5 m at the dune crests respectively the gtd transects cover a total length of 16 km and the differences in physiographic conditions would be negligible additionally vegetation cover is gradually decreasing and desertification is progressively increasing from site d1 to site d6 fig 1c the basic characteristics of each site in the gtd transects are shown in table 1 and fig 1d it is important to note that from site d1 to site d6 the ecological drought caused or intensified by groundwater depletion soil water deficit and salinization due to the overexploitation related to regional modern irrigated agriculture and industrial development together with anthropogenic induced climate forcing gradually exacerbated 2 2 data collection along the gtd transects soil samples were collected within 0 20 20 100 and 100 300 cm soil layer at 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm intervals respectively using a hand auger 5 cm inner diameter with 3 replicates at the inter dune lowland

physicochemical properties table 1 along a soil profile 0 150 cm at a 10 cm interval with 3 replications were determined following the standard methods bao 2000 groundwater signatures were obtained from observation wells fig s1 constructed by the cas at the inter dune lowland in each site the gtds were measured three times per month during 2018 2019 using a groundwater meter model 101 solinst

coordinates of site location were determined by a gps receiver etrex vistacx garmin usa with approximately 3 m accuracy the vegetation investigations table 1 in 20 m 20 m quadrat with three replications at the inter dune lowland and dune crest in each site were conducted in early summer 2020 besides this root distributions the base diameter is 4 8 cm of h ammodendron and h persicum were investigated using the whole root excavation method fig s1 and detailed in situ excavation and comprehensive measurements have been reported in previous studies xu and li 2006 further daily meteorological data were obtained from an automatic weather station campbell scientific logan utah usa installed near the site d1 also an eddy covariance flux tower at this site was installed to obtain direct field evapotranspiration measurements additionally the stable isotope δ 2h and δ 18o data for soil water and groundwater samples as well as eco physiological indicators of two haloxylon species were got in previous studies xu et al 2007 wu et al 2019b 2 3 model development 2 3 1 stochastic salinity dependent root water uptake model in order to reveal the distinct water use strategies among the two haloxylon species by considering the effect of salinity on evapotranspiration et and the feedback between direct shallow groundwater uptake and upper root zone saturation we introduce a simple but realistic stochastic root water uptake model for water limited halophytes that extract water with dimorphic root systems fig 2 a on the basis of the earlier model suweis et al 2010 we consider a homogeneous soil column with root zone depth zr averaged soil porosity n relative soil moisture s salt mass m and salt concentration c m n z r s and groundwater table depth zg the water

characterize the bistable transition of two haloxylon vegetation and to investigate the effect of the feedback between drought stress and vegetation dynamics according to the field observed phenomena by considering the influence of multiple noise factors e g hydrological fluctuations grazing and pests interferences extreme temperatures and saline stress and time delays e g hysteresis effect between the groundwater table decline and soil water depletion and the plant root water uptake process due to root growth in the interplays between vegetation and environmental changes we develop a stochastic delay differential equation for modelling vegetation dynamics in groundwater dependent ecosystems following noy meir 1975 and ridolfi et al 2006 changes in groundwater dependent vegetation are modeled by a logical curve that describes the growth death process with noises and time delays the ecosystem carrying capacity vcc is described by a piecewise function of water stress ws that takes into account drought stress induced by groundwater and soil water deficits salinity stress together with climate forcing fig 2b and the influence of groundwater pumping on vegetation dynamics is also considered therefore the stochastic time delayed vegetation dynamics model is given by 6 dv dt α 0 v v cc v v ϑ ψ t φ t 7 v cc a 1 1 w s a 1 z g z inf q z g z inf a 1 z inf z g z sup a 1 κ z g z

seasonal oscillations of zg respectively a detailed derivation of this model can be found in supplementary text s2 overall the stochastic time delayed vegetation dynamics model linking groundwater table dynamics and vegetation stress with explicit consideration of climate soil and plant characteristics that is the combination of k and q controls ecological resilience regime shifts and ecosystem services in groundwater dependent ecosystems porporato et al 2001 according to the measured vegetation data along the defined groundwater depth transects fig 1b we performed a series of direct numerical simulations for the time delayed stochastic model using the euler maruyama scheme with a integration step of 0 001 and the data of probability distribution are saved over 500 different trajectories also we generated gaussian white noise gwn from two random numbers uniformly distributed in the unit interval by the box mueller algorithm we conducted 1000 simulations to determine this limit of stability the deterministic potential u v with d v dt d u dv associated with the different regimes of the vegetation dynamics can be used to determine the stable equilibrium states of the system d odorico et al 2005 the quasi steady state probability distribution function of vegetation biomass pst v is provided in supplementary text s3 2 3 3 langevin approach for ecological resilience estimation in order to assess the ecological stability of the groundwater dependent haloxylon ecosystems in response to exacerbating drought stress we estimate the mean exit time using the langevin approach to measure ecological resilience fig 2c in such ecosystems and further the changes in ecological resilience under intensified drought stress are compared using the space for time substitution approach blois et al 2013 importantly the mean exit time i e the expected time required to cross a threshold such as the border of an attraction basin proposed by arani et al 2021 provides a new angle for anticipating critical transitions under both natural and anthropogenic drivers across diverse ecosystems according to arani et al 2021 the mean exit time of the ecosystem is estimated by the following steps i standardize the v time series by the dynamic linear models ii test the markov hypothesis for standardized time series iii detect the stationarity of the standardized time series by the augmented dickey fuller test iv system reconstruction i e estimate the deterministic and stochastic components of a langevin model and v estimate the mean exit time and its confidence limits from the basin of attraction for the ecosystem states importantly the standardized time series is used as state variable vt to estimate the drift diffusion model known as the langevin equation 9 dv d 1 v d t 2 d 2 v d w where d 1 v is the drift term d 2 v is the diffusion term and describes as d 2 v σ v 2 2 with σ v is the noise intensity fluctuation in the langevin model we use absorbing boundaries for the unstable edge between two basins of attraction and reflecting conditions at the left and right boundaries to indicate that no shift occurs by solving the fokker planck equation the mean exit time t v for state variable v is derived as arani et al 2021 10 d 1 v d t dv d 2 v d 2 t d v 2 1 further we estimated the probability weighted mean of t v using probabilities extracted from the normalized stationary density of the fokker planck equation arani et al 2021 particularly a detailed description of the full details mathematical proofs and related formulas and matlab codes of the langevin approach for measuring the ecological resilience is presented by arani et al 2021 2 4 model parameterization in this study the model parameterization involves two haloxylon species i e h ammodendron at the inter dune lowland and h persicum at the dune crest in six different groundwater depth sites i e site d1 to site d6 during the growing season i e from april to october rainfall is modeled at the daily timescale as a marked poisson process with frequency of occurrence λ exponentially distributed rainfall depths with mean α and interception threshold δ laio et al 2001 specifically from long term daily rainfall data 2000 2020 the α λ from april to october was 0 15 1 21 0 14 1 20 0 25 1 23 0 14 1 25 0 23 2 12 0 25 3 12 and 0 12 2 13 cm d 1 respectively the average soil saturation s of the deep stable unsaturated zone zr z zc and the czc and czg in each site were estimated from the measured deep soil moisture and soil salinity fig 2e f the threshold of rainfall interception δ for shrub is set to 0 2 cm d 1 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 we indirectly estimated the leaf area index ξ based on the allometric method and vegetation coverage yan et al 2019 the rooting zone depth zr and soil porosity n were determined from the in situ measurements the etmax is assumed to decrease linearly with depth daly et al 2009 and was determined using the ec measurements in every month during 2011 2020 the values of s and other soil characteristic parameters were adapted from laio et al 2001 the parameter c in the function rc z was obtained by fitting field survey data xu and li 2006 xu et al 2017 and as shown in fig 2g the values of ε d σ and τ are referenced and modified from borgogno et al 2012 and jia et al 2014 the parameters a ψ a 1 and α 0 are derived from ridolfi et al 2006 and borgogno et al 2012 the values of k z 0 z inf z sup q and κ are adapted and modified from porporato et al 2001 jia et al 2014 and yin et al 2022 the measured v at inter dune lowland dune crest from site d1 to site d6 is 0 410 0 120 0 397 0 050 0 248 0 045 0 314 0 039 0 038 0 027 and 0 016 0 011 respectively the parameters of the langevin model are obtained and modified from arani et al 2021 note that due to the lack of high resolution time series of v we replaced it with the model generated data by the stochastic time delayed model equations 6 8 tables 2 s2 s3 summarize the parameter values used in this study groundwater related parameterization has carefully considered dune height additionality we validated the stochastic root water uptake model with stable isotope data and calibrated the stochastic vegetation dynamics model with field survey data 3 results 3 1 seasonal variation in plant water use strategies the stochastic salinity dependent root water uptake model revealed that the h ammodendron and h persicum had different water use patterns over the growing season in this study area fig 3 a b as shown the two species possessed distinct dominant water sources with h ammodendron dependent more heavily on shallow groundwater 65 1 93 4 yet the contribution of root zone water and deep soil water were in the range of 4 7 19 9 and 1 9 19 9 respectively whereas h persicum relying more on root zone water 83 4 97 5 but the contribution of deep soil water and groundwater accounted for 1 1 1 6 and 1 4 15 5 respectively moreover both plants exhibited similar seasonal water uptake patterns at the different studied sites with the utilization rate of root zone water was the highest in april the isotopic data from field studies fig s2 also demonstrated similar findings in this study area carried out sensitivity analysis showed that the interplay of precipitation regimes α and λ and water table dynamics zg has a considerable influence on water use strategies of both haloxylon species in this study area fig 3c f as illustrated for h ammodendron groundwater subsidy increases clearly with precipitation decreases and groundwater depth increases and deep soil water uptake also increased slightly while root zone water use decreases sharply for h persicum as the climate becomes strongly drier α 0 2 d 1 and λ 0 15 cm root zone water uptake decreases dramatically but the utilization of groundwater increases significantly in contrast h ammodendron is more sensitive to variations in water table whereas h persicum is more sensitive to changes in precipitation regimes corresponding root zone soil moisture status figs s3 s4 further the root morphology i e parameter c see fig 2g is a key determinant of water availability thereby is fundamental in dominating the water use strategies of these two desert shrubs and in buffering or delaying the effects of increasing drought stress importantly both root zone salinity and groundwater salinity table 1 and fig 1d also had clear effects on the root water uptake of these two plants in the study area particularly for salt sensitive h persicum fig s5 suggesting that the effect of salinity on water use patterns depends on plant salt tolerance and can evidently vary across species interestingly by using the space for time substitution approach across site d1 to site d6 we found that the interplay of groundwater degradation zg gec and soil water salt stress of root zone czr szr has a significant ecohydrological control on the vegetation dynamics of the two haloxylon species fig 3g h these results indicate that plant water use strategies is substantially influenced by governing environmental conditions and species specific traits which in turn affects vegetation dynamics and the stability of plant ecosystems 3 2 vegetation dynamics with noises and time delays the numerical simulation results of the temporal evolution and probability distribution of the vegetation biomass v for h ammodendron and h persicum from site d1 to site d6 demonstrated that groundwater table fluctuations are acting as a source of disturbance on the groundwater dependent plant ecosystems and affecting their stability especially for h ammodendron fig 4 a b as presented under given the combination of noises periodic signal as well as time delays the v of h ammodendron mainly revolves around the relatively high coverage vegetated state when the water table is shallow but the drop in water table causes the system to transition between two alternative stable states corresponding to vegetated and bare soils whereas for h persicum the v initially fluctuates around the low coverage vegetated desert state and the decline in water table leads to the desert state to become populated fig 4c d illustrates the influences of time delays τ and ϑ drought inducible factors q and k extrinsic and intrinsic noises ε and d on the vegetation dynamics pst v of these two haloxylon plants it is clear that the effect of time delay in fluctuation force is opposite to that in deterministic force ϑ can enhance while τ can suppress the fluctuation and τ is more sensitive further as the increase of q i e the increase in drought stress induced by factors other than the water table the height of peak in pst v increases significantly v is more concentrated and vcc decreases notably fig s6 however as the increase of k i e the gtd drops the position of peak in pst v shifts dramatically to low v and the peak height increases clearly for a small noise intensity ε or d the pst v shows a single peak yet as the value of ε or d increases the height and position of peak at a larger v decrease also a new peak appears at a smaller v these results suggest that the interplay of drought stress with noises and time delays can cause the groundwater dependent ecosystems exhibit bistable dynamics in this study area from the potential u v point of view we investigated the effects of drought stress induced by both natural and anthropogenic forcings on the bifurcation diagram of the two haloxylon vegetation fig 4e f as shown both haloxylon ecosystems exhibited a bistable transition corresponding to vegetated and bare soils separated by a sharp breakpoint involving a saddle node bifurcation and catastrophic transition occurring at the critical value i e the tipping point of the drought stress notably the critical value of the combination of k and q of h persicum is clearly greater than that of h ammodendron indicating that the vegetation h persicum has clearly higher ecological resilience with larger temporal autocorrelation and variance fig s7 overall these findings seem to suggest that the ecological drought governed by the groundwater levels drop soil water deficit and salinization together with human induced climate forcing could play an important role in determining future stability and resilience of gdes in drylands especially in arid endorheic basins with human overexploitation 3 3 ecological resilience and catastrophic transitions the mean exit time of vegetation h ammodendron and h persicum was estimated based on the langevin approach using model generated data to measure ecological resilience in the study area figs 5 and s8 as illustrated both long term highly resolved datasets approximately meet the assumptions for the langevin approach and the effective potential revealed two stable basins and the low v basin appears shallower than the high v basin for both haloxylon vegetation fig s8 it is intriguing that the mean exit times of the low and high v basins are 17 years with confidence limits 95 of 14 21 and 292 years with 254 355 for h ammodendron respectively but are 75 years with confidence limits 62 89 and 749 years with confidence limits 660 837 for h persicum fig 5 c d this results suggest that once both haloxylon vegetation flips the high v basin into the low v basin both ecosystems can soon catastrophic shifts to bare soil state especially the h ammodendron ecosystem we further investigated the implications of ecological drought in the stability and ecosystem services of gdes and characterized the catastrophic transitions of both haloxylon ecosystems under the control of different drought stress scenarios the space for time substitution approach across central asia fig 5 as presented the interactions and feedbacks between human induced climate change increasing water consumption land use cover change and aggravating river basin salinization over time and space are causing or intensifing the ecological drought which are exacerbating catastrophic regime shifts in both haloxylon ecosystems and degrading a range of ecosystem service functions e g carbon sequestration biodiversity wind prevention and sand fixation in particular declining groundwater tables diminishing ecological flows changing precipitation and snowmelt patterns and intensifying soil water salinization induced by human footprint are threatening the sustainability of gdes in arid endorheic basins fig 5a b ultimately these ecological service impacts will feedback to both natural and human systems nonetheless groundwater dependent vegetation can acclimate to increasing drought intensity by changing water use strategies physiological responses as well as morphological adjustments alarmingly drought stress can be aggravated in the future due to the compounding effects of human activities and climatic changes carried out scenario analysis showed that drought stress reduces the resilience of gdes and enhances the likelihood of catastrophic transitions fig 5 accordingly with the intensification of ecological drought the h ammodendron ecosystem will degrade dramatically with low resilience and the h persicum ecosystem will slowly collapse with high resilience fig 5e f as well as a sequence of eco hydrological and eco environmental consequences e g shrinking lakes desertification saltstorms and sandstorms will be triggered across central asia these results suggest that exacerbated drought accelerates catastrophic shifts in both haloxylon ecosystems via reducing ecological resilience and conservation policies for such ecosystems should encourage management procedures that maintain or restore ecological resilience or minimize the negative impacts of anthropogenic environmental changes on the loss of resilience to ensure the stable provision of ecosystem services 4 discussion 4 1 ecohydrological model reveal contrasting water use strategies among two haloxylon species modelling root water uptake provides a powerful tool for studying the close association of groundwater dependent vegetation with spatiotemporal variations in soil water and groundwater feddes et al 2001 and helps to better assess future shifts in dryland vegetation structure and composition in response to predicted environmental changes wu et al 2019b our simulations revealed that the two haloxylon species had contrasting water use strategies over the growth period fig 3 i e the h ammodendron largely depended on groundwater while the h persicum relied mainly on root zone water which was replenished by precipitation this finding is basically consistent with the isotopic results of wu etal 2019a suggesting that the stochastic ecohydrological model equation 5 is effective in simulating root water uptake in gdes however we assume complete compensation below zr in this model and do not make any limiting assumptions about the roots depth below zr this means that the deep roots will use the maximum available water to access the location either groundwater or another deep store at any depth this is inconsistent with plant water uptake strategies by trading off water carbon costs guswa 2010 thus this limitation warrants further studies to optimize the results presented here additionally the space for time substitution approach blois et al 2013 is widely and effectively applied in ecological modelling to infer past or future trajectories of ecosystems from contemporary spatial patterns coexisting plant species often adopt contrasting resource use strategies via differences in key traits moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 and water available for root uptake is influenced by a suite of factors e g climatic hydrogeologic root architecture feddes et al 2001 lowry and loheide ii 2010 pierret et al 2017 our results show that plant water use strategies is substantially controlled by governing environmental conditions and species specific traits eco physiological traits specifically the interplay of precipitation regimes and water table dynamics has a great impact on the water use strategies of both haloxylon species vervoort and van der zee 2009 grossiord et al 2017 soil physical properties differed across dune micro topography table 1 and the role of soil texture in plant water uptake can be understood by how it regulates the downward infiltration and the upward capillary rise though root zone wu et al 2019a cai et al 2021 also plant rooting patterns e g dimorphic root systems affect the resilience of ecosystems to environmental stresses such as drought fan et al 2017 further the effect of salinity on evapotranspiration depend on plant salt tolerance and may vary remarkably across species perri et al 2018 this may be a strong evidence for why the use of groundwater high salinity water fig 1d by deep roots of h persicum salt sensitive plant is very limited and this plant rarely settle at inter dune lowland high salinity soil fig s9 in our study area thorburn et al 1995 wu et al 2019a together our results suggest that to a certain extent water use strategies strongly influence the responses of the two haloxylon species to their fluctuating environmental conditions 4 2 vegetation transition and ecological resilience under drought stress with noises and time delays quantitatively assessing the effects of noise correlations and time delays on dryland ecosystems has significant implications to understand the complex dynamics of such ecosystems under environmental stress conditions zeng and wang 2012 our findings suggest that although there is notable differences in water use strategies between the salt tolerant h ammodendron and salt sensitive h persicum both groundwater dependent haloxylon vegetation prone to exhibit bistable dynamics with two alternative states of vegetated and bare soils under compounding effects of noises and time delays the delay time τ appears in the deterministic force can suppress while ϑ presents in the fluctuation force can enhance the fluctuation of system gu et al 2007 it is important to note that time delays can also induce changes in bistability in the presence of noises e g for smaller time delays noises enhances ecosystem stability but for larger time delays noises accelerates ecosystem catastrophic transitions zeng and wang 2012 groundwater table fluctuations i e the parameter k and other environmental perturbations i e the parameter q have significant effects on vegetation dynamics of both haloxylon species particularly the vegetation groundwater salinity dynamics greatly control the resilience of dryland plant ecosystems runyan and d odorico 2010 these results highlight the central role of drought stress induced by both natural and anthropogenic forcings i e the combination of k and q in controlling the long term vegetation dynamics of gdes in drylands additionally although the stochastic time delayed vegetation dynamics model equations 6 8 simplifies the complex ecohydrological mechanisms that driving these ecosystems as well as neglecting interspecies interactions this model capturing some major aspects of the interplay between environmental fluctuations and vegetation dynamics exit time as an intuitive and realistic measure of ecological resilience depends not only on the environmental perturbations but also on the size of the attraction basin improves our understanding of the dynamical properties e g regime transitions of complex and fragile ecosystems under environmental perturbations arani et al 2021 one of the main challenges of the langevin approach equations 9 10 in practical applications is that it requires long high resolution time series in order to reduce the uncertainty of mean exit time estimates as arani et al 2021 revealed although the model generated datasets tend to overestimate randomness around unstable points the mean exit time is closely related to the time that can be derived directly from the original model thus the results of langevin approach based on the model generated datasets by the stochastic time delayed model are reliable in this study xie 2001 reported that the abandoning cycle of oases i e the oases evolved into deserts in xinjiang is 500 to 600 years with the lagging time 300 to 400 years and the stability of oasis is negatively correlated with the degree of agricultural development this is basically in accordance with the mean exit time of 749 years with confidence limits 660 837 for gdes under drought stress in this study area fig 5d we demonstrate that in contrast vegetation h persicum has higher resilience i e the larger mean exit time but the h ammodendron ecosystem is more prone to catastrophic shifts particularly in the low v state importantly the early warning signals for critical transitions were captured in this study fig 4e f this findings highlight the potential of applying the critical thresholds to avoid such ecosystems collapse and provides opportunities for positive changes scheffer et al 2009 berdugo et al 2017 further the regime shifts of both vegetation between adjacent studied sites is closely connected and the coexistence of the two haloxylon species may increase the resilience of the gdes in arid endorheic basins 4 3 exacerbated drought impacts on ecological stability of gdes and management implications our findings suggest that ecological drought is exacerbating catastrophic shifts in both haloxylon ecosystems and weakening ecological services of vegetated desert ecoregions in arid endorheic basins driven by diminishing ecological flows depleting soil moisture and aggravating salinization together with human induced climate forcing in particular the overexploitation related to the development of modern intensive irrigated agriculture has dramatically altered the water salt balance among oasis desert system in arid endorheic basins yin et al 2022 the projected intensification and expansion of irrigated agriculture would invariably increase the risk of salinization and groundwater degradation due to the growing reliance on marginal land and water sources in drylands assouline et al 2015 moreover because of salinization acts as an aridity enhancer perri et al 2020 thereby the drastic soil and water salinization shifts maybe trigger the transition of ecosystems to more stable permanent degradation states in drylands d odorico et al 2013 in addition owing to snowpack stores cold season precipitation is to fulfill warm season water demand qin et al 2020 the variations in the amount of snowfall and the timing of snowmelt as well as rising temperatures may reduce the availability of soil moisture and affect the drought resilience of such ecosystems jobbágy et al 2011 wu et al 2019a together ecological drought is believed to reduce the resilience of gdes enhance the likelihood of catastrophic shifts and diminish the functioning of ecosystem services in drylands here drought stress may affect resilience by changing both system parameters e g the position of critical thresholds and recovery rates and state variables e g vegetation cover or population size these findings reveal the fundamental and dominant role played by ecological drought in determining the stability and services of gdes in arid endorheic basins it is important to note that drought stress can be intensified in the future due to the compounding effects of climate change and human activities li et al 2017 aghakouchak et al 2021 if climate change intensifies and or prolongs droughts the overall negative impact for gdes will be even greater our study highlights that realistic strategies for sustainable management of such ecosystems in arid endorheic basins should focus on maintaining ecological resilience by balancing water scarcity water overuse and water soil quality in the face of intensifying drought stress for instance the maximum allowable ratio of irrigated land to surrounding desert should be really guaranteed to alleviate the contradiction between water supply and demand and groundwater pumping should be strictly supervised to maintain the continuity of drainage from oasis to desert yin et al 2022 and the principle of preparing for the worst should be applied in the resilient decision making process generally plants can acclimate to increasing drought stress through regulating gene expression and diverse metabolic physiological and structural pathways munson et al 2021 for instance in addition to seasonal differences in water use patterns the h ammodendron exhibits lower photosynthetic capacity and more negative predawn leaf water potential thanthe h persicum during the extreme drought period fig s10 wu et al 2019a also both haloxylon species tend to adjust the number of feeder roots leaves and branches to maintain water carbon balance under water scarcity xu et al 2007 nevertheless as ecological drought becomes widespread the irreversible degradation of these two haloxylon species will be accelerated which may impact the resistance of ecosystem throughout central asia via biodiversity hautier et al 2015 and ultimately catastrophic regime shifts in various ecosystems will be triggered revealingly identifying these impacts and the consequences for ecosystems and human communities are essential for effective drought management equally important is to improve the capacity of nature and humans to prepare for and respond to drought by identifying management strategies that benefit both munson et al 2021 simultaneously multidisciplinary approaches that integrate new scientific knowledge with economic societal and legislative tools as well as coupled models are needed to smarter decisions making for strengthening ecosystem resilience in drylands under global environmental change additionally the development of indicators or comprehensive assessment frameworks for describing ecological drought and the quantitative decomposition of the drivers of ecological drought and their effects in coupled human natural systems in drylands are the focus of future research 5 conclusions our study is conducted to demonstrate the implications of ecological drought induced by both natural and anthropogenic forcings on regime shifts of groundwater dependent ecosystems in arid endorheic basins and ecosystem services of the vegetated desert ecoregions in central asia using modelling approaches in conjunction with field comprehensive measurements we find that two groundwater dependent species the salt tolerant haloxylon ammodendron and salt sensitive haloxylon persicum exhibit contrasting water use strategies being driven by variations in eco physiological traits and environmental regimes nonetheless both vegetation h ammodendron low resilience and h persicum high resilience tend to show bistable transition under drought stress with noises and time delays ecological drought induced by diminishing ecological flows depleting soil moisture and aggravating salinization together with climate forcing is accelerating the catastrophic transitions in both haloxylon ecosystems across central asia in particular intensified drought reduces ecological resilience enhances the likelihood of catastrophic shifts and diminishes ecosystem services of gdes in arid endorheic basins the overall models and results presented here can contribute to more timely and comprehensive management strategies against drought by maintaining resilience for dryland ecosystems in face of ongoing and future

2891,as an important surface water resource that can be directly used water bodies wbs have a non negligible impact on human life production and maintaining ecological balance over the past few decades how many wb have changed to different degrees due to climate change dam construction and other factors using the high resolution wb mask dataset and dam point data the study distinguished artificial and natural wbs calculated their spatiotemporal changes and quantified climatic and human contributions in 17 basins in inland china during 1987 2020 the results show wbs exhibited a spatial pattern of contraction in the northeast and expansion in the southwest in inland china the total artificial and natural area of inland wbs in china increased by 38 8 32 3 40 8 from 1987 to 2020 respectively in the western basins of china such as inland rivers in northern tibet 61 upper yellow river 61 upper yangtze river 52 inland rivers in xinjiang 51 climate change dominates the increase of wbs while in the eastern basins such as the middle and lower yangtze river 60 84 lower yangtze river 60 53 and songhua basins 52 66 dam construction is the main reason for the area change in wbs the analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of wbs in inland china in the past three decades and the quantification of climate and human contributions are of great significance for the rational development and sustainable use of water resources keywords water bodies artificial water body area climate change dam construction inland china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wbs such as lakes reservoirs and ponds play an important role in all aspects of human society and ecosystems surface freshwater accounts for only about 0 8 of the earth s surface gleick 1996 but supplies nearly 78 of urban dwellers 1 2 billion people with domestic water mcdonald et al 2014 and lakes and rivers account for about 88 of the surface freshwater available to humans gleick 1996 making them the most important source of surface freshwater resources song et al 2020 and a veritable oasis of life suring 2020 in addition to supplying water for basic human domestic use wbs also play an important role in agricultural irrigation edwards and nehra 2020 and industrial production du plessis and anja 2020 in human society at the same time the role played by wbs in ecosystem services should not be underestimated wbs are closely related to the normal circulation of biochemical systems climate regulation and habitat protection for wildlife xie et al 1999 salick 2006 as an important carrier of the water cycle wbs can regulate the flow of rivers and have a positive impact on maintaining the regional water balance han et al 2003 wang and ma 2009 yu and jiang 2003 in addition wbs have the ecological function of regulating regional climate and are sensitive to the corresponding regional environment and human activities han et al 2003 ding et al 2006 xie 2019 and are known as sensitive indicators of climate change guo et al 2003 ma et al 2010 on the one hand the formation distribution and evolution of wbs are influenced by changes in the natural environment and thus can better reflect changes in the regional geomorphological environment and climate on the other hand they are also influenced by human modification activities xie 2019 man made water management projects such as dam construction water diversion hydropower engineering have profoundly altered the natural patterns of wbs and created spatially distributed artificial wbs fig 1 and the dynamic change process of wbs can also reflect the impact of human activities on the ecological environment under the trend of rapid global economic development and continuous population growth the relationship between human and land has become increasingly tense and the excessive exploitation of water resources by humans has led to a significant decrease in wb area and a gradual deterioration of water quality which is harmful to the balance of ecosystems and the conservation of biodiversity and the emergence of these problems runs counter to the goal of achieving sustainable development that harmonizes socioeconomic development with population resources and the environment therefore the environmental problems of lake hydrology and water quality have been included in the key research topics of the global water resources program of the international geosphere biosphere program igbp rapley 1996 and have attracted the attention of more and more experts and scholars worldwide china is a resource based water scarce country with uneven regional distribution of water resources population and economic development and wbs under the influence of various climate and human densities show different regional dynamics in recent decades china s rapid socio economic development accelerated urbanization construction process and increasing demand for water resources a series of human activities such as enclosing lakes to make fields intercepting surface runoff and over exploitation of groundwater together with the background of global warming have caused a sharp reduction in the area of wbs and some wbs even face the unfavorable situation of extinction for example the expansion of agricultural irrigation areas and agricultural irrigation water consumption in the songliao basin one of the important grain production bases in china has directly caused water resources problems such as decreasing river and groundwater levels xie 2019 which has brought negative effects on the wb area however the rapid expansion of wb area in the qinghai tibet plateau region since the 21st century under the combined effect of increased precipitation and glacial melting will cause water system reconfiguration in 20 basins and potential flood risks for china s critical infrastructure such as the qinghai tibet railway song et al 2013 ma et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 how water management and planning adapts to climate change and enhanced human activities relies heavily on understanding long term trends and spatial dynamics of the area of wbs ipcc 2014 in addition due to the need for economic development and reduction of thermal power carbon emissions as an important national strategy to support the construction of ecological civilization and achieve sustainable and high quality socio economic development china s dam construction develops rapidly and the number of dams accounted for 40 6 of the global total ranking first in the world huang et al 2021 causing a detrimental impact on the environment due to increased evapotranspiration and greenhouse gas emissions cooley et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to take a continuous and accurate overview of the history and the ongoing changes of dam construction on wbs to provide a scientific basis for maintaining the ecological balance of basins and the sustainable use of water resources piao et al 2010 oki and kanae 2006 feng feng et al 2019 used landsat images from 1984 to 2015 to reveal the size abundance and shoreline area relationships of wbs in china and tao tao et al 2020 used landsat images to explore the changes in chinese lakes and their associated drivers over the past 30 years existing studies show large differences in trends in water body changes in different regions of china and such changes are mainly driven by human activities and climate change but the extent of the impact of these two drivers still lacks a more quantitative description in addition these studies are more general descriptions of total wb changes lacks of the distinction between artificial and natural wb types and the long term and high resolution description of their respective spatial and temporal variations are still exist cooley cooley et al 2021 combined water body data from 2018 to 2020 and reservoir data to delineate the seasonal variation in global surface water storage driven by natural and dam construction enabling quantification of human impacts on global surface water storage which provides a new idea for the quantitative study of the impact of dam construction on wb changes however there is still a lack of longer time series and finer spatial scale descriptions of the extent of climate and dam construction influences on wb changes in china in this study we combine climate type and water resources zoning to divide mainland china into 17 sub basins using state of the art long term high resolution wb mask dataset and dam point data see methods we first distinguish natural and artificial wbs between 1987 and 2020 we then analyze the temporal trend and spatial patterns of total natural and artificial wbs at different area grade based on these results we further attribute climate and human influences and contributions to the evolution of different wbs using meteorological data and artificial wb area result a database of china s artificial wb from 1987 to 2020 was also generated in 56 763 individual wb with areas as small as 0 009 km2 the dataset and results in this study can improve our understanding of anthropogenic modifications to wbs with a view to contributing to more relevant research in the future 2 study area china is a vast country with a large number and variety of wbs and the total amount of water resources is relatively abundant but the spatial distribution is uneven the number and area of wbs in the eastern wb area and the qinghai tibetan wb area account for 62 7 and 77 2 of the national total forming two dense wb groups the freshwater wb group in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and the plateau wb group in the qinghai tibet plateau but in the northeast yunnan and guizhou wb areas the number and area of wbs account for a relatively small number of wbs belonging to a more sparse wb distribution area ma et al 2011 considering the vast and heterogeneous territory of china the spatial distribution and spatio temporal variation of wbs across different climatic zones and geomorphological environments show different regional characteristics seventeen basin division is used to analyze the characteristics of wbs in different regions at a finer scale in this study fig 1 namely songhua river shr liao river lr inner mongolia inland river imr hai river hai inland rivers in xinjiang xjr

and upper yangtze river muyang southeastern river ser lancang river lcr pearl river pr and brahmaputra brah the seventeen basins are labeled in the above order in fig 1 these 17 hydrologic and climatic regions were delineated according to the koppen geiger climate type peel et al 2007 to ensure that the regional climate has an almost uniform character when zoned zhang and ye 2020 among them inner mongolia inland river has the largest area of 1 537 520 km2 and southeastern basin has the smallest area of 226 496 km2 3 data and methods the overall work flow of the study includes two parts data collection and methods the data part mainly includes the collection and processing of wb mask dataset dam point data and meteorological data the method includes creating wb mask in inland china from 1987 to 2022 and analyzing its temporal and spatial changes identification of artificial wb and attribution of wb changes the work flow chart is shown in fig 2 3 1 data 3 1 1 wb mask dataset in this study the monthly scale global wb data provided by jrc joint research centre monthly water history v1 3 dataset was called and downloaded from google earth engine cloud platform through python api google earth engine is a cloud based planetary level geospatial analysis platform that not only enables online invocation of massive geospatial datasets but also online processing and calculation and supports rapid visualization of results providing experts and scholars in the traditional remote sensing field with convenient data acquisition and data processing and saving a lot of time and money it is convenient for experts and scholars in the field of traditional remote sensing to acquire and process data saving a lot of time and computational resources the jrc monthly water history v1 3 dataset contains maps of the spatial and temporal locations of surface waters on a global scale from 1984 to 2020 and provides statistics on the extent and changes of these surface waters this dataset uses 4 453 989 remotely sensed satellite images acquired from landsat 5 7 and 8 between march 16 1984 and december 31 2020 to quantify global surface water changes over the past 30 years at a resolution of 30 m each pixel is individually classified as a waterbody or non waterbody using an expert system the jrc monthly water history dataset is based on monthly scale data and collects waterbody monitoring results over longer time periods most of the information of this data is directly derived from the global water body change dataset with a resolution of 30 m for more than 30 years made by pekel pekel et al 2016 a total of 40 124 control points distributed both geographically globally temporally across the 32 years and across sensors tm etm and oli are used to verify its reliability and the results show that the errors of omission overall is less than 5 and the commission error is less than 1 at present this dataset has been widely recognized and applied shuailong feng feng et al 2019 used this data set to conduct a more detailed analysis of the temporal and spatial patterns of wb changes on the chinese scale and verified the controversial power scaling law of wb size abundance relationship sarah w cooley cooley et al 2021 made a wb mask based on this dataset then combined with satellite altimetry data and global reservoir database to generate the first global dataset of seasonal water storage changes and divide the natural variability of surface water storage from the variability of human management in order to further evaluate the quality of wb data in the jrc dataset we first used the modis land cover data of china with 500 meter resolution and igbp classification system from 2001 to 2019 to obtain the wb area of china from 2001 to 2019 and compared the results with the results of the jrc data supplementary fig s2 the change trend of china s total wb area obtained from the two types of data is consistent both rising the upward trend obtained by modis is more stable the upward trend of wb area obtained by jrc is relatively fluctuating the difference of statistical results of wb area between the two types of data sets is 28 40 furthermore to more intuitively reflect the difference in the degree of description of wbs between the two types of data sets we selected tai lake for comparative mapping supplementary fig s3 it can be seen from the figure that jrc monthly water history v1 3 depicts the morphology of wb more carefully and accurately at the same time we have also done quantitative research under the selected tai lake area the wb area of this area counted by jrc dataset is 3402 km2 while the wb area counted by modis in the same area is 3089 km2 the reason why the statistical result of jrc dataset is larger than that of modis is that the latter has a lower resolution of 500 m resulting in incomplete statistics of some small scale wbs and rivers and the underestimation of the wb area supplementary fig s3 f g h i as a continuous validated wb dataset on a global scale the jrc monthly water history dataset demonstrates that the effects of climate change and climate oscillations on surface water occurrence can be measured and how surface water is altered by human activities can be accounted for based on the data collected the publicly available freely accessible jrc waterbody dataset is expected to provide information to support management decisions for waterbody resources pekel et al 2016 3 1 2 dam point data global dam point data from global georeferenced database of dams goodd mulligan et al 2020 which contains concrete walled dams observable from landsat 15 m ikonos less than1 m and spot 2 5 m global satellite imagery and captures existing globally assessed large and medium sized dams from grand and icold is the most comprehensive global dam georeference database to date containing more than 38 000 dams and their associated catchments including 9 235 dams in the china region parameters such as dam point ids latitude and longitude coordinates perimeters and areas are provided in the goodd dataset for use in the form of vector points 3 1 3 meteorological data the meteorological data used in this study were obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd a gridded dataset from january 1979 to the present currently december 2018 through the fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis datasets and field data with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and a temporal resolution is 3 h its grid points are uniformly distributed over 70 140 e 15 55 n providing 2 m air temperature surface pressure and specific humidity 10 m wind speed downward short wave radiation downward long wave radiation and precipitation rate data with valid values for grid points in mainland china the quality of cmfd is better than gldas global land data assimilation system because the number of sites used to generate cmfd is larger than the number of sites used in gldas as one of the most popular datasets in the chinese land surface research community cmfd with its long length stability and continuity has been widely used in climate model validation climate zone classification crop planting programs and many other terrestrial research areas he et al 2020 3 2 methods 3 2 1 spatial and temporal changes of wb the jrc monthly water history v1 3 wb dataset is a monthly scale global image which has only one water bitmask band with three value cases of 0 1 2 where 0 represents no data 1 represents non wbs 2 represents wbs and the pixel points with no data are removed here in order to meet the needs of the study 12 images of each year were synthesized considering that the wb can be affected by climate change or human management there will be periods of wb area changes such as high water period and low water period and the research object of this paper is relatively stable wb rather than permanent wb so the water occurrence in every pixel for 12 months is not taken as the standard to judge it as wb pekel et al 2016 avoiding the underestimate of the wb area caused by excluding the temporarily exhausted or frozen wb from the wb at the same time in order to avoid identifying the temporary low lying ponding in some areas such as the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river as wb resulting in an overestimation of the wb area it is set that the proportion of the pixel with water occurrence in a year is greater than 60 that is there is water in at least seven months of a year and then the pixel is judged to be a wb and the results are organized into monthly historical data spanning the entire time scale and two centuries 1984 1999 2000 2020 for change detection due to the large volume of 30 m chinese water body images gee will automatically split the images when downloading and the size of the split images can be customized in the python api the geographic coordinate system of water body image is gcs krasovsky 1940 each country or region has its own datum china s beijing 54 coordinate system was established with reference to the former soviet union from 1953 using the krasovsky ellipsoid at present the geodesy basically still uses the beijing 54 coordinate system as a reference the projection coordinate system is krasovsky 1940 albers which is a kind of projection with two latitudinal corrections also known as orthographic equiprobable cut conic projection and biaxial latitudinal equiprobable conic projection whose the equal area property satisfies the requirement that the calculated area value is consistent with the true value the processed water body mask dataset of china for 34 years from 1987 to 2020 which is also used to analyze and study the spatial and temporal dynamics of the area and number of wbs in china in the past three decades 3 2 2 identification of artificial wb the study used the synthesized jrc monthly water history v1 3 dataset from 1987 to 2020 as a wb mask and intersected the goodd dam point data after buffering by 1 km although the total number of dams in china may still be underestimated it is possible to largely ensure that the study represents the vast majority of regulated wbs in inland china while excluding rivers from the analysis by marking wbs with an extent defined as the area of the water body divided by the area of the bounding box containing the wb of less than 5 visual inspection showed that this threshold effectively removes almost all rivers cooley et al 2021 we thus obtained a dataset of artificial wbs in china from 1987 to 2020 which provides a basis for subsequent analysis of changes in the spatial and temporal characteristics of artificial wb areas and for quantifying the effects of dam construction on changes in wb areas 3 2 3 driving factors of wb changes the temperature and precipitation data provided by cmfd in china were used to obtain the annual average temperature and annual precipitation rate of each basin from 1987 to 2018 and then correlated with the water area data of each basin separately partial correlation analysis also known as net correlation analysis is to analyze the correlation between two variables only under the condition of controlling the linear influence of other variables it is usually expressed by partial correlation coefficient which reflects the degree of net correlation between two variables the value range of partial correlation coefficient is the same as that of simple correlation coefficient which is 1 to 1 the greater the absolute value of partial correlation coefficient the closer it is to 1 the higher the degree of linear correlation between variables the smaller the absolute value of partial correlation coefficient the closer it is to 0 the lower the degree of linear correlation between variables when analyzing variable x 1 and x 2 and controls x 3 the first order partial correlation coefficient r 12 3 is defined as follows 1 r 12 3 r 12 r 13 r 23 1 r 13 2 1 r 23 2 where r 12 r 13 and r 23 represents the correlation coefficients of x 1 and x 2 x 1 and x 3 x 2 and x 3 respectively the assumption of t test is that the two variables are related so the test statistics is defined as follows 2 t r 12 n 2 1 r xy 2 where r 12 is the partial correlation coefficient between variables x 1 and x 2 and n is the number of samples p value p t n 2 t where t n 2 is a random variable that obeys the t distribution of n 2 degrees of freedom if the p value is greater than the significance level keep the original hypothesis otherwise the two variables have a linear relationship to quantify the impact of dam construction on the change in wb area we first counted the average annual change in awa and nwa for two epochs 1987 2000 2001 2020 denoted as δ a a and δ a n respectively 3 δ a a a a 2001 2020 a a 1987 2000 4 δ a n a n 2001 2020 a n 1987 2000 the proportion of change in the area of artificial wbs p a is calculated as follows 5 p a δ a a δ a a δ a n analysis of variance anova also known as analysis of the number of variances is the main work of decomposing the total variance of observed data into factor effects and experimental errors according to the different causes of variance and making a quantitative analysis of them to compare the importance of each cause in the total variance as a basis for further statistical inference in this study two way anova was used to quantify the proportion of variance in the climate explained variation in wb area in this study two way anova was used to quantify the proportion of variance in the climate explained variation in wb area in this study two way anova was used to quantify the explanatory power of air temperature and precipitation on the change of water area there are two factors a b with k l levels respectively the combination of level i of a and level j of b is recorded as i j and the experimental result is recorded as y i j i 1 k j 1 l the statistical model is set as 6 y i j μ a i b j e i j i 1 k j 1 l where e i j is random error including the influence of uncontrolled factors other than a and b we assume 7 e e i j 0 0 v a r e i j σ 2 and all e i j is independent and identically distributed another part μ a i b j is used to characterize the average effect of the horizontal combination i j where μ represents the total average a i represents the increase caused by level i of a b j represents the increase caused by level j of b supplementary conditions 8 a 1 a k 0 b 1 b k 0 this formula can be established by adjusting the value of μ to μ a b a i to a i a b j to b i b add y i

in statistics s s is called the total sum of squares the greater the s s he greater the difference between y i j which can reflect the impact of various factors on the inspection indicators the statistical analyses were performed using r 4 0 5 kabacoff 2015 4 results 4 1 various changes of wb area 4 1 1 temporal changes in wb area in inland china from 1987 to 2020 in general wb area throughout inland china including awa and nwa shows an overall upward trend with the twa total water body area awa and nwa increasing from 91050 km2 23357 km2 67 693 km2 in 1987 to 148 791 km2 34 482 km2 114 309 km2 increased by 38 8 32 3 40 8 respectively and the growth rate of nwa in inland china is much greater than the growth rate of awa fig 3 a to make a more detailed analysis of the temporal changes of awa and nwa in inland china combined with previous studies ma et al 2011 we divided three classes of wbs according to their area small 1 10 km2 medium 10 50 km2 and large greater than50 km2 and analyzed the changes in the number and area of wb in these three area grades from 1987 to 2020 fig 3bcd the proportion of artificial and natural wbs of different area classes can be seen in the figure and it can also be found that the fluctuations of temporal changes of nwa and awa are not completely consistent especially in 1995 when the drought was more severe in china the trends of small and medium sized natural and artificial wbs are opposite which indicates that dam construction has influenced or even reversed the original trends of changes in wb area 4 1 2 spatial distribution of the trend in lake area the study took 2000 as the interval year 1987 2000 as the base time period and 2001 2020 as the change time period and calculated the multi year average of wb area in the two time periods respectively and obtained the change amount of twa awa and nwa in 17 basins in the two time periods fig 4 a and see supplementary table s1 for detailed results as can be seen from the figure except for the inner mongolia inland river and liao river basins where the twa decreased by 182 7 and 103 6 km2 over two centuries respectively the amount of change in twa in all other basins in inland china was positive with especially large increases in twa in the tibet xjr and lyell basins which were 14423 1765 and 1658 km2 the vast majority of the basins twa growth is contributed by the increase of nwa especially in the basins with low impact of human activities such as tibet xjr brah lcr and uyell in western china where the twa growth is almost entirely from the increase of nwa and a similar situation occurs in the hai river basin which is mainly due to the reservoirs in the hai river basin tend to dry up due to the climate change and the increase human production and domestic water use making the hai river basin the only basin in inland china with a negative amount of change in awa among the basins with positive changes in awa the four basins of lyang huai tibet and shr in particular have the largest increases of 842 6 574 5 552 7 and 538 4 km2 respectively which are the result of the combined effects of human activities and climate change factors from the statistical results of the change in nwa in each basin it can be seen that among the seventeen basins in inland china only three basins shr imr and lr have negative epochal change in nwa decreasing by 484 1 248 7 and 123 2 km2 respectively and of these three basins compared to imr and lr which also have a decreasing trend in twa the slight amount of increase intwa in the shr is mainly attributed to the offsetting effect of the large increase in awa the remaining fourteen basins in inland china have positive amounts of change in nwa with the largest increases in tibet xjr and lyell in particular at 13870 1 1542 1 and 1162 7 km2 respectively the detailed description of the interannual variation of twa nwa and awa for each basin is showed in supplementary fig s1 and supplementary text1 in order to make a more quantitative analysis of wb changes in 17 basins in inland china this study counted the number of wbs in each basin that are in contraction and expansion respectively fig 4b from which it can be seen that tibet is the basin with the largest number of expanding wbs in inland china followed by xjr lyang and shr shr is the basin with the basin with the most contracting wbs followed by mlyang huai lr and xjr in general the basins with the largest wb changes areshr and tibet followed by xjr huai mlyang and lyang in addition it can be seen from the fig 4b that most of the wb number changes in the east central basins in china are shrinking while most of the basins with expansion oriented changes are located in the western part of china and a small part of them such as ser are located in the southeastern part of china see supplementary text 3 table s3 to make a more detailed analysis of the spatial distribution characteristics of wb changes in inland china the number of wbs in contraction or expansion and their distribution in different area classes in seventeen basins were counted in this study fig 5 d the study obtained a total of 1 553 wbs in china with a shrinkage area of more than 1 km2 and 519 wbs with a shrinkage area of more than 5 km2 of which 15 have shrunk by more than 50 km2 and three by more than 100 km2 and the wb with the largest shrinkage area is dongting lake in the mlyang with a shrinkage area of 397 1 km2 this is mainly due to a series of human activities of land reclamation reclamation lake enclosure farming and increased water use for agricultural irrigation domestic and industrial use since the 20th century with the changes in the natural environment and the rapid economic development of the yangtze river basin have greatly reduced the lake area in the jianghan plain and the dongting lake region in the middle reaches of the yangtze river which has adversely affected flood prevention and mitigation and is not conducive to maintaining the regional ecological environment and the safety of residents personal property cui et al 2013 there are 1 372 wbs with an expansion area of 5 km2 or more of which 153 have an expansion area of 50 km2 or more 69 have an expansion area of 100 km2 or more and 10 and 4 have an expansion area of 300 and 500 km2 or more respectively the wb with the largest expansion area is dabson lake in tibet with an expansion area of 733 6 km2 most of wbs in contraction in inland china are concentrated in shr lr fig 5c and the mlyang fig 5b the tibet fig 5a is densely distributed with a number of wbs in an expanding state which is mainly caused by increased precipitation and permafrost degradation liu et al 2021 while these water resources are largely inaccessible to humans on the contrary the wbs in contraction are mainly distributed in the densely populated areas where water resources are relatively limited but in great demand which further illustrates the growing regional imbalance between water resources and population distribution in china and with the projected climate warming and economic development dellink et al 2017 these situations are highly likely to further worsen tao et al 2020 4 2 driving forces of water body area changes 4 2 1 climate control air temperature and precipitation climate change is one of the most serious threats to lake ecosystems worldwide as observed in recent decades key physical lake variables such as lake ice cover surface temperature evaporation and water level all respond rapidly and dramatically to climate change woolway et al 2020 to conduct a more refined analysis of the drivers of wb area change in different basins we first investigate the effect of climate change on wb area in different basins by collecting meteorological data the time series data of annual mean temperature and annual precipitation for each basin during 1987 2018 were counted separately and later partial correlated with the wb area data of each basin fig 6 a b anova was used in the study to further quantify the contribution of climatic factors to wb area change in different basins fig 6c with temperature being the dominant climatic factor for wb area change in pr lcr ser muyang lyang uyang brah lyell hai and in mlyang tibet huai uyell xjr imr shr lr precipitation is the dominant climatic factor for wb changes see supplementary table s2 supplementary text 2 for detailed results combining the two results the correlation between climatic factors and wb area change is good and the anova results show that the wb area change is dominated by climate ss greater than 0 5 in the basins of uyang tibet uyell and xjr all of which are located in western china where human activities are weak among them qinghai tibet plateau region has increased very rapidly during the last 30 years especially in areas with elevations above 4000 m with an annual temperature increase of about 0 3 c which is twice the global average temperature growth rate with the increasing temperature in the qinghai tibet region the melting of glacial snow and the reduction of permafrost accelerate the expansion of lakes however most of the expansion of non glacial lakes is caused by an increase in precipitation which is consistent with our findings it was found that the correlation between wb area change and annual mean temperature and annual precipitation in the imr basin was not high p temperature and p precipitation were both greater than 0 1 and the results of anova also indicated that the contribution of climatic factors to wb area change in the imr basin was the lowest among the 17 basins study showed that in this region water depletion from coal mining explained 66 5 of the variation in wb area while rainfall variation explained only 20 further analysis also showed that in the grassland region of inner mongolia 64 6 of the sharp decline in lakes was due to water consumption from coal mining while in its mixed agricultural and pastoral areas water consumption from irrigation was the main factor for the decline in lakes explaining nearly 80 of the area change 4 2 2 dam construction china is the country that has built the largest number of dams in the world with more than 23 000 large dams that accounts for 40 6 of the global total but the distribution of them is uneven creating regionally differentiated changes in china s inland artificial wb china s inland dams are mainly distributed in the east and south such as the mlyang pr and ser where water withdrawals and water use have increased approximately fivefold since the 1950 s due to a doubling of population and increased irrigation and industrial activities gong 1998 in contrast the distribution of dams is more dispersed in the vast western regions of china such as the tibet imr and xjr suggesting that rapid urbanization and high population density in the basins are the main drivers of dam construction proportion of awa to the twa in seventeen basins in 2020 in inland china was drawn to reflect the degree of impact of dam construction in each basin and the result is consistent with the dense distribution of dam sites fig 7 a to quantify the effects of dam construction on changes in wb area the proportion of wb area changes related to dam construction p a was calculated in the 17 basins fig 7b overall 18 3 of the change in the area of china s inland wb occurred in artificial wb from 1987 to 2020 the extent of the impact of human activities in different basins varies considerably showing a decreasing trend from the east to the west the p a in mlyang lyang and shr is higher 60 84 60 53 and 52 66 respectively which is consistent with the residuals result of anova and demonstrates that in these basins dam construction dominates changes in wb area however in the hai basin which is also located in eastern china although its awa is 37 of the twa in 2020 the p a is still low because the awa has not changed much over two centuries indicating that the twa change in the hai basin is mainly dominated by nwa and that temperature is the main driver of wb area change in the hai basin as an important economic development area in china the mlyang the degree of human activities disturbing the natural environment is more serious some studies show that human activities has reduced the lake area from 11 711 km2 in the 1930 s to 4 910 km2 in this basin in 2000 du et al 2011 it has also been found that in the northeast plain songliao basin the change in the number of sluices in water conservancy projects shows a more significant negative correlation with the change in wb area so that in these basins the construction of upstream water conservancy projects has become one of the key factors influencing the change in wb area xie 2019 compared to the significant influence played by dam construction in wb area changes in the eastern china basins in western china such as tibet 3 8 uyang 2 8 and lcr 5 3 have a lower degree of dam construction on wb area change proving that in these basins climate change dominates the changes in wb area 5 conclusion based on the jrc wb mask dataset goodd dam point data and meteorological data we analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of wb area change in 17 basins in inland china from 1987 to 2020 and further explored the driving factors of wb area change in each basin and quantified the degree of influence of human activities on water body area change in different basins the results show that the spatial pattern of wb changes in inland china changed from contraction oriented in the northeast to expansion oriented in the southwest with most of the contracting wbs in the shr mlyang huai lr and xjr and a number of expanding wbs in the tibet basins in western china between 1987 and 2020 the area of wbs throughout inland china grew from 91 050 km2 to 148 791 km2 from a basin perspective the twa awa and nwa of the vast majority of basins showed a growth trend and the growth in twa was mostly contributed by the growth in nwa among them the i tibet basin has the largest increase from 22 178 5 km2 in 1987 to 46 852 5 km2 while the growth of wb area in the huai basin the mlyang and the lyang basin is mainly contributed by the growth of awa the growth of awa from 1987 to 2020 in the three basins of imr shr and lr basins attenuates or offsets the decreasing trend of the twa we found that the increase in mean annual temperature from 1987 to 2018 had a good positive correlation with the increase in wb area in the vast majority of chinese basins except for the shr lr imr and xjr precipitation is the dominant climatic factor in the change in wb area in the shr and lr basins the results of anova show that climate change is dominate the wb area increasing in basins in western china tibet 61 uyell 61 uyang 52 xjr 51 in the basins of mlyang lyang shr and huai where the change in awa accounts for more than 50 of the twa change the

2891,as an important surface water resource that can be directly used water bodies wbs have a non negligible impact on human life production and maintaining ecological balance over the past few decades how many wb have changed to different degrees due to climate change dam construction and other factors using the high resolution wb mask dataset and dam point data the study distinguished artificial and natural wbs calculated their spatiotemporal changes and quantified climatic and human contributions in 17 basins in inland china during 1987 2020 the results show wbs exhibited a spatial pattern of contraction in the northeast and expansion in the southwest in inland china the total artificial and natural area of inland wbs in china increased by 38 8 32 3 40 8 from 1987 to 2020 respectively in the western basins of china such as inland rivers in northern tibet 61 upper yellow river 61 upper yangtze river 52 inland rivers in xinjiang 51 climate change dominates the increase of wbs while in the eastern basins such as the middle and lower yangtze river 60 84 lower yangtze river 60 53 and songhua basins 52 66 dam construction is the main reason for the area change in wbs the analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of wbs in inland china in the past three decades and the quantification of climate and human contributions are of great significance for the rational development and sustainable use of water resources keywords water bodies artificial water body area climate change dam construction inland china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wbs such as lakes reservoirs and ponds play an important role in all aspects of human society and ecosystems surface freshwater accounts for only about 0 8 of the earth s surface gleick 1996 but supplies nearly 78 of urban dwellers 1 2 billion people with domestic water mcdonald et al 2014 and lakes and rivers account for about 88 of the surface freshwater available to humans gleick 1996 making them the most important source of surface freshwater resources song et al 2020 and a veritable oasis of life suring 2020 in addition to supplying water for basic human domestic use wbs also play an important role in agricultural irrigation edwards and nehra 2020 and industrial production du plessis and anja 2020 in human society at the same time the role played by wbs in ecosystem services should not be underestimated wbs are closely related to the normal circulation of biochemical systems climate regulation and habitat protection for wildlife xie et al 1999 salick 2006 as an important carrier of the water cycle wbs can regulate the flow of rivers and have a positive impact on maintaining the regional water balance han et al 2003 wang and ma 2009 yu and jiang 2003 in addition wbs have the ecological function of regulating regional climate and are sensitive to the corresponding regional environment and human activities han et al 2003 ding et al 2006 xie 2019 and are known as sensitive indicators of climate change guo et al 2003 ma et al 2010 on the one hand the formation distribution and evolution of wbs are influenced by changes in the natural environment and thus can better reflect changes in the regional geomorphological environment and climate on the other hand they are also influenced by human modification activities xie 2019 man made water management projects such as dam construction water diversion hydropower engineering have profoundly altered the natural patterns of wbs and created spatially distributed artificial wbs fig 1 and the dynamic change process of wbs can also reflect the impact of human activities on the ecological environment under the trend of rapid global economic development and continuous population growth the relationship between human and land has become increasingly tense and the excessive exploitation of water resources by humans has led to a significant decrease in wb area and a gradual deterioration of water quality which is harmful to the balance of ecosystems and the conservation of biodiversity and the emergence of these problems runs counter to the goal of achieving sustainable development that harmonizes socioeconomic development with population resources and the environment therefore the environmental problems of lake hydrology and water quality have been included in the key research topics of the global water resources program of the international geosphere biosphere program igbp rapley 1996 and have attracted the attention of more and more experts and scholars worldwide china is a resource based water scarce country with uneven regional distribution of water resources population and economic development and wbs under the influence of various climate and human densities show different regional dynamics in recent decades china s rapid socio economic development accelerated urbanization construction process and increasing demand for water resources a series of human activities such as enclosing lakes to make fields intercepting surface runoff and over exploitation of groundwater together with the background of global warming have caused a sharp reduction in the area of wbs and some wbs even face the unfavorable situation of extinction for example the expansion of agricultural irrigation areas and agricultural irrigation water consumption in the songliao basin one of the important grain production bases in china has directly caused water resources problems such as decreasing river and groundwater levels xie 2019 which has brought negative effects on the wb area however the rapid expansion of wb area in the qinghai tibet plateau region since the 21st century under the combined effect of increased precipitation and glacial melting will cause water system reconfiguration in 20 basins and potential flood risks for china s critical infrastructure such as the qinghai tibet railway song et al 2013 ma et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 how water management and planning adapts to climate change and enhanced human activities relies heavily on understanding long term trends and spatial dynamics of the area of wbs ipcc 2014 in addition due to the need for economic development and reduction of thermal power carbon emissions as an important national strategy to support the construction of ecological civilization and achieve sustainable and high quality socio economic development china s dam construction develops rapidly and the number of dams accounted for 40 6 of the global total ranking first in the world huang et al 2021 causing a detrimental impact on the environment due to increased evapotranspiration and greenhouse gas emissions cooley et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to take a continuous and accurate overview of the history and the ongoing changes of dam construction on wbs to provide a scientific basis for maintaining the ecological balance of basins and the sustainable use of water resources piao et al 2010 oki and kanae 2006 feng feng et al 2019 used landsat images from 1984 to 2015 to reveal the size abundance and shoreline area relationships of wbs in china and tao tao et al 2020 used landsat images to explore the changes in chinese lakes and their associated drivers over the past 30 years existing studies show large differences in trends in water body changes in different regions of china and such changes are mainly driven by human activities and climate change but the extent of the impact of these two drivers still lacks a more quantitative description in addition these studies are more general descriptions of total wb changes lacks of the distinction between artificial and natural wb types and the long term and high resolution description of their respective spatial and temporal variations are still exist cooley cooley et al 2021 combined water body data from 2018 to 2020 and reservoir data to delineate the seasonal variation in global surface water storage driven by natural and dam construction enabling quantification of human impacts on global surface water storage which provides a new idea for the quantitative study of the impact of dam construction on wb changes however there is still a lack of longer time series and finer spatial scale descriptions of the extent of climate and dam construction influences on wb changes in china in this study we combine climate type and water resources zoning to divide mainland china into 17 sub basins using state of the art long term high resolution wb mask dataset and dam point data see methods we first distinguish natural and artificial wbs between 1987 and 2020 we then analyze the temporal trend and spatial patterns of total natural and artificial wbs at different area grade based on these results we further attribute climate and human influences and contributions to the evolution of different wbs using meteorological data and artificial wb area result a database of china s artificial wb from 1987 to 2020 was also generated in 56 763 individual wb with areas as small as 0 009 km2 the dataset and results in this study can improve our understanding of anthropogenic modifications to wbs with a view to contributing to more relevant research in the future 2 study area china is a vast country with a large number and variety of wbs and the total amount of water resources is relatively abundant but the spatial distribution is uneven the number and area of wbs in the eastern wb area and the qinghai tibetan wb area account for 62 7 and 77 2 of the national total forming two dense wb groups the freshwater wb group in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and the plateau wb group in the qinghai tibet plateau but in the northeast yunnan and guizhou wb areas the number and area of wbs account for a relatively small number of wbs belonging to a more sparse wb distribution area ma et al 2011 considering the vast and heterogeneous territory of china the spatial distribution and spatio temporal variation of wbs across different climatic zones and geomorphological environments show different regional characteristics seventeen basin division is used to analyze the characteristics of wbs in different regions at a finer scale in this study fig 1 namely songhua river shr liao river lr inner mongolia inland river imr hai river hai inland rivers in xinjiang xjr

climatic regions were delineated according to the koppen geiger climate type peel et al 2007 to ensure that the regional climate has an almost uniform character when zoned zhang and ye 2020 among them inner mongolia inland river has the largest area of 1 537 520 km2 and southeastern basin has the smallest area of 226 496 km2 3 data and methods the overall work flow of the study includes two parts data collection and methods the data part mainly includes the collection and processing of wb mask dataset dam point data and meteorological data the method includes creating wb mask in inland china from 1987 to 2022 and analyzing its temporal and spatial changes identification of artificial wb and attribution of wb changes the work flow chart is shown in fig 2 3 1 data 3 1 1 wb mask dataset in this study the monthly scale global wb data provided by jrc joint research centre monthly water history v1 3 dataset was called and downloaded from google earth engine cloud platform through python api google earth engine is a cloud based planetary level geospatial analysis platform that not only enables online invocation of massive geospatial datasets but also online processing and calculation and supports rapid visualization of results providing experts and scholars in the traditional remote sensing field with convenient data acquisition and data processing and saving a lot of time and money it is convenient for experts and scholars in the field of traditional remote sensing to acquire and process data saving a lot of time and computational resources the jrc monthly water history v1 3 dataset contains maps of the spatial and temporal locations of surface waters on a global scale from 1984 to 2020 and provides statistics on the extent and changes of these surface waters this dataset uses 4 453 989 remotely sensed satellite images acquired from landsat 5 7 and 8 between march 16 1984 and december 31 2020 to quantify global surface water changes over the past 30 years at a resolution of 30 m each pixel is individually classified as a waterbody or non waterbody using an expert system the jrc monthly water history dataset is based on monthly scale data and collects waterbody monitoring results over longer time periods most of the information of this data is directly derived from the global water body change dataset with a resolution of 30 m for more than 30 years made by pekel pekel et al 2016 a total of 40 124 control points distributed both geographically globally temporally across the 32 years and across sensors tm etm and oli are used to verify its reliability and the results show that the errors of omission overall is less than 5 and the commission error is less than 1 at present this dataset has been widely recognized and applied shuailong feng feng et al 2019 used this data set to conduct a more detailed analysis of the temporal and spatial patterns of wb changes on the chinese scale and verified the controversial power scaling law of wb size abundance relationship sarah w cooley cooley et al 2021 made a wb mask based on this dataset then combined with satellite altimetry data and global reservoir database to generate the first global dataset of seasonal water storage changes and divide the natural variability of surface water storage from the variability of human management in order to further evaluate the quality of wb data in the jrc dataset we first used the modis land cover data of china with 500 meter resolution and igbp classification system from 2001 to 2019 to obtain the wb area of china from 2001 to 2019 and compared the results with the results of the jrc data supplementary fig s2 the change trend of china s total wb area obtained from the two types of data is consistent both rising the upward trend obtained by modis is more stable the upward trend of wb area obtained by jrc is relatively fluctuating the difference of statistical results of wb area between the two types of data sets is 28 40 furthermore to more intuitively reflect the difference in the degree of description of wbs between the two types of data sets we selected tai lake for comparative mapping supplementary fig s3 it can be seen from the figure that jrc monthly water history v1 3 depicts the morphology of wb more carefully and accurately at the same time we have also done quantitative research under the selected tai lake area the wb area of this area counted by jrc dataset is 3402 km2 while the wb area counted by modis in the same area is 3089 km2 the reason why the statistical result of jrc dataset is larger than that of modis is that the latter has a lower resolution of 500 m resulting in incomplete statistics of some small scale wbs and rivers and the underestimation of the wb area supplementary fig s3 f g h i as a continuous validated wb dataset on a global scale the jrc monthly water history dataset demonstrates that the effects of climate change and climate oscillations on surface water occurrence can be measured and how surface water is altered by human activities can be accounted for based on the data collected the publicly available freely accessible jrc waterbody dataset is expected to provide information to support management decisions for waterbody resources pekel et al 2016 3 1 2 dam point data global dam point data from global georeferenced database of dams goodd mulligan et al 2020 which contains concrete walled dams observable from landsat 15 m ikonos less than1 m and spot 2 5 m global satellite imagery and captures existing globally assessed large and medium sized dams from grand and icold is the most comprehensive global dam georeference database to date containing more than 38 000 dams and their associated catchments including 9 235 dams in the china region parameters such as dam point ids latitude and longitude coordinates perimeters and areas are provided in the goodd dataset for use in the form of vector points 3 1 3 meteorological data the meteorological data used in this study were obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd a gridded dataset from january 1979 to the present currently december 2018 through the fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis datasets and field data with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and a temporal resolution is 3 h its grid points are uniformly distributed over 70 140 e 15 55 n providing 2 m air temperature surface pressure and specific humidity 10 m wind speed downward short wave radiation downward long wave radiation and precipitation rate data with valid values for grid points in mainland china the quality of cmfd is better than gldas global land data assimilation system because the number of sites used to generate cmfd is larger than the number of sites used in gldas as one of the most popular datasets in the chinese land surface research community cmfd with its long length stability and continuity has been widely used in climate model validation climate zone classification crop planting programs and many other terrestrial research areas he et al 2020 3 2 methods 3 2 1 spatial and temporal changes of wb the jrc monthly water history v1 3 wb dataset is a monthly scale global image which has only one water bitmask band with three value cases of 0 1 2 where 0 represents no data 1 represents non wbs 2 represents wbs and the pixel points with no data are removed here in order to meet the needs of the study 12 images of each year were synthesized considering that the wb can be affected by climate change or human management there will be periods of wb area changes such as high water period and low water period and the research object of this paper is relatively stable wb rather than permanent wb so the water occurrence in every pixel for 12 months is not taken as the standard to judge it as wb pekel et al 2016 avoiding the underestimate of the wb area caused by excluding the temporarily exhausted or frozen wb from the wb at the same time in order to avoid identifying the temporary low lying ponding in some areas such as the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river as wb resulting in an overestimation of the wb area it is set that the proportion of the pixel with water occurrence in a year is greater than 60 that is there is water in at least seven months of a year and then the pixel is judged to be a wb and the results are organized into monthly historical data spanning the entire time scale and two centuries 1984 1999 2000 2020 for change detection due to the large volume of 30 m chinese water body images gee will automatically split the images when downloading and the size of the split images can be customized in the python api the geographic coordinate system of water body image is gcs krasovsky 1940 each country or region has its own datum china s beijing 54 coordinate system was established with reference to the former soviet union from 1953 using the krasovsky ellipsoid at present the geodesy basically still uses the beijing 54 coordinate system as a reference the projection coordinate system is krasovsky 1940 albers which is a kind of projection with two latitudinal corrections also known as orthographic equiprobable cut conic projection and biaxial latitudinal equiprobable conic projection whose the equal area property satisfies the requirement that the calculated area value is consistent with the true value the processed water body mask dataset of china for 34 years from 1987 to 2020 which is also used to analyze and study the spatial and temporal dynamics of the area and number of wbs in china in the past three decades 3 2 2 identification of artificial wb the study used the synthesized jrc monthly water history v1 3 dataset from 1987 to 2020 as a wb mask and intersected the goodd dam point data after buffering by 1 km although the total number of dams in china may still be underestimated it is possible to largely ensure that the study represents the vast majority of regulated wbs in inland china while excluding rivers from the analysis by marking wbs with an extent defined as the area of the water body divided by the area of the bounding box containing the wb of less than 5 visual inspection showed that this threshold effectively removes almost all rivers cooley et al 2021 we thus obtained a dataset of artificial wbs in china from 1987 to 2020 which provides a basis for subsequent analysis of changes in the spatial and temporal characteristics of artificial wb areas and for quantifying the effects of dam construction on changes in wb areas 3 2 3 driving factors of wb changes the temperature and precipitation data provided by cmfd in china were used to obtain the annual average temperature and annual precipitation rate of each basin from 1987 to 2018 and then correlated with the water area data of each basin separately partial correlation analysis also known as net correlation analysis is to analyze the correlation between two variables only under the condition of controlling the linear influence of other variables it is usually expressed by partial correlation coefficient which reflects the degree of net correlation between two variables the value range of partial correlation coefficient is the same as that of simple correlation coefficient which is 1 to 1 the greater the absolute value of partial correlation coefficient the closer it is to 1 the higher the degree of linear correlation between variables the smaller the absolute value of partial correlation coefficient the closer it is to 0 the lower the degree of linear correlation between variables when analyzing variable x 1 and x 2 and controls x 3 the first order partial correlation coefficient r 12 3 is defined as follows 1 r 12 3 r 12 r 13 r 23 1 r 13 2 1 r 23 2 where r 12 r 13 and r 23 represents the correlation coefficients of x 1 and x 2 x 1 and x 3 x 2 and x 3 respectively the assumption of t test is that the two variables are related so the test statistics is defined as follows 2 t r 12 n 2 1 r xy 2 where r 12 is the partial correlation coefficient between variables x 1 and x 2 and n is the number of samples p value p t n 2 t where t n 2 is a random variable that obeys the t distribution of n 2 degrees of freedom if the p value is greater than the significance level keep the original hypothesis otherwise the two variables have a linear relationship to quantify the impact of dam construction on the change in wb area we first counted the average annual change in awa and nwa for two epochs 1987 2000 2001 2020 denoted as δ a a and δ a n respectively 3 δ a a a a 2001 2020 a a 1987 2000 4 δ a n a n 2001 2020 a n 1987 2000 the proportion of change in the area of artificial wbs p a is calculated as follows 5 p a δ a a δ a a δ a n analysis of variance anova also known as analysis of the number of variances is the main work of decomposing the total variance of observed data into factor effects and experimental errors according to the different causes of variance and making a quantitative analysis of them to compare the importance of each cause in the total variance as a basis for further statistical inference in this study two way anova was used to quantify the proportion of variance in the climate explained variation in wb area in this study two way anova was used to quantify the proportion of variance in the climate explained variation in wb area in this study two way anova was used to quantify the explanatory power of air temperature and precipitation on the change of water area there are two factors a b with k l levels respectively the combination of level i of a and level j of b is recorded as i j and the experimental result is recorded as y i j i 1 k j 1 l the statistical model is set as 6 y i j μ a i b j e i j i 1 k j 1 l where e i j is random error including the influence of uncontrolled factors other than a and b we assume 7 e e i j 0 0 v a r e i j σ 2 and all e i j is independent and identically distributed another part μ a i b j is used to characterize the average effect of the horizontal combination i j where μ represents the total average a i represents the increase caused by level i of a b j represents the increase caused by level j of b supplementary conditions 8 a 1 a k 0 b 1 b k 0 this formula can be established by adjusting the value of μ to μ a b a i to a i a b j to b i b add y i

in statistics s s is called the total sum of squares the greater the s s he greater the difference between y i j which can reflect the impact of various factors on the inspection indicators the statistical analyses were performed using r 4 0 5 kabacoff 2015 4 results 4 1 various changes of wb area 4 1 1 temporal changes in wb area in inland china from 1987 to 2020 in general wb area throughout inland china including awa and nwa shows an overall upward trend with the twa total water body area awa and nwa increasing from 91050 km2 23357 km2 67 693 km2 in 1987 to 148 791 km2 34 482 km2 114 309 km2 increased by 38 8 32 3 40 8 respectively and the growth rate of nwa in inland china is much greater than the growth rate of awa fig 3 a to make a more detailed analysis of the temporal changes of awa and nwa in inland china combined with previous studies ma et al 2011 we divided three classes of wbs according to their area small 1 10 km2 medium 10 50 km2 and large greater than50 km2 and analyzed the changes in the number and area of wb in these three area grades from 1987 to 2020 fig 3bcd the proportion of artificial and natural wbs of different area classes can be seen in the figure and it can also be found that the fluctuations of temporal changes of nwa and awa are not completely consistent especially in 1995 when the drought was more severe in china the trends of small and medium sized natural and artificial wbs are opposite which indicates that dam construction has influenced or even reversed the original trends of changes in wb area 4 1 2 spatial distribution of the trend in lake area the study took 2000 as the interval year 1987 2000 as the base time period and 2001 2020 as the change time period and calculated the multi year average of wb area in the two time periods respectively and obtained the change amount of twa awa and nwa in 17 basins in the two time periods fig 4 a and see supplementary table s1 for detailed results as can be seen from the figure except for the inner mongolia inland river and liao river basins where the twa decreased by 182 7 and 103 6 km2 over two centuries respectively the amount of change in twa in all other basins in inland china was positive with especially large increases in twa in the tibet xjr and lyell basins which were 14423 1765 and 1658 km2 the vast majority of the basins twa growth is contributed by the increase of nwa especially in the basins with low impact of human activities such as tibet xjr brah lcr and uyell in western china where the twa growth is almost entirely from the increase of nwa and a similar situation occurs in the hai river basin which is mainly due to the reservoirs in the hai river basin tend to dry up due to the climate change and the increase human production and domestic water use making the hai river basin the only basin in inland china with a negative amount of change in awa among the basins with positive changes in awa the four basins of lyang huai tibet and shr in particular have the largest increases of 842 6 574 5 552 7 and 538 4 km2 respectively which are the result of the combined effects of human activities and climate change factors from the statistical results of the change in nwa in each basin it can be seen that among the seventeen basins in inland china only three basins shr imr and lr have negative epochal change in nwa decreasing by 484 1 248 7 and 123 2 km2 respectively and of these three basins compared to imr and lr which also have a decreasing trend in twa the slight amount of increase intwa in the shr is mainly attributed to the offsetting effect of the large increase in awa the remaining fourteen basins in inland china have positive amounts of change in nwa with the largest increases in tibet xjr and lyell in particular at 13870 1 1542 1 and 1162 7 km2 respectively the detailed description of the interannual variation of twa nwa and awa for each basin is showed in supplementary fig s1 and supplementary text1 in order to make a more quantitative analysis of wb changes in 17 basins in inland china this study counted the number of wbs in each basin that are in contraction and expansion respectively fig 4b from which it can be seen that tibet is the basin with the largest number of expanding wbs in inland china followed by xjr lyang and shr shr is the basin with the basin with the most contracting wbs followed by mlyang huai lr and xjr in general the basins with the largest wb changes areshr and tibet followed by xjr huai mlyang and lyang in addition it can be seen from the fig 4b that most of the wb number changes in the east central basins in china are shrinking while most of the basins with expansion oriented changes are located in the western part of china and a small part of them such as ser are located in the southeastern part of china see supplementary text 3 table s3 to make a more detailed analysis of the spatial distribution characteristics of wb changes in inland china the number of wbs in contraction or expansion and their distribution in different area classes in seventeen basins were counted in this study fig 5 d the study obtained a total of 1 553 wbs in china with a shrinkage area of more than 1 km2 and 519 wbs with a shrinkage area of more than 5 km2 of which 15 have shrunk by more than 50 km2 and three by more than 100 km2 and the wb with the largest shrinkage area is dongting lake in the mlyang with a shrinkage area of 397 1 km2 this is mainly due to a series of human activities of land reclamation reclamation lake enclosure farming and increased water use for agricultural irrigation domestic and industrial use since the 20th century with the changes in the natural environment and the rapid economic development of the yangtze river basin have greatly reduced the lake area in the jianghan plain and the dongting lake region in the middle reaches of the yangtze river which has adversely affected flood prevention and mitigation and is not conducive to maintaining the regional ecological environment and the safety of residents personal property cui et al 2013 there are 1 372 wbs with an expansion area of 5 km2 or more of which 153 have an expansion area of 50 km2 or more 69 have an expansion area of 100 km2 or more and 10 and 4 have an expansion area of 300 and 500 km2 or more respectively the wb with the largest expansion area is dabson lake in tibet with an expansion area of 733 6 km2 most of wbs in contraction in inland china are concentrated in shr lr fig 5c and the mlyang fig 5b the tibet fig 5a is densely distributed with a number of wbs in an expanding state which is mainly caused by increased precipitation and permafrost degradation liu et al 2021 while these water resources are largely inaccessible to humans on the contrary the wbs in contraction are mainly distributed in the densely populated areas where water resources are relatively limited but in great demand which further illustrates the growing regional imbalance between water resources and population distribution in china and with the projected climate warming and economic development dellink et al 2017 these situations are highly likely to further worsen tao et al 2020 4 2 driving forces of water body area changes 4 2 1 climate control air temperature and precipitation climate change is one of the most serious threats to lake ecosystems worldwide as observed in recent decades key physical lake variables such as lake ice cover surface temperature evaporation and water level all respond rapidly and dramatically to climate change woolway et al 2020 to conduct a more refined analysis of the drivers of wb area change in different basins we first investigate the effect of climate change on wb area in different basins by collecting meteorological data the time series data of annual mean temperature and annual precipitation for each basin during 1987 2018 were counted separately and later partial correlated with the wb area data of each basin fig 6 a b anova was used in the study to further quantify the contribution of climatic factors to wb area change in different basins fig 6c with temperature being the dominant climatic factor for wb area change in pr lcr ser muyang lyang uyang brah lyell hai and in mlyang tibet huai uyell xjr imr shr lr precipitation is the dominant climatic factor for wb changes see supplementary table s2 supplementary text 2 for detailed results combining the two results the correlation between climatic factors and wb area change is good and the anova results show that the wb area change is dominated by climate ss greater than 0 5 in the basins of uyang tibet uyell and xjr all of which are located in western china where human activities are weak among them qinghai tibet plateau region has increased very rapidly during the last 30 years especially in areas with elevations above 4000 m with an annual temperature increase of about 0 3 c which is twice the global average temperature growth rate with the increasing temperature in the qinghai tibet region the melting of glacial snow and the reduction of permafrost accelerate the expansion of lakes however most of the expansion of non glacial lakes is caused by an increase in precipitation which is consistent with our findings it was found that the correlation between wb area change and annual mean temperature and annual precipitation in the imr basin was not high p temperature and p precipitation were both greater than 0 1 and the results of anova also indicated that the contribution of climatic factors to wb area change in the imr basin was the lowest among the 17 basins study showed that in this region water depletion from coal mining explained 66 5 of the variation in wb area while rainfall variation explained only 20 further analysis also showed that in the grassland region of inner mongolia 64 6 of the sharp decline in lakes was due to water consumption from coal mining while in its mixed agricultural and pastoral areas water consumption from irrigation was the main factor for the decline in lakes explaining nearly 80 of the area change 4 2 2 dam construction china is the country that has built the largest number of dams in the world with more than 23 000 large dams that accounts for 40 6 of the global total but the distribution of them is uneven creating regionally differentiated changes in china s inland artificial wb china s inland dams are mainly distributed in the east and south such as the mlyang pr and ser where water withdrawals and water use have increased approximately fivefold since the 1950 s due to a doubling of population and increased irrigation and industrial activities gong 1998 in contrast the distribution of dams is more dispersed in the vast western regions of china such as the tibet imr and xjr suggesting that rapid urbanization and high population density in the basins are the main drivers of dam construction proportion of awa to the twa in seventeen basins in 2020 in inland china was drawn to reflect the degree of impact of dam construction in each basin and the result is consistent with the dense distribution of dam sites fig 7 a to quantify the effects of dam construction on changes in wb area the proportion of wb area changes related to dam construction p a was calculated in the 17 basins fig 7b overall 18 3 of the change in the area of china s inland wb occurred in artificial wb from 1987 to 2020 the extent of the impact of human activities in different basins varies considerably showing a decreasing trend from the east to the west the p a in mlyang lyang and shr is higher 60 84 60 53 and 52 66 respectively which is consistent with the residuals result of anova and demonstrates that in these basins dam construction dominates changes in wb area however in the hai basin which is also located in eastern china although its awa is 37 of the twa in 2020 the p a is still low because the awa has not changed much over two centuries indicating that the twa change in the hai basin is mainly dominated by nwa and that temperature is the main driver of wb area change in the hai basin as an important economic development area in china the mlyang the degree of human activities disturbing the natural environment is more serious some studies show that human activities has reduced the lake area from 11 711 km2 in the 1930 s to 4 910 km2 in this basin in 2000 du et al 2011 it has also been found that in the northeast plain songliao basin the change in the number of sluices in water conservancy projects shows a more significant negative correlation with the change in wb area so that in these basins the construction of upstream water conservancy projects has become one of the key factors influencing the change in wb area xie 2019 compared to the significant influence played by dam construction in wb area changes in the eastern china basins in western china such as tibet 3 8 uyang 2 8 and lcr 5 3 have a lower degree of dam construction on wb area change proving that in these basins climate change dominates the changes in wb area 5 conclusion based on the jrc wb mask dataset goodd dam point data and meteorological data we analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of wb area change in 17 basins in inland china from 1987 to 2020 and further explored the driving factors of wb area change in each basin and quantified the degree of influence of human activities on water body area change in different basins the results show that the spatial pattern of wb changes in inland china changed from contraction oriented in the northeast to expansion oriented in the southwest with most of the contracting wbs in the shr mlyang huai lr and xjr and a number of expanding wbs in the tibet basins in western china between 1987 and 2020 the area of wbs throughout inland china grew from 91 050 km2 to 148 791 km2 from a basin perspective the twa awa and nwa of the vast majority of basins showed a growth trend and the growth in twa was mostly contributed by the growth in nwa among them the i tibet basin has the largest increase from 22 178 5 km2 in 1987 to 46 852 5 km2 while the growth of wb area in the huai basin the mlyang and the lyang basin is mainly contributed by the growth of awa the growth of awa from 1987 to 2020 in the three basins of imr shr and lr basins attenuates or offsets the decreasing trend of the twa we found that the increase in mean annual temperature from 1987 to 2018 had a good positive correlation with the increase in wb area in the vast majority of chinese basins except for the shr lr imr and xjr precipitation is the dominant climatic factor in the change in wb area in the shr and lr basins the results of anova show that climate change is dominate the wb area increasing in basins in western china tibet 61 uyell 61 uyang 52 xjr 51 in the basins of mlyang lyang shr and huai where the change in awa accounts for more than 50 of the twa change the influence of human activity on the change in wb area in these basins is very significant credit authorship contribution statement yinuo zhu conceptualization methodology software data curation writing

2892,due to a steep slope rapid flow and large amounts of sediment rivers in taiwan are braided rivers that are full of bars and bifurcated flows the channel shifting behavior and bar migration within natural braided rivers results in difficult river engineering in this study the nays2dh model was used to simulate the braiding processes and morphological changes downstream of shigang dam in the da jia river from 2012 to 2013 furthermore the characteristics of riverbed erosion the stability of the channel in the longitudinal and transverse directions and the impact of river structures on the morphology were simulated the numerical model can present morphological and evolutionary processes similar to an actual river such as central bar formation chute cutoff and channel avulsion the scour pool mostly occurred at the apex of the river bend and downstream of the bar confluence in a braided river which means that bar migration is the main factor that alters scour position under the assumption of equilibrium sediment transportation across the upstream inflow section the width of the channel determines whether the river demonstrates longitudinal erosion or transverse changing results from this research can be used as a substantial reference for future research concerning river morphology evolution river engineering and river space planning keywords braided river numerical model nays2dh da jia river river structure data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fluvial geomorphology is the study of interactions between the physical shapes of rivers their flow sediment conditions and the landforms created efforts about river engineering should be based on a proper understanding of the morphological features involved and the responses to potential imposed changes in taiwan most rivers are braided in the middle stream reaches which originated from high altitude mountains due to large amount of sediment and high flow energy the downstream alluvial fans and flood plain areas usually present a braided form where the sandbar allocated and the channel flow converges and separates along the way leopold and wolman 1957 divided rivers into straight meandering and braided rivers according to their different plane types they described the braided river as one which flows in two or more anastomosing channels around alluvial islands lane 1957 defined braided rivers as characterized by having a number of alluvial channels with bars or islands between meeting and dividing again and presenting from the air the intertwining effect of a braid schumm 1985 divided rivers into various types according to their sand percentage flow velocity and river valley slope among them braided rivers bedload sand type have higher flow power and lower stability than other river types in the river type classification system established by rosgen 1994 braided rivers have a high sediment transport rate and riverbank erosion rate and low ecological habitat restoration morphology of braided rivers is affected by flow and sediment transport rate many japanese scholars believe that the plane pattern of the river channel is related to the distribution pattern of the sandbar ikeda 1984 if the upstream sediment supplies sufficiently the greater the width depth ratio of the river the easier for the river to develop into a braided river multiple bar ashmore 1991 utilized flume experiments to simulate the bed changes of the gravel bed braided river under different flow rates and summarized the braiding processes into four mechanisms which including the central bar formation transverse bar formation chute cutoff and multiple bar dissection fig 1 the formation of the central bar is related to the decrease in the sediment transport capacity of the flow caused by the widening of the downstream river and it mostly occurs when the bed shear stress is close to the critical value of the riverbed mobility transverse bar mostly occurs in places where the shear stresses of the bottom bed are higher than the critical shear stress which means the sediment transport rate is high chute cutoff mostly occurs at the bend of the river when the river bend develops to a certain stage and the concave bank collapses and the convex bank accumulates forcing the water flow deflect multiple bar dissection is where the river is wider downstream the flow will flood the surface of the sand bars with lower elevation and erode the sandbar body leddy and ashworth 1993 observed the flow changes in the flume experiments and summarized the avulsion of braided rivers into three mechanisms including constriction avulsion apex avulsion and choking avulsion yang 2020 summarized the fourth mechanism through numerical simulation and field study annexation avulsion fig 2 the evolution mechanism of these bars and channels will appear repeatedly and affect the riverbed morphology due to the increase in computational speed many computational models have been developed to simulate the morphological change in fluvial river murray and paola 1994 presented a cellular model which use simple discharge dependent erosion rules without calculations of depth or momentum reproduced the dynamic behavior of a braided stream they claimed that braiding may be a fundamental instability in a laterally unconstrained channel with non cohesion bed coulthard et al 2005 developed a cellular model caesar which built upon murray and paola 1994 but include flow routing non uniform bed material and land sliding model coulthard et al 2007 applied caesar model into a real braided stream in new zealand and discovered that altering the vegetation growth rate will influence the sediment supplied rate at downstream takebayashi 2017 presented numerical model and flume experiments under unsteady flow and suggested that vegetation in spatio temporal change may influence the configuration of bar and channels furthermore even the channel is under formative hydraulic conditions of braided stream the large vegetation resistance will reduce the number of channels and result in a meandering channel numerical models provide opportunity to combine several processes cause changes in river morphology until now however few people applied numerical simulations to make comprehensive comparisons on each evolution mechanism observed and described clearly in the gravel bed braided river in this study hec ras 4 0 a one dimensional model and nays2dh a two dimensional model was used to simulate morphological changes in the braided reach downstream of dajia river the following issues are discussed 1 can numerical simulation reproduce the braiding mechanism observed in flume experiments or field studies 2 the principle of the location for erosion deposition and the formation of the riverbed migration in a braided river 3 what is the general impact of river structures on river morphology in a gravel bed river 2 case study dajia river 2 1 study area introduction dajia river is a major river located in the central western part of taiwan island it originates from the main peak of the snow mountain 3 886 m above sea level and nanhu mountain 3 742 m above sea level in the central mountain range the length of its main stream is about 124 km and its drainage area is about 1 236 square kilometers its longitudinal slope is about 1 39 the lower reach of dajia river is demarcated by dajia river bridge on no 1 national highway the upstream of the shigang dam blocked large particles of sediment and interrupted the continuity of sand transportation erosion below the shigang dam was further enhanced due to a 10 m uplift of the dam by an earthquake in september 1999 the flow scoured the riverbed alluvium and the armor layers were lost the weak rock mud rocks at the bottom of the river was exposed the river is cutting down as incision and the cross section is a narrow and deep single channel fig 3 from the downstream of no 1 national highway to the estuary due to floods eroded the footings of the riverbank and the collapsed soil and sand on the riverbank increased the amount of sand transported the river level showed a braided river pattern an 2012 the channel oscillates frequently and its cross sections of the river channel are compound sections morphological change of the study area in recent years fig 4 to have an overall understanding of the trend of changes in the river channel of dajia river in recent years data of measured elevation across the major cross sections in different years were used for comparison data from 2012 was used as a benchmark to compare the lower reaches of dajia river in 2013 and 2018 respectively for the annual bed level variation rate width variation rate and channel shifting variation rate the calculation method of these indicators refers to the study of lu 2012 and the formulas are as follows h b h a v n h l h a v o h l where h b is the bed level variation rate h a v n is the average elevation of the new bed h a v o is the average of the original bed elevation and h l is the lowest elevation of the original bed w b w n w o w b is the width variation rate where w n is the width of the new bed and w o is the width of the original bed t b t n t o w o t b is the channel shifting rate where t n is the relative position of the new main channel t o is the relative position of the original main channel and w o is the width of the original bed fig 5 shows the bed level variation rate of the lower reach of dajia river for less than 25 km where the value greater than 1 on the vertical axis represents deposition and less than 1 represents erosion fig 5 shows that the average elevation change of these studied reached the same trend in different years and most erosion occurred in the upstream section with a transverse structure across the river upstream fig 6 shows the width variation rate of the lower reaches of dajia river value greater than 1 on the vertical axis represents a widening change of the river width and a value less than 1 represents a narrowing of the width the width of the main channel is defined as the width under a bank full discharge condition q10 i e discharge with 10 year return period it can be seen from the fig 6 that in the upstream section the width of the river changes little in the midstream section the change of the river width tends to be stable in the downstream section the distance between the banks of the two banks ranges from 800 to 1 200 m and the river has more freedom to grow into a larger area under the larger space formation of flood plain main channel avulsion and bank erosion all affect the width of the cross section and the width of the river usually vary greatly fig 7 shows the channel thalweg shifting rate in the lower reaches of dajia river based on the year of 2012 when the value greater than 0 on the vertical axis means the thalweg of main channel is shifting to the right and a value less than 0 means the thalweg is shifting to the left the thalweg is a line connecting the lowest points of successive cross sections along the course of the river fig 7 shows that the amplitude of the swing increases with the increase of the river width and the values of the two years showed an obvious left to right change which means that the river has an alternating swing in time in summary from 2012 to 2018 the elevation of riverbed far away from structures did not change much but the elevation of adjacent sections near transverse structures changed greatly the downstream of transverse structures were easily eroded and the upstream of structures were likely to deposit the width of the river and the swing of the deep channel in the study reach have smaller changes in the upper reaches and a larger change in the lower reaches in addition man made construction and renovation also affect the bed elevation the river width and the shifting of the main channel in view of the above reasons the following study conducted numerical simulations on a shorter reach not affected by transverse structures such as groundsill or bridge piers to explore the morphological change of braided rivers in a more natural situation 3 numerical model 3 1 nays2dh introduction nays2dh is a numerical model for simulating unsteady horizontal two dimensional 2d flow with sediment transport and morphological changes of bed and banks in rivers this model has been used in many calculation cases such as jang and shimuzu 2005 the model simulates the riverbed changes with erodible bank of a wide and shallow channel and reproduces the bank erosion characteristics similar to the flume experiments ali et al 2017 used this model to simulate the flow of water in an open channel with a groin structure and his calculations were in good agreement with the hydraulic test results and schuurman et al 2016 used this model to simulate the dynamic process of channel changing from straight to meandering 3 1 1 flow equation the basic equations in an orthogonal coordinate system x y before transformation mapping into a general curvilinear coordinate system are as follows equation of continuity h t h u x h v y 0 equation of motion u h t h u 2 x h u v y h g h x τ x ρ d x f x ρ v h t h u v x h v 2 y h g h y τ y ρ d y f y ρ in which τ x ρ c f u u 2 v 2 τ y ρ c f v

velocity in the y direction g is gravitational acceleration and f x y is resistance by vegetation in the x and y directions c f is riverbed shear coefficient ν t is eddy viscosity coefficient c d is drag coefficient of vegetation and a s is area of interception by vegetation per unit volume the vertical flow is parameterized to include the effect of streamline curvature induced spiral flow the turbulence closure is solved by applying a constant uniform horizontal eddy viscosity of 1 m 2 s 3 1 2 sediment transport in nays2dh composite velocity v is defined by the following equation v u 2 v 2 the dimensionless shearing force τ exerted on the riverbed is as follows τ h i e s g d where h is depth i e is energy gradient s g is submerged specific gravity and d is grain size of bed material by applying manning s formula to i e τ is expressed as follows τ v 2 c f s g g d n m 2 v 2 s g d h 1 3 where n m is manning s roughness parameter in nays2dh the total bedload transport qb in the depth

michiue where τ c is dimensionless critical tractive force each sediment transport formula has its applicable particle size the applicable particle size of the mpm formula is about 0 4 33 mm and the applicable particle size of the ashida and michiue formula is about 0 3 7 mm the limitation of sediment sizes comes from the data of laboratory flume experiments this study applies it to gravel beds such as dajia river it remains to be seen whether one step of extrapolation is appropriate when non uniform grain size is selected for the riverbed material the bedload transport is estimated by non uniform version of ashida and michiue formula a non uniform grain size riverbed is made up of a certain grading of riverbed material nays2d divides the cumulative grading curve into n layers and each layer is expressed by its representative grain size dk and the probability of that grain size existing pk median diameter dm is defined by d m k 1 n p k d k riverbed deformation is calculated by estimating the sediment transport in each of the n layers that have been divided and then adding up the sediment transport therefore the riverbed continuity equation is expressed as t z b j 1 1 λ ξ q bk ξ j η q bk η j 0 where zb is riverbed elevation λ is void ratio of bed and q bk ξ and q bk η are bed load transport in the ξ and η directions for layer k total bed load transport in each layer is calculated with the ashida michiue formula that has been expanded for each grain size dk 3 2 model setting the simulation area is located between the taiwan high speed rail bridge and no 3 national highway bridge fig 8 this reach is further downstream from the shigang dam which is therefore more suitable for exploring its morphological migration that swings freely with abundant sediments on riverbed and without effects of bridge piers and groundsill behind the bridge piers the length of this simulation section is about 6 km located within b and c on figs 5 7 and even shorter the left bank of the river is adjacent to the no 4 national highway and the right hand side bank is mostly flood plain land for agricultural purposes the numerical grids built in this study are structured grids each grid size is about 15 m 15 m with a total of 33 128 points and 32 643 grids the numerical terrain was built using the river cross section data from 2012 for the third river bureau of the wra water resources agency taiwan a one dimensional model hec ras was applied first for a longer length with upstream boundary condition at the shigang dam with hourly discharge the upstream boundary condition of the two dimensional model then uses the simulated discharge at the taiwan high speed rail bridge by hec ras the lateral distribution of the inflow was set to be proportional to local water depth and the downstream boundary condition at the no 3 national highway bridge was set as free outflow the simulated events include a flood event from june 11 to june 16 2012 and the typhoon sura from july 31 to august 3 2012 in addition 10 h steady flow of discharge 200 cms was added for the initial phase between the two flood events and the termination phase of the simulation respectively to stabilize the initial water flow of the model and observe the flow conditions in low discharge discharge of 200 cms is far below the threshold condition of movable bed such that no bed deformation can occur the total simulation time was 190 h and fig 9 shows the simulated inflow discharge hydrograph there were only these two large flow events in 2012 this study ignores other small flows and changes in the riverbed caused by human activities the manning s roughness setting of the two dimensional model was based on the suggested values on a research report study on riverbed stability for the reach downstream of shigang dam in dajia river 2 4 2009 most areas were 0 04 and a few areas adopted 0 035 or 0 045 fig 10 shows the manning s roughness setting of the study area and fig 11 shows the downstream water level calibration results the hollow points in these figures are measured data as can be seen from the figures the value of the correlation coefficient r 2 between the measured water level and the simulated water level is about 0 83 which indicated that the manning s roughness setting of this model is acceptable fig 12 is the particle size distribution of bed material and armoring layer in the study reach the d50 of the armoring layer is near 10 cm and the d50 of the bed material is about 5 cm for movable bed simulation nays2dh currently provides only two formulas as an option for sediment transport which are ashida michiue and m p m only the former supports the simulation of non uniform bed material so ashida michiue was used as the sediment transport formula for numerical simulation table 1 summarizes three nays2dh simulated cases in case 1 no structures within the study area and evolution processes were observed the size of bed material was set as the average of its armored layer 97 mm in case 2 longitudinal structure on the left bank was introduced by adjusting manning s coefficients along the location of structure in case 3 a transverse structure groundsill was introduced on the further downstream by an artificial elevation which cannot be eroded and manning s coefficients along the location of structure also adjusted 4 simulation results 4 1 morphological migration by numerical model in this section simulation results are described at different stages of migration behavior the simulated phenomena were compared with the morphological processes observed by ashmore 1991 leddy and ashworth 1993 and yang 2020 only the case with uniform bed material case1 was presented here which has a larger transport rate and the riverbed deformation is fast each description of morphological migration process will accompany concurrent bed level change water depth distribution as well as bed load transport rate such that readers can visualize the motion of braided rivers 4 1 1 central bar formation https www youtube com watch v w5cnienjy0u fig 13 shows the evolution processes of the central bar formation simulated by nays2dh at t 55hr the flow rate was about 2011cms the narrow width in the upstream increases its stream power per unit width forming a deep pool by scouring at the upstream and the downstream channel was wider so its stream power per unit width was smaller at t 68hr the total discharge was about 1185 cms and a dry node with a smaller water depth began to appear in the middle of the downstream reach and the upstream deep pool still maintained a high sediment transport rate at t 82hr the flow was about 918cms at this time the previously mentioned sandbar node has developed into an obvious central bar and exposed above the water surface with a planar shape similar to a lobate when upstream flow encounters this central bar a bifurcation was formed and the flow attached to the left bank became the main channel with more flow in the bed level evolution figure one can see the eroded volume deep pool on the upstream left bank and downstream of the bar the central bar mechanism observed in this numerical simulation is similar to that described by ashmore 1991 formation of a central sandbar is related to the narrower channel width in the upstream in the upstream the flow velocity is faster and the flow energy is larger the deep pool is formed by eroding the riverbed which makes the flow carry a lot of sediment the wider channel downstream reduces flow energy and drop the sediment to form a bar in addition to causing flow bifurcated the central bar will also form a pool at the confluent end of the bar which will also affect the downstream terrain 4 1 2 channel avulsion https www youtube com watch v pwgp3kad2fs in our numerical modeling of this simulation multiple channel avulsion situations have been observed which means main channel shifting fig 14 shows a typical larger channel avulsion situation observed in the model simulation at t 11hr the flow was about 1019cms and there were two deep flow paths in the middle reaches with the left stream as the main channel and the right stream as the tributary three large sandbars were distributed in the channel at t 20hr the flow was about 2551cms as the water level rose the two channels became a one connected flow path the water depth in the left stream is deeper and the sediment transport rate is larger at t 41hr the flow is about 3209cms which is the peak of the flow part of the bar and pool migrate downstream in addition to the downstream river bend the position of the deep pool changed and a deposition mound appears downstream at t 48hr the flow rate was about 2227cms as the water level drops part of the bar exposed to the surface from the sediment transport diagram there were two more stable bars named b1 and b2 at t 55hr the flow was about 1878cms the upstream flow path was affected by bar b1 and develops into a point bar river bend form the middle and lower flow path were affected by bar b2 and presents a bifurcation form in addition at the apex of the river bend a deposition node was generated downstream noted by a red circle in the figure at t 67hr the flow was about 1301cms the channel on the left bank was gradually cut off due to the blocking of the deposition node in the middle reach at t 84hr the flow was about 529cms upstream was affected by the development of bar b1 and the erosion of the left bank presenting obvious river bends in the middle and lower reaches of bar b2 was connected with the floodplain on the left bank the main stream shifted to the right bank only sporadic depths of water remained in the original left main channel according to the classification of channel avulsion phenomenon by leddy and ashworth 1993 this process can be regarded as a two stage diversion the case where the upper riverbank is compressed by a tip sand bar is named as constriction avulsion while the downstream bank was blocked by local sediments and causes the channel to dry up is called as choking avulsion overall constriction avulsion is often triggered by the increase in the curvature of the river bend the flow of water in the river bends will cause erosion of the concave bank and deposition on the convex bank causing the main channel to swing to the concave bank choking avulsion mostly occurs in bifurcation one of the tributaries has a strong bed load transport capacity and the migration and siltation of the sediment occurs fast when the sediment blocks the upstream entrance of the channel the tributary will be cut off and the flow will be transferred to the other tributary therefore the diversion of the river is caused by local erosion deposition and might also be effected by the upstream sediment transport and braided network 4 2 analysis of river erosion characteristics fig 15 is the water depth map of the last time step of the uniform particle size scheme case1 the red circles in the figure are the location where the maximum scour of each river section occurs and i 157 is the place with the deepest scour fig 16 is a graph showing the time delay phenomena of scour depth and shear stress versus flow rate simulated by the numerical model in this study in the figure y s is the max scour depth and y ms is the average scour depth it can be seen from the figure that during the first flood period t 10 100hr scour did not occur until after t 30 hr near the peak of discharge t 36 hr and flow discharge was above 3000 cms the shear stresses exceeded 110 n m2 which might be the incipient motion requirement for the bed material the scour depth kept developing as the flood peak flow t 36hr 3910cms receded until t 60hr the scour stops and gradually re deposit note that even when the discharge was reduced to far less than its incipient condition for example 2000cms at t 50hr the scour depth kept increasing the max scour depth of the first flood was 5 83 m and the average scour depth was 4 66 m this phenomenon of time lag between flood peak and max scour depth is partially because even if the river is in the retreat phase the force of the water flow on the bed material is still greater than its resistance it is necessary to wait for the shear stress of the flow to drop to a critical value before the bottom can be reached the other reason for a local scour deposition also depends on the amount of incoming sediment from its upstream this reason contributes to the re deposition after the maximum scour depth as well as the initially no scouring in the rising limb of discharge during the second flood period t 140 180hr the change of scour depth was the same as the previous one the scour did not decrease with the flood peak flow t 155hr 4014cms and the riverbed did not stop scourging until t 161hr the max scour depth of this flood was 3 66 m the average scour depth was 2 14 m and the cumulative max scour depth of the two floods was 8 33 m although the second flood peak flow was more than the first one the scour depth of the first flood was higher than that of the second because the first flood lasted longer overall from the numerical simulation of the scour history in this study the scour depth of the riverbed is not only affected by discharge slope and material size but also by the duration of the flood in addition the water flow in the receding section still affects the movement of the bed therefore the occurrence time of max scour depth tends to be later than the time of flood peak 4 3 impact of river structures this section discusses the influence of the existing longitudinal and transverse river structures on the simulated river the longitudinal structure is represented by an embankment on the left bank and the transverse structure takes a groundsill work further downstream of the previous simulation for the latter case the simulated domain must be shifted further downstream to cover the location of a groundsill numerical simulations were applied to analyze the differences of the riverbed with or without the existence of above mentioned structures 4 3 1 influence of longitudinal structure on river morphology in this section a numerical simulation of the braided river between the taiwan high speed railway bridge and the no 3 national highway bridge was conducted to compare the influence of embankment on the migration of riverbed case2 fig 17 shows the simulation range for protecting the concave left bank and the no 4 national highway behind it there is a xinzhuangzi embankment on the left bank with a total length of about 1200 m xinzhuangzi embankment was constructed with concrete the manning s n of the constructed area was set as 0 02 and fig 17 shows the setting of manning s n in the research area in addition to compare the erosion around the longitudinal structure by the recorded flood flow fig 9 the uniform bed model with the function with bank erosion in nays2dh was selected for simulation to observe the process of riverbank erosion fig 18 compares the results of the local erosion deposition of the numerical simulation between the original case and case with embankment fig 18 a is the simulation results of the original case and fig 18 b the results of the embankment case fig 18 c is the chronological diagram of the two cases at the river bend apex i 157 scouring depth fig 18 c shows that the embankment case was scoured sharply on the left bank and the main channel shifts into the left bank during low flow the left bank scour depth of the embankment case is more than that of the original case during the two flood peaks and the back deposition height after the flood peak is also lower than that of the original case in terms of resistance or friction effect the longitudinal structure was constructed by concrete or material with smoother surface compared to the roughness of nature gravel bed of the river which will attract fast flow from the main stream toward the longitudinal structure during the flood process this can accelerate erosion along the concave bank due to the fast flow as a result the artificial structure did not protect the bank as design instead the longitudinal structure enhanced the bank recession until the structure was damaged fukuoka 2008 also found in a field test of joganji river that the smooth concrete revetment would instead attract the main stream path closer to or even near the protected bank causing damage to the riverbank on the contrary the natural gravel bank was as rough as the riverbed the flow path is stable in fact the xinzhuangzi embankment was also effected by the high flow in the summer of 2017 june the flow path shifted and caused erosion of the foundation of the embankment 4 3 2 influence of transverse structure on river morphology in this section a numerical simulation was carried out with a transverse groundsill at the downstream reach of dajia river to evaluate the influence of a transverse structure on riverbed morphology case3 fig 19 shows the simulation range in this river it is a common practice to construct transverse structures for protecting their upstream bridge piers from scouring fig 19 shows a transverse concrete wall was installed followed by a band shaped tripod energy dissipation block at the downstream of railway bridge piers to prevent the piers from scouring hsu et al 2018 buried several wireless tracking particles underneath the bed surface downstream of the transverse protection works and used iot communication technology to obtain the real time dynamic scouring of riverbed during typhoon floods this study refers to its scouring monitoring records using typhoon dujuan in 2015 as a simulation event and compares the scouring process by numerical simulation with the real time measured monitoring records the upstream inflow refers to the hourly discharge of shigang dam during the typhoon dujuan event fig 20 the simulation time was 51 h and the downstream boundary conditions were set by a free outflow boundary condition for setting the riverbed conditions most of the groundsill works considered in this study are concrete and the manning s n was set as 0 02 fig 19 in addition since the elevation of the groundsill works is 0 5 m higher than the original riverbed the local elevation is increased by 0 5 m along the construction line and the experimental variables are simplified and the simulation was conducted assuming a uniform particle size of riverbed fig 20 shows the comparison between numerical simulation and the monitored scour records measured by hsu et al 2018 during typhoon dujuan the black dots in the figure are the scour records the red solid line is the numerical simulated results and the black solid line is the upstream inflow fig 20 shows that the value of maximum scour depth was up to 1 m and the depth was continuously deeper after the flood peak receded and there was no back deposition on bed level the measured records showed that the maximum erosion depth reached 1 2 m and the elevation returned to 0 4 m after the flood peak receded the difference between the numerical simulation and the measured records might be caused by the poor ability of the two dimensional model to simulate the water movement along the vertical direction after a water fall behind the concrete groundsill which is a truly 3d case in addition prediction by the sediment transport formula on the bed material might be completely different from the actual transport capacity by the flow in terms of river morphology when water flows through the groundsill because of the imbalance of sediment conveyance and the difference in height the water flow changes the way of cutting the riverbed to consume energy however when the bed material of the solid foundation is washed away the foundation will be destroyed if the erosion continues and repetitively evolves upstream the phenomenon of traceable erosion will be formed 5 conclusion in this study a two dimensional hydrodynamic movable bed model was used to simulate the morphological evolution of a braided river downstream of the high speed railway bridge compared with the evolution mechanisms described in previous literature we observed that the central bar formation and channel avulsion are the main river evolution mechanism in the simulated reach other conclusions are as follows 1 the elevation survey of river cross sections in 2012 2013 and 2018 indicated that the largest scour points of riverbed in the downstream reach of shigang dam are located at the downstream section of the groundsill protection work of no 1 national highway in addition the river width variation rate and channel shifting variation rate of the studied reach have minor variation in the upstream and large variation in the downstream as the river width expands downstream the longitudinal profile gets stable while the transverse oscillation becomes wild 2 nays2dh model can reproduce the same braided mechanism as flume experiments and field studies these braided mechanisms are caused by irregular main channel and bed topography which affect the downstream by chain effects or aggravate the braided topography of the river two braided mechanisms were significant in our 2d simulation which are central bar formation and channel avulsion central bar mostly occurs in places where its upstream flow is narrower and the lower flow is wider channel avulsion is caused by local erosion deposition and is also effected by upstream incoming sediment transport rate and braided networks development 3 under the setting of an equilibrium inflowing sediment at the upstream boundary the width of the river can affect the characteristics of its lateral migration for a wide river width the stream power of the flow per unit width becomes smaller the sand and gravel carried by the upstream flow are more likely to settle down and create new sand bar and form a flow pattern with multiple flow paths and divergence the swing amplitude of the thalweg also increases for narrower cross section the longitudinal characteristics of the braided river are affected by its slope drop and sediment transport rate for wider channels evolution will be affected by lateral topographic changes and local erosion deposition 4 if the longitudinal structure bank revetment on the concave bank of a gravel bed river is made by concrete with relatively smooth surface it is very likely to accelerate the erosion of the concave bank due to attracting rapid flow toward the bank at the peak of the flood and cause further damage on the longitudinal structure which will cause concerns about river bank safety transverse structures such as groundsill cause discontinuity of the local sediment transport as well as the local elevation of the riverbed which will cause falling water erosion downstream of the structure due to erosion at the downstream of the transverse structure the structure may eventually collapse due to the loss of the bed material underneath its

2892,due to a steep slope rapid flow and large amounts of sediment rivers in taiwan are braided rivers that are full of bars and bifurcated flows the channel shifting behavior and bar migration within natural braided rivers results in difficult river engineering in this study the nays2dh model was used to simulate the braiding processes and morphological changes downstream of shigang dam in the da jia river from 2012 to 2013 furthermore the characteristics of riverbed erosion the stability of the channel in the longitudinal and transverse directions and the impact of river structures on the morphology were simulated the numerical model can present morphological and evolutionary processes similar to an actual river such as central bar formation chute cutoff and channel avulsion the scour pool mostly occurred at the apex of the river bend and downstream of the bar confluence in a braided river which means that bar migration is the main factor that alters scour position under the assumption of equilibrium sediment transportation across the upstream inflow section the width of the channel determines whether the river demonstrates longitudinal erosion or transverse changing results from this research can be used as a substantial reference for future research concerning river morphology evolution river engineering and river space planning keywords braided river numerical model nays2dh da jia river river structure data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fluvial geomorphology is the study of interactions between the physical shapes of rivers their flow sediment conditions and the landforms created efforts about river engineering should be based on a proper understanding of the morphological features involved and the responses to potential imposed changes in taiwan most rivers are braided in the middle stream reaches which originated from high altitude mountains due to large amount of sediment and high flow energy the downstream alluvial fans and flood plain areas usually present a braided form where the sandbar allocated and the channel flow converges and separates along the way leopold and wolman 1957 divided rivers into straight meandering and braided rivers according to their different plane types they described the braided river as one which flows in two or more anastomosing channels around alluvial islands lane 1957 defined braided rivers as characterized by having a number of alluvial channels with bars or islands between meeting and dividing again and presenting from the air the intertwining effect of a braid schumm 1985 divided rivers into various types according to their sand percentage flow velocity and river valley slope among them braided rivers bedload sand type have higher flow power and lower stability than other river types in the river type classification system established by rosgen 1994 braided rivers have a high sediment transport rate and riverbank erosion rate and low ecological habitat restoration morphology of braided rivers is affected by flow and sediment transport rate many japanese scholars believe that the plane pattern of the river channel is related to the distribution pattern of the sandbar ikeda 1984 if the upstream sediment supplies sufficiently the greater the width depth ratio of the river the easier for the river to develop into a braided river multiple bar ashmore 1991 utilized flume experiments to simulate the bed changes of the gravel bed braided river under different flow rates and summarized the braiding processes into four mechanisms which including the central bar formation transverse bar formation chute cutoff and multiple bar dissection fig 1 the formation of the central bar is related to the decrease in the sediment transport capacity of the flow caused by the widening of the downstream river and it mostly occurs when the bed shear stress is close to the critical value of the riverbed mobility transverse bar mostly occurs in places where the shear stresses of the bottom bed are higher than the critical shear stress which means the sediment transport rate is high chute cutoff mostly occurs at the bend of the river when the river bend develops to a certain stage and the concave bank collapses and the convex bank accumulates forcing the water flow deflect multiple bar dissection is where the river is wider downstream the flow will flood the surface of the sand bars with lower elevation and erode the sandbar body leddy and ashworth 1993 observed the flow changes in the flume experiments and summarized the avulsion of braided rivers into three mechanisms including constriction avulsion apex avulsion and choking avulsion yang 2020 summarized the fourth mechanism through numerical simulation and field study annexation avulsion fig 2 the evolution mechanism of these bars and channels will appear repeatedly and affect the riverbed morphology due to the increase in computational speed many computational models have been developed to simulate the morphological change in fluvial river murray and paola 1994 presented a cellular model which use simple discharge dependent erosion rules without calculations of depth or momentum reproduced the dynamic behavior of a braided stream they claimed that braiding may be a fundamental instability in a laterally unconstrained channel with non cohesion bed coulthard et al 2005 developed a cellular model caesar which built upon murray and paola 1994 but include flow routing non uniform bed material and land sliding model coulthard et al 2007 applied caesar model into a real braided stream in new zealand and discovered that altering the vegetation growth rate will influence the sediment supplied rate at downstream takebayashi 2017 presented numerical model and flume experiments under unsteady flow and suggested that vegetation in spatio temporal change may influence the configuration of bar and channels furthermore even the channel is under formative hydraulic conditions of braided stream the large vegetation resistance will reduce the number of channels and result in a meandering channel numerical models provide opportunity to combine several processes cause changes in river morphology until now however few people applied numerical simulations to make comprehensive comparisons on each evolution mechanism observed and described clearly in the gravel bed braided river in this study hec ras 4 0 a one dimensional model and nays2dh a two dimensional model was used to simulate morphological changes in the braided reach downstream of dajia river the following issues are discussed 1 can numerical simulation reproduce the braiding mechanism observed in flume experiments or field studies 2 the principle of the location for erosion deposition and the formation of the riverbed migration in a braided river 3 what is the general impact of river structures on river morphology in a gravel bed river 2 case study dajia river 2 1 study area introduction dajia river is a major river located in the central western part of taiwan island it originates from the main peak of the snow mountain 3 886 m above sea level and nanhu mountain 3 742 m above sea level in the central mountain range the length of its main stream is about 124 km and its drainage area is about 1 236 square kilometers its longitudinal slope is about 1 39 the lower reach of dajia river is demarcated by dajia river bridge on no 1 national highway the upstream of the shigang dam blocked large particles of sediment and interrupted the continuity of sand transportation erosion below the shigang dam was further enhanced due to a 10 m uplift of the dam by an earthquake in september 1999 the flow scoured the riverbed alluvium and the armor layers were lost the weak rock mud rocks at the bottom of the river was exposed the river is cutting down as incision and the cross section is a narrow and deep single channel fig 3 from the downstream of no 1 national highway to the estuary due to floods eroded the footings of the riverbank and the collapsed soil and sand on the riverbank increased the amount of sand transported the river level showed a braided river pattern an 2012 the channel oscillates frequently and its cross sections of the river channel are compound sections morphological change of the study area in recent years fig 4 to have an overall understanding of the trend of changes in the river channel of dajia river in recent years data of measured elevation across the major cross sections in different years were used for comparison data from 2012 was used as a benchmark to compare the lower reaches of dajia river in 2013 and 2018 respectively for the annual bed level variation rate width variation rate and channel shifting variation rate the calculation method of these indicators refers to the study of lu 2012 and the formulas are as follows h b h a v n h l h a v o h l where h b is the bed level variation rate h a v n is the average elevation of the new bed h a v o is the average of the original bed elevation and h l is the lowest elevation of the original bed w b w n w o w b is the width variation rate where w n is the width of the new bed and w o is the width of the original bed t b t n t o w o t b is the channel shifting rate where t n is the relative position of the new main channel t o is the relative position of the original main channel and w o is the width of the original bed fig 5 shows the bed level variation rate of the lower reach of dajia river for less than 25 km where the value greater than 1 on the vertical axis represents deposition and less than 1 represents erosion fig 5 shows that the average elevation change of these studied reached the same trend in different years and most erosion occurred in the upstream section with a transverse structure across the river upstream fig 6 shows the width variation rate of the lower reaches of dajia river value greater than 1 on the vertical axis represents a widening change of the river width and a value less than 1 represents a narrowing of the width the width of the main channel is defined as the width under a bank full discharge condition q10 i e discharge with 10 year return period it can be seen from the fig 6 that in the upstream section the width of the river changes little in the midstream section the change of the river width tends to be stable in the downstream section the distance between the banks of the two banks ranges from 800 to 1 200 m and the river has more freedom to grow into a larger area under the larger space formation of flood plain main channel avulsion and bank erosion all affect the width of the cross section and the width of the river usually vary greatly fig 7 shows the channel thalweg shifting rate in the lower reaches of dajia river based on the year of 2012 when the value greater than 0 on the vertical axis means the thalweg of main channel is shifting to the right and a value less than 0 means the thalweg is shifting to the left the thalweg is a line connecting the lowest points of successive cross sections along the course of the river fig 7 shows that the amplitude of the swing increases with the increase of the river width and the values of the two years showed an obvious left to right change which means that the river has an alternating swing in time in summary from 2012 to 2018 the elevation of riverbed far away from structures did not change much but the elevation of adjacent sections near transverse structures changed greatly the downstream of transverse structures were easily eroded and the upstream of structures were likely to deposit the width of the river and the swing of the deep channel in the study reach have smaller changes in the upper reaches and a larger change in the lower reaches in addition man made construction and renovation also affect the bed elevation the river width and the shifting of the main channel in view of the above reasons the following study conducted numerical simulations on a shorter reach not affected by transverse structures such as groundsill or bridge piers to explore the morphological change of braided rivers in a more natural situation 3 numerical model 3 1 nays2dh introduction nays2dh is a numerical model for simulating unsteady horizontal two dimensional 2d flow with sediment transport and morphological changes of bed and banks in rivers this model has been used in many calculation cases such as jang and shimuzu 2005 the model simulates the riverbed changes with erodible bank of a wide and shallow channel and reproduces the bank erosion characteristics similar to the flume experiments ali et al 2017 used this model to simulate the flow of water in an open channel with a groin structure and his calculations were in good agreement with the hydraulic test results and schuurman et al 2016 used this model to simulate the dynamic process of channel changing from straight to meandering 3 1 1 flow equation the basic equations in an orthogonal coordinate system x y before transformation mapping into a general curvilinear coordinate system are as follows equation of continuity h t h u x h v y 0 equation of motion u h t h u 2 x h u v y h g h x τ x ρ d x f x ρ v h t h u v x h v 2 y h g h y τ y ρ d y f y ρ in which τ x ρ c f u u 2 v 2 τ y ρ c f v

velocity in the y direction g is gravitational acceleration and f x y is resistance by vegetation in the x and y directions c f is riverbed shear coefficient ν t is eddy viscosity coefficient c d is drag coefficient of vegetation and a s is area of interception by vegetation per unit volume the vertical flow is parameterized to include the effect of streamline curvature induced spiral flow the turbulence closure is solved by applying a constant uniform horizontal eddy viscosity of 1 m 2 s 3 1 2 sediment transport in nays2dh composite velocity v is defined by the following equation v u 2 v 2 the dimensionless shearing force τ exerted on the riverbed is as follows τ h i e s g d where h is depth i e is energy gradient s g is submerged specific gravity and d is grain size of bed material by applying manning s formula to i e τ is expressed as follows τ v 2 c f s g g d n m 2 v 2 s g d h 1 3 where n m is manning s roughness parameter in nays2dh the total bedload transport qb in the depth

michiue where τ c is dimensionless critical tractive force each sediment transport formula has its applicable particle size the applicable particle size of the mpm formula is about 0 4 33 mm and the applicable particle size of the ashida and michiue formula is about 0 3 7 mm the limitation of sediment sizes comes from the data of laboratory flume experiments this study applies it to gravel beds such as dajia river it remains to be seen whether one step of extrapolation is appropriate when non uniform grain size is selected for the riverbed material the bedload transport is estimated by non uniform version of ashida and michiue formula a non uniform grain size riverbed is made up of a certain grading of riverbed material nays2d divides the cumulative grading curve into n layers and each layer is expressed by its representative grain size dk and the probability of that grain size existing pk median diameter dm is defined by d m k 1 n p k d k riverbed deformation is calculated by estimating the sediment transport in each of the n layers that have been divided and then adding up the sediment transport therefore the riverbed continuity equation is expressed as t z b j 1 1 λ ξ q bk ξ j η q bk η j 0 where zb is riverbed elevation λ is void ratio of bed and q bk ξ and q bk η are bed load transport in the ξ and η directions for layer k total bed load transport in each layer is calculated with the ashida michiue formula that has been expanded for each grain size dk 3 2 model setting the simulation area is located between the taiwan high speed rail bridge and no 3 national highway bridge fig 8 this reach is further downstream from the shigang dam which is therefore more suitable for exploring its morphological migration that swings freely with abundant sediments on riverbed and without effects of bridge piers and groundsill behind the bridge piers the length of this simulation section is about 6 km located within b and c on figs 5 7 and even shorter the left bank of the river is adjacent to the no 4 national highway and the right hand side bank is mostly flood plain land for agricultural purposes the numerical grids built in this study are structured grids each grid size is about 15 m 15 m with a total of 33 128 points and 32 643 grids the numerical terrain was built using the river cross section data from 2012 for the third river bureau of the wra water resources agency taiwan a one dimensional model hec ras was applied first for a longer length with upstream boundary condition at the shigang dam with hourly discharge the upstream boundary condition of the two dimensional model then uses the simulated discharge at the taiwan high speed rail bridge by hec ras the lateral distribution of the inflow was set to be proportional to local water depth and the downstream boundary condition at the no 3 national highway bridge was set as free outflow the simulated events include a flood event from june 11 to june 16 2012 and the typhoon sura from july 31 to august 3 2012 in addition 10 h steady flow of discharge 200 cms was added for the initial phase between the two flood events and the termination phase of the simulation respectively to stabilize the initial water flow of the model and observe the flow conditions in low discharge discharge of 200 cms is far below the threshold condition of movable bed such that no bed deformation can occur the total simulation time was 190 h and fig 9 shows the simulated inflow discharge hydrograph there were only these two large flow events in 2012 this study ignores other small flows and changes in the riverbed caused by human activities the manning s roughness setting of the two dimensional model was based on the suggested values on a research report study on riverbed stability for the reach downstream of shigang dam in dajia river 2 4 2009 most areas were 0 04 and a few areas adopted 0 035 or 0 045 fig 10 shows the manning s roughness setting of the study area and fig 11 shows the downstream water level calibration results the hollow points in these figures are measured data as can be seen from the figures the value of the correlation coefficient r 2 between the measured water level and the simulated water level is about 0 83 which indicated that the manning s roughness setting of this model is acceptable fig 12 is the particle size distribution of bed material and armoring layer in the study reach the d50 of the armoring layer is near 10 cm and the d50 of the bed material is about 5 cm for movable bed simulation nays2dh currently provides only two formulas as an option for sediment transport which are ashida michiue and m p m only the former supports the simulation of non uniform bed material so ashida michiue was used as the sediment transport formula for numerical simulation table 1 summarizes three nays2dh simulated cases in case 1 no structures within the study area and evolution processes were observed the size of bed material was set as the average of its armored layer 97 mm in case 2 longitudinal structure on the left bank was introduced by adjusting manning s coefficients along the location of structure in case 3 a transverse structure groundsill was introduced on the further downstream by an artificial elevation which cannot be eroded and manning s coefficients along the location of structure also adjusted 4 simulation results 4 1 morphological migration by numerical model in this section simulation results are described at different stages of migration behavior the simulated phenomena were compared with the morphological processes observed by ashmore 1991 leddy and ashworth 1993 and yang 2020 only the case with uniform bed material case1 was presented here which has a larger transport rate and the riverbed deformation is fast each description of morphological migration process will accompany concurrent bed level change water depth distribution as well as bed load transport rate such that readers can visualize the motion of braided rivers 4 1 1 central bar formation https www youtube com watch v w5cnienjy0u fig 13 shows the evolution processes of the central bar formation simulated by nays2dh at t 55hr the flow rate was about 2011cms the narrow width in the upstream increases its stream power per unit width forming a deep pool by scouring at the upstream and the downstream channel was wider so its stream power per unit width was smaller at t 68hr the total discharge was about 1185 cms and a dry node with a smaller water depth began to appear in the middle of the downstream reach and the upstream deep pool still maintained a high sediment transport rate at t 82hr the flow was about 918cms at this time the previously mentioned sandbar node has developed into an obvious central bar and exposed above the water surface with a planar shape similar to a lobate when upstream flow encounters this central bar a bifurcation was formed and the flow attached to the left bank became the main channel with more flow in the bed level evolution figure one can see the eroded volume deep pool on the upstream left bank and downstream of the bar the central bar mechanism observed in this numerical simulation is similar to that described by ashmore 1991 formation of a central sandbar is related to the narrower channel width in the upstream in the upstream the flow velocity is faster and the flow energy is larger the deep pool is formed by eroding the riverbed which makes the flow carry a lot of sediment the wider channel downstream reduces flow energy and drop the sediment to form a bar in addition to causing flow bifurcated the central bar will also form a pool at the confluent end of the bar which will also affect the downstream terrain 4 1 2 channel avulsion https www youtube com watch v pwgp3kad2fs in our numerical modeling of this simulation multiple channel avulsion situations have been observed which means main channel shifting fig 14 shows a typical larger channel avulsion situation observed in the model simulation at t 11hr the flow was about 1019cms and there were two deep flow paths in the middle reaches with the left stream as the main channel and the right stream as the tributary three large sandbars were distributed in the channel at t 20hr the flow was about 2551cms as the water level rose the two channels became a one connected flow path the water depth in the left stream is deeper and the sediment transport rate is larger at t 41hr the flow is about 3209cms which is the peak of the flow part of the bar and pool migrate downstream in addition to the downstream river bend the position of the deep pool changed and a deposition mound appears downstream at t 48hr the flow rate was about 2227cms as the water level drops part of the bar exposed to the surface from the sediment transport diagram there were two more stable bars named b1 and b2 at t 55hr the flow was about 1878cms the upstream flow path was affected by bar b1 and develops into a point bar river bend form the middle and lower flow path were affected by bar b2 and presents a bifurcation form in addition at the apex of the river bend a deposition node was generated downstream noted by a red circle in the figure at t 67hr the flow was about 1301cms the channel on the left bank was gradually cut off due to the blocking of the deposition node in the middle reach at t 84hr the flow was about 529cms upstream was affected by the development of bar b1 and the erosion of the left bank presenting obvious river bends in the middle and lower reaches of bar b2 was connected with the floodplain on the left bank the main stream shifted to the right bank only sporadic depths of water remained in the original left main channel according to the classification of channel avulsion phenomenon by leddy and ashworth 1993 this process can be regarded as a two stage diversion the case where the upper riverbank is compressed by a tip sand bar is named as constriction avulsion while the downstream bank was blocked by local sediments and causes the channel to dry up is called as choking avulsion overall constriction avulsion is often triggered by the increase in the curvature of the river bend the flow of water in the river bends will cause erosion of the concave bank and deposition on the convex bank causing the main channel to swing to the concave bank choking avulsion mostly occurs in bifurcation one of the tributaries has a strong bed load transport capacity and the migration and siltation of the sediment occurs fast when the sediment blocks the upstream entrance of the channel the tributary will be cut off and the flow will be transferred to the other tributary therefore the diversion of the river is caused by local erosion deposition and might also be effected by the upstream sediment transport and braided network 4 2 analysis of river erosion characteristics fig 15 is the water depth map of the last time step of the uniform particle size scheme case1 the red circles in the figure are the location where the maximum scour of each river section occurs and i 157 is the place with the deepest scour fig 16 is a graph showing the time delay phenomena of scour depth and shear stress versus flow rate simulated by the numerical model in this study in the figure y s is the max scour depth and y ms is the average scour depth it can be seen from the figure that during the first flood period t 10 100hr scour did not occur until after t 30 hr near the peak of discharge t 36 hr and flow discharge was above 3000 cms the shear stresses exceeded 110 n m2 which might be the incipient motion requirement for the bed material the scour depth kept developing as the flood peak flow t 36hr 3910cms receded until t 60hr the scour stops and gradually re deposit note that even when the discharge was reduced to far less than its incipient condition for example 2000cms at t 50hr the scour depth kept increasing the max scour depth of the first flood was 5 83 m and the average scour depth was 4 66 m this phenomenon of time lag between flood peak and max scour depth is partially because even if the river is in the retreat phase the force of the water flow on the bed material is still greater than its resistance it is necessary to wait for the shear stress of the flow to drop to a critical value before the bottom can be reached the other reason for a local scour deposition also depends on the amount of incoming sediment from its upstream this reason contributes to the re deposition after the maximum scour depth as well as the initially no scouring in the rising limb of discharge during the second flood period t 140 180hr the change of scour depth was the same as the previous one the scour did not decrease with the flood peak flow t 155hr 4014cms and the riverbed did not stop scourging until t 161hr the max scour depth of this flood was 3 66 m the average scour depth was 2 14 m and the cumulative max scour depth of the two floods was 8 33 m although the second flood peak flow was more than the first one the scour depth of the first flood was higher than that of the second because the first flood lasted longer overall from the numerical simulation of the scour history in this study the scour depth of the riverbed is not only affected by discharge slope and material size but also by the duration of the flood in addition the water flow in the receding section still affects the movement of the bed therefore the occurrence time of max scour depth tends to be later than the time of flood peak 4 3 impact of river structures this section discusses the influence of the existing longitudinal and transverse river structures on the simulated river the longitudinal structure is represented by an embankment on the left bank and the transverse structure takes a groundsill work further downstream of the previous simulation for the latter case the simulated domain must be shifted further downstream to cover the location of a groundsill numerical simulations were applied to analyze the differences of the riverbed with or without the existence of above mentioned structures 4 3 1 influence of longitudinal structure on river morphology in this section a numerical simulation of the braided river between the taiwan high speed railway bridge and the no 3 national highway bridge was conducted to compare the influence of embankment on the migration of riverbed case2 fig 17 shows the simulation range for protecting the concave left bank and the no 4 national highway behind it there is a xinzhuangzi embankment on the left bank with a total length of about 1200 m xinzhuangzi embankment was constructed with concrete the manning s n of the constructed area was set as 0 02 and fig 17 shows the setting of manning s n in the research area in addition to compare the erosion around the longitudinal structure by the recorded flood flow fig 9 the uniform bed model with the function with bank erosion in nays2dh was selected for simulation to observe the process of riverbank erosion fig 18 compares the results of the local erosion deposition of the numerical simulation between the original case and case with embankment fig 18 a is the simulation results of the original case and fig 18 b the results of the embankment case fig 18 c is the chronological diagram of the two cases at the river bend apex i 157 scouring depth fig 18 c shows that the embankment case was scoured sharply on the left bank and the main channel shifts into the left bank during low flow the left bank scour depth of the embankment case is more than that of the original case during the two flood peaks and the back deposition height after the flood peak is also lower than that of the original case in terms of resistance or friction effect the longitudinal structure was constructed by concrete or material with smoother surface compared to the roughness of nature gravel bed of the river which will attract fast flow from the main stream toward the longitudinal structure during the flood process this can accelerate erosion along the concave bank due to the fast flow as a result the artificial structure did not protect the bank as design instead the longitudinal structure enhanced the bank recession until the structure was damaged fukuoka 2008 also found in a field test of joganji river that the smooth concrete revetment would instead attract the main stream path closer to or even near the protected bank causing damage to the riverbank on the contrary the natural gravel bank was as rough as the riverbed the flow path is stable in fact the xinzhuangzi embankment was also effected by the high flow in the summer of 2017 june the flow path shifted and caused erosion of the foundation of the embankment 4 3 2 influence of transverse structure on river morphology in this section a numerical simulation was carried out with a transverse groundsill at the downstream reach of dajia river to evaluate the influence of a transverse structure on riverbed morphology case3 fig 19 shows the simulation range in this river it is a common practice to construct transverse structures for protecting their upstream bridge piers from scouring fig 19 shows a transverse concrete wall was installed followed by a band shaped tripod energy dissipation block at the downstream of railway bridge piers to prevent the piers from scouring hsu et al 2018 buried several wireless tracking particles underneath the bed surface downstream of the transverse protection works and used iot communication technology to obtain the real time dynamic scouring of riverbed during typhoon floods this study refers to its scouring monitoring records using typhoon dujuan in 2015 as a simulation event and compares the scouring process by numerical simulation with the real time measured monitoring records the upstream inflow refers to the hourly discharge of shigang dam during the typhoon dujuan event fig 20 the simulation time was 51 h and the downstream boundary conditions were set by a free outflow boundary condition for setting the riverbed conditions most of the groundsill works considered in this study are concrete and the manning s n was set as 0 02 fig 19 in addition since the elevation of the groundsill works is 0 5 m higher than the original riverbed the local elevation is increased by 0 5 m along the construction line and the experimental variables are simplified and the simulation was conducted assuming a uniform particle size of riverbed fig 20 shows the comparison between numerical simulation and the monitored scour records measured by hsu et al 2018 during typhoon dujuan the black dots in the figure are the scour records the red solid line is the numerical simulated results and the black solid line is the upstream inflow fig 20 shows that the value of maximum scour depth was up to 1 m and the depth was continuously deeper after the flood peak receded and there was no back deposition on bed level the measured records showed that the maximum erosion depth reached 1 2 m and the elevation returned to 0 4 m after the flood peak receded the difference between the numerical simulation and the measured records might be caused by the poor ability of the two dimensional model to simulate the water movement along the vertical direction after a water fall behind the concrete groundsill which is a truly 3d case in addition prediction by the sediment transport formula on the bed material might be completely different from the actual transport capacity by the flow in terms of river morphology when water flows through the groundsill because of the imbalance of sediment conveyance and the difference in height the water flow changes the way of cutting the riverbed to consume energy however when the bed material of the solid foundation is washed away the foundation will be destroyed if the erosion continues and repetitively evolves upstream the phenomenon of traceable erosion will be formed 5 conclusion in this study a two dimensional hydrodynamic movable bed model was used to simulate the morphological evolution of a braided river downstream of the high speed railway bridge compared with the evolution mechanisms described in previous literature we observed that the central bar formation and channel avulsion are the main river evolution mechanism in the simulated reach other conclusions are as follows 1 the elevation survey of river cross sections in 2012 2013 and 2018 indicated that the largest scour points of riverbed in the downstream reach of shigang dam are located at the downstream section of the groundsill protection work of no 1 national highway in addition the river width variation rate and channel shifting variation rate of the studied reach have minor variation in the upstream and large variation in the downstream as the river width expands downstream the longitudinal profile gets stable while the transverse oscillation becomes wild 2 nays2dh model can reproduce the same braided mechanism as flume experiments and field studies these braided mechanisms are caused by irregular main channel and bed topography which affect the downstream by chain effects or aggravate the braided topography of the river two braided mechanisms were significant in our 2d simulation which are central bar formation and channel avulsion central bar mostly occurs in places where its upstream flow is narrower and the lower flow is wider channel avulsion is caused by local erosion deposition and is also effected by upstream incoming sediment transport rate and braided networks development 3 under the setting of an equilibrium inflowing sediment at the upstream boundary the width of the river can affect the characteristics of its lateral migration for a wide river width the stream power of the flow per unit width becomes smaller the sand and gravel carried by the upstream flow are more likely to settle down and create new sand bar and form a flow pattern with multiple flow paths and divergence the swing amplitude of the thalweg also increases for narrower cross section the longitudinal characteristics of the braided river are affected by its slope drop and sediment transport rate for wider channels evolution will be affected by lateral topographic changes and local erosion deposition 4 if the longitudinal structure bank revetment on the concave bank of a gravel bed river is made by concrete with relatively smooth surface it is very likely to accelerate the erosion of the concave bank due to attracting rapid flow toward the bank at the peak of the flood and cause further damage on the longitudinal structure which will cause concerns about river bank safety transverse structures such as groundsill cause discontinuity of the local sediment transport as well as the local elevation of the riverbed which will cause falling water erosion downstream of the structure due to erosion at the downstream of the transverse structure the structure may eventually collapse due to the loss of the bed material underneath its

2893,calculating actual bare soil evaporation ea based on potential evaporation pe is a widely followed approach in many disciplines such as hydrogeology hydrology and agricultural sciences the influence of soil texture on pe is rarely considered in these approaches in this work seasonal and diurnal cycles of pe over saturated bare soils were assessed using a unique lysimeter experiment in the guanzhong basin china the assessment was made for three different soil textures including fine sand pefine coarse sand pecoarse and gravel pegravel meteorological variables soil heat flux and soil temperatures were measured at a high temporal resolution for more than 14 consecutive months potential evaporation rates over saturated bare soil showed clear differences between fine sand coarse sand and gravel on an annual basis pefine was higher than pecoarse and pegravel 7 3 and 11 0 respectively the differences between measured pe rates over different surfaces were especially pronounced during daytime in spring and summer but showed minor differences in autumn and winter these results are quantitatively explained with detailed calculations of the surface energy balance and it is found that differences in available energy over the soil textures related to different albedos as well as different porosities and thermal properties for the materials which influence soil temperatures explain the differences this shows that pe is different for different soil textures which is neglected in most hydrological studies nevertheless the full form penman monteith equation can reproduce the pe differences over soil textures quite well in autumn and winter but a simplified approach to calculate the ground heat flux does not allow to reproduce pe differences between textures keywords

et al 1996 sutanto et al 2012 zhang et al 2021 in arid and semi arid regions e is relatively high compared to t due to the relatively large fraction of bare surface and sparse vegetation compared to

2012 van de griend and owe 1994 the accurate measurement of ea remains challenging as an alternative approach to measuring ea a common method is to calculate the potential evaporation rate pe first and then deduce ea as a fraction of pe the ratio between ea and pe depends on factors such as soil type chanzy and bruckler 1993 soil water availability federer et al 1996 kirono et al 2010 soil heat

by atmospheric demand allen et al 2005 balwinder singh et al 2011 boesten and stroosnijder 1986 bond and willis 1970 ciocca et al 2014 as a result evaporation rates from surfaces where water availability was not limiting the evaporation rate for example open water and saturated bare soil have all been used as standard to estimate ea brutsaert 2013 kirono et al 2010 westra 2009 a comparison of pe over open water and saturated bare soil was carried out in our previous research li et al 2020 another central topic of concern is the assessment of the role of soil texture on pe saturated bare soil evaporation is close to the so called stage i evaporation early stages of evaporation from saturated porous media at an initially high and relatively constant rate lehmann and or 2009 or et al 2013 shahraeeni et al 2012 lehmann et al 2008 established an evaporation experiment focusing on tracking the evolution of the drying front in coarse and fine sands and showed that fine sand has a longer duration of stage i evaporation and bigger water loss than coarse sand because of the larger characteristic length of fine sand in other studies the mechanisms affecting stage i evaporation were investigated including soil properties like air entry value critical capillary hydraulic conductivity and pore size distribution lehmann et al 2008 lehmann and or 2009 shokri et al 2010 2009a 2009b in those experiments exploring how the soil texture affects evaporation rates soil columns were saturated initially and subjected to high evaporation rates until the cumulated evaporation no longer increased these types of experiments are called dry down experiments despite the above mentioned studies a comprehensive understanding on how soil texture affects pe evaporation rate when soil remains saturated has not yet been developed lysimeters allow to directly measure evaporation rates allen et al 1991a allen et al 1991a goss and ehlers 2010 hellwig 1973 holmes 1984 pütz et al 2018 weighing lysimeters can provide an accurate estimation of evaporation rates jensen and allen 2016 despite their accuracy weighing lysimeters are not routinely used because of the high installation cost an approach to determine the evaporation rate directly from fully saturated lysimeter columns is to use the markov mariotte bottle based lysimeter system ashraf et al 2002 liu and luo 2012 rezazadeh et al 2020 rowshon et al 2014 2014 truong 2012 wang et al 2011 attaching the markov bottle to the lysimeter column the water table in the column can be maintained at the soil surface so that the evaporation rate in the saturated lysimeter column equals the quantity delivered by the markov bottle lehmann and or 2009 this type of device is also known as the constant water table type lysimeter and can provide reliable and direct pe data for fully saturated lysimeters jensen and allen 2016 labedzki 2011 truong 2012 wang and dickinson 2012 using this device for long term observations requires continuous water supply and water level recordings in the markov bottle at high temporal resolution to analyse the influence of soil texture on pe a unique markov bottle based lysimeter experiment was set up in a temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate near xi an shaanxi province guanzhong basin china given the rapid change of evaporation rate in response to atmospheric conditions evaporation over saturated fine sand pefine coarse sand pecoarse and gravel sand pegravel was measured at a high temporal discretization for more than 14 months if evaporation is not restricted by water availability it will be influenced by the net available energy and environmental conditions westra 2009 the full form penman monteith pm equation combines the energy balance and aerodynamic equation into the combined method the full form pm equation is sometimes simplified when climate data is missing or cannot be calculated the fao 56 guidelines recommend several procedures to estimate the missing parameters allen et al 2005 we also compare the measured pe for the different textures with calculated pe using the energy balance equation and two variants of the penman monteith pm equation this analysis estimates the possible magnitude of the error if pe is calculated classically not taking into account the impact of soil texture to summarize the objectives of this research are 1 characterizing the diurnal and seasonal dynamics of measured pe for saturated fine sand coarse sand and gravel with a focus on differences in pe for the different soil textures 2 explaining pe differences and pe dynamics in terms of a full analysis of the coupled water energy balance for the studied lysimeters including the role of environmental conditions and soil

and rc 5 8 cm are the radii of the lysimeter column and the markov bottle respectively it implies that a drop of the water level in the markov bottle of 94 cm coincides with an evaporation rate in the lysimeter column of 1 cm the water level in the markov bottle was collected every 10 min we determined hourly evaporation rates the markov bottles fig 1 in this research were newly installed in 2018 the radius of the old markov bottle was 6 0 cm the construction and operation of this device was successfuland got a utility model patent in 2014 shen et al 2014 the above described measurement setup cannot provide data in two particular situations firstly evaporation on rainy days cannot be measured the contribution of evaporation on rainy days to the total water and energy cycles is especially important in tropical areas but less in arid and semi arid regions calder et al 1986 kumjian and ryzhkov 2010 worden et al 2007 secondly evaporation cannot be measured when the lysimeter soil column freezes as this device is based on the principle of connected vessels connectivity between the soil columns and the markov bottles only exists after the frozen soil melts in this study area the saturated soil column typically freezes from the middle of december until the end of january at night and melts again during the day the processes of freezing and melting result in outliers in the evaporation data and therefore pe was in the winter season only collected for conditions without a frozen soil the resulting data gaps only correspond to a small part of a year and it is expected that evaporation rates were relatively small for those days 2 2 2 data analysis with energy balance method and pm equation the mass balance principle was applied to measure pe the energy balance method was used in analyzing the differences between pefine pecoarse and pegravel from the physical point of view the energy balance at the soil atmosphere interface is given by 2 r n g le h where rn w m 2 is

well watered reference surface allen et al 1998 heat flux plates were buried in soil columns to measure the ground heat flux g0 it is difficult to bury the plates at the topmost soil surface the heat storage variation δ s between the soil surface and the heat flux plate has to be added to estimate g the total ground heat flux estimate is then obtained as follows an et al 2016 9 g g 0 δs where δs w

approximated as a fraction of rn g 0 1 r n daylight r n 0 17 g 0 5 r n nighttime r n 0 in this research the meteorological variables needed as input for the full form pm and simplified pm equations were available at a temporal resolution of 1 h 3 results 3 1 climatic and meteorological conditions fig 2 shows the time series of meteorological variables for the study period from july 2018 until august 2019 meteorological variables are characterized by seasonal and diurnal cycles there are 83 days with precipitation 31 days with at least 10 mm and 7 days with at least 20 mm rainfall in the study area mainly occurred in summer and autumn incoming shortwave radiation w m 2 shows a peak value around noon the months with higher precipitation were associated with a smaller average incoming shortwave radiation rate september 2018 and june 2019 for air temperature ta the maximum value normally occurred in the afternoon 15 00 local time july and august are normally the warmest months of the year due to the higher incoming shortwave radiation and on 56 days the average daily air temperature was above 30 the coldest days in the measurement period were in december 2018 and january 2019 with 68 frost days with daily minimum temperature below 0 wind speed m s 1 in winter is larger than in other seasons during summer wind speed showed a clear diurnal cycle with higher wind speeds during the day in general wind speeds are relatively small in the guanzhong basin 3 2 potential evaporation rates for different soil textures measured monthly pe for the three materials is displayed in fig 3 during spring and summer the pe value for fine sand is the highest for coarse sand smaller and for gravel the smallest the highest evaporation rates were observed in the hottest period of the year with high temperatures and high evaporation demand july and august table 2 shows the average monthly pe amounts for the three materials for the summer season jja june july august pefine is 14 3 higher than pegravel and 9 4 higher than pecoarse june 2019 had smaller pe rates than the other two summer months which is related to more cloudy conditions including precipitation during that month in autumn and winter son and djf pe rates for the different textures show minor differences for the period from may 2019 to august 2019 these results were evaluated with a second lysimeter for each of the three soil textures results show that pe differs between the three different soil textures in a similar way for the two sets of three lysimeters the potential evaporation rate was calculated on the basis of energy conservation principles and two variants of the penman monteith equation the first variant is the full form penman monteith equation eq 13 the second is the simplified penman monteith equation with a simplified approach to calculate heat flux g according to fao 56 eq 17 to investigate the drivers of the pe differences between the three different soil textures three approaches to estimating pe were compared we now focus on the pe differences between different soil textures which is our key interest measured and calculated differences in pe between the three soil textures pefine pegravel pefine pecoarse and pecoarse pegravel are compared on a seasonal basis see fig 4 the pe differences between textures are also compared in table 3 for all three methods pe is higher for fine sand smaller for coarse sand and smallest for gravel however the magnitude of the differences is strongly underestimated by the simplified pm method especially in spring and summer fig 4 the full form pm underestimates the pe differences between textures nevertheless in transition seasons the full form pm method estimates total pe better with smaller deviations between measurement and calculation the energy balance approach reproduces the pe differences best with some underestimation of the differences in summer and overestimation of the differences for the rest of the seasons table 3 shows that the total measured difference in pe between fine sand and gravel is 110 mm and the simplified pm method and full form pm method underestimate this difference with values of only 40 mm resp 66 mm on the other hand the energy balance method slightly overestimates the difference 124 mm 3 3 diurnal and seasonal variations of pe over different soil textures 3 3 1 analysis of different energy balance components the average diurnal courses of pe for the three different soil textures were calculated based on a detailed energy balance eq 2 to explain the pe differences fig 5 shows the average diurnal cycles of the flux terms for the three soil textures in the different seasons the seasonal cycles of the flux terms were calculated from hourly data excluding heavy rainfall and frost conditions fig 6 shows the differences in the energy balance terms between fine sand and the other two soil textures a net radiation solar energy available for evaporation will increase with the decrease of albedo fig 7 shows measured hourly albedo during daytime for three soil textures the scatter plot shows the relation between albedo and solar zenith angle the albedo is a function of the solar zenith angle φ with higher values close to sunrise and sunset and relatively stable values around solar noon albedo around local solar noon 12 00 and 13 00 can be selected to calculate rns lawrence and chase 2006 albedo tends to be constant when φ is greater than 40 liu et al 2008 zheng et al 2017 in this study area φ at local solar noon 12 50 beijing time fluctuates from 32 to 78 φ at local solar noon is greater than 40 from the 36th day of the year to the 320th day of the year and φ at solar noon is smaller than 40 mainly in winter albedo in winter is therefore slightly higher than in the other seasons as the albedo decreases as a function of the increase in sun angle besides the solar angle albedo is mainly determined by the water content of the surface the value decreases with increasing of the soil moisture content liu et al 2008 in this research the albedo for the gravel is higher than for the other two textures because of the smaller saturated water content lower porosity as well as the slightly different soil color table 4 fig 5 shows the net radiation rn curves which is the energy input for the soil columns rn is negative during nighttime and increases after sunrise summer between 5 00 and 6 00 spring and autumn between 6 00 and 7 00 winter between 7 00 and 8 00 reaching a maximum around 12 50 beijing time in guanzhong basin cloud formation and rainfall reduce the peak value of the average diurnal cycle of rn the rn peak is relatively high in both spring and summer between 400 and 500 w m2 on average and the rn curve is broad in summer related to the longer daytime gravel has the highest albedo resulting in the smallest rns and highest ts which enhances the upwards longwave radiation rlu resulting in the smallest rn value both during the day and at night on the other hand fine sand has a higher rn value which contributes to the larger pe for fine sand b ground heat flux the soil heat flux g0 and the heat storage variation δs above the ground heat flux plate are related to the energy redistribution in the lysimeter column fig 5 displays the average diurnal curves of the total ground heat flux g0 δs for the four seasons which are closely related to the soil temperature profiles fig 8 shows the diurnal cycles of the measured soil temperature at different depths in the soil profile for the different textures and different seasons both g0 and δs have positive values during daytime and negative values during the night g0 gravel shows a bigger amplitude than g0 coarse and g0 fine this is related to a more pronounced land surface temperature variation for gravel than for the other textures fig 8 and a higher heat conductivity for gravel than for the other textures additionally g0 gravel has a more negative amplitude at nighttime than the other two textures this is because larger upward g0 at night will compensate the higher g0 during daytime the diurnal sum of g0 is positive in summer and especially spring which is related to the heating process and the higher soil temperature gradient throughout spring fig 8 the diurnal sum of g0 is negative in autumn and winter over long time scales the negative ground heat flux in autumn and winter will compensate the positive ground heat flux in spring and summer gravel sand has a more pronounced surface temperature variation and the smallest heat capacity among the three textures according to eq 11 the differences in δs among the three textures are minor compared to g0 in addition the diurnal sum of δs is small on the other hand the curves of g0 and δs have different shapes the g0 curve resembles more the rn curve the g0 curve peaks slightly earlier in the day compared to the peak of rn in summer and lags one hour behind the rn peak in winter the δs curves are centrosymmetric they peak 2 h earlier in the day compared to rn except for winter and have a negative peak before sunset the total ground heat flux g is the sum of g0 and δs with a larger amplitude for gravel a lower amplitude for coarse sand and the lowest amplitude for fine sand fig 5 these differences in total ground heat flux are one of the main contributions to the differences in pe for the different soil textures c sensible heat flux the calculated sensible heat fluxes for the lysimeters are displayed in fig 5 the absolute values of h for the saturated porous media are small compared to rn and g on a seasonal basis h has a bigger amplitude in spring and summer than in other seasons except for winter h is positive from 9 00 to 15 00 as the saturated land surface is releasing sensible heat to the air ts ta 0 and negative from 16 00 to 8 00 as heat is transferred from the overlying air into the land surface ts ta 0 h for gravel sand has the highest value among the three textures 3 3 2 comparison with energy balance method and pm results fig 9 shows the measured diurnal pe courses for different seasons diurnal pe curves in summer closely follow the net radiation trend with a peak value in the early afternoon in other seasons another small peak exists in the morning in winter the observed pe curves on sunny days for example in mid and late february resemble more the pe curve for spring and autumn but on other days the pe rates were at a constant low level even around noon the influence of soil texture on the pe values is the largest in periods with a high evaporation demand like during daytime in spring and summer measured results also reveal that the night time pe rate is considerable and not always constant night time pe accounts for 34 of the annual pe average nighttime pe over saturated soil textures are 1 2 mm 1 6 mm 0 9 mm and 0 4 mm per day from spring to winter night time pe rates decrease from dusk and reach a constant level during the second part of the night fig 9 fig 10 shows the comparison of measured and calculated diurnal pe courses for different seasons the calculations are made with the energy balance method and two variants of the penman monteith equation table 5 shows the evaluation statistics for the comparison of measured and calculated pe for the average diurnal cycles for the four seasons the measured season specific diurnal cycles of pe can be well described by both the energy balance equation and the full form pm equation except for autumn and winter with lower values of r2 diurnal pe values are overestimated mbe 0 by the energy balance method but underestimated mbe 0 by the full form pm equation in most seasons the simplified pm method results in the largest absolute errors and deviations with the smallest r2 and the biggest mae and rmse as it overestimates daily pe and underestimates pe after sunset fig 10 however in autumn and winter the calculated values by this method deviate less from the measurements than the other methods with smaller mbe values overall the simplified pm method cannot be recommended 3 3 3 contribution of energy flux terms to pe the pe differences between textures mainly occur during daytime we quantify now how much of the difference in pe between soil textures can be explained by the different components of the energy balance like rn and g the contribution of rns rnl and g to the calculated le differences between fine sand and coarse sand is determined based on the average diurnal values data from curves in fig 6 18 α r ns fine coarse i 1 m

i where i refers to hourly measurements m is the number of data during day time the contribution of the flux terms to the calculated pe differences between fine sand and the other two textures are shown in table 6 indicating that differences in the net shortwave radiation i e the role of albedo contribute to 15 of the pe differences net longwave radiation and the total ground heat flux g both related to porosity and soil thermal properties which influence the soil temperatures have a similar contribution 30 to the pe differences 4 discussion 4 1 potential evaporation rates over different soil textures energy balance considerations 4 1 1 influence of soil texture on energy balance terms the differences in pe over different soil textures can be explained by different albedo and different soil properties including porosity heat capacity and thermal conductance soil albedo determines the energy input for evaporation based on our measurements gravel sand has the highest albedo resulting in the smallest net shortwave radiation rns for evaporation on the contrary fine sand has the biggest rns even though albedo only shows a small difference between saturated textures it should be considered given the magnitude of incoming shortwave radiation soil porosity and thermal properties will influence the soil surface temperature and the vertical soil temperature profile variation in practical applications land surface temperature is considered to be an independent external forcing that determines wet surface evaporation tu et al 2021 yang and roderick 2019 however soil temperature determines the energy redistribution at the land surface for example g0 is influenced by the vertical soil temperature gradient and heat conductivity g0 gravel has a bigger amplitude than g0 coarse and g0 fine during the day differences in g0 among the different soil textures contribute to more than 30 in explaining the daily differences in pe fig 6c furthermore the larger soil heat flux and land surface temperature variation for gravel sand enhance the upward longwave radiation rlu eq 4 and sensible heat flux h compared to the other two textures the measurements showed that rn fine rn coarse rn gravel g0 fine g0 coarse g0 gravel hfine hcoarse hgravel during the day based on energy balance considerations over gravel less energy is available for evaporation while over fine sand the most energy is available for evaporation the existence of a small pe peak in the early morning is also related to the temporal dynamics of the energy terms in spring and autumn g changes its sign from negative to positive in the morning around one hour after rn fig 5 this delay is related to an increase of the latent heat flux after sunrise difference between positive rn and negative g is relatively large this is not observed in summer as rn is larger than for example in autumn while g is less negative than for example in spring in other words in summer mornings rn compensates the negative value of g at night there is no incoming shortwave radiation g0 gravel is more negative than g0 fine and g0 coarse this more negative g0 gravel is associated with a more negative value of rnl and higher h for gravel sand fig 6 measurements at night show rnl fine rnl coarse rnl gravel g0 fine g0 coarse g0 gravel hfine hcoarse hgravel as a result observed differences in pe between textures were small at night which can be reproduced by the energy balance approach and the full form pm equation the lysimeter data also revealed that night time pe is not constant this is because g and h are more negative than rn at night after sunset g and h increase gradually and the soil releases heat stored during the day fig 5 as a result night time latent heat flux pe decreases from dusk to become more constant in the second part of the night for soil the calculated night time pe with the energy balance method was smaller than the observed pe fig 10 vapor diffusion enhanced by wind speed might also give an important contribution to nighttime evaporation groh et al 2019 a more comprehensive analysis of night time pe was beyond the scope of this paper and will be considered in future studies 4 1 2 error analysis energy unclosure we find differences between measured pe and calculated pe with the energy balance method even though fluxes are carefully calculated to close the energy balance a certain mismatch remains one possible error source is that the energy balance equation in this research only considered the vertical fluxes although the column is made by fiberglass with good thermal insulation performance the temperature difference between the surroundings and lysimeter column may generate horizontal energy exchange gh which might influence the pe rate one complication is that for soil the vertical temperature distribution inside the lysimeter column is not uniform fig 8 compared with the net radiation available to the upper soil layers the horizontal energy transport in the lysimeter will contribute much less to the latent heat flux a detailed assessment of the importance of the horizontal heat flux gh was carried out in this research differences in gh between the three textures are quite small because the average soil profile temperature difference between the surroundings and the three lysimeters is relatively small the temperature profiles in the lysimeters were obtained by linear interpolation of measurements a further limitation is that the shallowest soil temperature sensors were buried 3 cm below the ground surface temperature was estimated by extrapolating the soil temperature measured at 3 cm and 5 cm depth given the importance of surface temperature on the overall energy balance and the observed pe differences in this research the impact of the uncertainty might be important another limitation is related to the measurement of the albedo albedo was only measured during nine months and might show fluctuations over the year there is still some uncertainty regarding the albedo which could affect the energy closure although energy closure is difficult to achieve possible errors may affect pe estimates for all three soil textures as this research focused on the influence of soil texture on pe and as pe results were averaged over a long time series we think that effects are systematically affecting all three soil textures similarly and did not significantly affect the reliability of using the energy balance method 4 2 estimating potential evaporation rates over different soil textures application of two variants of the penman monteith methods the full form pm equation eq 13 consists of an energy term leenergy and an aerodynamic term leaero leaero is the adiabatic term which indicates the evaporative capacity of air the influence of leaero on the evaporation rate mainly depends on air temperature wind speed and the vapor pressure deficit es ea therefore leaero is the same over different saturated soil textures leenergy is the diabatic term influenced by available energy rn g thus leenergy is different over textures δ δ γ in eq 13 represents the fraction of rn g to latent heat flux the value of δ δ γ is always smaller than 1 fig 11 pink curve as a result pe differences among textures calculated by the full form pm equation are always smaller than those calculated by the energy balance method table 3 in the full form pm method the contribution of available energy rn g to total pe differs among seasons related to variations in saturation deficit and δ δ γ which are commonly much smaller in cold than in warm climates this implies that the adiabatic term leaero dominates over the energy term leenergy when the weather is colder as a result both our analysis and calculation results imply that the full form pm method estimated total pe better than the energy balance method when the evaporative demand was small in transition seasons this good performance of the pm method depends on the accurate calculation of the energy balance terms of eq 2 the simplified pm equation assumes that the total ground heat flux g g0 δs is 10 of rn during daytime and 50 of rn during the night the simplified pm equation underestimates g at day and overestimates g at night compared with the energy balance equation fig 12 this finally results in large deviations from the measured pe as well as too small pe differences between textures fig 4 and fig 10 the differences in δs among the three textures are minor compared to g0 see fig 6 nevertheless δs plays a significant role in the diurnal pe dynamics if δs is considered like in the energy balance approach and the full form pm method the timing of the peak is closer to the measured peak if it is not considered the pe peak is calculated too early compared to the measurements like in the simplified pm equation fig 10 this shows that errors in the total ground heat flux can play a major role in the estimation of the latent heat flux 5 conclusions potential evaporation rate pe was measured for 14 months over saturated fine sand pefine coarse sand pecoarse and gravel pegravel using lysimeters installed in the guanzhong basin china the experiment setup allowed for a very high temporal resolution of all measured quantities measurement data were analysed with the help of energy balance considerations and two variants of the penman monteith equation the following conclusions can be drawn 1 diurnal pe curves closely follow the net radiation curve with peak values in the early afternoon pe also shows a small second peak in the early morning shortly after sunrise pe rate at night is substantial average pe rates are more than 1 0 mm per night in spring and summer with a decreasing trend in the first part of the night and a constant lower value in the second part of the night 2 diurnal and seasonal dynamics of pe over textures showed obvious differences pefine was higher than pecoarse and pegravel 7 3 and 11 0 respectively on annual basis with the largest differences when evaporation demand was high during daytime in spring and summer based on detailed energy balance considerations these pe differences over textures are controlled by differences in albedo which influence the net shortwave radiation rns and soil properties which influence the net longwave radiation rnl ground heat flux g and sensible heat flux h by influencing the soil temperature finally influencing the available energy for evaporation 3 the pe differences between the different soil textures were approximated quite well by the energy balance considerations and the full form pm equation as they are based on a comprehensive description of the relevant processes including the influence of albedo porosity and soil thermal properties the energy balance method reproduces the best measured pe differences between soil textures the full form pm equation estimates best the total amount of pe especially in transition seasons the application of the simplified pm equation however results in the largest mismatches with the measurements and is not able to explain the influence of texture on pe our results suggest that the total ground heat flux should be determined as precisely as possible taking into account soil texture meteorological conditions and environmental factors instead of calculating it as a fixed fraction of rn

2893,calculating actual bare soil evaporation ea based on potential evaporation pe is a widely followed approach in many disciplines such as hydrogeology hydrology and agricultural sciences the influence of soil texture on pe is rarely considered in these approaches in this work seasonal and diurnal cycles of pe over saturated bare soils were assessed using a unique lysimeter experiment in the guanzhong basin china the assessment was made for three different soil textures including fine sand pefine coarse sand pecoarse and gravel pegravel meteorological variables soil heat flux and soil temperatures were measured at a high temporal resolution for more than 14 consecutive months potential evaporation rates over saturated bare soil showed clear differences between fine sand coarse sand and gravel on an annual basis pefine was higher than pecoarse and pegravel 7 3 and 11 0 respectively the differences between measured pe rates over different surfaces were especially pronounced during daytime in spring and summer but showed minor differences in autumn and winter these results are quantitatively explained with detailed calculations of the surface energy balance and it is found that differences in available energy over the soil textures related to different albedos as well as different porosities and thermal properties for the materials which influence soil temperatures explain the differences this shows that pe is different for different soil textures which is neglected in most hydrological studies nevertheless the full form penman monteith equation can reproduce the pe differences over soil textures quite well in autumn and winter but a simplified approach to calculate the ground heat flux does not allow to reproduce pe differences between textures keywords

2012 van de griend and owe 1994 the accurate measurement of ea remains challenging as an alternative approach to measuring ea a common method is to calculate the potential evaporation rate pe first and then deduce ea as a fraction of pe the ratio between ea and pe depends on factors such as soil type chanzy and bruckler 1993 soil water availability federer et al 1996 kirono et al 2010 soil heat

by atmospheric demand allen et al 2005 balwinder singh et al 2011 boesten and stroosnijder 1986 bond and willis 1970 ciocca et al 2014 as a result evaporation rates from surfaces where water availability was not limiting the evaporation rate for example open water and saturated bare soil have all been used as standard to estimate ea brutsaert 2013 kirono et al 2010 westra 2009 a comparison of pe over open water and saturated bare soil was carried out in our previous research li et al 2020 another central topic of concern is the assessment of the role of soil texture on pe saturated bare soil evaporation is close to the so called stage i evaporation early stages of evaporation from saturated porous media at an initially high and relatively constant rate lehmann and or 2009 or et al 2013 shahraeeni et al 2012 lehmann et al 2008 established an evaporation experiment focusing on tracking the evolution of the drying front in coarse and fine sands and showed that fine sand has a longer duration of stage i evaporation and bigger water loss than coarse sand because of the larger characteristic length of fine sand in other studies the mechanisms affecting stage i evaporation were investigated including soil properties like air entry value critical capillary hydraulic conductivity and pore size distribution lehmann et al 2008 lehmann and or 2009 shokri et al 2010 2009a 2009b in those experiments exploring how the soil texture affects evaporation rates soil columns were saturated initially and subjected to high evaporation rates until the cumulated evaporation no longer increased these types of experiments are called dry down experiments despite the above mentioned studies a comprehensive understanding on how soil texture affects pe evaporation rate when soil remains saturated has not yet been developed lysimeters allow to directly measure evaporation rates allen et al 1991a allen et al 1991a goss and ehlers 2010 hellwig 1973 holmes 1984 pütz et al 2018 weighing lysimeters can provide an accurate estimation of evaporation rates jensen and allen 2016 despite their accuracy weighing lysimeters are not routinely used because of the high installation cost an approach to determine the evaporation rate directly from fully saturated lysimeter columns is to use the markov mariotte bottle based lysimeter system ashraf et al 2002 liu and luo 2012 rezazadeh et al 2020 rowshon et al 2014 2014 truong 2012 wang et al 2011 attaching the markov bottle to the lysimeter column the water table in the column can be maintained at the soil surface so that the evaporation rate in the saturated lysimeter column equals the quantity delivered by the markov bottle lehmann and or 2009 this type of device is also known as the constant water table type lysimeter and can provide reliable and direct pe data for fully saturated lysimeters jensen and allen 2016 labedzki 2011 truong 2012 wang and dickinson 2012 using this device for long term observations requires continuous water supply and water level recordings in the markov bottle at high temporal resolution to analyse the influence of soil texture on pe a unique markov bottle based lysimeter experiment was set up in a temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate near xi an shaanxi province guanzhong basin china given the rapid change of evaporation rate in response to atmospheric conditions evaporation over saturated fine sand pefine coarse sand pecoarse and gravel sand pegravel was measured at a high temporal discretization for more than 14 months if evaporation is not restricted by water availability it will be influenced by the net available energy and environmental conditions westra 2009 the full form penman monteith pm equation combines the energy balance and aerodynamic equation into the combined method the full form pm equation is sometimes simplified when climate data is missing or cannot be calculated the fao 56 guidelines recommend several procedures to estimate the missing parameters allen et al 2005 we also compare the measured pe for the different textures with calculated pe using the energy balance equation and two variants of the penman monteith pm equation this analysis estimates the possible magnitude of the error if pe is calculated classically not taking into account the impact of soil texture to summarize the objectives of this research are 1 characterizing the diurnal and seasonal dynamics of measured pe for saturated fine sand coarse sand and gravel with a focus on differences in pe for the different soil textures 2 explaining pe differences and pe dynamics in terms of a full analysis of the coupled water energy balance for the studied lysimeters including the role of environmental conditions and soil

lysimeter column of 1 cm the water level in the markov bottle was collected every 10 min we determined hourly evaporation rates the markov bottles fig 1 in this research were newly installed in 2018 the radius of the old markov bottle was 6 0 cm the construction and operation of this device was successfuland got a utility model patent in 2014 shen et al 2014 the above described measurement setup cannot provide data in two particular situations firstly evaporation on rainy days cannot be measured the contribution of evaporation on rainy days to the total water and energy cycles is especially important in tropical areas but less in arid and semi arid regions calder et al 1986 kumjian and ryzhkov 2010 worden et al 2007 secondly evaporation cannot be measured when the lysimeter soil column freezes as this device is based on the principle of connected vessels connectivity between the soil columns and the markov bottles only exists after the frozen soil melts in this study area the saturated soil column typically freezes from the middle of december until the end of january at night and melts again during the day the processes of freezing and melting result in outliers in the evaporation data and therefore pe was in the winter season only collected for conditions without a frozen soil the resulting data gaps only correspond to a small part of a year and it is expected that evaporation rates were relatively small for those days 2 2 2 data analysis with energy balance method and pm equation the mass balance principle was applied to measure pe the energy balance method was

the year due to the higher incoming shortwave radiation and on 56 days the average daily air temperature was above 30 the coldest days in the measurement period were in december 2018 and january 2019 with 68 frost days with daily minimum temperature below 0 wind speed m s 1 in winter is larger than in other seasons during summer wind speed showed a clear diurnal cycle with higher wind speeds during the day in general wind speeds are relatively small in the guanzhong basin 3 2 potential evaporation rates for different soil textures measured monthly pe for the three materials is displayed in fig 3 during spring and summer the pe value for fine sand is the highest for coarse sand smaller and for gravel the smallest the highest evaporation rates were observed in the hottest period of the year with high temperatures and high evaporation demand july and august table 2 shows the average monthly pe amounts for the three materials for the summer season jja june july august pefine is 14 3 higher than pegravel and 9 4 higher than pecoarse june 2019 had smaller pe rates than the other two summer months which is related to more cloudy conditions including precipitation during that month in autumn and winter son and djf pe rates for the different textures show minor differences for the period from may 2019 to august 2019 these results were evaluated with a second lysimeter for each of the three soil textures results show that pe differs between the three different soil textures in a similar way for the two sets of three lysimeters the potential evaporation rate was calculated on the basis of energy conservation principles and two variants of the penman monteith equation the first variant is the full form penman monteith equation eq 13 the second is the simplified penman monteith equation with a simplified approach to calculate heat flux g according to fao 56 eq 17 to investigate the drivers of the pe differences between the three different soil textures three approaches to estimating pe were compared we now focus on the pe differences between different soil textures which is our key interest measured and calculated differences in pe between the three soil textures pefine pegravel pefine pecoarse and pecoarse pegravel are compared on a seasonal basis see fig 4 the pe differences between textures are also compared in table 3 for all three methods pe is higher for fine sand smaller for coarse sand and smallest for gravel however the magnitude of the differences is strongly underestimated by the simplified pm method especially in spring and summer fig 4 the full form pm underestimates the pe differences between textures nevertheless in transition seasons the full form pm method estimates total pe better with smaller deviations between measurement and calculation the energy balance approach reproduces the pe differences best with some underestimation of the differences in summer and overestimation of the differences for the rest of the seasons table 3 shows that the total measured difference in pe between fine sand and gravel is 110 mm and the simplified pm method and full form pm method underestimate this difference with values of only 40 mm resp 66 mm on the other hand the energy balance method slightly overestimates the difference 124 mm 3 3 diurnal and seasonal variations of pe over different soil textures 3 3 1 analysis of different energy balance components the average diurnal courses of pe for the three different soil textures were calculated based on a detailed energy balance eq 2 to explain the pe differences fig 5 shows the average diurnal cycles of the flux terms for the three soil textures in the different seasons the seasonal cycles of the flux terms were calculated from hourly data excluding heavy rainfall and frost conditions fig 6 shows the differences in the energy balance terms between fine sand and the other two soil textures a net radiation solar energy available for evaporation will increase with the decrease of albedo fig 7 shows measured hourly albedo during daytime for three soil textures the scatter plot shows the relation between albedo and solar zenith angle the albedo is a function of the solar zenith angle φ with higher values close to sunrise and sunset and relatively stable values around solar noon albedo around local solar noon 12 00 and 13 00 can be selected to calculate rns lawrence and chase 2006 albedo tends to be constant when φ is greater than 40 liu et al 2008 zheng et al 2017 in this study area φ at local solar noon 12 50 beijing time fluctuates from 32 to 78 φ at local solar noon is greater than 40 from the 36th day of the year to the 320th day of the year and φ at solar noon is smaller than 40 mainly in winter albedo in winter is therefore slightly higher than in the other seasons as the albedo decreases as a function of the increase in sun angle besides the solar angle albedo is mainly determined by the water content of the surface the value decreases with increasing of the soil moisture content liu et al 2008 in this research the albedo for the gravel is higher than for the other two textures because of the smaller saturated water content lower porosity as well as the slightly different soil color table 4 fig 5 shows the net radiation rn curves which is the energy input for the soil columns rn is negative during nighttime and increases after sunrise summer between 5 00 and 6 00 spring and autumn between 6 00 and 7 00 winter between 7 00 and 8 00 reaching a maximum around 12 50 beijing time in guanzhong basin cloud formation and rainfall reduce the peak value of the average diurnal cycle of rn the rn peak is relatively high in both spring and summer between 400 and 500 w m2 on average and the rn curve is broad in summer related to the longer daytime gravel has the highest albedo resulting in the smallest rns and highest ts which enhances the upwards longwave radiation rlu resulting in the smallest rn value both during the day and at night on the other hand fine sand has a higher rn value which contributes to the larger pe for fine sand b ground heat flux the soil heat flux g0 and the heat storage variation δs above the ground heat flux plate are related to the energy redistribution in the lysimeter column fig 5 displays the average diurnal curves of the total ground heat flux g0 δs for the four seasons which are closely related to the soil temperature profiles fig 8 shows the diurnal cycles of the measured soil temperature at different depths in the soil profile for the different textures and different seasons both g0 and δs have positive values during daytime and negative values during the night g0 gravel shows a bigger amplitude than g0 coarse and g0 fine this is related to a more pronounced land surface temperature variation for gravel than for the other textures fig 8 and a higher heat conductivity for gravel than for the other textures additionally g0 gravel has a more negative amplitude at nighttime than the other two textures this is because larger upward g0 at night will compensate the higher g0 during daytime the diurnal sum of g0 is positive in summer and especially spring which is related to the heating process and the higher soil temperature gradient throughout spring fig 8 the diurnal sum of g0 is negative in autumn and winter over long time scales the negative ground heat flux in autumn and winter will compensate the positive ground heat flux in spring and summer gravel sand has a more pronounced surface temperature variation and the smallest heat capacity among the three textures according to eq 11 the differences in δs among the three textures are minor compared to g0 in addition the diurnal sum of δs is small on the other hand the curves of g0 and δs have different shapes the g0 curve resembles more the rn curve the g0 curve peaks slightly earlier in the day compared to the peak of rn in summer and lags one hour behind the rn peak in winter the δs curves are centrosymmetric they peak 2 h earlier in the day compared to rn except for winter and have a negative peak before sunset the total ground heat flux g is the sum of g0 and δs with a larger amplitude for gravel a lower amplitude for coarse sand and the lowest amplitude for fine sand fig 5 these differences in total ground heat flux are one of the main contributions to the differences in pe for the different soil textures c sensible heat flux the calculated sensible heat fluxes for the lysimeters are displayed in fig 5 the absolute values of h for the saturated porous media are small compared to rn and g on a seasonal basis h has a bigger amplitude in spring and summer than in other seasons except for winter h is positive from 9 00 to 15 00 as the saturated land surface is releasing sensible heat to the air ts ta 0 and negative from 16 00 to 8 00 as heat is transferred from the overlying air into the land surface ts ta 0 h for gravel sand has the highest value among the three textures 3 3 2 comparison with energy balance method and pm results fig 9 shows the measured diurnal pe courses for different seasons diurnal pe curves in summer closely follow the net radiation trend with a peak value in the early afternoon in other seasons another small peak exists in the morning in winter the observed pe curves on sunny days for example in mid and late february resemble more the pe curve for spring and autumn but on other days the pe rates were at a constant low level even around noon the influence of soil texture on the pe values is the largest in periods with a high evaporation demand like during daytime in spring and summer measured results also reveal that the night time pe rate is considerable and not always constant night time pe accounts for 34 of the annual pe average nighttime pe over saturated soil textures are 1 2 mm 1 6 mm 0 9 mm and 0 4 mm per day from spring to winter night time pe rates decrease from dusk and reach a constant level during the second part of the night fig 9 fig 10 shows the comparison of measured and calculated diurnal pe courses for different seasons the calculations are made with the energy balance method and two variants of the penman monteith equation table 5 shows the evaluation statistics for the comparison of measured and calculated pe for the average diurnal cycles for the four seasons the measured season specific diurnal cycles of pe can be well described by both the energy balance equation and the full form pm equation except for autumn and winter with lower values of r2 diurnal pe values are overestimated mbe 0 by the energy balance method but underestimated mbe 0 by the full form pm equation in most seasons the simplified pm method results in the largest absolute errors and deviations with the smallest r2 and the biggest mae and rmse as it overestimates daily pe and underestimates pe after sunset fig 10 however in autumn and winter the calculated values by this method deviate less from the measurements than the other methods with smaller mbe values overall the simplified pm method cannot be recommended 3 3 3 contribution of energy flux terms to pe the pe differences between textures mainly occur during daytime we quantify now how much of the difference in pe between soil textures can be explained by the different components of the energy balance like rn and g the contribution of rns rnl and g to the calculated le differences between fine sand and coarse sand is determined based on the average diurnal values data from curves in fig 6 18 α r ns fine coarse i 1 m r ns fine i r ns coarse i i 1 m le fine i le coarse i α r nl fine coarse i 1 m r nl fine i r nl coarse i i 1 m le fine i le coarse i α g fine coarse i 1 m g fine i g coarse i i 1 m le fine i le coarse i where i refers to hourly measurements m is the number of data during day time the contribution of the flux terms to the calculated pe differences between fine sand and the other two textures are shown in table 6 indicating that differences in the net shortwave radiation i e the role of albedo contribute to 15 of the pe differences net longwave radiation and the total ground heat flux g both related to porosity and soil thermal properties which influence the soil temperatures have a similar contribution 30 to the pe differences 4 discussion 4 1 potential evaporation rates over different soil textures energy balance considerations 4 1 1 influence of soil texture on energy balance terms the differences in pe over different soil textures can be explained by different albedo and different soil properties including porosity heat capacity and thermal conductance soil albedo determines the energy input for evaporation based on our measurements gravel sand has the highest albedo resulting in the smallest net shortwave radiation rns for evaporation on the contrary fine sand has the biggest rns even though albedo only shows a small difference between saturated textures it should be considered given the magnitude of incoming shortwave radiation soil porosity and thermal properties will influence the soil surface temperature and the vertical soil temperature profile variation in practical applications land surface temperature is considered to be an independent external forcing that determines wet surface evaporation tu et al 2021 yang and roderick 2019 however soil temperature determines the energy redistribution at the land surface for example g0 is influenced by the vertical soil temperature gradient and heat conductivity g0 gravel has a bigger amplitude than g0 coarse and g0 fine during the day differences in g0 among the different soil textures contribute to more than 30 in explaining the daily differences in pe fig 6c furthermore the larger soil heat flux and land surface temperature variation for gravel sand enhance the upward longwave radiation rlu eq 4 and sensible heat flux h compared to the other two textures the measurements showed that rn fine rn coarse rn gravel g0 fine g0 coarse g0 gravel hfine hcoarse hgravel during the day based on energy balance considerations over gravel less energy is available for evaporation while over fine sand the most energy is available for evaporation the existence of a small pe peak in the early morning is also related to the temporal dynamics of the energy terms in spring and autumn g changes its sign from negative to positive in the morning around one hour after rn fig 5 this delay is related to an increase of the latent heat flux after sunrise difference between positive rn and negative g is relatively large this is not observed in summer as rn is larger than for example in autumn while g is less negative than for example in spring in other words in summer mornings rn compensates the negative value of g at night there is no incoming shortwave radiation g0 gravel is more negative than g0 fine and g0 coarse this more negative g0 gravel is associated with a more negative value of rnl and higher h for gravel sand fig 6 measurements at night show rnl fine rnl coarse rnl gravel g0 fine g0 coarse g0 gravel hfine hcoarse hgravel as a result observed differences in pe between textures were small at night which can be reproduced by the energy balance approach and the full form pm equation the lysimeter data also revealed that night time pe is not constant this is because g and h are more negative than rn at night after sunset g and h increase gradually and the soil releases heat stored during the day fig 5 as a result night time latent heat flux pe decreases from dusk to become more constant in the second part of the night for soil the calculated night time pe with the energy balance method was smaller than the observed pe fig 10 vapor diffusion enhanced by wind speed might also give an important contribution to nighttime evaporation groh et al 2019 a more comprehensive analysis of night time pe was beyond the scope of this paper and will be considered in future studies 4 1 2 error analysis energy unclosure we find differences between measured pe and calculated pe with the energy balance method even though fluxes are carefully calculated to close the energy balance a certain mismatch remains one possible error source is that the energy balance equation in this research only considered the vertical fluxes although the column is made by fiberglass with good thermal insulation performance the temperature difference between the surroundings and lysimeter column may generate horizontal energy exchange gh which might influence the pe rate one complication is that for soil the vertical temperature distribution inside the lysimeter column is not uniform fig 8 compared with the net radiation available to the upper soil layers the horizontal energy transport in the lysimeter will contribute much less to the latent heat flux a detailed assessment of the importance of the horizontal heat flux gh was carried out in this research differences in gh between the three textures are quite small because the average soil profile temperature difference between the surroundings and the three lysimeters is relatively small the temperature profiles in the lysimeters were obtained by linear interpolation of measurements a further limitation is that the shallowest soil temperature sensors were buried 3 cm below the ground surface temperature was estimated by extrapolating the soil temperature measured at 3 cm and 5 cm depth given the importance of surface temperature on the overall energy balance and the observed pe differences in this research the impact of the uncertainty might be important another limitation is related to the measurement of the albedo albedo was only measured during nine months and might show fluctuations over the year there is still some uncertainty regarding the albedo which could affect the energy closure although energy closure is difficult to achieve possible errors may affect pe estimates for all three soil textures as this research focused on the influence of soil texture on pe and as pe results were averaged over a long time series we think that effects are systematically affecting all three soil textures similarly and did not significantly affect the reliability of using the energy balance method 4 2 estimating potential evaporation rates over different soil textures application of two variants of the penman monteith methods the full form pm equation eq 13 consists of an energy term leenergy and an aerodynamic term leaero leaero is the adiabatic term which indicates the evaporative capacity of air the influence of leaero on the evaporation rate mainly depends on air temperature wind speed and the vapor pressure deficit es ea therefore leaero is the same over different saturated soil textures leenergy is the diabatic term influenced by available energy rn g thus leenergy is different over textures δ δ γ in eq 13 represents the fraction of rn g to latent heat flux the value of δ δ γ is always smaller than 1 fig 11 pink curve as a result pe differences among textures calculated by the full form pm equation are always smaller than those calculated by the energy balance method table 3 in the full form pm method the contribution of available energy rn g to total pe differs among seasons related to variations in saturation deficit and δ δ γ which are commonly much smaller in cold than in warm climates this implies that the adiabatic term leaero dominates over the energy term leenergy when the weather is colder as a result both our analysis and calculation results imply that the full form pm method estimated total pe better than the energy balance method when the evaporative demand was small in transition seasons this good performance of the pm method depends on the accurate calculation of the energy balance terms of eq 2 the simplified pm equation assumes that the total ground heat flux g g0 δs is 10 of rn during daytime and 50 of rn during the night the simplified pm equation underestimates g at day and overestimates g at night compared with the energy balance equation fig 12 this finally results in large deviations from the measured pe as well as too small pe differences between textures fig 4 and fig 10 the differences in δs among the three textures are minor compared to g0 see fig 6 nevertheless δs plays a significant role in the diurnal pe dynamics if δs is considered like in the energy balance approach and the full form pm method the timing of the peak is closer to the measured peak if it is not considered the pe peak is calculated too early compared to the measurements like in the simplified pm equation fig 10 this shows that errors in the total ground heat flux can play a major role in the estimation of the latent heat flux 5 conclusions potential evaporation rate pe was measured for 14 months over saturated fine sand pefine coarse sand pecoarse and gravel pegravel using lysimeters installed in the guanzhong basin china the experiment setup allowed for a very high temporal resolution of all measured quantities measurement data were analysed with the help of energy balance considerations and two variants of the penman monteith equation the following conclusions can be drawn 1 diurnal pe curves closely follow the net radiation curve with peak values in the early afternoon pe also shows a small second peak in the early morning shortly after sunrise pe rate at night is substantial average pe rates are more than 1 0 mm per night in spring and summer with a decreasing trend in the first part of the night and a constant lower value in the second part of the night 2 diurnal and seasonal dynamics of pe over textures showed obvious differences pefine was higher than pecoarse and pegravel 7 3 and 11 0 respectively on annual basis with the largest differences when evaporation demand was high during daytime in spring and summer based on detailed energy balance considerations these pe differences over textures are controlled by differences in albedo which influence the net shortwave radiation rns and soil properties which influence the net longwave radiation rnl ground heat flux g and sensible heat flux h by influencing the soil temperature finally influencing the available energy for evaporation 3 the pe differences between the different soil textures were approximated quite well by the energy balance considerations and the full form pm equation as they are based on a comprehensive description of the relevant processes including the influence of albedo porosity and soil thermal properties the energy balance method reproduces the best measured pe differences between soil textures the full form pm equation estimates best the total amount of pe especially in transition seasons the application of the simplified pm equation however results in the largest mismatches with the measurements and is not able to explain the influence of texture on pe our results suggest that the total ground heat flux should be determined as precisely as possible taking into account soil texture meteorological conditions and environmental factors instead of calculating it as a fixed fraction of rn

2894,a better understanding of solute transport in fractures with immobile zones is critical for many geophysical processes and engineering applications although the roles of immobile zones in capturing and releasing solutes leading to non fickian transport are well acknowledged the mass transfer between immobile and mobile domains using the first order rate law has never been explicitly validated to this end we solved fluid flow and solute transport through direct numerical simulations with reynolds number re ranging from 10 to 40 where one kind of immobile zone i e recirculation zones rzs are noticeably present and grow with re by fitting the analytical solution using the first order rate law to the numerically derived concentration in rzs we find that the first order rate law is applicable whenever rzs are noticeably present moreover the mass transfer coefficient increases with re and decreases from upstream to downstream in the direction of fluid flow hence the mass transfer coefficient should be precisely determined to accurately capture non fickian transport via the first order rate law keywords fracture recirculation zone fluid flow solute transport first order rate law mass transfer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the presence of fractures naturally serves as preferential flow paths that transmit subsurface fluids and fluid borne solutes berkowitz 2002 boutt et al 2006 mohais et al 2012 therefore understanding solute transport process in fractures is of great importance to better understand biogeochemical cycles gu et al 2020 and to determine the success of engineering applications such as sequestration of co2 deng et al 2015 wang and cardenas 2017 wang and cardenas 2019 and contaminant remediation lee et al 2017 the field tracer tests becker and shapiro 2000 małoszewski and zuber 1985 laboratory experiments lee et al 2015 and numerical simulations yoon and kang 2021 in fractured rocks all demonstrated that the non fickian transport regime prevails where transport behavior deviates from the traditional fickian theory described by the advection dispersion equation bauget and fourar 2008 the non fickian transport is typically characterized by the power law tailing process at the late time of breakthrough curves becker and shapiro 2000 berkowitz 2002 li et al 2020 which has been attributed to many driving mechanisms in fractured rocks including flow channeling tsang and neretnieks 1998 fracture heterogeneity detwiler et al 2000 wang and cardenas 2014 solute diffusion into and out of matrix hoffmann et al 2020 houseworth et al 2013 hyman and dentz 2021 zou et al 2017 chemical reactions such as sorption and desorption james et al 2018 and trapping and release of solute in immobile zone such as recirculation zones wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 among above mentioned mechanisms the mass transfer between immobile zone and main flow or mobile domain is particularly interested to researchers gao et al 2010 haggerty and gorelick 1995 zhou et al 2006 especially the presence of recirculation zones rzs that causes non fickian transport kim et al 2020 lee et al 2017 lee et al 2015 sund et al 2015 however the difficulty in observing and quantifying rz that makes such mass transfer less clear lee et al 2017 recent numerical and physical experiments observed rzs due to non negligible inertial effects and studied the concomitant effects of rzs on the non fickian transport lee et al 2015 wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 yet the accurate mathematic description of mass transfer between rzs and main flow remains less understood considering the difficulty in delineating the rzs volume and interface between rzs and main flow channel previous studies for simplicity proposed and applied the first order rate law where exchange flux is proportional to the concentration gradient with a proportionality coefficient i e the mass transfer coefficient to describe the mass transfer process between immobile zone i e rzs and mobile zone in fact this first order rate law underpins many classic models including the mobile immobile model chen et al 2010 gao et al 2010 multi rate model haggerty and gorelick 1995 etc in these models solute transport in the immobile zones is traditionally assumed to follow pure diffusion process however at high flow rate or high reynolds number re regime solute transport in rzs significantly deviates from the traditional view based on physical and numerical experiments lee et al 2017 lee et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 where solute advects along the fracture walls and diffuses towards to the center of rzs this observed phenomenon raises the question of applicability of the first order rate law for describing the mass transfer process between rzs and main flow channel moreover the mass transfer coefficient in the first order rate law remains physically elusive because it is often times determined by fitting breakthrough curves to the classical models gao et al 2010 haggerty and gorelick 1995 this makes the first order rate law become less predictive to the best of our knowledge while the classic models are powerful to predict solute transport process the robustness of using the first order rate law in these models at high re regime has never been directly tested so far for describing the mass transfer process between the immobile and mobile domains let alone the accurate determination of mass transfer coefficient although a previous study has quantified the dynamic mass transfer coefficient zhou et al 2019 the validity of the first order rate law itself and the appropriateness of mass transfer coefficient remains untested to address this question we resort to the recently proposed automatic detection of rzs and the associated interface wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 the accurate quantification of rzs enables the corroboration of the first order rate law that is exemplified in an idealized sinusoidal fracture when inertial effects are non negligible 2 methodology 2 1 simplified fracture with sinusoidal surfaces the simplified fracture geometry considered here is a converging diverging channel with sinusoidal boundaries fig 1 a as studied by previous studies bolster et al 2014 sund et al 2015 this is because recirculation zones are more likely to exist that serve our purpose specifically the geometry is bounded by two symmetric surfaces where the surface s varies in the longitudinal direction x following 1 s x b a c o s 2 π x λ where b m is the constant value a m the amplitude of fluctuation λ m is wavelength of aperture field in this study the minimum aperture h 2 mm a h and λ 5 h fig 1a this specific two dimensional sinusoidal geometry rather than a three dimensional geometry was used here due to two reasons a the numerical modelling and rzs are tractable in a two dimensional geometry and b the results are typical regardless of dimensionality where rzs have appreciable effects on the non fickian solute transport as discussed below 2 2 fluid flow with recirculation zone in a simplified fracture the flow of fluids in fracture is essentially dictated by the navier stokes equations wang et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 2 ρ u u p μ 2 u u 0 where u u w m s is the velocity vector in the two dimensional fracture p pa is pressure ρ 1 103 kg m3 is fluid density μ 1 10 3 pa s is fluid viscosity to solve the flow field we used a constant flux at the inlet left and a zero pressure at the outlet right boundaries fig 1a all other boundaries were no slip walls this led to fluid flow from left to right fig 2 to make sure rzs have non negligible effects on solute transport where the first order rate law can be well evaluated the constant flux was incrementally increased to achieve different flow regimes with re 10 15 20 40 where re is defined as 3 re ρ q μ where q m s is specific discharge at the outlet this specific range of re was considered here because inertial effects were pronounced resulting in noticeable volume of rzs in the fracture we applied a finer triangular mesh element around the fracture walls and a relative coarser mesh in the inner domain fig 1b in total we had 4 9 104 triangular elements the numerical solutions were insensitive to a further refinement of element size results are not shown here the above numerical configuration was conducted via a finite element based solver comsol multiphysics in a memory shared workstation in the end four numerical cases were done with re 10 15 20 40 where rzs were all remarkably present with distinct flow velocity fields fig 2 2 3 automatic delineation of recirculation zone the solutions to the flow fields were further used to accurately quantify the spatial distribution and volume of rzs within the simplified fracture fig 3 essentially the zero integral fluid flux was particularly employed here to delineate rzs considering there was no flux across the interface between rzs and main flow channel yoon and kang 2021 zhou et al 2019 in fact this method has been rigorously derived and validated in two dimension zhou et al 2019 and three dimensional wang et al 2020 flow fields in fractures in this study the automatic detection of rzs was conducted via a public accessible matlab code zhou et al 2019 2 4 solute transport in fracture the resultant distinct flow fields of four cases were used to simulate solute transport via the advection diffusion equation 4 c t u c d m c where c kg m3 is concentration t s is time dm is molecular diffusion coefficient 2 03 10 9 m2 s in this study we applied a dirichlet boundary condition with a constant concentration cin 1 kg m3 at inlet left and a neumann boundary condition with zero dispersive diffusive flux at the outlet right in fig 1a there was no solute in the fracture at the beginning of simulation the mesh scheme was further refined at the interface of rzs fig 1c to ensure accurate quantification of mass transfer between the main flow channel and rzs which resulted in 1 44 million of triangular elements the solute transport simulations were also implemented in comsol multiphysics each run took about a few hours to one day depending on re in the memory shared workstation since we only considered moderate to high re flow regimes the transport regimes were thus advection dominated where peclet number pe m defined as 5 pe q d m ranging from 2 46 106 to 9 85 106 for the purpose of analyzing transport behavior we evaluated the flux weighted concentration over time at the outlet that constituted breakthrough curves btcs for four cases with varying re moreover the btcs were further used to estimate the residence time distributions rtds by taking the time derivative of concentration that was plotted against time the rtds were particularly concerned here because rtds served as a better way to demonstrate the heavy tailing behavior that is the power law function c t n was consistently used to fit rtds at a given time window from 1 to 3 pore volumes for all cases where the exponent n represents the degree of late time tailing 2 5 verification of the first order rate law with asymptotic increase of concentration in recirculation zone almost all classical models including the mobile immobile model chen et al 2010 gao et al 2010 multi rate model haggerty and gorelick 1995 assume the first order rate law is valid for describing mass transfer across the interface between the immobile zone and mobile zone 6 c im t α c 0 c im where cim kg m3 is the mean concentration of immobile zone or rzs c 0 kg m3 is time invariant concentration of mobile zone or main flow channel α 1 s is mass transfer coefficient the time invariant c 0 is assumed here because solutes travel much faster in the main flow channel than those in rzs where solute concentration in the main flow channel quickly equilibrates with the constant inlet boundary condition the analytical solution to the equation 6 is 7 c im c 0 1 exp α t essentially cim increases asymptotically with time given that the first order rate law is valid in this study rzs are one type of immobile zone we extracted the mean concentration i e c rz from direct numerical simulations over time in rzs to verify the validity of the first order rate law the time series of c rz of each rz was used to fit solution cim in the equation 7 by adjusting parameters c 0 and α the goodness of fitting was assessed by the root square mean error 8 r m s e c rz c im 2 n for a given re we had three rzs in the fracture fig 3a and we solved four re cases in total we conducted twelve i e 3 4 inverse fitting procedures in matlab using fminsearch function 3 results and discussion on the first order rate law for describing mass transfer between recirculation zone and main flow channel 3 1 the growth of recirculation zones with increasing inertial effects with increasing re we find a remarkable enlargement of all three rzs in the fractures figs 2 and 3a this is mainly due to enhanced inertial effects that led to a large proportion of energy dissipated within rzs indeed the growth of rzs with increasing inertial effects or re is a widely acknowledged flow phenomenon in porous media chaudhary et al 2011 chaudhary et al 2013 and fractures lee et al 2015 wang et al 2020 where the shape and location of rzs depend on the flow direction and re cardenas et al 2009 in this study the amplitude of fracture surface equals to the separation of fracture surfaces fig 1 which creates a potential large room for the growth of rzs specifically we find that the total volume of rzs increases monotonically with re fig 3b where rzs almost takes up half of fracture volume when re 40 the enlargement of rzs and concomitant shrinkage of main flow channel can lead to a reduction of effective permeability lee et al 2017 wang et al 2020 xing et al 2021 more importantly the large portion of rzs plays an important role in solute transport by capturing and releasing solutes as discussed below 3 2 the effects of recirculation zones on non fickian transport solutes not only travel along with water following advection process but also migrate driven by the concentration gradient following diffusion process which typically leads to transport behavior depending on re regimes bouquain et al 2012 for example the early arrival which is indicative of initial breakthrough time in the breakthrough curves fig 5 is a typical feature of non fickian transport here we find that the early arrival time of solutes in btcs and rtds decreases with re fig 5 this is because at high re regimes solute normally follows a highly dispersive process in the main flow channel that leads to a quick breakthrough time moreover the transport process is further complicated by the presence of rzs because the flow behavior in the main flow channel and rzs are remarkably different fig 2 i e the reverse flow field with a much low magnitude is uniquely present in rzs that is consistent with previous studies boutt et al 2006 lee et al 2015 therefore solutes take a longer orders of magnitude time to fully sample rzs than that for the main flow channel fig 4 resulting in a heavy tailing in the late time btcs fig 5a and rtds fig 5b another typical feature of non fickian transport the degree of tailing was demonstrated by the power law exponent in the power law function c t n which was fitted to the late time rtds typically the smaller n is the heavier tailing behavior would be based on numerical simulations with varying re or pe we find that n increases with re indicating that the enhanced spreading and mixing caused by the advection in rzs could lead to the shortened tailing in rtds which is congruent with previous study lee et al 2015 it is worthy to be mentioned that like in the main flow channel solute transport is driven by both of advection and diffusion processes in rzs bolster et al 2014 bouquain et al 2012 which is different from the traditional perception assuming pure diffusion in the immobile zone gao et al 2010 houseworth et al 2013 to further demonstrate the difference between solute transport behaviors caused by the pure diffusion and coupled advection diffusion in rzs we added one more simulation by manually imposing velocity 0 m s in rzs when re 40 fig 4 as expected under the condition of pure diffusion process with zero velocity solutes normally migrate at a constant rate that is perpendicular to the interface of rzs and the main flow channel fig 4 in contrast for the case with advection and diffusion in rzs when re 40 solutes first travel along the fracture walls driven by advection then diffuse into the center of rzs fig 4 this phenomenon is congruent with the previous study zhou et al 2019 3 3 the validity of first order rate law with notable features of mass transfer coefficient the assumption of the first order rate law underlies many classical upscaled models gao et al 2010 haggerty and gorelick 1995 zhou et al 2006 but it has never been explicitly validated based on the simplified fracture geometry our study for the first time shows that the first order rate law in describing the mass transfer between rzs and main flow channel remains valid whenever rzs are present this is demonstrated by the good performance of equation 7 in capturing the mean concentration over time in rzs fig 6 a moreover the rmse values for all cases including the pure diffusion case and advection diffusion case in capturing mean concentration in rzs are noticeably small rmse 0 05 further suggesting the robustness of the first order rate law this is somehow surprising because this law is theoretically valid when pure diffusion is present in rzs with increasing re the effects of advection in rzs on the solute transport behavior is prominent which might violate the basis of the first order rate law however the first order rate law remains robust fig 6 this is likely due to a fact that the overall mean velocity in rzs remains relatively small or the advective flux is on the same order of magnitude of diffusive flux in rzs the above phenomenon partially explains why classical upscaled models although never tested are applicable in many real world situations by tweaking with parameters zhou et al 2006 given the validity of the first order law we estimated the mass transfer coefficient α by fitting equation 7 to the numerically derived concentration fig 7 a our method of estimating α is different from previous studies karadimitriou et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 where they calculated dynamic values of α that ultimately stabilized to a constant value based on the concentration difference between mobile and immobile zones we argue that our method based on the equation 7 would be more representative and reliable to reproduce the evolution of mean concentration in rzs the collective information of α for different locations of rzs with increasing re suggests three notable features a at a given rz α monotonically increases with re fig 7a due to the enhanced mass transfer process caused by the advection in rz b given the same re α monotonically decreases from rzs located in the upstream to that located in the downstream fig 7a c the assumption of pure diffusion in rz at re 40 substantially underestimates α that is affected by both of advection and diffusion we further plotted α against the areas of rzs fig 7b because the areas of rzs and re are tightly correlated due to the growth of rzs fig 3b we find that although the first order rate law is applicable for the varying re cases the magnitude of mass transfer determined by α should be varied from place to place and depends on re or pe suggesting the multi rate transfer model would be more appropriate and could be used in a broad sense haggerty and gorelick 1995 3 4 possibility of using distributed mobile immobile models for capturing non fickian transport the magnitude of α is critical to determine the accuracy of upscaled models to support this argument we implemented one dimensional numerical simulations based on the distributed mobile immobile model dmim following zhou et al 2019 which can be regarded as a special type of multi rate transfer model haggerty and gorelick 1995 for a comparison purpose we selected two dimensional direct simulation results when re 10 and 40 as reference cases where advection and diffusion in rzs were considered figs 4 5 in the dmim model two cases with specified α were solved in comsol multiphysics the input α values determined in fig 7 considered either pure diffusion following traditional perception re 40 or advection diffusion re 10 and 40 as realistically occurring in rzs moreover the mean velocity and dispersion coefficient were approximated using parameter estimation tool in comsol multiphysics to fit direct simulation results the inversion process by adjusting velocity and dispersion coefficient in the dmim can roughly capture the overall trend of non fickian btcs fig 8 however using α determined by the fully resolved advection and diffusion apparently improves the prediction of btcs compared to the case with α determined by the pure diffusion for the case with re 40 fig 8b this numerical practice of using different α suggests that the dmim is a viable tool to capture the non fickian solute transport but the selection of α for each rz in the model should be carefully determined 4 summary and conclusion the first order rate law used in the classical upscaled models for describing mass transfer between immobile and mobile domains is widely used however its robustness has never been tested here the flow and solute transport processes were directly solved with varying reynolds number the flow velocity field was used to map the spatial distribution of recirculation zone rz in the fractures moreover the numerically derived mean concentration in rz was applied to validate the analytical solutions based on the first order rate law for the first time we find that the first order rate law is robust for describing mass transfer process between mobile and immobile domains particularly in fractures with the presence of rz moreover the mass transfer coefficient in this law increases with re and decreases from upstream to downstream our study suggests the potential applicability of the first order rate law in many upscaled models but the caution should be paid to the determination of mass transfer coefficient credit authorship contribution statement lizhi zheng

2894,a better understanding of solute transport in fractures with immobile zones is critical for many geophysical processes and engineering applications although the roles of immobile zones in capturing and releasing solutes leading to non fickian transport are well acknowledged the mass transfer between immobile and mobile domains using the first order rate law has never been explicitly validated to this end we solved fluid flow and solute transport through direct numerical simulations with reynolds number re ranging from 10 to 40 where one kind of immobile zone i e recirculation zones rzs are noticeably present and grow with re by fitting the analytical solution using the first order rate law to the numerically derived concentration in rzs we find that the first order rate law is applicable whenever rzs are noticeably present moreover the mass transfer coefficient increases with re and decreases from upstream to downstream in the direction of fluid flow hence the mass transfer coefficient should be precisely determined to accurately capture non fickian transport via the first order rate law keywords fracture recirculation zone fluid flow solute transport first order rate law mass transfer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the presence of fractures naturally serves as preferential flow paths that transmit subsurface fluids and fluid borne solutes berkowitz 2002 boutt et al 2006 mohais et al 2012 therefore understanding solute transport process in fractures is of great importance to better understand biogeochemical cycles gu et al 2020 and to determine the success of engineering applications such as sequestration of co2 deng et al 2015 wang and cardenas 2017 wang and cardenas 2019 and contaminant remediation lee et al 2017 the field tracer tests becker and shapiro 2000 małoszewski and zuber 1985 laboratory experiments lee et al 2015 and numerical simulations yoon and kang 2021 in fractured rocks all demonstrated that the non fickian transport regime prevails where transport behavior deviates from the traditional fickian theory described by the advection dispersion equation bauget and fourar 2008 the non fickian transport is typically characterized by the power law tailing process at the late time of breakthrough curves becker and shapiro 2000 berkowitz 2002 li et al 2020 which has been attributed to many driving mechanisms in fractured rocks including flow channeling tsang and neretnieks 1998 fracture heterogeneity detwiler et al 2000 wang and cardenas 2014 solute diffusion into and out of matrix hoffmann et al 2020 houseworth et al 2013 hyman and dentz 2021 zou et al 2017 chemical reactions such as sorption and desorption james et al 2018 and trapping and release of solute in immobile zone such as recirculation zones wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 among above mentioned mechanisms the mass transfer between immobile zone and main flow or mobile domain is particularly interested to researchers gao et al 2010 haggerty and gorelick 1995 zhou et al 2006 especially the presence of recirculation zones rzs that causes non fickian transport kim et al 2020 lee et al 2017 lee et al 2015 sund et al 2015 however the difficulty in observing and quantifying rz that makes such mass transfer less clear lee et al 2017 recent numerical and physical experiments observed rzs due to non negligible inertial effects and studied the concomitant effects of rzs on the non fickian transport lee et al 2015 wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 yet the accurate mathematic description of mass transfer between rzs and main flow remains less understood considering the difficulty in delineating the rzs volume and interface between rzs and main flow channel previous studies for simplicity proposed and applied the first order rate law where exchange flux is proportional to the concentration gradient with a proportionality coefficient i e the mass transfer coefficient to describe the mass transfer process between immobile zone i e rzs and mobile zone in fact this first order rate law underpins many classic models including the mobile immobile model chen et al 2010 gao et al 2010 multi rate model haggerty and gorelick 1995 etc in these models solute transport in the immobile zones is traditionally assumed to follow pure diffusion process however at high flow rate or high reynolds number re regime solute transport in rzs significantly deviates from the traditional view based on physical and numerical experiments lee et al 2017 lee et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 where solute advects along the fracture walls and diffuses towards to the center of rzs this observed phenomenon raises the question of applicability of the first order rate law for describing the mass transfer process between rzs and main flow channel moreover the mass transfer coefficient in the first order rate law remains physically elusive because it is often times determined by fitting breakthrough curves to the classical models gao et al 2010 haggerty and gorelick 1995 this makes the first order rate law become less predictive to the best of our knowledge while the classic models are powerful to predict solute transport process the robustness of using the first order rate law in these models at high re regime has never been directly tested so far for describing the mass transfer process between the immobile and mobile domains let alone the accurate determination of mass transfer coefficient although a previous study has quantified the dynamic mass transfer coefficient zhou et al 2019 the validity of the first order rate law itself and the appropriateness of mass transfer coefficient remains untested to address this question we resort to the recently proposed automatic detection of rzs and the associated interface wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 the accurate quantification of rzs enables the corroboration of the first order rate law that is exemplified in an idealized sinusoidal fracture when inertial effects are non negligible 2 methodology 2 1 simplified fracture with sinusoidal surfaces the simplified fracture geometry considered here is a converging diverging channel with sinusoidal boundaries fig 1 a as studied by previous studies bolster et al 2014 sund et al 2015 this is because recirculation zones are more likely to exist that serve our purpose specifically the geometry is bounded by two symmetric surfaces where the surface s varies in the longitudinal direction x following 1 s x b a c o s 2 π x λ where b m is the constant value a m the amplitude of fluctuation λ m is wavelength of aperture field in this study the minimum aperture h 2 mm a h and λ 5 h fig 1a this specific two dimensional sinusoidal geometry rather than a three dimensional geometry was used here due to two reasons a the numerical modelling and rzs are tractable in a two dimensional geometry and b the results are typical regardless of dimensionality where rzs have appreciable effects on the non fickian solute transport as discussed below 2 2 fluid flow with recirculation zone in a simplified fracture the flow of fluids in fracture is essentially dictated by the navier stokes equations wang et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 2 ρ u u p μ 2 u u 0 where u u w m s is the velocity vector in the two dimensional fracture p pa is pressure ρ 1 103 kg m3 is fluid density μ 1 10 3 pa s is fluid viscosity to solve the flow field we used a constant flux at the inlet left and a zero pressure at the outlet right boundaries fig 1a all other boundaries were no slip walls this led to fluid flow from left to right fig 2 to make sure rzs have non negligible effects on solute transport where the first order rate law can be well evaluated the constant flux was incrementally increased to achieve different flow regimes with re 10 15 20 40 where re is defined as 3 re ρ q μ where q m s is specific discharge at the outlet this specific range of re was considered here because inertial effects were pronounced resulting in noticeable volume of rzs in the fracture we applied a finer triangular mesh element around the fracture walls and a relative coarser mesh in the inner domain fig 1b in total we had 4 9 104 triangular elements the numerical solutions were insensitive to a further refinement of element size results are not shown here the above numerical configuration was conducted via a finite element based solver comsol multiphysics in a memory shared workstation in the end four numerical cases were done with re 10 15 20 40 where rzs were all remarkably present with distinct flow velocity fields fig 2 2 3 automatic delineation of recirculation zone the solutions to the flow fields were further used to accurately quantify the spatial distribution and volume of rzs within the simplified fracture fig 3 essentially the zero integral fluid flux was particularly employed here to delineate rzs considering there was no flux across the interface between rzs and main flow channel yoon and kang 2021 zhou et al 2019 in fact this method has been rigorously derived and validated in two dimension zhou et al 2019 and three dimensional wang et al 2020 flow fields in fractures in this study the automatic detection of rzs was conducted via a public accessible matlab code zhou et al 2019 2 4 solute transport in fracture the resultant distinct flow fields of four cases were used to simulate solute transport via the advection diffusion equation 4 c t u c d m c where c kg m3 is concentration t s is time dm is molecular diffusion coefficient 2 03 10 9 m2 s in this study we applied a dirichlet boundary condition with a constant concentration cin 1 kg m3 at inlet left and a neumann boundary condition with zero dispersive diffusive flux at the outlet right in fig 1a there was no solute in the fracture at the beginning of simulation the mesh scheme was further refined at the interface of rzs fig 1c to ensure accurate quantification of mass transfer between the main flow channel and rzs which resulted in 1 44 million of triangular elements the solute transport simulations were also implemented in comsol multiphysics each run took about a few hours to one day depending on re in the memory shared workstation since we only considered moderate to high re flow regimes the transport regimes were thus advection dominated where peclet number pe m defined as 5 pe q d m ranging from 2 46 106 to 9 85 106 for the purpose of analyzing transport behavior we evaluated the flux weighted concentration over time at the outlet that constituted breakthrough curves btcs for four cases with varying re moreover the btcs were further used to estimate the residence time distributions rtds by taking the time derivative of concentration that was plotted against time the rtds were particularly concerned here because rtds served as a better way to demonstrate the heavy tailing behavior that is the power law function c t n was consistently used to fit rtds at a given time window from 1 to 3 pore volumes for all cases where the exponent n represents the degree of late time tailing 2 5 verification of the first order rate law with asymptotic increase of concentration in recirculation zone almost all classical models including the mobile immobile model chen et al 2010 gao et al 2010 multi rate model haggerty and gorelick 1995 assume the first order rate law is valid for describing mass transfer across the interface between the immobile zone and mobile zone 6 c im t α c 0 c im where cim kg m3 is the mean concentration of immobile zone or rzs c 0 kg m3 is time invariant concentration of mobile zone or main flow channel α 1 s is mass transfer coefficient the time invariant c 0 is assumed here because solutes travel much faster in the main flow channel than those in rzs where solute concentration in the main flow channel quickly equilibrates with the constant inlet boundary condition the analytical solution to the equation 6 is 7 c im c 0 1 exp α t essentially cim increases asymptotically with time given that the first order rate law is valid in this study rzs are one type of immobile zone we extracted the mean concentration i e c rz from direct numerical simulations over time in rzs to verify the validity of the first order rate law the time series of c rz of each rz was used to fit solution cim in the equation 7 by adjusting parameters c 0 and α the goodness of fitting was assessed by the root square mean error 8 r m s e c rz c im 2 n for a given re we had three rzs in the fracture fig 3a and we solved four re cases in total we conducted twelve i e 3 4 inverse fitting procedures in matlab using fminsearch function 3 results and discussion on the first order rate law for describing mass transfer between recirculation zone and main flow channel 3 1 the growth of recirculation zones with increasing inertial effects with increasing re we find a remarkable enlargement of all three rzs in the fractures figs 2 and 3a this is mainly due to enhanced inertial effects that led to a large proportion of energy dissipated within rzs indeed the growth of rzs with increasing inertial effects or re is a widely acknowledged flow phenomenon in porous media chaudhary et al 2011 chaudhary et al 2013 and fractures lee et al 2015 wang et al 2020 where the shape and location of rzs depend on the flow direction and re cardenas et al 2009 in this study the amplitude of fracture surface equals to the separation of fracture surfaces fig 1 which creates a potential large room for the growth of rzs specifically we find that the total volume of rzs increases monotonically with re fig 3b where rzs almost takes up half of fracture volume when re 40 the enlargement of rzs and concomitant shrinkage of main flow channel can lead to a reduction of effective permeability lee et al 2017 wang et al 2020 xing et al 2021 more importantly the large portion of rzs plays an important role in solute transport by capturing and releasing solutes as discussed below 3 2 the effects of recirculation zones on non fickian transport solutes not only travel along with water following advection process but also migrate driven by the concentration gradient following diffusion process which typically leads to transport behavior depending on re regimes bouquain et al 2012 for example the early arrival which is indicative of initial breakthrough time in the breakthrough curves fig 5 is a typical feature of non fickian transport here we find that the early arrival time of solutes in btcs and rtds decreases with re fig 5 this is because at high re regimes solute normally follows a highly dispersive process in the main flow channel that leads to a quick breakthrough time moreover the transport process is further complicated by the presence of rzs because the flow behavior in the main flow channel and rzs are remarkably different fig 2 i e the reverse flow field with a much low magnitude is uniquely present in rzs that is consistent with previous studies boutt et al 2006 lee et al 2015 therefore solutes take a longer orders of magnitude time to fully sample rzs than that for the main flow channel fig 4 resulting in a heavy tailing in the late time btcs fig 5a and rtds fig 5b another typical feature of non fickian transport the degree of tailing was demonstrated by the power law exponent in the power law function c t n which was fitted to the late time rtds typically the smaller n is the heavier tailing behavior would be based on numerical simulations with varying re or pe we find that n increases with re indicating that the enhanced spreading and mixing caused by the advection in rzs could lead to the shortened tailing in rtds which is congruent with previous study lee et al 2015 it is worthy to be mentioned that like in the main flow channel solute transport is driven by both of advection and diffusion processes in rzs bolster et al 2014 bouquain et al 2012 which is different from the traditional perception assuming pure diffusion in the immobile zone gao et al 2010 houseworth et al 2013 to further demonstrate the difference between solute transport behaviors caused by the pure diffusion and coupled advection diffusion in rzs we added one more simulation by manually imposing velocity 0 m s in rzs when re 40 fig 4 as expected under the condition of pure diffusion process with zero velocity solutes normally migrate at a constant rate that is perpendicular to the interface of rzs and the main flow channel fig 4 in contrast for the case with advection and diffusion in rzs when re 40 solutes first travel along the fracture walls driven by advection then diffuse into the center of rzs fig 4 this phenomenon is congruent with the previous study zhou et al 2019 3 3 the validity of first order rate law with notable features of mass transfer coefficient the assumption of the first order rate law underlies many classical upscaled models gao et al 2010 haggerty and gorelick 1995 zhou et al 2006 but it has never been explicitly validated based on the simplified fracture geometry our study for the first time shows that the first order rate law in describing the mass transfer between rzs and main flow channel remains valid whenever rzs are present this is demonstrated by the good performance of equation 7 in capturing the mean

effects of advection in rzs on the solute transport behavior is prominent which might violate the basis of the first order rate law however the first order rate law remains robust fig 6 this is likely due to a fact that the overall mean velocity in rzs remains relatively small or the advective flux is on the same order of magnitude of diffusive flux in rzs the above phenomenon partially explains why classical upscaled models although never tested are applicable in many real world situations by tweaking with parameters zhou et al 2006 given the validity of the first order law we estimated the mass transfer coefficient α by fitting equation 7 to the numerically derived concentration fig 7 a our method of estimating α is different from previous studies karadimitriou et al 2016 zhou et al

suggests three notable features a at a given rz α monotonically increases with re fig 7a due to the enhanced mass transfer process caused by the advection in rz b given the same re α monotonically decreases from rzs located in the upstream to that located in the downstream fig 7a c the assumption of pure diffusion in rz at re 40 substantially underestimates α that is affected by both of advection and diffusion we further plotted α against the areas of rzs fig 7b because the areas of rzs and re are tightly correlated due to the growth of rzs fig 3b we find that although the first order rate law is applicable for the varying re cases the magnitude of mass transfer determined by α should be varied from place to place and depends on re or pe suggesting the multi rate transfer model would be more appropriate and could be used in a broad sense haggerty and gorelick 1995 3 4 possibility of using distributed mobile immobile models for capturing non fickian transport the

solute transport but the selection of α for each rz in the model should be carefully determined 4 summary and conclusion the first order rate law used in the classical upscaled models for describing
