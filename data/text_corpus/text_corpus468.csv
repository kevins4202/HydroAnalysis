2340,groundwater levels have been decreasing in most agricultural areas motivating research to find optimal solutions to balance socio economical and environmental demands traditionally groundwater optimization aims at long term profit maximization while accounting for the extraction costs following this approach we find exploitation protocols characterized by pumping rates that slowly decrease in time toward a long term sustainable value however the comparison of the model prediction with water extraction data for the period 1985 2021 from kern county in california points out the inconsistencies between real management and long term optimal behavior rather the observed trajectory resembles those obtained by finite time optimization horizons which provide short term high profits by over drafting while leading to long term dilapidation of the capital and the exhaustion of the aquifer such myopic planning results in a ponzi scheme for groundwater extraction like the infamous fraudulent scheme more than optimal profits are achievable by excessive short term consumption by the early investors the past and current aquifer exploiters leaving the later comers the future generations with an impossible cost to sustain including the environmental costs of aquifer over exploitation the myopic nature of human planning can be corrected and reconciled with a more sustainable use of groundwater keywords groundwater exploitation california overdraft unsustainable management economic optimization ponzi scheme data availability data used are publicly available and references òrovided mathemwtica cose available upon request 1 introduction in the 1920s charles ponzi became a millionaire in a few weeks by running the fraudulent scheme that later would take his name a ponzi scheme is characterized by very high promised returns of investment which are actually paid with money from new investors it allows some players the early ones to gain a super profit while leaving to certain demise the later ones when the scheme collapses in finite time the ponzi scheme is an example of market failure with an unsustainable economic trajectory the short sightedness of the great short term returns of a ponzi scheme is reminiscent of the unsustainable management of environmental resources hardin 1968 hoekstra and wiedmann 2014 and echoes the lack of foresight in the current management of major aquifers around the world scanlon et al 2012 while sustained groundwater extraction has enabled farmers and on a larger scale states to maintain a high level of returns from agricultural production even in drought years the same high extraction rates have impoverished groundwater resources irrigation has led to aquifers depletion in several regions scanlon et al 2012 siebert et al 2010 rodell et al 2018 and is likely to intensify under the uncertainty that climate change poses on future precipitation and surface soil water taylor et al 2013 with risk of exhaustion for human uses and heavy implications for food security and connected ecosystem health esteban and albiac 2011 in this paper we argue that groundwater exploitation is a quintessential example of an environmental ponzi scheme in which over exploiters play the role of the early investors profiting from the excessive overdraft but leaving depleted aquifers to the next generation the late investors optimal management of groundwater has been a well explored research topic since the 1960s but remains a matter of timely importance due to global water scarcity here we revisit the subject as a classic example of optimization to analyze the optimal strategies for groundwater extraction as a function of the planning time while the literature see next section for a review generally considers groundwater optimization over infinite time horizons we show that real pumping rates rather follow a protocol that optimizes the revenue for much shorter horizons comparing the optimal trajectories for different time horizons with observed data for groundwater management we show that indeed the extraction path offers higher utility compared to the long term optimum but only for a limited time after that the trajectories become first sub optimal and then unsustainable revealing that the current exploitation path shares the shortsightedness of a ponzi scheme only strong policies towards more sustainable pumping rates can avoid sharing also the fate of the ponzi investors the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a brief review of the research devoted to the application of optimization methods for groundwater management section 3 presents in detail the model for the aquifer exploitation and the implemented optimal control method the solution to the optimization process is presented and discussed in section 4 the intrinsic instability of the optimal path sets the stage for an unsustainable path toward over exploitation in section 5 the application of the model to a real case study is investigated we take as a representative example the overdraft in kern county overlying the california aquifer system which has been experiencing depletion since the beginning of the twentieth century finally we draw some conclusions in section 6 2 optimal management of groundwater resources a brief review the risk of groundwater over exploitation calls for a solution that balances the socio economical demand with the preservation of water availability in the aquifers and the related streams and water bodies for this reason determining the optimal i e economically viable and environmentally sustainable protocols for groundwater use has motivated a considerable amount of research the problem faces the difficult task of linking climatic biological and socio economical issues for a review see bierkens and wada 2019 this avenue of research has naturally adopted optimization methods and control theory hotelling s hotelling 1931 seminal work on exhaustible resources marked the beginning of extensive use of the calculus of variations including the celebrated work by boltyanskii et al 1960 and bellman 1954 among others kamien 2012 in general optimal control aims at finding a strategy that minimizes respectively maximizes a given cost gain functional these methods allow us to rigorously compare a continuum of scenarios and control protocols to find optimal strategies in the entire strategy space where the control parameters can be continuously changed over time in a series of papers with specific reference to groundwater burt 1964 1966 1967 1970 and brown and deacon 1972 first developed the variational problem to optimize groundwater use integrating the groundwater modeling as a single cell aquifer in this framework the exploitation of an aquifer aims to maximize the revenue from agricultural production sustained by groundwater irrigation offset by the cost of water extraction which increases with the depletion of the aquifer an optimal pumping rate is reached when an extra unit of withdrawal equals the value of an extra unit of water left in the aquifer following the fundamental framework established in these first works the literature has pursued two main directions on the one hand the main goal has been to include more realistic aquifer representations which better characterize the spatial heterogeneities and the hydrogeologic processes bredehoeft and young 1970 brozović et al 2006a knapp and olson 1995 provencher and burt 1994 on the other hand a second research direction focused on including the interaction of multiple agents in the optimization process using tools borrowed from game theory agent based models and behavioral economics foster et al 2014 fisher and huber lee 2012 mulligan et al 2014 competition among users of the same aquifer likely causes depletion gisser and mercado 1973 since each user has little incentive to leave the water in the aquifer as the competitors may take advantage of that free exploitation of the common pool resource results in an extraction rate path that is intrinsically regulated by the users competition to be economically efficient gisser and sánchez 1980 argued that the competitive solution has a negligible discrepancy from the optimally controlled one leading to the conclusion that there is no benefit in following a controlled path especially when considering that optimization has a cost such a similarity between the optimal and the competitive pumping rates has since been known as the gisser sanchez effect not surprisingly a great deal of research has been devoted to either confirming or discrediting this counter intuitive result which discards the need for regulations koundouri 2004 found that the gisser sanchez effect holds in many cases but its validity is challenged for highly nonlinear cost of extraction spatial heterogeneity of productivity worthington et al 1985 aquifers close to depletion presence of river effects and the inclusion of environmental externalities esteban and albiac 2011 a few years after the gisser and sanchez paper negri 1989 explored the same antagonism between control and competition using a game theory perspective in the formulation of the optimization problem he extended the exploitation path solution of brown and deacon 1972 to multiple users and then compared it to the competitive case modeled as a differential game while providing the conditions for the two cases to be identical single user or behavior independent of storage observation the focus of his paper was more on the nature of the two solutions the solution provided by optimal control was argued to be unrealistic as the optimal control framework assumes the agents commit to a predetermined pumping path for the entire horizon of the planning while it is more realistic to picture that owners would observe the level of the water table revise their expectations about the actions of their rivals and pursue optimal pumping rates given the current information this kind of feedback solution does not require commitment and depends on the aquifer state another interesting aspect of optimal solutions is related to the fact that dynamic optimization problems often have saddle path solutions samuelson 1972 barro and sala i martin 2004 this fact in relation to different optimization time horizons has important theoretical and practical consequences which have not been thoroughly investigated within the groundwater context and in general in environmental problems thus as it is common in economic growth models see for example the famous ramsey koopmans cass model ramsey 1928 the optimization through the pontryagin maximum principle results in a dynamical system with saddle stability in which the optimal trajectory or saddle path lies onto the stable manifold that reaches the saddle point the unstable nature of the saddle equilibrium means that the slightest deviation from the path tends to take the dynamics far away from the optimal one christiaans 2001a argued that the positive attitude with which the economic theory looks at these solutions has been taken so far that is actually common to refer to the saddle equilibria as stable barro and sala i martin 2004 lucas 1988 which is obviously an oxymoron for by definition a saddle point is unstable indeed the permanence on the saddle path is a condition stemming from long term actually infinite time optimality the maximum principle ensures this stability through a constraint on the time horizon called the transversality condition which ensures that by uniquely defining the correct initial condition the system neither explodes nor falls towards the uninteresting stable equilibrium in other words adherence to the optimal path is guaranteed only by means of a perfect foresight condition which disregards real world conditions and implies infinite time horizons the practical unfeasibility of such long term optimal solutions lies in the self interested and often myopic behavior of the agents the determination of these exact values is subject to uncertainty and errors that can lead one quickly far from the optimum to this regard christiaans offers an effective analogy when he compares the agent s trust to reach the optimum to the confidence a physicist could have in giving the precise push to a pendulum that would make it stay straight up christiaans 2001b in practice remaining on the optimal path requires adjustment and reconsideration of the followed dynamics thus inherently challenging the nature of the long term optimal solution especially when considering the stochastic nature of aquifer evolution burt 1964 1966 3 modeling framework in this section we describe the optimization problem by first introducing the constraint represented by the simplified aquifer dynamics and the utility function to maximize we then review the maximum principle within the groundwater context and use it to obtain the optimal solution 3 1 aquifer water balance following burt 1967 brown and deacon 1972 gisser and sánchez 1980 negri 1989 we consider for simplicity a single cell model of the aquifer also known as the bathtub model brozović et al 2006b it considers an unconfined aquifer as a box with a uniform horizontal head and spatially uniform response pumping this simple representation has been traditionally implemented in groundwater management optimization roumasset and wada 2015 bierkens and wada 2019 and proved to be a reasonable approximation of more complex models augeraud veron and pereau 2022 the corresponding water balance equation is a differential equation that describes the rate of change of the water table level h l as the difference in the rate of inflow and outflow 1 n a d h d t r q b where the inflow is the groundwater recharge r l 3 t the outflows are the groundwater withdrawal by pumping q l 3 t and the baseflow b l 3 t n is the aquifer storage coefficient i e the aquifer effective porosity a l 2 is the representative aquifer area the recharge is assumed to be deterministic and constant for simplicity r r 0 with r 0 a constant a reasonable assumption for conditions in which the natural recharge is small compared to the aquifer storativity gisser and sánchez 1980 the recharge term represents the net inflow to the aquifer and includes the part of precipitation and applied water that percolates from the surface to the aquifer as well as managed recharge if any subsurface inflow and net interaction with surface water the outflow terms are the withdrawal due to agricultural industrial or urban use here we focus on agricultural extraction and the baseflow i e the amount of groundwater that discharges naturally into other water bodies for simplicity the baseflow component is considered as a linear function of the water table level b β h with β constant as often done in the literature crosbie et al 2005 fenicia et al 2006 gisser and sánchez 1980 to account for the reduced discharge to streams with lower water tables levels more complex nonlinear formulations are possible but are not expected to change quantitatively the results the withdrawal term refers to the groundwater pumping and represents the gross demand accounting for irrigation inefficiencies and other losses it should be clear that this description simplifies the real dynamics by assuming that pumping uniformly affects the water level this is a reasonable approximation for a relatively compact aquifer with well distributed wells but can be relaxed in the case of complex aquifers the current situation typical of many over exploited aquifers around the world implies that the extraction term is persistently higher than the recharge q r leading to overdraft harou and lund 2008 3 2 profit it is assumed that it is desirable to maximize the net economic value expressed as a utility functional 2 u t 0 t 0 t g t c t e ρ t d t over a period t i e a so called inter temporal problem kamien 2012 where t 0 is the time at which pumping is started g t 1 is the gain or revenue rate related to crop sale and other water uses c t 1 is the loss due to both economical costs e g infrastructure construction and electricity costs and environmental damages e g soil subsidence galloway and burbey 2011 reduction of baseflow fed by the aquifer scanlon et al 2012 etc and ρ is the discount rate t 1 on future utility the coupling between the two previous equations eqs 1 and 2 stems from the dependence of g and c on the pumping rate q we assume the gain to be proportional to withdrawals here referred to a unit area of the aquifer 3 g κ q α with q q a κ the profit per unit withdrawal and the exponent α to account for market saturation or limits to production independent of water availability the cost term 4 c μ σ h m a x h δ q θ is taken to be dependent on both the quantity of water extracted and the aquifer depletion h m a x h δ negri 1989 where σ is the drawdown h m a x is the maximum aquifer level i e irrigation surface and μ the cost of extraction and damages per unit of aquifer depletion increased costs associated with maintaining and repairing capital well and pump equipment resulting from the use of the well and pumps for withdrawals are captured by the nonlinear dependence on withdrawals q of the cost function through the parameter θ as groundwater is pumped out the water table close to the extraction site is lowered in the cone of depression or drawdown σ which means that the lifting depth is higher and needs to be considered in the water extraction costs knapp et al 2003 the nonlinearity in the cost function also represents both the increasing cost of extraction and the progressive loss of water availability and connectivity for ecosystems as the water table declines esteban and albiac 2011 3 3 optimization the maximum principle and the transversality condition the optimization game may be framed assuming either a single agent or a collective action by multiple users using the theory of variational analysis in either case it is concerned with determining the optimal function q t i e the control variable that maximizes the present value utility among the infinite possible ones the problem usually considers an infinite horizon t which is an appropriate choice for long term groundwater resource allocation burt 1967 as stated this is a dynamic problem since increased or reduced pumping rates will affect the aquifer dynamics and future pumping decisions formally it can be written as 5 max q t u max q t t 0 κ q t α μ σ h m a x h t δ q t θ e ρ t d t where now the time dependence of the variables h t and q t is made explicit the optimization is subject to the physical conditions imposed by the aquifer water balance eq 1 the scheme in fig 1 shows that the objective of the optimization process is maximizing profit by optimizing the control variable q t the normalized pumping rate that affects both the costs and the aquifer dynamics constraint the first step in the variational analysis is to build the hamiltonian 6 h e ρ t κ q t α μ σ h m a x h t δ q t θ λ t r 0 q t β h t n a where λ is the lagrange multiplier the pontryagin maximum principle kopp 1962 kamien 2012 chiang 1999 imposes the following first order conditions on the hamiltonian 7 h q 0 8 h h λ and 9 lim t λ h t 0 the lagrange multiplier λ is the co state variable interpreted as the shadow price of an extracted water unit the first two conditions eqs 7 and 8 provide the equations for the time evolution of the control variable q t and the water level h t the third equation eq 9 or transversality condition is a necessary condition on the final time its necessity comes directly from the lagrangian formulation of the calculus of variations when the hamiltonian is concave in both the control and state variable the transversality condition together with the first order conditions is the sufficient condition to have an optimum it has the role of choosing the right path in the entire phase space described by the equations for d h d t and d q d t to guarantee optimality in the specified time horizon being a condition on the final point eq 9 does not give directly the initial state to solve the system of equations h t q t numerically this is often solved through a shooting algorithm which iterates over plausible initial states to find the one that leads to the saddle point 4 optimal solution 4 1 optimal steady state before analyzing the variational problem it is instructive to consider the long term steady state in which case the problem is reduced to a classical extremization problem i e finding a maximum of a function a constant pumping rate q is applied for a very long time so that the problem reaches a steady state d h d t 0 with level 10 h r 0 q β which represents by definition the level at which recharge equals losses from the aquifer next we consider the utility per time neglecting the initial transient before the steady state this will also be constant in time 11 ū t 1 t 0 t 1 κ q t α μ σ h m a x h t δ q t θ e ρ t d t κ ρ q α μ ρ q θ σ h m a x h δ where the second equality follows from the fact that both pumping rate and aquifer level are constant in this integral and therefore can be taken out and from 0 e ρ t d t 1 ρ obviously if the long term withdrawal exceeds the replenishment or for the case of no recharge hotelling 1931 a steady state cannot be reached and the aquifer experiences progressive depletion till complete exhaustion and the aquifer mining yield are reached at which level the extraction cost equals the pumping benefits domenico et al 1968 hellegers et al 2001 substituting h from 10 the steady state utility can be written as a function of the constant pumping rate as 12 ū κ ρ q α μ ρ q θ σ h m a x r 0 q β δ and the optimal pumping rate is the maximum given by the condition d u d q 0 it is instructive to consider the special case θ 2 and δ α 1 which leads to an analytical expression for the optimal withdrawal rate at steady state 13 q o p t β σ h m a x μ β 3 β κ μ μ r 0 β σ h m a x μ 2 β 2 μ r 0 3 μ plotted in fig 2 this figure provides a simple way to find the optimal state the equilibrium is determined by the tangency point between the highest among the indifference curves along which the utility has the same constant value and the constraint curve a similar figure can be found in burt 1967 as expected the optimal equilibrium value for water table level obtained by inserting 13 in 10 increases with recharge a lower cost of extraction contributing to μ for example by means of more modern technology decreases the water table level as exploitation is more rewarding on the other hand damages to the environment when included in the cost coefficient penalize the economic benefit but help the preservation of a higher steady water table level khan and brown 2019 as shown in fig 2b the optimal steady state value is generally easy to compute but it rarely coincides with the initial state of the system thus the optimal path of extraction describes the evolution of the water table as it transitions from the initial head to the long term optimal one previous work kamien 2012 assessed that for a single resource and stationary demand and cost functions the paths will be monotonic meaning that the optimal head level will smoothly rise if the initial head is lower than the optimal steady state one or decrease if higher as shown in the next section 4 2 the saddle property the substitution of the maximum principle conditions eq 7 in eq 8 gives the dynamics of the control variable 14 q t δ θ μ q t θ 1 r 0 q t n a q t n a θ α κ β ρ q t α θ σ h max h t 1 δ δ θ μ β ρ σ h max h t δ β h t σ h max h t θ 1 θ μ q t θ α 1 α κ q t α σ h max h t δ which together with eq 1 forms a system of two nonlinear first order differential equations the phase space of this system presents saddle stability as shown in fig 3a this can be verified by linearizing the system around the steady state h q as 15 h ˆ t q ˆ t j h q h ˆ t q ˆ t where j is the jacobian matrix and noting that the determinant is negative barro and sala i martin 2004 the stable arm of the saddle or saddle path thick green line splits the phase space into two regions see fig 3a above the saddle path trajectories are characterized by a high value of pumping rate which causes the progressive lowering of the water table these paths are obviously not optimal in the lower part the water table grows because the recharge exceeds the modest pumping rate giving rise to trajectories that themselves are not optimal as some of the groundwater storage is left unexploited for an infinite time horizon the only path that ensures sustainability is the one that follows the stable arm of the saddle and ends at the steady state star symbol in fig 3a the convergence to the saddle path occurs by means of the transversality condition which assumes perfect foresight when the optimization occurs over finite time horizons the transversality condition now selects a different portion of the phase space that does not coincide with the saddle path only perfect foresight gives the saddle path as the optimal solution the further the finite horizon is set the closest the optimal trajectory is to the infinite horizon one a property known as the turnpike property samuelson 1972 trélat and zuazua 2015 4 3 sustainable groundwater use requires long term optimal planning the solution to the planning problem provides a protocol for the extraction rate that should be employed to efficiently manage the groundwater resource this requires that the agent has perfect foresight on the future utility that results from their pumping rates typically dynamic economic optimization suggests an initial phase of aquifer exploitation during which the pumping rate is high as seen in previous models young 1992 vaux 2011 later in the horizon the lowering of the water table causes the pumping to be more expensive so that withdrawals should progressively decrease until they finally reach the optimal steady state pumping rate corresponding to the saddle point it is important to notice that the solution of the optimization process is highly dependent on the transversality condition i e the condition on the final time in fact a final time condition is needed to close the optimization problem thus allowing the selection of the appropriate path for the given time horizon fig 3 compares the optimal trajectories for finite time solid arrows to the saddle path green thick line for different values of the finite time horizon dashed arrows denote the trajectories that the paths would follow according to eqs 1 14 after the planned horizon it should be clear that after this time such paths are no longer optimal for finite time horizons the optimal pumping rate is typically higher than in the infinite horizon case after a decreasing phase as the end of the horizon is approached the pumping rises as shown in fig 3c the corresponding optimal groundwater levels for each planning horizon are shown in fig 3b as can be seen for short time horizons the groundwater level drops quickly by increasing the planning time the decrease in groundwater level occurs at a slower pace but for all finite time horizons it ends in a final state that is lower than the long term optimum as the time horizon increases the optimal trajectory approaches the one of the infinite time horizon following the turnpike property however all the optimal trajectories at finite time deviate from the stable arm towards higher values of pumping rate this is because close to the end of the horizon there is no apprehension for future costs of extraction so increasing the pumping to increase the profit is convenient fig 3d shows the utility corresponding to the different optimal paths the cumulative benefit is higher than the long term optimal path green thick line for their corresponding time period for example the same trajectory that entails the best possible benefit for 10 years squanders all the profit if prolonged for the following 10 years because the aquifer is brought to low levels that strongly increase the costs of extraction it is clear from the trajectories in fig 3 that though optimal for their respective horizons they would bring the aquifer to complete depletion if they were pursued for longer times upper left quadrant in the phase space 5 real case application it is interesting to analyze a real case in light of the results just obtained toward this goal we apply the optimization problem to the case of kern county ca a region comprising the southeast part of the central valley major aquifer which heavily relies on groundwater for agriculture knapp et al 2003 kern county is the leading agricultural producer county in california thanks to growing high valued commodities such as grapes almonds and pistachios cdwa 2017 kern county subbasin consists of 787356 ha overlying the southernmost portion of central valley aquifer that extends for 5200 km 2 feinerman and knapp 1983 knapp et al 2003 the specific yield for the unconfined aquifer has an average value of 0 13 knapp et al 2003 california department of water resources 2006 model parameters are adjusted to represent kern county aquifer conditions and are described in what follows precipitation over the basin varies between 23 and 33 cm annually the recharge is considered constant and equal to r 0 0 79 km 3 year as the sum of net natural recharge and portion of surface inflow that reaches the aquifer as in knapp et al 2003 the recharge estimate is consistent with 1995 2014 c2vsimfg kern historical simulation kern groundwater authority 2023 average output for aquifer recharge due to deep percolation 0 812 km 3 year because of the scarce recharge and high withdrawals the aquifer level has declined dramatically feinerman and knapp 1983 and the basin has been designated as one of 21 critically over drafted basins in california bourque et al 2019 like other parts of california it has suffered the economic impact of recent droughts medellín azuara et al 2011 and climate change is feared to further exacerbate such over exploitation water table data for the region are available from the california department of water resources cdwr and the location of the available sites is indicated on the map in fig 4 the time frame considered here goes from 1985 to 2021 wells with less than 5 recordings were excluded as well as data with questionable elevation data e g elevations higher than ground surface elevation sudden change in the topographic level or unrealistic trends as a result data from 242 wells were used for the analysis fluctuations in water table levels are associated with variable climatic conditions see fig 4b the lowering of water table levels is correlated with periods of drought like the 2007 2010 or 2012 2010 period wet years periods 1995 to 1999 2005 to 2006 2011 present a partial recovery of groundwater table levels but the average water table level for the considered time frame shows an inexorable declining trend reported in fig 4 b as for water use in kern county data were obtained from the usgs database u s geological survey 0000a since agriculture takes up about 75 of total groundwater use kern groundwater authority 2023 the category irrigation total self supplied groundwater withdrawals fresh was considered as the estimate of water extraction per year water use data are provided every 5 year period and the corresponding time evolution for the pumping q t is reported in fig 4c the 2019 2021 water extraction estimate is instead taken from kern groundwater authority water use report kern groundwater authority 2023 fig 4c shows a particularly high level of extraction during dry years like the 2015 drought and 2021 one in particular 2021 has been a critically dry water year with total extraction of 3 05 cubic kilometers of which 73 was for agricultural use during wet years groundwater pumping in the kern county subbasin is generally about 20 to 30 lower due to higher surface water availability kern groundwater authority 2023 the initial water table elevation h 0 is the value registered in 1985 averaged among all the sites considered the baseflow represents a minor outflow from the basin it has been described as negligible in the 118 bulletin kern groundwater authority 2023 and consists of around 5 of total outflow in the averaged 1995 2014 c2vsimfg kern historical simulation the coefficient β to the baseflow output in eq 1 is estimated through a linear interpolation of subsurface outflow estimates and annual water table elevations the average groundwater pumping cost per unit of water lifted μ is taken from the literature knapp et al 2003 he et al 2019 and adjusted for inflation to current monetary values we do not account here for the cost of replacing wells that ran dry since kern county reports a low number of cases compared to other nearby subbasins we estimate the revenue from the water footprint of different crops grown in california fulton et al 2018 the total revenue is due to the consumptive use of water from all managed resources effective rainfall surface and groundwater the revenue per unit of water use and the share attributable to groundwater is very hard to define so we use a range of values that is consistent with the water footprint due to blue water total evapotranspiration effective rainfall and it falls within the 0 1 0 2 m 3 range a list of all parameters used here is reported in table 1 5 1 short term planning to compare the optimal profiles for extraction rate to real observations of withdrawal in the studied region we first plot the recorded pumping rate as a function of the water table elevation measurements for the 1985 2021 period to reproduce the phase space trajectory red line in fig 5a as expected the trend occupies the over exploitation part of the phase space situated above the long term sustainable green path pumping decreased in the early 2000 s almost as if approaching the optimal steady values for extraction and water table level however as a consequence of the most recent droughts the aquifer has been increasingly exploited producing the increasing trend of the last decade groundwater levels in most areas have since further decreased the measured pumping profile has produced a high revenue for most of the 40 years horizon since exploitation ensured a higher profit compared to the long term sustainable one red and green curves in fig 5b it is evident that such a trend is unsustainable for the aquifer and the entire agricultural system of the county 5 2 groundwater overdraft as a ponzi scheme as said in the introduction the long term unsustainable trajectories share similar features with the well known fraudulent ponzi scheme aquifer exploitation is characterized by excessive consumption and the revenue that comes from the overdrafting can be seen as the high promised returns that motivate more intense rates of extraction for the promise of higher profits the slow recharge rates cannot compensate for the outflow and the aquifer dynamics is driven through an unsustainable path that can only end with the exhaustion of the water resource once the aquifer is depleted it leaves some users enriched by years of exploitation while most of the participants face economic and environmental disaster fig 5b compares the profit gained by users that started exploiting the aquifer in different years a generation of early comers for example the curve starting in 1985 has the opportunity to end the use of the aquifer and find itself enriched by years of exploitation users that start profiting at a later stage the curves starting in 2005 or 2020 in fig 5b extract from a more depleted aquifer and face a higher risk of failure the analogy with the ponzi scheme is also born out of the short minded behavior that characterizes the agents the high pumping rates provided high revenue during the early drought periods with a utility higher than the long term optimal one red line in fig 5b yet to reach this super utility the aquifer was brought to a state that is close to collapse with consequent complete loss of utility feinerman and knapp 1983 it is interesting that staying on such a disastrous path is not incompatible with being rational economic agents as noted previously in madhavan and barrass 2011 with a sufficiently high and constant discount rate a stream of utility lasting for a finite time can have a higher present value than a lower utility stream of infinite duration in the case of financial bubbles it has been shown that even if agents recognize to be on one of them they may still be willing to stick to the course before trying to return to the saddle path as long as there are still short term benefits christiaans identifies it as a possible cause for the financial crisis of 2008 christiaans 2001a alternatively another reason for following a ponzi scheme is the lack of a proper and comprehensive definition of the cost function in which not all the potential costs are considered this case is discussed in the next section 5 3 the environmental cost of overdrafting as mentioned at the end of the previous section persevering on the unsustainable path may be explained also by an improper formulation of the cost function when the cost function accounts almost uniquely for the cost of water extraction as typical in both the theory and practice of groundwater management a pure economic optimization based on the short term costs and gains leads to over extraction especially in areas that decided to invest in high value crops like kern county agricultural revenue has been increasing despite water scarcity kern county s agricultural crop value increased from 4 billion in 2007 to 7 billion in 2016 and recently peaked at 8 3 billion making it one of the highest agricultural producers the imbalance between such numbers and the current groundwater crisis reveals unsuitable water prices that do not reflect the current scarcity and the value of keeping groundwater in the aquifer d odorico et al 2020 for this reason it is important to include other costs of groundwater depletion related to environmental damages these include effects due to land subsidence saline intrusion reduces stream flow and impoverishment of related wetlands and springs as well as interference with pre existing water uses and water rights sophocleous 2003 zektser et al 2005 such environmental costs are difficult to quantify but it is crucial to include them in the total cost to achieve a properly optimal strategy as a first step to explore the effect of adding further environmental constraints here we consider that all the environmental costs are functionally related to the lowering of the water table accordingly we analyze how the long term solution behaves when the h m a x h t term is weighted more in the optimization process δ 1 figure 8 sm shows how the saddle path shifts to the lower right with increasing δ the long term sustainable water table level shifts right to much higher values and the relative position compared to the observed pumping rate widens since now depletion implies an extra cost in addition to the extraction costs exploitation is further curtailed as a result the long term optimal value for water level increases and the optimal pumping rate decreases as shown in the contour plot in fig 6 the optimal trajectories now follow lower pumping rates see dashed lines in figure sm9b compared to the previous ones solid line in figure sm9 the water table levels are not lowered as much as in the previous case and even for finite time optimizations the aquifer is maintained in more sustainable conditions as depicted in figure sm9a the ponzi like behavior is thus contrasted by taking into account the real costs of overexploitation the optimization process naturally provides a new optimal now also environmentally optimal pumping protocol that ensures a more sustainable use of the aquifer fig 6c and d explores also the effect of increasing water extraction costs μ which can be also used as a proxy for increased water prices by assigning a higher value to the water in the aquifer extraction is discouraged as shown by the optimal long term value for pumping rate fig 6c the path to reach this more sustainable condition is characterized by a higher water table throughout the entire considered period fig 9d in sm 5 4 role of discounting the results are sensitive to the discount factor ρ applied in the optimization it has been shown that with a sufficiently high discount rate the utility accumulated in a short finite time can have a higher present value than a lower utility for an infinite time and thus is the preferred optimization output madhavan and barrass 2011 in other words an excessive discount on future generations utility could lead to quick depletion on the other hand introducing a low discount rate means weighing the utility of future generations so have an interest in keeping sustainable conditions as shown in fig 6a and 6b a lower discount rate pushes the optimal state to higher recommended groundwater levels and lower optimal long term pumping rates optimal protocols to reach the recommended levels present in fact lower rates of pumping and higher water tables throughout the planning period as shown in figure 9b in sm 5 5 an optimistic outlook the original scheme enacted by ponzi collapsed after 9 months artzrouni 2009 and others typically lasted a max of a few years the longest is known to have lasted about two decades enacted by bernie madoff luckily the groundwater ponzi scheme like other environmental resource exploitation paths typically has longer timescales while a market cannot sustain the overconsumption for more than a few months an aquifer may sustain a rate of depletion for much longer thanks to the huge initial resource stock it has been proved that a ponzi scheme with big enough initial stock can survive for a long time artzrouni 2009 this consideration enables some action to correct the unsustainable trend and regulations have already started to be imposed in 2014 california passed the sustainable groundwater management act sgwa requiring local water agencies to design and adopt groundwater management plans at the basin scale however integrating the new policies is challenging and bringing groundwater levels to long term sustainable levels will likely take many years medellín azuara et al 2015 the impact of policy regulation is expected to modify the current trend we explore this scenario by considering two different policies the hard policy scenario assumes that regulation imposes an immediate switch from the current trend to the long term optimal path in this scenario pumping rates experience an abrupt switch to values that are lower than the natural recharge consequently water tables immediately start recovering and smoothly increase toward the long term sustainable level the soft policy scenario instead assumes that pumping rates are gradually decreased by 10 of current values each year till they reach the long term sustainable pumping rate purple curve in fig 7 a new cap on q t is set and kept constant each year see fig 7c since the decrease in pumping is not abrupt water levels initially keep decreasing even if at a much slower pace compared to the current trend after a few years the pumping rate reaches a sustainable level and the aquifer starts recovering fig 7d compares the cumulative utility u t associated with each of these scenarios and the ponzi like trend the ponzi scenario shows an initial gain in benefit which is soon nullified by the complete depletion of the gained profit the soft policy scenario purple line initially entails higher profit compared to the hard policy green as pumping rates are kept higher along with the profit however after a few years the cumulative profit from the hard policy path is actually the highest since it operates at higher water table levels and has lower extraction costs it is important to note that even if the green curve is the optimal scenario imposing the initial abrupt switch in extraction rates would require a huge initial cost that would lower the total benefit because of the need for an important initial allocation of resources not to mention the nature of human adaptation a soft policy is more likely to be implemented thus lengthening the journey to aquifer recovery 5 6 limitations and possible extensions this work can be extended in several directions a first line of work could include the effects of different policy measures by modifying the cost function an extra benefit term could easily be introduced to represent potential subsidies for farmers to incentivize shifts towards drought tolerant crops or water efficient methods of irrigation moreover the aquifer dynamics could be adjusted to include the role of artificial recharge in replenishing groundwater provisions the resulting optimal trajectories could be compared to assess the repercussions on both the economy and the environment the temporal variability and stochastic nature of the economic groundwater system have been neglected here further research to fill this gap may include the role of disturbances in climate variables e g rainfall interannual variability see porporato and yin 2022 sec 7 8 or market fluctuations a time dependent recharge term could also consider the effect of a change in irrigation method for example the reduced percolation induced by adopting micro irrigation techniques the single cell aquifer does not account for spatial variability so in order to provide policy recommendations at a local level it is appropriate to incorporate the spatial heterogeneity location and use of each well as done in previous works brozović et al 2006b we also considered the totality of water extraction from the whole basin rather than single user behavior so a natural extension to this work would include a distribution of users and extraction strategies finally a more comprehensive analysis of groundwater management use should include also the impact on the energy sector kern et al 2020 he et al 2019 as well as food security renewable development may in fact increase the demand for water for hydro power while a more sustainable groundwater use would impact crop productivity and thus be better implemented with a concurrent optimization of crop types and production as it has already happened in some basins graham et al 2021 6 conclusions can groundwater overdraft be considered an environmental ponzi scheme the evidence from the case study of kern county in california pointed out the inconsistencies between the observed pumping rates and a presumed optimal behavior and therefore lent support to an affirmative answer interestingly the observed path maintains a high utility by over drafting this brings the water table levels to sub optimal conditions while still making the short term over exploitation a rational if unsustainable path help towards a solution comes from realizing the long term consequences of short term optimization the acknowledgment of the true costs of being part of a ponzi scheme helps prevent unsustainable conditions since including the environmental costs in the cost optimization leads to more sustainable pumping protocols it is crucial to understand the coupling between groundwater environmental impacts and the economy bierkens and wada 2019 so that its effects can be included for a better informed policy making process it is also necessary to assign a water value that reflects its preciosity as the current values are not compatible with a sustainable use of this resource d odorico et al 2020 foresight is equally crucial for we have shown that the long term optimal trajectories are initially characterized by lower utility rates than the short term optimal ones and only in the long run entail higher cumulative utilities implementing policies that appear sub optimal in the short term implies foregoing the immediate benefit of overdrafting for future and thus also more uncertain profit safeguarding the interest of future generations may require us to avoid being our own ponzi

2340,groundwater levels have been decreasing in most agricultural areas motivating research to find optimal solutions to balance socio economical and environmental demands traditionally groundwater optimization aims at long term profit maximization while accounting for the extraction costs following this approach we find exploitation protocols characterized by pumping rates that slowly decrease in time toward a long term sustainable value however the comparison of the model prediction with water extraction data for the period 1985 2021 from kern county in california points out the inconsistencies between real management and long term optimal behavior rather the observed trajectory resembles those obtained by finite time optimization horizons which provide short term high profits by over drafting while leading to long term dilapidation of the capital and the exhaustion of the aquifer such myopic planning results in a ponzi scheme for groundwater extraction like the infamous fraudulent scheme more than optimal profits are achievable by excessive short term consumption by the early investors the past and current aquifer exploiters leaving the later comers the future generations with an impossible cost to sustain including the environmental costs of aquifer over exploitation the myopic nature of human planning can be corrected and reconciled with a more sustainable use of groundwater keywords groundwater exploitation california overdraft unsustainable management economic optimization ponzi scheme data availability data used are publicly available and references òrovided mathemwtica cose available upon request 1 introduction in the 1920s charles ponzi became a millionaire in a few weeks by running the fraudulent scheme that later would take his name a ponzi scheme is characterized by very high promised returns of investment which are actually paid with money from new investors it allows some players the early ones to gain a super profit while leaving to certain demise the later ones when the scheme collapses in finite time the ponzi scheme is an example of market failure with an unsustainable economic trajectory the short sightedness of the great short term returns of a ponzi scheme is reminiscent of the unsustainable management of environmental resources hardin 1968 hoekstra and wiedmann 2014 and echoes the lack of foresight in the current management of major aquifers around the world scanlon et al 2012 while sustained groundwater extraction has enabled farmers and on a larger scale states to maintain a high level of returns from agricultural production even in drought years the same high extraction rates have impoverished groundwater resources irrigation has led to aquifers depletion in several regions scanlon et al 2012 siebert et al 2010 rodell et al 2018 and is likely to intensify under the uncertainty that climate change poses on future precipitation and surface soil water taylor et al 2013 with risk of exhaustion for human uses and heavy implications for food security and connected ecosystem health esteban and albiac 2011 in this paper we argue that groundwater exploitation is a quintessential example of an environmental ponzi scheme in which over exploiters play the role of the early investors profiting from the excessive overdraft but leaving depleted aquifers to the next generation the late investors optimal management of groundwater has been a well explored research topic since the 1960s but remains a matter of timely importance due to global water scarcity here we revisit the subject as a classic example of optimization to analyze the optimal strategies for groundwater extraction as a function of the planning time while the literature see next section for a review generally considers groundwater optimization over infinite time horizons we show that real pumping rates rather follow a protocol that optimizes the revenue for much shorter horizons comparing the optimal trajectories for different time horizons with observed data for groundwater management we show that indeed the extraction path offers higher utility compared to the long term optimum but only for a limited time after that the trajectories become first sub optimal and then unsustainable revealing that the current exploitation path shares the shortsightedness of a ponzi scheme only strong policies towards more sustainable pumping rates can avoid sharing also the fate of the ponzi investors the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a brief review of the research devoted to the application of optimization methods for groundwater management section 3 presents in detail the model for the aquifer exploitation and the implemented optimal control method the solution to the optimization process is presented and discussed in section 4 the intrinsic instability of the optimal path sets the stage for an unsustainable path toward over exploitation in section 5 the application of the model to a real case study is investigated we take as a representative example the overdraft in kern county overlying the california aquifer system which has been experiencing depletion since the beginning of the twentieth century finally we draw some conclusions in section 6 2 optimal management of groundwater resources a brief review the risk of groundwater over exploitation calls for a solution that balances the socio economical demand with the preservation of water availability in the aquifers and the related streams and water bodies for this reason determining the optimal i e economically viable and environmentally sustainable protocols for groundwater use has motivated a considerable amount of research the problem faces the difficult task of linking climatic biological and socio economical issues for a review see bierkens and wada 2019 this avenue of research has naturally adopted optimization methods and control theory hotelling s hotelling 1931 seminal work on exhaustible resources marked the beginning of extensive use of the calculus of variations including the celebrated work by boltyanskii et al 1960 and bellman 1954 among others kamien 2012 in general optimal control aims at finding a strategy that minimizes respectively maximizes a given cost gain functional these methods allow us to rigorously compare a continuum of scenarios and control protocols to find optimal strategies in the entire strategy space where the control parameters can be continuously changed over time in a series of papers with specific reference to groundwater burt 1964 1966 1967 1970 and brown and deacon 1972 first developed the variational problem to optimize groundwater use integrating the groundwater modeling as a single cell aquifer in this framework the exploitation of an aquifer aims to maximize the revenue from agricultural production sustained by groundwater irrigation offset by the cost of water extraction which increases with the depletion of the aquifer an optimal pumping rate is reached when an extra unit of withdrawal equals the value of an extra unit of water left in the aquifer following the fundamental framework established in these first works the literature has pursued two main directions on the one hand the main goal has been to include more realistic aquifer representations which better characterize the spatial heterogeneities and the hydrogeologic processes bredehoeft and young 1970 brozović et al 2006a knapp and olson 1995 provencher and burt 1994 on the other hand a second research direction focused on including the interaction of multiple agents in the optimization process using tools borrowed from game theory agent based models and behavioral economics foster et al 2014 fisher and huber lee 2012 mulligan et al 2014 competition among users of the same aquifer likely causes depletion gisser and mercado 1973 since each user has little incentive to leave the water in the aquifer as the competitors may take advantage of that free exploitation of the common pool resource results in an extraction rate path that is intrinsically regulated by the users competition to be economically efficient gisser and sánchez 1980 argued that the competitive solution has a negligible discrepancy from the optimally controlled one leading to the conclusion that there is no benefit in following a controlled path especially when considering that optimization has a cost such a similarity between the optimal and the competitive pumping rates has since been known as the gisser sanchez effect not surprisingly a great deal of research has been devoted to either confirming or discrediting this counter intuitive result which discards the need for regulations koundouri 2004 found that the gisser sanchez effect holds in many cases but its validity is challenged for highly nonlinear cost of extraction spatial heterogeneity of productivity worthington et al 1985 aquifers close to depletion presence of river effects and the inclusion of environmental externalities esteban and albiac 2011 a few years after the gisser and sanchez paper negri 1989 explored the same antagonism between control and competition using a game theory perspective in the formulation of the optimization problem he extended the exploitation path solution of brown and deacon 1972 to multiple users and then compared it to the competitive case modeled as a differential game while providing the conditions for the two cases to be identical single user or behavior independent of storage observation the focus of his paper was more on the nature of the two solutions the solution provided by optimal control was argued to be unrealistic as the optimal control framework assumes the agents commit to a predetermined pumping path for the entire horizon of the planning while it is more realistic to picture that owners would observe the level of the water table revise their expectations about the actions of their rivals and pursue optimal pumping rates given the current information this kind of feedback solution does not require commitment and depends on the aquifer state another interesting aspect of optimal solutions is related to the fact that dynamic optimization problems often have saddle path solutions samuelson 1972 barro and sala i martin 2004 this fact in relation to different optimization time horizons has important theoretical and practical consequences which have not been thoroughly investigated within the groundwater context and in general in environmental problems thus as it is common in economic growth models see for example the famous ramsey koopmans cass model ramsey 1928 the optimization through the pontryagin maximum principle results in a dynamical system with saddle stability in which the optimal trajectory or saddle path lies onto the stable manifold that reaches the saddle point the unstable nature of the saddle equilibrium means that the slightest deviation from the path tends to take the dynamics far away from the optimal one christiaans 2001a argued that the positive attitude with which the economic theory looks at these solutions has been taken so far that is actually common to refer to the saddle equilibria as stable barro and sala i martin 2004 lucas 1988 which is obviously an oxymoron for by definition a saddle point is unstable indeed the permanence on the saddle path is a condition stemming from long term actually infinite time optimality the maximum principle ensures this stability through a constraint on the time horizon called the transversality condition which ensures that by uniquely defining the correct initial condition the system neither explodes nor falls towards the uninteresting stable equilibrium in other words adherence to the optimal path is guaranteed only by means of a perfect foresight condition which disregards real world conditions and implies infinite time horizons the practical unfeasibility of such long term optimal solutions lies in the self interested and often myopic behavior of the agents the determination of these exact values is subject to uncertainty and errors that can lead one quickly far from the optimum to this regard christiaans offers an effective analogy when he compares the agent s trust to reach the optimum to the confidence a physicist could have in giving the precise push to a pendulum that would make it stay straight up christiaans 2001b in practice remaining on the optimal path requires adjustment and reconsideration of the followed dynamics thus inherently challenging the nature of the long term optimal solution especially when considering the stochastic nature of aquifer evolution burt 1964 1966 3 modeling framework in this section we describe the optimization problem by first introducing the constraint represented by the simplified aquifer dynamics and the utility function to maximize we then review the maximum principle within the groundwater context and use it to obtain the optimal solution 3 1 aquifer water balance following burt 1967 brown and deacon 1972 gisser and sánchez 1980 negri 1989 we consider for simplicity a single cell model of the aquifer also known as the bathtub model brozović et al 2006b it considers an unconfined aquifer as a box with a uniform horizontal head and spatially uniform response pumping this simple representation has been traditionally implemented in groundwater management optimization roumasset and wada 2015 bierkens and wada 2019 and proved to be a reasonable approximation of more complex models augeraud veron and pereau 2022 the corresponding water balance equation is a differential equation that describes the rate of change of the water table level h l as the difference in the rate of inflow and outflow 1 n a d h d t r q b where the inflow is the groundwater recharge r l 3 t the outflows are the groundwater withdrawal by pumping q l 3 t and the baseflow b l 3 t n is the aquifer storage coefficient i e the aquifer effective porosity a l 2 is the representative aquifer area the recharge is assumed to be deterministic and constant for simplicity r r 0 with r 0 a constant a reasonable assumption for conditions in which the natural recharge is small compared to the aquifer storativity gisser and sánchez 1980 the recharge term represents the net inflow to the aquifer and includes the part of precipitation and applied water that percolates from the surface to the aquifer as well as managed recharge if any subsurface inflow and net interaction with surface water the outflow terms are the withdrawal due to agricultural industrial or urban use here we focus on agricultural extraction and the baseflow i e the amount of groundwater that discharges naturally into other water bodies for simplicity the baseflow component is considered as a linear function of the water table level b β h with β constant as often done in the literature crosbie et al 2005 fenicia et al 2006 gisser and sánchez 1980 to account for the reduced discharge to streams with lower water tables levels more complex nonlinear formulations are possible but are not expected to change quantitatively the results the withdrawal term refers to the groundwater pumping and represents the gross demand accounting for irrigation inefficiencies and other losses it should be clear that this description simplifies the real dynamics by assuming that pumping uniformly affects the water level this is a reasonable approximation for a relatively compact aquifer with well distributed wells but can be relaxed in the case of complex aquifers the current situation typical of many over exploited aquifers around the world implies that the extraction term is persistently higher than the recharge q r leading to overdraft harou and lund 2008 3 2 profit it is assumed that it is desirable to maximize the net economic value expressed as a utility functional 2 u t 0 t 0 t g t c t e ρ t d t over a period t i e a so called inter temporal problem kamien 2012 where t 0 is the time at which pumping is started g t 1 is the gain or revenue rate related to crop sale and other water uses c t 1 is the loss due to both economical costs e g infrastructure construction and electricity costs and environmental damages e g soil subsidence galloway and burbey 2011 reduction of baseflow fed by the aquifer scanlon et al 2012 etc and ρ is the discount rate t 1 on future utility the coupling between the two previous equations eqs 1 and 2 stems from the dependence of g and c on the pumping rate q we assume the gain to be proportional to withdrawals here referred to a unit area of the aquifer 3 g κ q α with q q a κ the profit per unit withdrawal and the exponent α to account for market saturation or limits to production independent of water availability the cost term 4 c μ σ h m a x h δ q θ is taken to be dependent on both the quantity of water extracted and the aquifer depletion h m a x h δ negri 1989 where σ is the drawdown h m a x is the maximum aquifer level i e irrigation surface and μ the cost of extraction and damages per unit of aquifer depletion increased costs associated with maintaining and repairing capital well and pump equipment resulting from the use of the well and pumps for withdrawals are captured by the nonlinear dependence on withdrawals q of the cost function through the parameter θ as groundwater is pumped out the water table close to the extraction site is lowered in the cone of depression or drawdown σ which means that the lifting depth is higher and needs to be considered in the water extraction costs knapp et al 2003 the nonlinearity in the cost function also represents both the increasing cost of extraction and the progressive loss of water availability and connectivity for ecosystems as the water table declines esteban and albiac 2011 3 3 optimization the maximum principle and the transversality condition the optimization game may be framed assuming either a single agent or a collective action by multiple users using the theory of variational analysis in either case it is concerned with determining the optimal function q t i e the control variable that maximizes the present value utility among the infinite possible ones the problem usually considers an infinite horizon t which is an appropriate choice for long term groundwater resource allocation burt 1967 as stated this is a dynamic problem since increased or reduced pumping rates will affect the aquifer dynamics and future pumping decisions formally it can be written as 5 max q t u max q t t 0 κ q t α μ σ h m a x h t δ q t θ e ρ t d t where now the time dependence of the variables h t and q t is made explicit the optimization is subject to the physical conditions imposed by the aquifer water balance eq 1 the scheme in fig 1 shows that the objective of the optimization process is maximizing profit by optimizing the control variable q t the normalized pumping rate that affects both the costs and the aquifer dynamics constraint the first step in the variational analysis is to build the hamiltonian 6 h e ρ t κ q t α μ σ h m a x h t δ q t θ λ t r 0 q t β h t n a where λ is the lagrange multiplier the pontryagin maximum principle kopp 1962 kamien 2012 chiang 1999 imposes the following first order conditions on the hamiltonian 7 h q 0 8 h h λ and 9 lim t λ h t 0 the lagrange multiplier λ is the co state variable interpreted as the shadow price of an extracted water unit the first two conditions eqs 7 and 8 provide the equations for the time evolution of the control variable q t and the water level h t the third equation eq 9 or transversality condition is a necessary condition on the final time its necessity comes directly from the lagrangian formulation of the calculus of variations when the hamiltonian is concave in both the control and state variable the transversality condition together with the first order conditions is the sufficient condition to have an optimum it has the role of choosing the right path in the entire phase space described by the equations for d h d t and d q d t to guarantee optimality in the specified time horizon being a condition on the final point eq 9 does not give directly the initial state to solve the system of equations h t q t numerically this is often solved through a shooting algorithm which iterates over plausible initial states to find the one that leads to the saddle point 4 optimal solution 4 1 optimal steady state before analyzing the variational problem it is instructive to consider the long term steady state in which case the problem is reduced to a classical extremization problem i e finding a maximum of a function a constant pumping rate q is applied for a very long time so that the problem reaches a steady state d h d t 0 with level 10 h r 0 q β which represents by definition the level at which recharge equals losses from the aquifer next we consider the utility per time neglecting the initial transient before the steady state this will also be constant in time 11 ū t 1 t 0 t 1 κ q t α μ σ h m a x h t δ q t θ e ρ t d t κ ρ q α μ ρ q θ σ h m a x h δ where the second equality follows from the fact that both pumping rate and aquifer level are constant in this integral and therefore can be taken out and from 0 e ρ t d t 1 ρ obviously if the long term withdrawal exceeds the replenishment or for the case of no recharge hotelling 1931 a steady state cannot be reached and the aquifer experiences progressive depletion till complete exhaustion and the aquifer mining yield are reached at which level the extraction cost equals the pumping benefits domenico et al 1968 hellegers et al 2001 substituting h from 10 the steady state utility can be written as a function of the constant pumping rate as 12 ū κ ρ q α μ ρ q θ σ h m a x r 0 q β δ and the optimal pumping rate is the maximum given by the condition d u d q 0 it is instructive to consider the special case θ 2 and δ α 1 which leads to an analytical expression for the optimal withdrawal rate at steady state 13 q o p t β σ h m a x μ β 3 β κ μ μ r 0 β σ h m a x μ 2 β 2 μ r 0 3 μ plotted in fig 2 this figure provides a simple way to find the optimal state the equilibrium is determined by the tangency point between the highest among the indifference curves along which the utility has the same constant value and the constraint curve a similar figure can be found in burt 1967 as expected the optimal equilibrium value for water table level obtained by inserting 13 in 10 increases with recharge a lower cost of extraction contributing to μ for example by means of more modern technology decreases the water table level as exploitation is more rewarding on the other hand damages to the environment when included in the cost coefficient penalize the economic benefit but help the preservation of a higher steady water table level khan and brown 2019 as shown in fig 2b the optimal steady state value is generally easy to compute but it rarely coincides with the initial state of the system thus the optimal path of extraction describes the evolution of the water table as it transitions from the initial head to the long term optimal one previous work kamien 2012 assessed that for a single resource and stationary demand and cost functions the paths will be monotonic meaning that the optimal head level will smoothly rise if the initial head is lower than the optimal steady state one or decrease if higher as shown in the next section 4 2 the saddle property the substitution of the maximum principle conditions eq 7 in eq 8 gives the dynamics of the control variable 14 q t δ θ μ q t θ 1 r 0 q t n a q t n a θ α κ β ρ q t α θ σ h max h t 1 δ δ θ μ β ρ σ h max h t δ β h t σ h max h t θ 1 θ μ q t θ α 1 α κ q t α σ h max h t δ which together with eq 1 forms a system of two nonlinear first order differential equations the phase space of this system presents saddle stability as shown in fig 3a this can be verified by linearizing the system around the steady state h q as 15 h ˆ t q ˆ t j h q h ˆ t q ˆ t where j is the jacobian matrix and noting that the determinant is negative barro and sala i martin 2004 the stable arm of the saddle or saddle path thick green line splits the phase space into two regions see fig 3a above the saddle path trajectories are characterized by a high value of pumping rate which causes the progressive lowering of the water table these paths are obviously not optimal in the lower part the water table grows because the recharge exceeds the modest pumping rate giving rise to trajectories that themselves are not optimal as some of the groundwater storage is left unexploited for an infinite time horizon the only path that ensures sustainability is the one that follows the stable arm of the saddle and ends at the steady state star symbol in fig 3a the convergence to the saddle path occurs by means of the transversality condition which assumes perfect foresight when the optimization occurs over finite time horizons the transversality condition now selects a different portion of the phase space that does not coincide with the saddle path only perfect foresight gives the saddle path as the optimal solution the further the finite horizon is set the closest the optimal trajectory is to the infinite horizon one a property known as the turnpike property samuelson 1972 trélat and zuazua 2015 4 3 sustainable groundwater use requires long term optimal planning the solution to the planning problem provides a protocol for the extraction rate that should be employed to efficiently manage the groundwater resource this requires that the agent has perfect foresight on the future utility that results from their pumping rates typically dynamic economic optimization suggests an initial phase of aquifer exploitation during which the pumping rate is high as seen in previous models young 1992 vaux 2011 later in the horizon the lowering of the water table causes the pumping to be more expensive so that withdrawals should progressively decrease until they finally reach the optimal steady state pumping rate corresponding to the saddle point it is important to notice that the solution of the optimization process is highly dependent on the transversality condition i e the condition on the final time in fact a final time condition is needed to close the optimization problem thus allowing the selection of the appropriate path for the given time horizon fig 3 compares the optimal trajectories for finite time solid arrows to the saddle path green thick line for different values of the finite time horizon dashed arrows denote the trajectories that the paths would follow according to eqs 1 14 after the planned horizon it should be clear that after this time such paths are no longer optimal for finite time horizons the optimal pumping rate is typically higher than in the infinite horizon case after a decreasing phase as the end of the horizon is approached the pumping rises as shown in fig 3c the corresponding optimal groundwater levels for each planning horizon are shown in fig 3b as can be seen for short time horizons the groundwater level drops quickly by increasing the planning time the decrease in groundwater level occurs at a slower pace but for all finite time horizons it ends in a final state that is lower than the long term optimum as the time horizon increases the optimal trajectory approaches the one of the infinite time horizon following the turnpike property however all the optimal trajectories at finite time deviate from the stable arm towards higher values of pumping rate this is because close to the end of the horizon there is no apprehension for future costs of extraction so increasing the pumping to increase the profit is convenient fig 3d shows the utility corresponding to the different optimal paths the cumulative benefit is higher than the long term optimal path green thick line for their corresponding time period for example the same trajectory that entails the best possible benefit for 10 years squanders all the profit if prolonged for the following 10 years because the aquifer is brought to low levels that strongly increase the costs of extraction it is clear from the trajectories in fig 3 that though optimal for their respective horizons they would bring the aquifer to complete depletion if they were pursued for longer times upper left quadrant in the phase space 5 real case application it is interesting to analyze a real case in light of the results just obtained toward this goal we apply the optimization problem to the case of kern county ca a region comprising the southeast part of the central valley major aquifer which heavily relies on groundwater for agriculture knapp et al 2003 kern county is the leading agricultural producer county in california thanks to growing high valued commodities such as grapes almonds and pistachios cdwa 2017 kern county subbasin consists of 787356 ha overlying the southernmost portion of central valley aquifer that extends for 5200 km 2 feinerman and knapp 1983 knapp et al 2003 the specific yield for the unconfined aquifer has an average value of 0 13 knapp et al 2003 california department of water resources 2006 model parameters are adjusted to represent kern county aquifer conditions and are described in what follows precipitation over the basin varies between 23 and 33 cm annually the recharge is considered constant and equal to r 0 0 79 km 3 year as the sum of net natural recharge and portion of surface inflow that reaches the aquifer as in knapp et al 2003 the recharge estimate is consistent with 1995 2014 c2vsimfg kern historical simulation kern groundwater authority 2023 average output for aquifer recharge due to deep percolation 0 812 km 3 year because of the scarce recharge and high withdrawals the aquifer level has declined dramatically feinerman and knapp 1983 and the basin has been designated as one of 21 critically over drafted basins in california bourque et al 2019 like other parts of california it has suffered the economic impact of recent droughts medellín azuara et al 2011 and climate change is feared to further exacerbate such over exploitation water table data for the region are available from the california department of water resources cdwr and the location of the available sites is indicated on the map in fig 4 the time frame considered here goes from 1985 to 2021 wells with less than 5 recordings were excluded as well as data with questionable elevation data e g elevations higher than ground surface elevation sudden change in the topographic level or unrealistic trends as a result data from 242 wells were used for the analysis fluctuations in water table levels are associated with variable climatic conditions see fig 4b the lowering of water table levels is correlated with periods of drought like the 2007 2010 or 2012 2010 period wet years periods 1995 to 1999 2005 to 2006 2011 present a partial recovery of groundwater table levels but the average water table level for the considered time frame shows an inexorable declining trend reported in fig 4 b as for water use in kern county data were obtained from the usgs database u s geological survey 0000a since agriculture takes up about 75 of total groundwater use kern groundwater authority 2023 the category irrigation total self supplied groundwater withdrawals fresh was considered as the estimate of water extraction per year water use data are provided every 5 year period and the corresponding time evolution for the pumping q t is reported in fig 4c the 2019 2021 water extraction estimate is instead taken from kern groundwater authority water use report kern groundwater authority 2023 fig 4c shows a particularly high level of extraction during dry years like the 2015 drought and 2021 one in particular 2021 has been a critically dry water year with total extraction of 3 05 cubic kilometers of which 73 was for agricultural use during wet years groundwater pumping in the kern county subbasin is generally about 20 to 30 lower due to higher surface water availability kern groundwater authority 2023 the initial water table elevation h 0 is the value registered in 1985 averaged among all the sites considered the baseflow represents a minor outflow from the basin it has been described as negligible in the 118 bulletin kern groundwater authority 2023 and consists of around 5 of total outflow in the averaged 1995 2014 c2vsimfg kern historical simulation the coefficient β to the baseflow output in eq 1 is estimated through a linear interpolation of subsurface outflow estimates and annual water table elevations the average groundwater pumping cost per unit of water lifted μ is taken from the literature knapp et al 2003 he et al 2019 and adjusted for inflation to current monetary values we do not account here for the cost of replacing wells that ran dry since kern county reports a low number of cases compared to other nearby subbasins we estimate the revenue from the water footprint of different crops grown in california fulton et al 2018 the total revenue is due to the consumptive use of water from all managed resources effective rainfall surface and groundwater the revenue per unit of water use and the share attributable to groundwater is very hard to define so we use a range of values that is consistent with the water footprint due to blue water total evapotranspiration effective rainfall and it falls within the 0 1 0 2 m 3 range a list of all parameters used here is reported in table 1 5 1 short term planning to compare the optimal profiles for extraction rate to real observations of withdrawal in the studied region we first plot the recorded pumping rate as a function of the water table elevation measurements for the 1985 2021 period to reproduce the phase space trajectory red line in fig 5a as expected the trend occupies the over exploitation part of the phase space situated above the long term sustainable green path pumping decreased in the early 2000 s almost as if approaching the optimal steady values for extraction and water table level however as a consequence of the most recent droughts the aquifer has been increasingly exploited producing the increasing trend of the last decade groundwater levels in most areas have since further decreased the measured pumping profile has produced a high revenue for most of the 40 years horizon since exploitation ensured a higher profit compared to the long term sustainable one red and green curves in fig 5b it is evident that such a trend is unsustainable for the aquifer and the entire agricultural system of the county 5 2 groundwater overdraft as a ponzi scheme as said in the introduction the long term unsustainable trajectories share similar features with the well known fraudulent ponzi scheme aquifer exploitation is characterized by excessive consumption and the revenue that comes from the overdrafting can be seen as the high promised returns that motivate more intense rates of extraction for the promise of higher profits the slow recharge rates cannot compensate for the outflow and the aquifer dynamics is driven through an unsustainable path that can only end with the exhaustion of the water resource once the aquifer is depleted it leaves some users enriched by years of exploitation while most of the participants face economic and environmental disaster fig 5b compares the profit gained by users that started exploiting the aquifer in different years a generation of early comers for example the curve starting in 1985 has the opportunity to end the use of the aquifer and find itself enriched by years of exploitation users that start profiting at a later stage the curves starting in 2005 or 2020 in fig 5b extract from a more depleted aquifer and face a higher risk of failure the analogy with the ponzi scheme is also born out of the short minded behavior that characterizes the agents the high pumping rates provided high revenue during the early drought periods with a utility higher than the long term optimal one red line in fig 5b yet to reach this super utility the aquifer was brought to a state that is close to collapse with consequent complete loss of utility feinerman and knapp 1983 it is interesting that staying on such a disastrous path is not incompatible with being rational economic agents as noted previously in madhavan and barrass 2011 with a sufficiently high and constant discount rate a stream of utility lasting for a finite time can have a higher present value than a lower utility stream of infinite duration in the case of financial bubbles it has been shown that even if agents recognize to be on one of them they may still be willing to stick to the course before trying to return to the saddle path as long as there are still short term benefits christiaans identifies it as a possible cause for the financial crisis of 2008 christiaans 2001a alternatively another reason for following a ponzi scheme is the lack of a proper and comprehensive definition of the cost function in which not all the potential costs are considered this case is discussed in the next section 5 3 the environmental cost of overdrafting as mentioned at the end of the previous section persevering on the unsustainable path may be explained also by an improper formulation of the cost function when the cost function accounts almost uniquely for the cost of water extraction as typical in both the theory and practice of groundwater management a pure economic optimization based on the short term costs and gains leads to over extraction especially in areas that decided to invest in high value crops like kern county agricultural revenue has been increasing despite water scarcity kern county s agricultural crop value increased from 4 billion in 2007 to 7 billion in 2016 and recently peaked at 8 3 billion making it one of the highest agricultural producers the imbalance between such numbers and the current groundwater crisis reveals unsuitable water prices that do not reflect the current scarcity and the value of keeping groundwater in the aquifer d odorico et al 2020 for this reason it is important to include other costs of groundwater depletion related to environmental damages these include effects due to land subsidence saline intrusion reduces stream flow and impoverishment of related wetlands and springs as well as interference with pre existing water uses and water rights sophocleous 2003 zektser et al 2005 such environmental costs are difficult to quantify but it is crucial to include them in the total cost to achieve a properly optimal strategy as a first step to explore the effect of adding further environmental constraints here we consider that all the environmental costs are functionally related to the lowering of the water table accordingly we analyze how the long term solution behaves when the h m a x h t term is weighted more in the optimization process δ 1 figure 8 sm shows how the saddle path shifts to the lower right with increasing δ the long term sustainable water table level shifts right to much higher values and the relative position compared to the observed pumping rate widens since now depletion implies an extra cost in addition to the extraction costs exploitation is further curtailed as a result the long term optimal value for water level increases and the optimal pumping rate decreases as shown in the contour plot in fig 6 the optimal trajectories now follow lower pumping rates see dashed lines in figure sm9b compared to the previous ones solid line in figure sm9 the water table levels are not lowered as much as in the previous case and even for finite time optimizations the aquifer is maintained in more sustainable conditions as depicted in figure sm9a the ponzi like behavior is thus contrasted by taking into account the real costs of overexploitation the optimization process naturally provides a new optimal now also environmentally optimal pumping protocol that ensures a more sustainable use of the aquifer fig 6c and d explores also the effect of increasing water extraction costs μ which can be also used as a proxy for increased water prices by assigning a higher value to the water in the aquifer extraction is discouraged as shown by the optimal long term value for pumping rate fig 6c the path to reach this more sustainable condition is characterized by a higher water table throughout the entire considered period fig 9d in sm 5 4 role of discounting the results are sensitive to the discount factor ρ applied in the optimization it has been shown that with a sufficiently high discount rate the utility accumulated in a short finite time can have a higher present value than a lower utility for an infinite time and thus is the preferred optimization output madhavan and barrass 2011 in other words an excessive discount on future generations utility could lead to quick depletion on the other hand introducing a low discount rate means weighing the utility of future generations so have an interest in keeping sustainable conditions as shown in fig 6a and 6b a lower discount rate pushes the optimal state to higher recommended groundwater levels and lower optimal long term pumping rates optimal protocols to reach the recommended levels present in fact lower rates of pumping and higher water tables throughout the planning period as shown in figure 9b in sm 5 5 an optimistic outlook the original scheme enacted by ponzi collapsed after 9 months artzrouni 2009 and others typically lasted a max of a few years the longest is known to have lasted about two decades enacted by bernie madoff luckily the groundwater ponzi scheme like other environmental resource exploitation paths typically has longer timescales while a market cannot sustain the overconsumption for more than a few months an aquifer may sustain a rate of depletion for much longer thanks to the huge initial resource stock it has been proved that a ponzi scheme with big enough initial stock can survive for a long time artzrouni 2009 this consideration enables some action to correct the unsustainable trend and regulations have already started to be imposed in 2014 california passed the sustainable groundwater management act sgwa requiring local water agencies to design and adopt groundwater management plans at the basin scale however integrating the new policies is challenging and bringing groundwater levels to long term sustainable levels will likely take many years medellín azuara et al 2015 the impact of policy regulation is expected to modify the current trend we explore this scenario by considering two different policies the hard policy scenario assumes that regulation imposes an immediate switch from the current trend to the long term optimal path in this scenario pumping rates experience an abrupt switch to values that are lower than the natural recharge consequently water tables immediately start recovering and smoothly increase toward the long term sustainable level the soft policy scenario instead assumes that pumping rates are gradually decreased by 10 of current values each year till they reach the long term sustainable pumping rate purple curve in fig 7 a new cap on q t is set and kept constant each year see fig 7c since the decrease in pumping is not abrupt water levels initially keep decreasing even if at a much slower pace compared to the current trend after a few years the pumping rate reaches a sustainable level and the aquifer starts recovering fig 7d compares the cumulative utility u t associated with each of these scenarios and the ponzi like trend the ponzi scenario shows an initial gain in benefit which is soon nullified by the complete depletion of the gained profit the soft policy scenario purple line initially entails higher profit compared to the hard policy green as pumping rates are kept higher along with the profit however after a few years the cumulative profit from the hard policy path is actually the highest since it operates at higher water table levels and has lower extraction costs it is important to note that even if the green curve is the optimal scenario imposing the initial abrupt switch in extraction rates would require a huge initial cost that would lower the total benefit because of the need for an important initial allocation of resources not to mention the nature of human adaptation a soft policy is more likely to be implemented thus lengthening the journey to aquifer recovery 5 6 limitations and possible extensions this work can be extended in several directions a first line of work could include the effects of different policy measures by modifying the cost function an extra benefit term could easily be introduced to represent potential subsidies for farmers to incentivize shifts towards drought tolerant crops or water efficient methods of irrigation moreover the aquifer dynamics could be adjusted to include the role of artificial recharge in replenishing groundwater provisions the resulting optimal trajectories could be compared to assess the repercussions on both the economy and the environment the temporal variability and stochastic nature of the economic groundwater system have been neglected here further research to fill this gap may include the role of disturbances in climate variables e g rainfall interannual variability see porporato and yin 2022 sec 7 8 or market fluctuations a time dependent recharge term could also consider the effect of a change in irrigation method for example the reduced percolation induced by adopting micro irrigation techniques the single cell aquifer does not account for spatial variability so in order to provide policy recommendations at a local level it is appropriate to incorporate the spatial heterogeneity location and use of each well as done in previous works brozović et al 2006b we also considered the totality of water extraction from the whole basin rather than single user behavior so a natural extension to this work would include a distribution of users and extraction strategies finally a more comprehensive analysis of groundwater management use should include also the impact on the energy sector kern et al 2020 he et al 2019 as well as food security renewable development may in fact increase the demand for water for hydro power while a more sustainable groundwater use would impact crop productivity and thus be better implemented with a concurrent optimization of crop types and production as it has already happened in some basins graham et al 2021 6 conclusions can groundwater overdraft be considered an environmental ponzi scheme the evidence from the case study of kern county in california pointed out the inconsistencies between the observed pumping rates and a presumed optimal behavior and therefore lent support to an affirmative answer interestingly the observed path maintains a high utility by over drafting this brings the water table levels to sub optimal conditions while still making the short term over exploitation a rational if unsustainable path help towards a solution comes from realizing the long term consequences of short term optimization the acknowledgment of the true costs of being part of a ponzi scheme helps prevent unsustainable conditions since including the environmental costs in the cost optimization leads to more sustainable pumping protocols it is crucial to understand the coupling between groundwater environmental impacts and the economy bierkens and wada 2019 so that its effects can be included for a better informed policy making process it is also necessary to assign a water value that reflects its preciosity as the current values are not compatible with a sustainable use of this resource d odorico et al 2020 foresight is equally crucial for we have shown that the long term optimal trajectories are initially characterized by lower utility rates than the short term optimal ones and only in the long run entail higher cumulative utilities implementing policies that appear sub optimal in the short term implies foregoing the immediate benefit of overdrafting for future and thus also more uncertain profit safeguarding the interest of future generations may require us to avoid being our own ponzi

2341,this paper develops the one dimensional large deformation consolidation theory for the porous medium under alternating saturated unsaturated conditions through a former generalization of the well established gibson s nonlinear theory from saturated to unsaturated regime with the differential relations between the coordinate systems the equations governing the momentum mass balances in the unsaturated porous stratum are transported from the moving current to the initial lagrangian coordinate system without loss of generality the collective forms of various incremental constitutive laws are then incorporated for unsaturated materials indicating that any particular constitutive law has been embraced two forms of final governing equations are derived depending on the primary independents σ v u w total vertical stress pore fluid pressure and w gravimetric water content which are solved by two distinct finite element codes on the initial fixed configuration numerical examples demonstrate that the two resulting total lagrangian formulations are equivalent yield virtually identical predictions and agrees well with an existing finite differential code that solves the equations in the convective configuration the dynamical consolidation process evolving from a weight driven saturated stage to an evaporation driven unsaturated stage is quantitatively captured very well by the predictions the impacts of evaporation material s compressibility and permeability in these two distinct stages are independently explored through several parametric analyses on the consolidation dewatering rates and the penetration of drying front through one factor must affect in concert with the others such a hydro mechanical coupling process these results can provide a

bypass products in mining and dredging projects moftakhari et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 chen et al 2023 oftentimes these materials are deposited with initial high fluid contents fluid like state and are then subjected to large deformations under self weight which could take years or even decades before reaching a relatively dense state solid like state thus large amounts of equipment and land resources must be occupied for reprocessing and storing these soft materials for long various techniques are currently being explored to accelerate this densification process and therefore to reduce resource consumptions wang et al 2012 qi 2017 wang et al 2018 fu et al 2019 ngo et al 2020 among which the air drying technique stands out in terms of low costs the air drying technique makes use of the natural evaporative force which is technically free to further dehydrate the pre planned thin deposits as such the weight driven wd consolidation process will be followed by an evaporation driven ed dewatering process which finally brings the soft materials from the wet fluid dominated saturated states to dry skeleton dominated unsaturated states a numerical model that can simulate these two physical processes could provide a theoretical gist for optimizing the operational design for example to i reduce the densification time ii improve the storage efficiency and iii reuse the land resources safely and economically in the multiphase porous medium deposit both the wd and ed processes are featured as a poromechanical coupling phenomenon where the deformation of solid skeleton is tightly coupled to flow of fluid and or air through pores however these two poromechanical coupling processes differ in many aspects first in the former the skeleton deformation drives the flow in saturated conditions and the deformation rate equals the net fluid outflow rate under the assumption of incompressible constituents whereas in the latter the driving factor turns to be the interstitial flow and the deformation rate surpasses the net fluid outflow rate due to the air phase involvement in unsaturated conditions second despite that the fluid flows in both processes are directed constitutively by the same darcy s law with several superficial modifications for unsaturated conditions compared to the saturated one constitutive modelling of skeleton deformations which depends nonlinearly on the degree of saturation is notoriously complicated in unsaturated zone that necessitates a distinct definition of constitutive variables alonso et al 1990 fredlund and rahardjo 1993 these complications pose great challenges to formulating a rigorous unified numerical model for simulating the coupled large strain and consolidation dewatering process in a seamless manner earlier numerical models for consolidation of unsaturated porous materials follows terzaghi s classic one dimensional 1d consolidation theory in that the mass conservations of liquid and gas phases were both embraced in the governing equations but the constitutive relations were rather simplified or linearized due to the lack of experimental evidence for example fredlund and hasan 1979 assumed the permeability coefficients for air liquid flow were both constant barden 1965 linked the permeability and porosity to the pore air liquid pressure with linear relations these unwarranted assumptions could lead to unjustifiable predictions in recent decades fully coupled hydro mechanical numerical models for unsaturated porous materials have attracted significant interest with the theoretical advancement of constitutive modelling for example the impressive progress has been made in the simulation of transient fluid flow through deforming unsaturated skeleton based on the poroelastic theory under complex hydra mechanical boundaries lo et al 2020 lo et al 2021 multiple nonlinear constitutive models for the mechanical behavior with different levels of sophistication have been numerically implemented ranging from various nonlinear elasticity thomas et al 1996 gatmiri et al 1998 different elastic plasticity potts et al 2001 gatmiri and arson 2008 sheng et al 2008 potts et al 2021 to advanced hyper plasticity muraleetharan et al 2009 yang et al 2020 and other types kodikara 2012 tamagnini and ciantia 2016 a fully coupled numerical model which is armed with an appropriate model can capture very complicated point level response in any boundary value problems as diverse as slope stability qi and vanapalli 2015 zhang et al 2018 and ground subsidence cui et al 2013 nonetheless most of the existing implementations have exclusively adopted the assumption of infinitesimal strain and neglected the kinematic nonlinearity which limits their applications to problems where the skeleton deformations are small such that the computational grids e g the finite element mesh could always be tied to the rigid and undeformed configuration to escape from the constraints much of the efforts are currently being directed at challenges of the kinematic nonlinearity under large deformations inlaid juxtaposed with the material nonlinearity under unsaturated conditions in various coupled numerical frameworks fox 2007 wu et al 2020 the dual nonlinearity must be addressed by meticulous choices and integrations of the different numerical techniques fox and berles 1997 borja et al 2013 meric et al 2013 qi et al 2017a pu et al 2020 in a complete numerical framework being a research field that still requires continual work for the wd consolidation process under saturated conditions i e the first half of the porous materials response under air drying technique the 1d large deformation coupling theory by gibson et al 1967 has found successful practical applications which combines darcy s law with terzaghi s effective stress in a nonlinear kinematic framework a core step of this theory formalization was to unscramble the differential relations between the lagrangian coordinates fixed to the initial positions of skeleton particles and convective coordinates locating the current positions of skeleton particles and to link them with one variable quantifying the deformation state e g the void ratio in gibson et al 1967 then the governing equations for fluid and solid physics that are defined conveniently in the current convective coordinate system were transported to the fixed initial lagrangian coordinate system note that all relevant physical quantities are defined as attached to the same skeleton particles thus the resulted numerical formulation is essentially a total lagrangian formulation that is solved over an initial configuration referred to the solid skeleton and does not need a computational demanding configuration updating procedure for the same consolidation problem there exists an alternative numerical formulation that solves the governing equations directly in the convective coordinate system e g fox and berles 1997 where the discretized mesh node together with all relevant physical quantities is frequently updated over each time step according to computed skeleton deformation thus this type of numerical formulation is classified as an updated lagrangian formulation that tracks the motions of skeleton these two lagrangian formulations should lead to equivalent solutions and the latter is primarily concerned with the matter of programming for 1d problems and has been extended by the authors qi et al 2017a qi et al 2020 using a piece wise linear framework to unsaturated porous materials it will be shown that the above mentioned relations for coordinate transformation are only concerned with the skeleton deformation and holds true regardless of the saturation degree of pore fluid this allows extension of gibson et al 1967 s theory to ed dewatering process under unsaturated conditions i e the second half of the porous materials response under air drying technique in this study the extension is achieved by incorporating the nonlinear constitutive equations for unsaturated porous materials into the two partial differential equations for mass and momentum conservations via the basic relations for coordinate transformation categorized by the primary independents in the resulting governing equations two total lagrangian formulations namely u f σ v and w where u f pore fluid pressure σ v total vertical stress w gravimetric water content are formalized to fully capture the hydro mechanical coupling under large deformations both formulations are solved by the finite element methods but with different programs i e a commercially available and a self coded one for diversity the constitutive equations are presented in general incremental forms for generality which means that application of the two new formulations is not limited to any specific group of models in particular a new simple skeleton deformation model is proposed to describe the drying induced shrinkage of porous materials extensive mutual comparisons are made among numerical results not only from differential formulations including also the existing piece wise linear one qi et al 2020 but also from different constitutive models after examining the accuracy of the new global large deformation formulations and effectiveness of the new volumetric shrinkage model several parametric analyses are performed to investigate the effects of three important factors i e evaporation compressibility and permeability on the coupling responses of large strain consolidation and dewatering of a porous medium stratum 2 model description 2 1 basic assumptions and coordinate systems prior to the mathematical formalization of the large deformation theories the following basic assumptions are made a the material could switch from saturated state presenting as a solid fluid biphasic medium to unsaturated state presenting as a solid fluid gas triphasic medium and vice versa in both states the material is seen as a quasi continuum and the local quantities are replaced by the phase volume averaged values in the continuum formulation b the solid and liquid constituents are both incompressible thus the volumetric deformation of solid skeleton is identical to the change of porous volume which in particular for saturated state is merely associated with the net fluid flow through the porous volume c the pore fluid flow relative to the moving solid skeleton while with a complex hydro mechanical interaction in the large deformation process conforms to the generalized darcy s law in both saturated and unsaturated states coussy 2004 d the pore air flow is not explicitly formulated with its pressure remaining atmospheric the fluid gas phase change e g air dissolution and water vaporization in the porous space is also neglected leading to a basic isothermal formulation under the action of self weight and evaporative forces all large deformations of the porous strata occur in the vertical direction thus the problem is treated in an idealized one dimensional 1d configuration with unit cross sectional area in plan view fig 1 a as with the original work for saturated porous medium by gibson et al 1981 who formalized the large deformation consolidation theory in a lagrangian framework with reference to the initial configuration of undeformed solid skeleton it is featured as a type of total lagrangian formulation in that all the field quantities are defined as functions of time and of coordinates positioning the solid particle in the initial configuration while the basic balance equations governing various related physical processes commonly refer to the current and convective configuration therefore the conversion of the expressions from the current configuration to the initial configuration must be made which poses no difficulty under 1d conditions and can be achieved with the following mathematical relationships between the two corresponding coordinate systems as shown in fig 1 b in the porous stratum of an initial thickness h 0 a differential element that is initially located between positions a and a δ a will moves and deforms at time t to a new position between ξ a t and ξ a δ a t according to the chain rule the partial derivative operators with respect to a and ξ are related by 1 a ξ a ξ where a refers to the lagrangian coordinate that is fixed and marks the skeleton particle positions in the initial configuration ξ refers to convective coordinate that is a function of a t and tracks the motion of skeleton particles 2 2 general balance equations consider the element shown as fig 1 the mass balance of the solid skeleton by the lagrangian approach reads 2 ρ s 1 n δ ξ ρ s 1 n 0 δ a where n 0 denotes the initial porosity of the porous element δ a in the reference configuration n is the true porosity which refers the current porous volume fraction to the current element δ ξ but with respect to the same underlying solid particles that are marked by the lagrangian coordinate a ρ s is the density of solid particles and is constant according to assumption b note that the pore volume is oftentimes measured by the void ratio e n 1 n in some circumstances e g the constitutive models dissimulated later eq 2 can be rearranged to give 3 ξ a 1 n 0 1 n 1 e 1 e 0 where e 0 denotes the initial void ratio eqs 1 and 3 constitutes the two basic equations that will be used to convert the field quantities and differential operations between the two coordinate systems when deriving the fundamental governing equations in later sections note that these two relations originally provided by gibson et al 1981 are rigorously valid irrespective of whether the medium is in a saturated or unsaturated state the mass balance of the fluid phase states that the mass of net fluid flow out of or into an element must equal the change rate of fluid mass in the same element the former for the element δ a in the lagrangian coordinate system is evaluated by q ρ f a δ a where q is the relative flux vector of fluid and ρ f is the density of fluid phase for the latter the true fluid mass with reference to the element δ a must be firstly evaluated based on the its current volume fraction and with reference to the current element δ ξ thus the change rate of fluid mass is n s r ρ f δ ξ t where s r is the degree of saturation and the product n s r is the fluid volume fraction by substituting eq 1 the fluid mass balance equation writes 4 q a ρ f δ a t n s r ρ f ξ a δ a 0 according to the generalized darcy s law coussy 2004 the flux vector of fluid q relative to the solid skeleton should also be calculated in the current convective coordinate system as 5 q n s r v f v s k ξ u f ρ f g ξ where v f and v s are the velocities of the fluid and solid phase respectively k is the hydraulic permeability g is the gravitational acceleration u f is the pore fluid pressure in the unsaturated state the u f is negative and numerically equal to the opposite of the suction s u a u f when the pore air pressure u a is assumed zero according to assumption d note that ρ f is constant and combining eqs 4 with 5 yields 6a a k 1 γ f u f ξ k t n s r ξ a where γ f ρ f g is the unit weight of fluid phase the moment balance equation by neglecting the inertia force reduces to a static equilibrium equation in the lagrangian coordinate system 7a σ v a ρ m g ξ a 0 where σ v is the total vertical stress ρ m n s r ρ f 1 n ρ s is the phase volume averaged density of the medium which is again scaled by the ratio of the current element volume to its initial volume ξ a because the true weight of the medium must be evaluated with reference to the current element finally using the specific gravity of solid particle g s ρ s ρ f and the void ratio e and substituting the coordinate conversion relations i e eqs 2 and 3 the two balance equations are rearranged with respect to a t as 6b a k 1 γ f 1 e 0 1 e u f a k 1 1 e 0 e s r t and 7b σ v a γ f g s e s r 1 e 0 0 note that when the differential element is saturated with fluid s r 1 eqs 6b and 7b reverts to those for saturated cases gibson et al 1981 in summary under the adopted assumptions only two differential equations are required to describe the large strain consolidation behavior of porous medium under both saturated and unsaturated conditions the mass balance of solid phase is automatically fulfilled because of choice of the lagrangian framework which is explored and adopted for coordinate conversion and has been naturally merged into the final equations the governing balance equations describe the temporal variations of several field unknowns whose number however is far more than two thus additional constitutive equations must be added to fully constraint the problem definition 2 3 differential forms of constitutive models 2 3 1 skeleton deformation the skeleton deformation of a porous medium is excited by the superposition effect of both changes in the macroscopic total stress and interstitial pore pressures by applying the phase averaging technique to two pore pressures the bishop s effective stress dictating the skeleton deformation is defined as σ v σ v s r u f 1 s r u a note that s r represents the volume fraction whereas the stress is defined as the force per unit area thus it is assumed the phase area and volume fractions are equivalent also considering the specifical feature of 1d conditions only the vertical stress component instead of the general stress tensors is adopted and change in e can completely characterize the large deformations macminn et al 2016 and a deformation function e e σ v can exclusively describe the mechanical constitutive response for being merged into the partial differential governing equations its differential form also oftentimes directly formulated for an increment stress strain model is adopted and expressed by expanding σ v as 8 d e e σ v d σ v e s d s e s r d s r eq 8 represents general form in unsaturated zone where s u f under the assumption u a 0 while in saturated zone the last term vanishes s r 1 d s r 0 meanwhile e σ v e s e σ v being compatible with the terzaghi s effective stress principle σ v σ v u f although the symbols s and u f are used respectively in constitutive and governing equations throughout this paper confusions can be avoided by adding the negative sign whenever required in the final equation derivations if in unsaturated zone the increment d s r over d s is known from the fluid retention models discussed below eq 8 can be reformulated as d e e σ v d σ v m s d s where m s e s e s r s r s is s r dependent compressibility modulus with respect to suction this expression is the same as that based on two independent stress variables matyas and radhakrishna 1968 fredlund and morgenstern 1977 fredlund and rahardjo 1993 where the influence of s r is not explicitly captured but vaguely obscured by the second empirically determined compressibility modulus i e m s e s see appendix c for example note that the intention here is not to provide a thorough discussion on the strengths of one category of models and the limitations of the other but to underline that any constitutive models including bishop s stress based e g wheeler et al 2003 gallipoli and bruno 2017 or two independent stresses based models for unsaturated conditions and also terzaghi s effective stress based models for saturated conditions can be merged into the governing equations through eq 8 the only distinctions lie in computing the derivative coefficients 2 3 2 fluid retention in the isochoric and isothermal conditions the degree of saturation of interstitial fluid in a porous medium depends on its suction level which is often described by the so called fluid retention curve s r s r s or the capillary pressure curve s s s r the two expressions will not lead to any difference in the numerical solution so the choice is purely a matter of individual preference and the former is used hereafter however the retention capacity of a porous medium at a particular suction will be modified internally by the interstitial geometric change gallipoli et al 2003 simms and yanful 2005 sun et al 2007 externally by the temperature variation through changing the surface tension along the phase interfaces laloui et al 2013 therefore the retention curve is both deformation and temperature dependent the former provides surely a more decisive influence for large deformation scenarios thus we adopt herein an isothermal but non isochoric retention curve s r s e whose differential form is 9 d s r s r s d s s r e d e where s r s and s r e are the isochoric and choric fluid capacities respectively note that some sophisticated characters e g the hysteresis along the suction reverse paths can be reflected by systematically adjusting these two capacities in the laboratory tests for a retention curve the gravimetric water content w is often measured simply by weight whereas measuring void ratio is usually lacking the fitting retention curve is delineated by the function w w s or d w w s d s this expression however can be readily converted to eq 9 with the basic volume mass relationship w g s s r e or its differential form 10 d w s r g s d e e g s d s r 2 3 3 permeability the permeability of a porous medium depends on its deformation state somogyi 1979 fredlund and rahardjo 1993 in saturated conditions and degree of saturation in unsaturated conditions the latter is often portrayed from a relative perspective mualem 1978 zou 2012 the multiplication principle is adopted to fully represent the permeability as k k s e k r s r where k s and k r denote respectively the saturated intrinsic and unsaturated relative permeability again its differential form is 11 d k k e d e k s r d s r note that various models exist in the literature for all the above three constitutive models when specific functions are chosen see the appendix c all the differential coefficients can be determined which can then be substituted into the general balance equations to tailor a set of coupled differential equations in terms of selected primary independent variables for example the independent pair σ v u f or a single independent w in the following section 2 4 governing equations using σ v and u f as independent variables 2 4 1 jacobian matrix of s r e with respect to σ v s with σ v and u f as independent variables the infinitesimal variations of s r and e from the general balance equations 6b and 7b must be first re expressed via rearranging the incremental constitutive equations 8 and 9 as 12 e s r 1 1 s r e d s r d e e σ v e s 0 s r s d σ v d s solving eq 12 yields 13 d s r d e j 1 d σ v d s where j 1 j s r e σ v s is the jacobian matrix which aggregates the partial derivatives that are necessary for the differentiable mapping from d s r d e to d σ v d s see appendix a for its specific derivation and detailed expansion spontaneously the partial derivatives of s r and e with respect to time or space can also be transformed through the same relation into the those of σ v and s as 14 s r e j 1 σ v s where could be a or t 2 4 2 expansion of storage terms and flux terms based on the chain rule and eq 14 the last storage term in the fluid mass balance eq 6b is expanded as 15 e s r t e s r t s r e e s r j 1 λ 1 1 t σ v u f where λ 1 1 denotes the diagonal matrix 1 0 0 1 which is used for transforming s to u f as mentioned above in the flux term the first derivative of the permeability k i e the convection term is evaluated based on e and s r from eq 11 thus its expansion is again based on the combination of the chain rule and the relation defined by j 1 finally k a can be evaluated from σ v and u f as 16 k a s r e k a s r e s r e k j 1 λ 1 1 a σ v u f where s r e k k s r k e 2 4 3 final equations and boundary conditions substituting eqs 15 and 16 into the fluid mass balance eq 6b we derive 17a a 0 c u f a σ v u f a σ v a u f a σ v u f t σ v t u f t σ v u f where a σ v a u f s r e k j 1 λ 1 1 and t σ v t u f e s r j 1 λ 1 1 1 e 0 eq 17a together with the following momentum balance equation alternative form to eq 7b 17b σ v a c σ v 0 constitutes the system of governing equations for large strain consolidation of saturated unsaturated material using σ v and u f as the independent variables where the coefficients c u f a u f t u f c σ v a σ v and t σ v are shown in table c2 for eq 17a the pressure dirichlet boundary conditions for u f at both ends are 18 u f a a u f a t where a could be 0 bottom or initial height h 0 top and u f a t is the imposed time dependent pore fluid pressure value linking the darcy s law with the exchange rate of fluid between the porous medium and surrounding environment the fluid flux across the interface in the convective coordinate system r t k u f ρ f g ξ ξ where r a t represents the time dependent rate of evaporation infiltration or drainage at the top or bottom respectively by applying the coordinate transformation eq 3 the neumann boundary conditions in the lagrangian coordinate system are expressed as 19 u f a a a γ f k 1 e 1 e 0 r a t k 1 c u f r a t k normally the bottom is set to be impervious i e r 0 t 0 and the right hand side of eq 19 degenerates into γ f 1 e 1 e 0 a 0 lastly the first order eq 17b indicates that the boundary conditions can only be imposed on σ v at one end of the configuration which for this case at the top writes 20 σ v a h 0 σ v h 0 t where σ v denotes the time dependent top boundary loads per unit area 2 5 governing equations using w as independent variable 2 5 1 jacobian matrix of s s r e with respect to σ v w in this section efforts are devoted to establishing a single governing equation with w as the system independent this is possible because one of the field variables i e σ v can be independently determined by integrating the momentum balance eq 7b which is first order and can be merged into the fluid mass balance eq 6b to this end the incremental constitutive equations eqs 8 9 and 10 should be rearranged as a σ v and w driven form as 21 e s e s r 1 s r s 1 s r e 0 e g s s r g s d s d s r d e e σ v 0 0 0 0 1 d σ v d w solving eq 21 in the same way as for eq 12 yields 22 d s d s r d e j 2 d σ v d w where the jacobian matrix j 2 j s s r e σ v w aggregates the partial derivatives that are necessary for the differentiable mapping from d s d s r d e to d σ v d w see appendix b for its specific derivation and detailed expansion as with eq 14 a partial differential relation for u f or s that will be useful for further derivation can be segregated from eq 22 written as 23 u f a s a j 11 2 j 12 2 a σ v w where j mn 2 is the m n t h component of the jacobian matrix j 2 2 5 2 rewriting of storage terms and flux terms the last storage term of eq 6b can be simplified via the basic intrinsic relation w g s s r e as 24 e s r t g s w t this identity indicates that only the independent variable w appears in terms of time derivative which is another reason for the possibility of using a single system independent substitution of eq 23 into the flux term of eq 6b leads to 25 a k 1 γ f 1 e 0 1 e u f a k a c u f j 11 2 j 12 2 a σ v w k where c u f k 1 e 0 γ f 1 e note here that the permeability gradient in eq 25 can also be expanded by using eqs 11 and 22 like the previous treatment of eq 16 however the subsequent substitution of the momentum balance equation for eliminating the stress gradient term σ v a will lead to a rather complicated form of the final equation thus a full expansion is not carried out here and in the following derivation 2 5 3 final equations and boundary conditions as implied above the total stress gradient in the flux term of eq 25 can be replaced by the momentum balance eq 7b which together with the intrinsic relation w g s s r e and eq 24 leads to the final governing equation 26 a c u f j 12 2 w a c u f j 11 2 γ f g s 1 e 0 1 w k g s 1 e 0 w t which can be abbreviated as 27 a c w 1 w a c w 2 w t where the coefficients c w 1 and c w 2 are given in table c2 the term c w 2 comprises two parts the first is the conservative flux convection term that arises from the momentum balance conditions and the second is conservative flux source term that is linked to the permeability we choose to leave c w 2 as a conservative flux term in the brackets rather than being expanded to be a nonconservative convection term i e unlike eq 16 to guarantee simplicity of the final equation form this treatment will not lead to any difference in the solutions if an appropriate numerical scheme is adopted as will be discussed in a later section finally it is worth stressing that eq 27 is the single equation that couples the momentum and mass balance equations for mechanical equilibrium and fluid flow respectively during the consolidation process since w is used as the independent eq 27 could also be termed coupled dewatering equation for porous media in both saturated and unsaturated conditions implying the same saturated form as gibson et al 1981 s the flux neumann boundary conditions in terms of the gradient of w can be obtained by inserting eqs 17b and 23 into eq 19 as 28 w a a a 1 c u f r a t k j 11 2 c σ v j 12 2 where c u f and c σ v are shown in table c2 when transferring the known pressure dirichlet boundary conditions for u f to those for w according to the constitutive functions an additional boundary variable must be determined or known a priori normally σ v at the top is given or can be determined at the bottom during the calculation process thus the value of w imposed for the dirichlet condition is calculated as 29 w a a w a t f u f a t σ v a t where the implicit function f is constrained by the constitutive relations of eqs 8 9 and 10 u f a t and σ v a t denote the respective boundary values the boundary conditions given above are in general forms their detailed specifications will be discussed in later sections 2 6 initial conditions once two of field variables s r e w σ v and u f at the initial state are specified the remaining that are compatible with the constitute relations can be determined meanwhile they must also satisfy the following requirements by integrating the momentum balance equation over the lagrangian coordinate while considering the initial boundary load σ v a h 0 t 0 σ v h 0 0 we obtain the initial σ v profile 30 σ v a 0 σ v h 0 0 a h 0 γ f 1 e 0 g s e 0 s r 0 d α σ v h 0 0 g s γ f 1 e 0 h 0 a g s γ f 1 e 0 a h 0 w 0 d α where s r 0 and w 0 represent the initial values if the materials are initially saturated s r 0 1 with fluids over the entire configuration and skeleton particles are very loosely lapped over each other then w 0 g s e 0 and a very small and constant distribution of terzaghi s effective stress could be assumed as σ ˇ v 0 0 k p a thus the initial fluid pressure 31 u f a 0 σ v a 0 σ ˇ v 0 σ v a 0 3 numerical scheme for both sets of equation s the primary unknowns are mapped over the initial fixed configuration leading to a total lagrangian formulation without requiring the actual large deformation of the computational configuration to be updated the coordinate mapping adds geometric nonlinearity to the equation coefficients in addition to material nonlinearity two different nonlinear finite element solutions are developed for these two sets of equations s which will also be compared with an existing finite difference solution from unsatcon developed by the authors qi et al 2017a qi et al 2017b the aim of these mutual verifications is to consolidate the fact that different numerical schemes for different equation s will literally yield identical yet accurate results for the same physical problem the main distinct features of the three numerical solutions are briefed below the first set of equations eqs 17a and 17b with the independent pair of σ v and s are solved using the commercial scripted equations solver flexpde 2019 which processes the partial differential equations symbolically after discretization the two equations are assembled into one single set of coupling matrix equations and solved stimulatingly by a conjugate gradient solver for a fully coupled solution the nonlinear coefficients are treated by a modified newton raphson procedure a petrov galerkin weighting process is applied to eliminate the solution oscillations caused by the first order convection terms in both equations the calculation errors are continually monitored by a timestep controller which automatically adjusts the timestep size to guarantee the accuracy the second set of equation with the independent of w is solved using a finite element code developed by the authors based on the fortran code in smith and griffiths 2013 for the small strain consolidation of saturated materials when applying the galerkin discretization the term c w 2 is treated as a conservative flux source term and singled out via the integration by parts which is consequently associated with a first derivation of the test function after each iteration the σ v increments are first computed via eq 30 to update the other variables s r e s through constitutive integration appendices c and b and to evaluate the equation coefficients c w 1 c w 2 at the gauss points for the next iteration noted that this is not an interlaced procedure for solving flow and equilibrium equations sequentially over a time step integration of eq 7b is only for the local constitutive integration the single governing eq 27 alone can yield a global hydro mechanical coupled solution as elaborated above during its derivation the third code unsatcon also uses the lagrangian description for all physical variables but discretizes the governing equations in the convection ξ coordinate system with a finite difference procedure thus the node coordinates must be constantly updated to track the motion of the solid skeleton during calculation different from the numerical integrations of the incremental constitutive equations in the above two solutions the integrated closed form of constitutive equations are directly solved by a specially designed algorithm which is found to be efficient for the majority of the sophisticated including elastic plastic constitutive models for unsaturated poromaterials qi et al 2020 4 skeleton shrinkage model for the skeleton deformation of a porous material undergoing sustained drying the most distinctive feature is the marked volumetric contraction but only to a shrinkage limit beyond which its stiffness in response to capillary pressure tends to diverge we have attempted to assimilate the shrinkage modelling in unsatcon with two categories of constitutive models e g the state surface model based on two independent stresses vu and fredlund 2006 and the glasgow coupled model based on bishop s effective stress wheeler et al 2003 the former requires calibrating a high number of empirical constants from samples that must subject to various stress paths and the latter imitates shrinkage limit by the elastic branch of the elastic plastic framework in that a faster rate of drying included hardening than bishop s stress growing must be fine tuned for simplicity we propose herein a model fig 2 a to simulate the vanishing compressibility under sustained drying by d e d ln σ v σ v d e d σ v λ 1 e r n 32 e r 0 s r 1 e 00 e e 00 e f s r 1 where λ is the slope of virgin compression line in the e ln σ v diagram indicating the compressibility as per convention in saturated soil mechanics its validity extends over the capillary range until the air entry value and its calibration can be easily performed over the corresponding range of data for example the thickened tailings data in fig 2 b daliri 2013 where the points for s r 1 were excluded in fitting e 00 is the void ratio corresponding to onset of desaturation which depends on the overburden stress or depth as will be discussed later once desaturation starts λ is scaled down by a factor of 1 e r n where e r is the distance of e 00 e normalized by e 00 e f where e f is the shrinkage void ratio the scaling factor varies progressively from 1 to 0 and the new model therefore respects two essential physical limits the compressibility matches the value of λ in the limit of s r 1 and vanishes asymptotically towards the shrinkage limit fig 2 a the exponent n controls the rate of volume shrinkage to e f which is the only additional parameter that requiring extra calibration due to the use of σ v n must be calibrated in conjunction with the retention parameters or with a pre calibrated e dependent retention model the latter is adopted herein for illustrating the model sensitivity to n for the same thickened tailings the modified van genuchten model eq c2 has been calibrated previously by the authors qi 2017 and refer also to table 2 fig 2 b shows that the shrinkage rate increases with n the retention trajectory travels from one isochoric drying curve to another of the underlying retention model with decreasing e fig 2 c consequently for highest n the simulated retention trajectory is on the rightmost side and ceases at the wettest state when reaching e f for this case the experimental σ v was lower than its actual value over the suction range of 100 kpa due to cavitation leading to difficulty in obtaining the best fit n value fig 2 b however the simulated shrinkage state i e w at e f is quite sensitive to n which can be readily identified from the shrinkage curve e v s w that can be measured much more accurately for instance in this way n 7 is determined for a shrinkage limit of w 17 3 for this tailings sample fig 2 d 5 numerical performance 5 1 numerical verification 5 1 1 configuration and material the laboratory column test of the same gold tailings daliri 2013 which has been simulated with the unsatcon qi et al 2020 was re simulated with the two new large deformation models for consolidation of unsaturated porous materials mutual verifications will be made by comparisons of not only different large deformation models but also different constitutive models for skeleton shrinkage the initial conditions were characterized by a uniform density distribution with voids were fully saturated with water throughout the configuration which can be set by eqs 30 and 31 as detailed in appendix d the subsequent consolidation dewatering process was divided into two stages wd consolidation in saturated conditions and ed dewatering in unsaturated conditions both stages can exist simultaneously in one simulation but within different elements the internal elements can be easily simulated from saturated to unsaturated state by changing the constitutive relations to update the coefficients of the governing equations one caveat here is that the smooth switching of boundary conditions is important for the full stage simulation when the supernatant water was completely depleted by evaporation see table 1 in unsatcon this boundary treatment is rather simple as the skeleton surface position is tracked naturally in the updated lagrangian formulation however for the two new models in the fixed space additional codes are required to record the time history of the supernatant water thickness i e the time integration of the rate difference between wd outflows and actual evaporation the numerical configuration is h 0 0 18 m e 0 1 0982 g s 2 89 potential evaporation rate 9 92 mm day and table 2 summarizes the parameters for constitutive models 5 1 2 inter large deformation model comparison due to the nonexistence of analytical solution the simulation accuracy is first examined by comparing the results from different models with the same sets of constitutive models in which eq c1 in table 2 was used for the skeleton deformation fig 3 a shows that in the 1st wd stage the simulated water outflow rates ofs across the surface from the three models are almost identical which further divides the wd stage into two substages when compared with the potential evaporation pe rate the supernatant water thickness first accumulates when of pe and then dissipates when of pe see fig 3 b it is interesting that the top inflow negative rate is observed from around 0 55 to 0 9 days in the second substage this is caused by the fact that the wd consolidation has essentially ceased and the imposed bottom drainage rate has induced a downward water migration throughout the entire domain the almost identical results demonstrate the correctness of the implementations of various boundary conditions in different formulations which is crucial for stage switch prediction a closer inspection indicates that the switch timing was predicted to be slightly earlier 7 6 min by the commercial fem script flexpde than the other two this difference is obviously not due to different mathematical descriptions for these models i e different coordinate systems equation independents or numerical methods since the fem fortran code and fdm unsatcon simulations which are based on the lagrangian a and convective ξ coordinate systems respectively predict very close switching timings this difference is however attributed to the numerical discretization errors in the flexpde an automatic mesh approach and adaptive time steps were utilized whereas both the node spacings number and time steps were fixed in the other two self developed codes for simplicity also eliminating this intrinsic numerical error seems to be unimportant for this case since it has no appreciable influence on subsequent predictions in the 2nd ed stage fig 3 c d shows that the differences in the average w and e from three simulations are 0 05 and 0 01 respectively which are imperceptible compared to the scattered experimental data the good agreements demonstrate that all the three models are accurate and can operate independently 5 1 3 inter skeleton deformation model comparison the skeleton deformation model proposed in section 4 was implemented through constitutive integration of eq 32 into the fem scheme based on eq 27 which was then applied to simulating the same column test fig 4 a shows that the predicted variations of average w and e display no observable deviations from those with the previous constitutive model i e eq c1 the point level predictions e g at the bottom and top ends in fig 4 b in terms of various constitutive paths also demonstrate good agreements between models noted that the void ratio e 00 from which the element starts to desaturate is depth dependent and is programmatically determined as the drying front gradually penetrates deeper before the arrival of drying front the element volume contracts due to fluid escape and is controlled by terzaghi s effective stress σ v u f thus an element at deeper location will be subjected to more volumetric contraction under higher σ v from the same initial state further the denser state at deeper location implies a higher air entry value and therefore a delayed desaturation according to the e dependent retention model this mutual promotion mechanism explains the smaller e 00 at deeper depth fig 4 c in other words the new skeleton model predicts naturally the depth dependent shrinkage paths fig 4 b c being more conforming to the reality whereas the six parameter empirical model of eq c1 does not embrace any path history dependent feature and the predicted volume contraction depends simply on the current stress levels overall the new model offers a much greater flexibility and capability for shrinkage modelling with only two easily calibrated constants which will be further explored in the following parametric analysis more importantly although the governing equations are compatible with arbitrary constitutive models the non integrable eq 32 is difficult to be implemented in some commercial scripted differential equation solvers in view of this only the self written fem scheme based on eq 27 will be applied in the subsequent analyses 5 2 parametric study the consolidation dewatering behaviors of a porous material deposit are constitutively dominated by the coupling responses of its two constituent materials i e the deformation of the skeleton and flow of the pore fluid the coupling is affected internally by the solid particle compositions and the pore structures vick 1990 aubertin et al 1996 mizani 2010 heidarian 2012 and externally by the actual evaporative driving force fredlund et al 2016 the latter is altered not only by the local environment but also the surface ground conditions in this section these influencing factors are investigated by changing the most relevant and controlling parameters including λ and n for skeleton deformation β and m for fluid flow and the actual evaporation ae rate the parametrical studies in section 5 2 1 to 5 2 3 are performed based on the measured shrinkage behavior of a residual soil mixed with different contents of fine sands krisdani et al 2008 the numerical configuration is h 0 0 2 m g s 2 65 e 0 2 slurry table 3 lists the other input parameters similar to the saturated case gibson et al 1967 the average degree of consolidation is defined in terms of settlement as 33 u s t h 0 0 ξ h 0 t 1 d ξ h 0 0 ξ h 0 1 d ξ 0 h 0 e 0 e a t d a 0 h 0 e 0 e f d a where refers to the final state corresponding to the limiting e f in addition the average degree of dewatering is defined in terms of relative water mass loss as 34 u w t 0 h 0 w 0 w a t d a 0 h 0 w 0 d a note that it is assumed that the water could be completely lost in eq 34 which is only theoretically possible for a thin deposit under extremely dry conditions in practice the flow will be restricted when water becomes discontinuous at low s r close to the ground surface thus u w t can never reach unity 5 2 1 effects of evaporation the evaporation is essentially a thermodynamic process involving water vapor and turbulent diffusion in the air overlying the surface which however has not been integrated into the proposed models as such an estimated time dependent ae rate must be imposed at the top boundary for making reasonable predictions for practical applications the wilson penman ae model wilson 1990 was used herein 35 a e p e γ η γ η exp 10 δ ψ g w m γ f r u 273 15 t s where ψ osmotic suction matric suction and osmotic component is neglected in our model η psychrometric constant 0 06733 kpa w m molecular mass of water 0 018 kg mol r u universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k γ slope of saturation vapor pressure versus temperature curve in kpa which depends on the value of surface temperature t s in and δ suction adjustment factor eq 35 gives the relationship between relative evaporation and suction by combining penman s equation for pe depending on local meteorological factors with lord kelvin s equation for relative humidity in the surficial ground the lord kelvin s equation i e the exponential part in eq 35 was derived based on the thermodynamic equilibrium principle at the evaporative plane that was assumed to remain in the vicinity of ground surface this assumption however contradicts the fact that the evaporative plane gradually recedes to deeper depths and the top unsaturated materials will exert an evaporative resistance unlike the pe contingent on the meteorological parameters the resistance mechanism is closely associated the material internal features e g pore structure salinity water retention and conductivity which are empirically considered through adjusting suction by a factor of 10 δ the complicated resistance mechanism challenges selection of δ for example the formula δ lg 3000 s r e s where s r e s is the residual suction suggested by fredlund et al 2016 has led to reasonable predictions of the average s r variation over time on one shrinkage test in krisdani et al 2008 when being combined with the large strain consolidation model fig 5 a but yielded an overestimated evaporation rate fig 5 b for the column test of daliri 2013 the overestimation for the latter case was due to the higher evaporative resistance from the surface salinity which implies a larger δ thus the parametric analyses were conducted by using different combinations of δ and pe values fig 6 a as the pe boundary on a 0 2 m high porous stratum fig 6 b c shows that for the same pe 10 mm day varying δ results in no differences in the predicted u w and u s until the imposed ae starts to deviate from pe at the respective s r as δ increases the value of s r for this deviation also increases fig 6 a and the dewatering consolidation ends up earlier with lower u w u s and suction fig 6 b c d the non thoroughness of dewatering consolidation for larger δ case is due to that the ae vanishes at larger s r in the surface element for practical implications smaller values of δ are usually observed in clayey materials for which the evaporation has a more prolonged effect for the same δ 2 decreasing the pe will delay the wd ed stage switching point since it requires longer times to consume the supernatant water as a result the time required to reach the same u w and u s is approximately doubled when pe is halved fig 6 b c however all cases for the same δ value will reach the same u w and u s sooner or later depending on pe finally the predictions with supernatant decantation are also included as the dashed curves which gradually approach the respective predictions for the no decantation cases despite no delay of the stage switch for lower pe cases 5 2 2 effects of compressibility the effects of the skeleton stiffness in fully and partially saturated conditions are investigated by varying λ and n respectively the pre adopted reference λ 0 15 represents the average stiffness of the saturated granitic residual soils in krisdani et al 2008 according to the regression model that correlates compressibility with atterberg limits and e 0 han et al 2022 however λ depends also on many other factors which for instance might increase remarkably with increasing fines content carrera et al 2011 hu et al 2017 thus four values of λ range 0 1 to 0 2 lying in the 95 confidence interval from the regression analysis by han et al 2022 were used in the parametric study fig 7 a shows that as expected a lower saturated stiffness i e larger λ leads to a denser state i e higher u s and u w at the end of wd stage consequently a larger amount of supernatant water needs longer evaporative time when ae pe resulting in a delayed onset of desaturation nevertheless this delay does not have a profound or subversive influence on the subsequent ed stage i e a larger λ will always lead to a higher u s throughout the process the reasons are twofold i u s itself is higher before the start of the ed stage ii the ae is also higher for a larger λ the latter is the result of sophisticated coupling between the skeleton volumetric and water flow behaviors a rough explanation is that the denser skeleton structure for larger λ implies a higher s r and a lower s given approximately the same amount of w see fig 7 b therefore a higher ae is expected according to wilson 1990 s model i e eq 35 likewise the pre adopted reference n 4 provides an average stiffness of the granitic residual soils under capillary stress whose value is also affected by many factors for instance a much stiffer response smaller n and lower plasticity was observed in krisdani et al 2008 for a lower fine content sample the parametric results show that the value of n over the studied range only has a limited and insignificant influence on u s and u w respectively in the second half of the ed stage i e when u s 0 6 these differences in u s may also be attributed to the sophisticated coupling as explained above despite smaller differences compared to those from varying λ the time span required to reach a high degree of consolidation e g u s 0 95 for smaller n is still noticeably longer than for larger n noting that fig 7 c is plotted in log time scale 5 2 3 effects of permeability as with the deformation model the adopted permeability model comprises two components k s e and k r s r for saturated and unsaturated conditions whose variations with e and s r are controlled by β and m respectively see appendix c thus β and m were varied in separate groups of analyses to distinguish their influences ghezzehei et al 2007 geng and yu 2017 fig 8 a b shows the input k s e and k k s s r relationships for the considered ranges of β and m respectively note that k s is normalized by α which equals k s at e 1 fig 9 illustrates that varying β only affects the wd stage the consolidation rate increases with increasing β because a larger β gives a higher k for the ranges of e 1 44 1 47 in this stage as marked in fig 8 a the wd stage ends up with the same values of u w and u s which are dictated by terzaghi s effective stress induced by the same weight through the same skeleton deformation model therefore in all varying β cases the same amounts of supernatant water should have been accumulated and require the same lengths of time to fully evaporate for ae pe before desaturation consequently the ed stages start after the same time elapsed from identical initial configuration settings i e same depth distribution of all physical quantities thus there are no differences in u w and u s after onset of desaturation fig 10 a illustrates that varying m only affects the ed stage to be more precise there are differences only when u w 0 7 or u s 0 9 from which the dewatering consolidation rate decreases with decreasing m this is attributed to lower ae rates for smaller m cases the desaturation penetrates gradually downward from the surface and a smaller m will amplify the permeability difference between the top lower s r and bottom higher s r zones a higher hydraulic gradient has been stimulated to compensate the blocking effect of the top lower k zone on the upward water migration to fulfill the ae needs near the surface thus the non uniformity of the depth profile of s must be more significant for smaller m cases this will in turn augment the non uniformity of depth profile of s r and therefore of k as the dewatering proceeds fig 10 b c compares the depth profiles of s and s r for varying m cases at two same values of u w 0 5 0 7 a higher s or lower s r at the surface will cause ae attenuation and limit the ed forces for smaller m cases see fig 10 d showing ae over time for different m cases it appears that larger volumetric compressions under higher capillary stresses near the surface would also reduce the water transport ability see fig 8 a and further augment the non uniformity this influence however is considered to be secondary compared to the smaller m for practical implications smaller values of m are usually observed in clayey soils since its pore structural feature likely increases the flow resistances at lower s r which is dominated by the adsorbed film flow corner flow and vapor diffusion ghezzehei et al 2007 5 2 4 depth of drying front lastly the development of drying front was investigated under different evaporation conditions and for different permeability at the engineering scale h 0 2 0 m is used herein for illustration based on the case in table 2 the depth of the drying front d d f which marks the interface between saturated and unsaturated zones is graphically shown through two simplified diagrams in fig 11 a numerically we use the depth at which the suction reaches the nominal air entry value 1 φ e ψ see eq c2 gallipoli 2012 as d d f fig 11 a b shows that the time histories of d d f and ae at different pes are divided by two segments by an clear cusp at a characteristic d d f similar to the experimental results shahraeeni et al 2012 in the first stage the drying front first penetrates rapidly into the porous medium under the effect of high ae and then stabilizes toward the characteristic d d f with the rapid decay of ae as the surface s r decreases the shallow capillary can maintain continuous viscous flow above characteristic d d f in this stage the cusp indicates that s r at surface reaches a critical value hayek 2015 and the surface water transport changes from viscous flow to vapor diffusion in the second stage an accelerate decreases of k r after the critical s r fig 8 b results in a larger suction gradient fig 10 c to satisfy the needs of ae thus the fast penetration of d d f is reactivated which re stabilizes eventually as the ae 0 it can be found that pe only changes the onset and duration of these two stages without affecting the characteristic and final values of d d f which are controlled by the coupling of the permeability evaporation and retention models or et al 2013 the relationship between ae and d d f is given in fig 11 c d to explore the influences of the evaporation and permeability on the predicted d d f large δ in the evaporation model implies a high evaporation resistance at the surface e g coarse soil and saline soil which will impede the penetration of the drying front however the final d d f is not significantly affected by δ except for the cases with ultra high evaporation resistance e g δ 3 when δ 3 ae decays to zero before the characteristic d d f is reached so that the final d d f is smaller than the other cases the value of m for relative permeability has a significant effect on d d f fig 11 d especially after the characteristic d d f under the same evaporation conditions a smaller m leads to a larger gradient of s r near the surface e g fig 10 b and the resulting sharp change in permeability along the depth will hinder the internal water transport and lead to the stabilization of the final drying front at a shallower depth when ae 0 in particular for m 0 2 the penetration of drying front is limited to the first stage and the final d d f only approaches its characteristic value 6 conclusions based on gibson s large deformation theory and poromechanics for unsaturated porous medium the one dimensional consolidation theory that couples the large deformation of the skeleton to saturated unsaturated fluid flow are derived through mapping the momentum mass balance equations from current convective to initial lagrangian coordinate systems and by incorporating the general incremental form of nonlinear constitutive models for unsaturated materials as such the geometric nonlinearity through equation mapping is superimposed on the material nonlinearity the theory is presented by two different forms of governing equations depending on the primary independents σ v u w total vertical stress pore fluid pressure and w gravimetric water content both in the fixed configuration two finite element codes with distinct features are developed to deal with the dual nonlinearity embedded in the equation coefficients and to provide diverse solutions for mutual validations the loose constraints on the forms of constitutive laws imply that the derived formulation has a strong capability to be compatible with arbitrary constitutive models e g the two parameter incremental model for the skeleton deformation the two finite element formulations are applied to a tailings column test which has been simulated by a finite difference solution to the governing equations in continually deforming configuration in a piece wise linear manner qi et al 2020 the inter formulation comparison demonstrates the inherent equivalence among three different formulations and the good accuracy of the associated numerical solutions to dealing with such a dual nonlinearity problem the present theories can very well capture the entire large deformation consolidation process and clearly distinguish between the weight driven wd saturated stage and the evaporation driven wd unsaturated stage by accurately tracking the variation of the supernatant thickness this indicates the new theories can naturally revert to the gibson s theory the effects of evaporation material s compressibility and permeability were parametrically studied the sub parameters in each of the three influencing elements which corresponds to saturated and unsaturated regimes respectively were found to independently affect the consolidation dewatering rates in the corresponding first wd and second ed stages respectively though the different parameters for saturated regime e g the saturated compressibility might have cascade effects on the consolidation dewatering degree in the subsequent ed stage and the sub parameters in both regimes will likely change concurrently with the material inherent structures the parametric results can still provide good references for understanding the large deformation consolidation process of a porous stratum under alternating saturated unsaturated conditions in addition the present numerical schemes do not have a rigorous coupling of evaporation processes but a robust evaporation model is successfully applied at different scales in particular the study of water transport in large scale simulations is an essential guidance for setting soil atmosphere boundaries in engineering applications in future research simulations of the response when changing more constitutive parameters are necessary and a greater focus on the coupling of surface evaporation resistance and cracking into the governing equations could produce interesting findings credit

2341,this paper develops the one dimensional large deformation consolidation theory for the porous medium under alternating saturated unsaturated conditions through a former generalization of the well established gibson s nonlinear theory from saturated to unsaturated regime with the differential relations between the coordinate systems the equations governing the momentum mass balances in the unsaturated porous stratum are transported from the moving current to the initial lagrangian coordinate system without loss of generality the collective forms of various incremental constitutive laws are then incorporated for unsaturated materials indicating that any particular constitutive law has been embraced two forms of final governing equations are derived depending on the primary independents σ v u w total vertical stress pore fluid pressure and w gravimetric water content which are solved by two distinct finite element codes on the initial fixed configuration numerical examples demonstrate that the two resulting total lagrangian formulations are equivalent yield virtually identical predictions and agrees well with an existing finite differential code that solves the equations in the convective configuration the dynamical consolidation process evolving from a weight driven saturated stage to an evaporation driven unsaturated stage is quantitatively captured very well by the predictions the impacts of evaporation material s compressibility and permeability in these two distinct stages are independently explored through several parametric analyses on the consolidation dewatering rates and the penetration of drying front through one factor must affect in concert with the others such a hydro mechanical coupling process these results can provide a

differential operator e and s r 1 introduction large quantities of soft materials with low density high compressibility weak permeability and sub standard strength are generated worldwide annually as bypass products in mining and dredging projects moftakhari et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 chen et al 2023 oftentimes these materials are deposited with initial high fluid contents fluid like state and are then subjected to large deformations under self weight which could take years or even decades before reaching a relatively dense state solid like state thus large amounts of equipment and land resources must be occupied for reprocessing and storing these soft materials for long various techniques are currently being explored to accelerate this densification process and therefore to reduce resource consumptions wang et al 2012 qi 2017 wang et al 2018 fu et al 2019 ngo et al 2020 among which the air drying technique stands out in terms of low costs the air drying technique makes use of the natural evaporative force which is technically free to further dehydrate the pre planned thin deposits as such the weight driven wd consolidation process will be followed by an evaporation driven ed dewatering process which finally brings the soft materials from the wet fluid dominated saturated states to dry skeleton dominated unsaturated states a numerical model that can simulate these two physical processes could provide a theoretical gist for optimizing the operational design for example to i reduce the densification time ii improve the storage efficiency and iii reuse the land resources safely and economically in the multiphase porous medium deposit both the wd and ed processes are featured as a poromechanical coupling phenomenon where the deformation of solid skeleton is tightly coupled to flow of fluid and or air through pores however these two poromechanical coupling processes differ in many aspects first in the former the skeleton deformation drives the flow in saturated conditions and the deformation rate equals the net fluid outflow rate under the assumption of incompressible constituents whereas in the latter the driving factor turns to be the interstitial flow and the deformation rate surpasses the net fluid outflow rate due to the air phase involvement in unsaturated conditions second despite that the fluid flows in both processes are directed constitutively by the same darcy s law with several superficial modifications for unsaturated conditions compared to the saturated one constitutive modelling of skeleton deformations which depends nonlinearly on the degree of saturation is notoriously complicated in unsaturated zone that necessitates a distinct definition of constitutive variables alonso et al 1990 fredlund and rahardjo 1993 these complications pose great challenges to formulating a rigorous unified numerical model for simulating the coupled large strain and consolidation dewatering process in a seamless manner earlier numerical models for consolidation of unsaturated porous materials follows terzaghi s classic one dimensional 1d consolidation theory in that the mass conservations of liquid and gas phases were both embraced in the governing equations but the constitutive relations were rather simplified or linearized due to the lack of experimental evidence for example fredlund and hasan 1979 assumed the permeability coefficients for air liquid flow were both constant barden 1965 linked the permeability and porosity to the pore air liquid pressure with linear relations these unwarranted assumptions could lead to unjustifiable predictions in recent decades fully coupled hydro mechanical numerical models for unsaturated porous materials have attracted significant interest with the theoretical advancement of constitutive modelling for example the impressive progress has been made in the simulation of transient fluid flow through deforming unsaturated skeleton based on the poroelastic theory under complex hydra mechanical boundaries lo et al 2020 lo et al 2021 multiple nonlinear constitutive models for the mechanical behavior with different levels of sophistication have been numerically implemented ranging from various nonlinear elasticity thomas et al 1996 gatmiri et al 1998 different elastic plasticity potts et al 2001 gatmiri and arson 2008 sheng et al 2008 potts et al 2021 to advanced hyper plasticity muraleetharan et al 2009 yang et al 2020 and other types kodikara 2012 tamagnini and ciantia 2016 a fully coupled numerical model which is armed with an appropriate model can capture very complicated point level response in any boundary value problems as diverse as slope stability qi and vanapalli 2015 zhang et al 2018 and ground subsidence cui et al 2013 nonetheless most of the existing implementations have exclusively adopted the assumption of infinitesimal strain and neglected the kinematic nonlinearity which limits their applications to problems where the skeleton deformations are small such that the computational grids e g the finite element mesh could always be tied to the rigid and undeformed configuration to escape from the constraints much of the efforts are currently being directed at challenges of the kinematic nonlinearity under large deformations inlaid juxtaposed with the material nonlinearity under unsaturated conditions in various coupled numerical frameworks fox 2007 wu et al 2020 the dual nonlinearity must be addressed by meticulous choices and integrations of the different numerical techniques fox and berles 1997 borja et al 2013 meric et al 2013 qi et al 2017a pu et al 2020 in a complete numerical framework being a research field that still requires continual work for the wd consolidation process under saturated conditions i e the first half of the porous materials response under air drying technique the 1d large deformation coupling theory by gibson et al 1967 has found successful practical applications which combines darcy s law with terzaghi s effective stress in a nonlinear kinematic framework a core step of this theory formalization was to unscramble the differential relations between the lagrangian coordinates fixed to the initial positions of skeleton particles and convective coordinates locating the current positions of skeleton particles and to link them with one variable quantifying the deformation state e g the void ratio in gibson et al 1967 then the governing equations for fluid and solid physics that are defined conveniently in the current convective coordinate system were transported to the fixed initial lagrangian coordinate system note that all relevant physical quantities are defined as attached to the same skeleton particles thus the resulted numerical formulation is essentially a total lagrangian formulation that is solved over an initial configuration referred to the solid skeleton and does not need a computational demanding configuration updating procedure for the same consolidation problem there exists an alternative numerical formulation that solves the governing equations directly in the convective coordinate system e g fox and berles 1997 where the discretized mesh node together with all relevant physical quantities is frequently updated over each time step according to computed skeleton deformation thus this type of numerical formulation is classified as an updated lagrangian formulation that tracks the motions of skeleton these two lagrangian formulations should lead to equivalent solutions and the latter is primarily concerned with the matter of programming for 1d problems and has been extended by the authors qi et al 2017a qi et al 2020 using a piece wise linear framework to unsaturated porous materials it will be shown that the above mentioned relations for coordinate transformation are only concerned with the skeleton deformation and holds true regardless of the saturation degree of pore fluid this allows extension of gibson et al 1967 s theory to ed dewatering process under unsaturated conditions i e the second half of the porous materials response under air drying technique in this study the extension is achieved by incorporating the nonlinear constitutive equations for unsaturated porous materials into the two partial differential equations for mass and momentum conservations via the basic relations for coordinate transformation categorized by the primary independents in the resulting governing equations two total lagrangian formulations namely u f σ v and w where u f pore fluid pressure σ v total vertical stress w gravimetric water content are formalized to fully capture the hydro mechanical coupling under large deformations both formulations are solved by the finite element methods but with different programs i e a commercially available and a self coded one for diversity the constitutive equations are presented in general incremental forms for generality which means that application of the two new formulations is not limited to any specific group of models in particular a new simple skeleton deformation model is proposed to describe the drying induced shrinkage of porous materials extensive mutual comparisons are made among numerical results not only from differential formulations including also the existing piece wise linear one qi et al 2020 but also from different constitutive models after examining the accuracy of the new global large deformation formulations and effectiveness of the new volumetric shrinkage model several parametric analyses are performed to investigate the effects of three important factors i e evaporation compressibility and permeability on the coupling responses of large strain consolidation and dewatering of a porous medium stratum 2 model description 2 1 basic assumptions and coordinate systems prior to the mathematical formalization of the large deformation theories the following basic assumptions are made a the material could switch from saturated state presenting as a solid fluid biphasic medium to unsaturated state presenting as a solid fluid gas triphasic medium and vice versa in both states the material is seen as a quasi continuum and the local quantities are replaced by the phase volume averaged values in the continuum formulation b the solid and liquid constituents are both incompressible thus the volumetric deformation of solid skeleton is identical to the change of porous volume which in particular for saturated state is merely associated with the net fluid flow through the porous volume c the pore fluid flow relative to the moving solid skeleton while with a complex hydro mechanical interaction in the large deformation process conforms to the generalized darcy s law in both saturated and unsaturated states coussy 2004 d the pore air flow is not explicitly formulated with its pressure remaining atmospheric the fluid gas phase change e g air dissolution and water vaporization in the porous space is also neglected leading to a basic isothermal formulation under the action of self weight and evaporative forces all large deformations of the porous strata occur in the vertical direction thus the problem is treated in an idealized one dimensional 1d configuration with unit cross sectional area in plan view fig 1 a as with the original work for saturated porous medium by gibson et al 1981 who formalized the large deformation consolidation theory in a lagrangian framework with reference to the initial configuration of undeformed solid skeleton it is featured as a type of total lagrangian formulation in that all the field quantities are defined as functions of time and of coordinates positioning the solid particle in the initial configuration while the basic balance equations governing various related physical processes commonly refer to the current and convective configuration therefore the conversion of the expressions from the current configuration to the initial configuration must be made which poses no difficulty under 1d conditions and can be achieved with the following mathematical relationships between the two corresponding coordinate systems as shown in fig 1 b in the porous stratum of an initial thickness h 0 a differential element that is initially located between positions a and a δ a will moves and deforms at time t to a new position between ξ a t and ξ a δ a t according to the chain rule the partial derivative operators with respect to a and ξ are related by 1 a ξ a ξ where a refers to the lagrangian coordinate that is fixed and marks the skeleton particle positions in the initial configuration ξ refers to convective coordinate that is a function of a t and tracks the motion of skeleton particles 2 2 general balance equations consider the element shown as fig 1 the mass balance of the solid skeleton by the lagrangian approach reads 2 ρ s 1 n δ ξ ρ s 1 n 0 δ a where n 0 denotes the initial porosity of the porous element δ a in the reference configuration n is the true porosity which refers the current porous volume fraction to the current element δ ξ but with respect to the same underlying solid particles that are marked by the lagrangian coordinate a ρ s is the density of solid particles and is constant according to assumption b note that the pore volume is oftentimes measured by the void ratio e n 1 n in some circumstances e g the constitutive models dissimulated later eq 2 can be rearranged to give 3 ξ a 1 n 0 1 n 1 e 1 e 0 where e 0 denotes the initial void ratio eqs 1 and 3 constitutes the two basic equations that will be used to convert the field quantities and differential operations between the two coordinate systems when deriving the fundamental governing equations in later sections note that these two relations originally provided by gibson et al 1981 are rigorously valid irrespective of whether the medium is in a saturated or unsaturated state the mass balance of the fluid phase states that the mass of net fluid flow out of or into an element must equal the change rate of fluid mass in the same element the former for the element δ a in the lagrangian coordinate system is evaluated by q ρ f a δ a where q is the relative flux vector of fluid and ρ f is the density of fluid phase for the latter the true fluid mass with reference to the element δ a must be firstly evaluated based on the its current volume fraction and with reference to the current element δ ξ thus the change rate of fluid mass is n s r ρ f δ ξ t where s r is the degree of saturation and the product n s r is the fluid volume fraction by substituting eq 1 the fluid mass balance equation writes 4 q a ρ f δ a t n s r ρ f ξ a δ a 0 according to the generalized darcy s law coussy 2004 the flux vector of fluid q relative to the solid skeleton should also be calculated in the current convective coordinate system as 5 q n s r v f v s k ξ u f ρ f g ξ where v f and v s are the velocities of the fluid and solid phase respectively k is the hydraulic permeability g is the gravitational acceleration u f is the pore fluid pressure in the unsaturated state the u f is negative and numerically equal to the opposite of the suction s u a u f when the pore air pressure u a is assumed zero according to assumption d note that ρ f is constant and combining eqs 4 with 5 yields 6a a k 1 γ f u f ξ k t n s r ξ a where γ f ρ f g is the unit weight of fluid phase the moment balance equation by neglecting the inertia force reduces to a static equilibrium equation in the lagrangian coordinate system 7a σ v a ρ m g ξ a 0 where σ v is the total vertical stress ρ m n s r ρ f 1 n ρ s is the phase volume averaged density of the medium which is again scaled by the ratio of the current element volume to its initial volume ξ a because the true weight of the medium must be evaluated with reference to the current element finally using the specific gravity of solid particle g s ρ s ρ f and the void ratio e and substituting the coordinate conversion relations i e eqs 2 and 3 the two balance equations are rearranged with respect to a t as 6b a k 1 γ f 1 e 0 1 e u f a k 1 1 e 0 e s r t and 7b σ v a γ f g s e s r 1 e 0 0 note that when the differential element is saturated with fluid s r 1 eqs 6b and 7b reverts to those for saturated cases gibson et al 1981 in summary under the adopted assumptions only two differential equations are required to describe the large strain consolidation behavior of porous medium under both saturated and unsaturated conditions the mass balance of solid phase is automatically fulfilled because of choice of the lagrangian framework which is explored and adopted for coordinate conversion and has been naturally merged into the final equations the governing balance equations describe the temporal variations of several field unknowns whose number however is far more than two thus additional constitutive equations must be added to fully constraint the problem definition 2 3 differential forms of constitutive models 2 3 1 skeleton deformation the skeleton deformation of a porous medium is excited by the superposition effect of both changes in the macroscopic total stress and interstitial pore pressures by applying the phase averaging technique to two pore pressures the bishop s effective stress dictating the skeleton deformation is defined as σ v σ v s r u f 1 s r u a note that s r represents the volume fraction whereas the stress is defined as the force per unit area thus it is assumed the phase area and volume fractions are equivalent also considering the specifical feature of 1d conditions only the vertical stress component instead of the general stress tensors is adopted and change in e can completely characterize the large deformations macminn et al 2016 and a deformation function e e σ v can exclusively describe the mechanical constitutive response for being merged into the partial differential governing equations its differential form also oftentimes directly formulated for an increment stress strain model is adopted and expressed by expanding σ v as 8 d e e σ v d σ v e s d s e s r d s r eq 8 represents general form in unsaturated zone where s u f under the assumption u a 0 while in saturated zone the last term vanishes s r 1 d s r 0 meanwhile e σ v e s e σ v being compatible with the terzaghi s effective stress principle σ v σ v u f although the symbols s and u f are used respectively in constitutive and governing equations throughout this paper confusions can be avoided by adding the negative sign whenever required in the final equation derivations if in unsaturated zone the increment d s r over d s is known from the fluid retention models discussed below eq 8 can be reformulated as d e e σ v d σ v m s d s where m s e s e s r s r s is s r dependent compressibility modulus with respect to suction this expression is the same as that based on two independent stress variables matyas and radhakrishna 1968 fredlund and morgenstern 1977 fredlund and rahardjo 1993 where the influence of s r is not explicitly captured but vaguely obscured by the second empirically determined compressibility modulus i e m s e s see appendix c for example note that the intention here is not to provide a thorough discussion on the strengths of one category of models and the limitations of the other but to underline that any constitutive models including bishop s stress based e g wheeler et al 2003 gallipoli and bruno 2017 or two independent stresses based models for unsaturated conditions and also terzaghi s effective stress based models for saturated conditions can be merged into the governing equations through eq 8 the only distinctions lie in computing the derivative coefficients 2 3 2 fluid retention in the isochoric and isothermal conditions the degree of saturation of interstitial fluid in a porous medium depends on its suction level which is often described by the so called fluid retention curve s r s r s or the capillary pressure curve s s s r the two expressions will not lead to any difference in the numerical solution so the choice is purely a matter of individual preference and the former is used hereafter however the retention capacity of a porous medium at a particular suction will be modified internally by the interstitial geometric change gallipoli et al 2003 simms and yanful 2005 sun et al 2007 externally by the temperature variation through changing the surface tension along the phase interfaces laloui et al 2013 therefore the retention curve is both deformation and temperature dependent the former provides surely a more decisive influence for large deformation scenarios thus we adopt herein an isothermal but non isochoric retention curve s r s e whose differential form is 9 d s r s r s d s s r e d e where s r s and s r e are the isochoric and choric fluid capacities respectively note that some sophisticated characters e g the hysteresis along the suction reverse paths can be reflected by systematically adjusting these two capacities in the laboratory tests for a retention curve the gravimetric water content w is often measured simply by weight whereas measuring void ratio is usually lacking the fitting retention curve is delineated by the function w w s or d w w s d s this expression however can be readily converted to eq 9 with the basic volume mass relationship w g s s r e or its differential form 10 d w s r g s d e e g s d s r 2 3 3 permeability the permeability of a porous medium depends on its deformation state somogyi 1979 fredlund and rahardjo 1993 in saturated conditions and degree of saturation in unsaturated conditions the latter is often portrayed from a relative perspective mualem 1978 zou 2012 the multiplication principle is adopted to fully represent the permeability as k k s e k r s r where k s and k r denote respectively the saturated intrinsic and unsaturated relative permeability again its differential form is 11 d k k e d e k s r d s r note that various models exist in the literature for all the above three constitutive models when specific functions are chosen see the appendix c all the differential coefficients can be determined which can then be substituted into the general balance equations to tailor a set of coupled differential equations in terms of selected primary independent variables for example the independent pair σ v u f or a single independent w in the following section 2 4 governing equations using σ v and u f as independent variables 2 4 1 jacobian matrix of s r e with respect to σ v s with σ v and u f as independent variables the infinitesimal variations of s r and e from the general balance equations 6b and 7b must be first re expressed via rearranging the incremental constitutive equations 8 and 9 as 12 e s r 1 1 s r e d s r d e e σ v e s 0 s r s d σ v d s solving eq 12 yields 13 d s r d e j 1 d σ v d s where j 1 j s r e σ v s is the jacobian matrix which aggregates the partial derivatives that are necessary for the differentiable mapping from d s r d e to d σ v d s see appendix a for its specific derivation and detailed expansion spontaneously the partial derivatives of s r and e with respect to time or space can also be transformed through the same relation into the those of σ v and s as 14 s r e j 1 σ v s where could be a or t 2 4 2 expansion of storage terms and flux terms based on the chain rule and eq 14 the last storage term in the fluid mass balance eq 6b is expanded as 15 e s r t e s r t s r e e s r j 1 λ 1 1 t σ v u f where λ 1 1 denotes the diagonal matrix 1 0 0 1 which is used for transforming s to u f as mentioned above in the flux term the first derivative of the permeability k i e the convection term is evaluated based on e and s r from eq 11 thus its expansion is again based on the combination of the chain rule and the relation defined by j 1 finally k a can be evaluated from σ v and u f as 16 k a s r e k a s r e s r e k j 1 λ 1 1 a σ v u f where s r e k k s r k e 2 4 3 final equations and boundary conditions substituting eqs 15 and 16 into the fluid mass balance eq 6b we derive 17a a 0 c u f a σ v u f a σ v a u f a σ v u f t σ v t u f t σ v u f where a σ v a u f s r e k j 1 λ 1 1 and t σ v t u f e s r j 1 λ 1 1 1 e 0 eq 17a together with the following momentum balance equation alternative form to eq 7b 17b σ v a c σ v 0 constitutes the system of governing equations for large strain consolidation of saturated unsaturated material using σ v and u f as the independent variables where the coefficients c u f a u f t u f c σ v a σ v and t σ v are shown in table c2 for eq 17a the pressure dirichlet boundary conditions for u f at both ends are 18 u f a a u f a t where a could be 0 bottom or initial height h 0 top and u f a t is the imposed time dependent pore fluid pressure value linking the darcy s law with the exchange rate of fluid between the porous medium and surrounding environment the fluid flux across the interface in the convective coordinate system r t k u f ρ f g ξ ξ where r a t represents the time dependent rate of evaporation infiltration or drainage at the top or bottom respectively by applying the coordinate transformation eq 3 the neumann boundary conditions in the lagrangian coordinate system are expressed as 19 u f a a a γ f k 1 e 1 e 0 r a t k 1 c u f r a t k normally the bottom is set to be impervious i e r 0 t 0 and the right hand side of eq 19 degenerates into γ f 1 e 1 e 0 a 0 lastly the first order eq 17b indicates that the boundary conditions can only be imposed on σ v at one end of the configuration which for this case at the top writes 20 σ v a h 0 σ v h 0 t where σ v denotes the time dependent top boundary loads per unit area 2 5 governing equations using w as independent variable 2 5 1 jacobian matrix of s s r e with respect to σ v w in this section efforts are devoted to establishing a single governing equation with w as the system independent this is possible because one of the field variables i e σ v can be independently determined by integrating the momentum balance eq 7b which is first order and can be merged into the fluid mass balance eq 6b to this end the incremental constitutive equations eqs 8 9 and 10 should be rearranged as a σ v and w driven form as 21 e s e s r 1 s r s 1 s r e 0 e g s s r g s d s d s r d e e σ v 0 0 0 0 1 d σ v d w solving eq 21 in the same way as for eq 12 yields 22 d s d s r d e j 2 d σ v d w where the jacobian matrix j 2 j s s r e σ v w aggregates the partial derivatives that are necessary for the differentiable mapping from d s d s r d e to d σ v d w see appendix b for its specific derivation and detailed expansion as with eq 14 a partial differential relation for u f or s that will be useful for further derivation can be segregated from eq 22 written as 23 u f a s a j 11 2 j 12 2 a σ v w where j mn 2 is the m n t h component of the jacobian matrix j 2 2 5 2 rewriting of storage terms and flux terms the last storage term of eq 6b can be simplified via the basic intrinsic relation w g s s r e as 24 e s r t g s w t this identity indicates that only the independent variable w appears in terms of time derivative which is another reason for the possibility of using a single system independent substitution of eq 23 into the flux term of eq 6b leads to 25 a k 1 γ f 1 e 0 1 e u f a k a c u f j 11 2 j 12 2 a σ v w k where c u f k 1 e 0 γ f 1 e note here that the permeability gradient in eq 25 can also be expanded by using eqs 11 and 22 like the previous treatment of eq 16 however the subsequent substitution of the momentum balance equation for eliminating the stress gradient term σ v a will lead to a rather complicated form of the final equation thus a full expansion is not carried out here and in the following derivation 2 5 3 final equations and boundary conditions as implied above the total stress gradient in the flux term of eq 25 can be replaced by the momentum balance eq 7b which together with the intrinsic relation w g s s r e and eq 24 leads to the final governing equation 26 a c u f j 12 2 w a c u f j 11 2 γ f g s 1 e 0 1 w k g s 1 e 0 w t which can be abbreviated as 27 a c w 1 w a c w 2 w t where the coefficients c w 1 and c w 2 are given in table c2 the term c w 2 comprises two parts the first is the conservative flux convection term that arises from the momentum balance conditions and the second is conservative flux source term that is linked to the permeability we choose to leave c w 2 as a conservative flux term in the brackets rather than being expanded to be a nonconservative convection term i e unlike eq 16 to guarantee simplicity of the final equation form this treatment will not lead to any difference in the solutions if an appropriate numerical scheme is adopted as will be discussed in a later section finally it is worth stressing that eq 27 is the single equation that couples the momentum and mass balance equations for mechanical equilibrium and fluid flow respectively during the consolidation process since w is used as the independent eq 27 could also be termed coupled dewatering equation for porous media in both saturated and unsaturated conditions implying the same saturated form as gibson et al 1981 s the flux neumann boundary conditions in terms of the gradient of w can be obtained by inserting eqs 17b and 23 into eq 19 as 28 w a a a 1 c u f r a t k j 11 2 c σ v j 12 2 where c u f and c σ v are shown in table c2 when transferring the known pressure dirichlet boundary conditions for u f to those for w according to the constitutive functions an additional boundary variable must be determined or known a priori normally σ v at the top is given or can be determined at the bottom during the calculation process thus the value of w imposed for the dirichlet condition is calculated as 29 w a a w a t f u f a t σ v a t where the implicit function f is constrained by the constitutive relations of eqs 8 9 and 10 u f a t and σ v a t denote the respective boundary values the boundary conditions given above are in general forms their detailed specifications will be discussed in later sections 2 6 initial conditions once two of field variables s r e w σ v and u f at the initial state are specified the remaining that are compatible with the constitute relations can be determined meanwhile they must also satisfy the following requirements by integrating the momentum balance equation over the lagrangian coordinate while considering the initial boundary load σ v a h 0 t 0 σ v h 0 0 we obtain the initial σ v profile 30 σ v a 0 σ v h 0 0 a h 0 γ f 1 e 0 g s e 0 s r 0 d α σ v h 0 0 g s γ f 1 e 0 h 0 a g s γ f 1 e 0 a h 0 w 0 d α where s r 0 and w 0 represent the initial values if the materials are initially saturated s r 0 1 with fluids over the entire configuration and skeleton particles are very loosely lapped over each other then w 0 g s e 0 and a very small and constant distribution of terzaghi s effective stress could be assumed as σ ˇ v 0 0 k p a thus the initial fluid pressure 31 u f a 0 σ v a 0 σ ˇ v 0 σ v a 0 3 numerical scheme for both sets of equation s the primary unknowns are mapped over the initial fixed configuration leading to a total lagrangian formulation without requiring the actual large deformation of the computational configuration to be updated the coordinate mapping adds geometric nonlinearity to the equation coefficients in addition to material nonlinearity two different nonlinear finite element solutions are developed for these two sets of equations s which will also be compared with an existing finite difference solution from unsatcon developed by the authors qi et al 2017a qi et al 2017b the aim of these mutual verifications is to consolidate the fact that different numerical schemes for different equation s will literally yield identical yet accurate results for the same physical problem the main distinct features of the three numerical solutions are briefed below the first set of equations eqs 17a and 17b with the independent pair of σ v and s are solved using the commercial scripted equations solver flexpde 2019 which processes the partial differential equations symbolically after discretization the two equations are assembled into one single set of coupling matrix equations and solved stimulatingly by a conjugate gradient solver for a fully coupled solution the nonlinear coefficients are treated by a modified newton raphson procedure a petrov galerkin weighting process is applied to eliminate the solution oscillations caused by the first order convection terms in both equations the calculation errors are continually monitored by a timestep controller which automatically adjusts the timestep size to guarantee the accuracy the second set of equation with the independent of w is solved using a finite element code developed by the authors based on the fortran code in smith and griffiths 2013 for the small strain consolidation of saturated materials when applying the galerkin discretization the term c w 2 is treated as a conservative flux source term and singled out via the integration by parts which is consequently associated with a first derivation of the test function after each iteration the σ v increments are first computed via eq 30 to update the other variables s r e s through constitutive integration appendices c and b and to evaluate the equation coefficients c w 1 c w 2 at the gauss points for the next iteration noted that this is not an interlaced procedure for solving flow and equilibrium equations sequentially over a time step integration of eq 7b is only for the local constitutive integration the single governing eq 27 alone can yield a global hydro mechanical coupled solution as elaborated above during its derivation the third code unsatcon also uses the lagrangian description for all physical variables but discretizes the governing equations in the convection ξ coordinate system with a finite difference procedure thus the node coordinates must be constantly updated to track the motion of the solid skeleton during calculation different from the numerical integrations of the incremental constitutive equations in the above two solutions the integrated closed form of constitutive equations are directly solved by a specially designed algorithm which is found to be efficient for the majority of the sophisticated including elastic plastic constitutive models for unsaturated poromaterials qi et al 2020 4 skeleton shrinkage model for the skeleton deformation of a porous material undergoing sustained drying the most distinctive feature is the marked volumetric contraction but only to a shrinkage limit beyond which its stiffness in response to capillary pressure tends to diverge we have attempted to assimilate the shrinkage modelling in unsatcon with two categories of constitutive models e g the state surface model based on two independent stresses vu and fredlund 2006 and the glasgow coupled model based on bishop s effective stress wheeler et al 2003 the former requires calibrating a high number of empirical constants from samples that must subject to various stress paths and the latter imitates shrinkage limit by the elastic branch of the elastic plastic framework in that a faster rate of drying included hardening than bishop s stress growing must be fine tuned for simplicity we propose herein a model fig 2 a to simulate the vanishing compressibility under sustained drying by d e d ln σ v σ v d e d σ v λ 1 e r n 32 e r 0 s r 1 e 00 e e 00 e f s r 1 where λ is the slope of virgin compression line in the e ln σ v diagram indicating the compressibility as per convention in saturated soil mechanics its validity extends over the capillary range until the air entry value and its calibration can be easily performed over the corresponding range of data for example the thickened tailings data in fig 2 b daliri 2013 where the points for s r 1 were excluded in fitting e 00 is the void ratio corresponding to onset of desaturation which depends on the overburden stress or depth as will be discussed later once desaturation starts λ is scaled down by a factor of 1 e r n where e r is the distance of e 00 e normalized by e 00 e f where e f is the shrinkage void ratio the scaling factor varies progressively from 1 to 0 and the new model therefore respects two essential physical limits the compressibility matches the value of λ in the limit of s r 1 and vanishes asymptotically towards the shrinkage limit fig 2 a the exponent n controls the rate of volume shrinkage to e f which is the only additional parameter that requiring extra calibration due to the use of σ v n must be calibrated in conjunction with the retention parameters or with a pre calibrated e dependent retention model the latter is adopted herein for illustrating the model sensitivity to n for the same thickened tailings the modified van genuchten model eq c2 has been calibrated previously by the authors qi 2017 and refer also to table 2 fig 2 b shows that the shrinkage rate increases with n the retention trajectory travels from one isochoric drying curve to another of the underlying retention model with decreasing e fig 2 c consequently for highest n the simulated retention trajectory is on the rightmost side and ceases at the wettest state when reaching e f for this case the experimental σ v was lower than its actual value over the suction range of 100 kpa due to cavitation leading to difficulty in obtaining the best fit n value fig 2 b however the simulated shrinkage state i e w at e f is quite sensitive to n which can be readily identified from the shrinkage curve e v s w that can be measured much more accurately for instance in this way n 7 is determined for a shrinkage limit of w 17 3 for this tailings sample fig 2 d 5 numerical performance 5 1 numerical verification 5 1 1 configuration and material the laboratory column test of the same gold tailings daliri 2013 which has been simulated with the unsatcon qi et al 2020 was re simulated with the two new large deformation models for consolidation of unsaturated porous materials mutual verifications will be made by comparisons of not only different large deformation models but also different constitutive models for skeleton shrinkage the initial conditions were characterized by a uniform density distribution with voids were fully saturated with water throughout the configuration which can be set by eqs 30 and 31 as detailed in appendix d the subsequent consolidation dewatering process was divided into two stages wd consolidation in saturated conditions and ed dewatering in unsaturated conditions both stages can exist simultaneously in one simulation but within different elements the internal elements can be easily simulated from saturated to unsaturated state by changing the constitutive relations to update the coefficients of the governing equations one caveat here is that the smooth switching of boundary conditions is important for the full stage simulation when the supernatant water was completely depleted by evaporation see table 1 in unsatcon this boundary treatment is rather simple as the skeleton surface position is tracked naturally in the updated lagrangian formulation however for the two new models in the fixed space additional codes are required to record the time history of the supernatant water thickness i e the time integration of the rate difference between wd outflows and actual evaporation the numerical configuration is h 0 0 18 m e 0 1 0982 g s 2 89 potential evaporation rate 9 92 mm day and table 2 summarizes the parameters for constitutive models 5 1 2 inter large deformation model comparison due to the nonexistence of analytical solution the simulation accuracy is first examined by comparing the results from different models with the same sets of constitutive models in which eq c1 in table 2 was used for the skeleton deformation fig 3 a shows that in the 1st wd stage the simulated water outflow rates ofs across the surface from the three models are almost identical which further divides the wd stage into two substages when compared with the potential evaporation pe rate the supernatant water thickness first accumulates when of pe and then dissipates when of pe see fig 3 b it is interesting that the top inflow negative rate is observed from around 0 55 to 0 9 days in the second substage this is caused by the fact that the wd consolidation has essentially ceased and the imposed bottom drainage rate has induced a downward water migration throughout the entire domain the almost identical results demonstrate the correctness of the implementations of various boundary conditions in different formulations which is crucial for stage switch prediction a closer inspection indicates that the switch timing was predicted to be slightly earlier 7 6 min by the commercial fem script flexpde than the other two this difference is obviously not due to different mathematical descriptions for these models i e different coordinate systems equation independents or numerical methods since the fem fortran code and fdm unsatcon simulations which are based on the lagrangian a and convective ξ coordinate systems respectively predict very close switching timings this difference is however attributed to the numerical discretization errors in the flexpde an automatic mesh approach and adaptive time steps were utilized whereas both the node spacings number and time steps were fixed in the other two self developed codes for simplicity also eliminating this intrinsic numerical error seems to be unimportant for this case since it has no appreciable influence on subsequent predictions in the 2nd ed stage fig 3 c d shows that the differences in the average w and e from three simulations are 0 05 and 0 01 respectively which are imperceptible compared to the scattered experimental data the good agreements demonstrate that all the three models are accurate and can operate independently 5 1 3 inter skeleton deformation model comparison the skeleton deformation model proposed in section 4 was implemented through constitutive integration of eq 32 into the fem scheme based on eq 27 which was then applied to simulating the same column test fig 4 a shows that the predicted variations of average w and e display no observable deviations from those with the previous constitutive model i e eq c1 the point level predictions e g at the bottom and top ends in fig 4 b in terms of various constitutive paths also demonstrate good agreements between models noted that the void ratio e 00 from which the element starts to desaturate is depth dependent and is programmatically determined as the drying front gradually penetrates deeper before the arrival of drying front the element volume contracts due to fluid escape and is controlled by terzaghi s effective stress σ v u f thus an element at deeper location will be subjected to more volumetric contraction under higher σ v from the same initial state further the denser state at deeper location implies a higher air entry value and therefore a delayed desaturation according to the e dependent retention model this mutual promotion mechanism explains the smaller e 00 at deeper depth fig 4 c in other words the new skeleton model predicts naturally the depth dependent shrinkage paths fig 4 b c being more conforming to the reality whereas the six parameter empirical model of eq c1 does not embrace any path history dependent feature and the predicted volume contraction depends simply on the current stress levels overall the new model offers a much greater flexibility and capability for shrinkage modelling with only two easily calibrated constants which will be further explored in the following parametric analysis more importantly although the governing equations are compatible with arbitrary constitutive models the non integrable eq 32 is difficult to be implemented in some commercial scripted differential equation solvers in view of this only the self written fem scheme based on eq 27 will be applied in the subsequent analyses 5 2 parametric study the consolidation dewatering behaviors of a porous material deposit are constitutively dominated by the coupling responses of its two constituent materials i e the deformation of the skeleton and flow of the pore fluid the coupling is affected internally by the solid particle compositions and the pore structures vick 1990 aubertin et al 1996 mizani 2010 heidarian 2012 and externally by the actual evaporative driving force fredlund et al 2016 the latter is altered not only by the local environment but also the surface ground conditions in this section these influencing factors are investigated by changing the most relevant and controlling parameters including λ and n for skeleton deformation β and m for fluid flow and the actual evaporation ae rate the parametrical studies in section 5 2 1 to 5 2 3 are performed based on the measured shrinkage behavior of a residual soil mixed with different contents of fine sands krisdani et al 2008 the numerical configuration is h 0 0 2 m g s 2 65 e 0 2 slurry table 3 lists the other input parameters similar to the saturated case gibson et al 1967 the average degree of consolidation is defined in terms of settlement as 33 u s t h 0 0 ξ h 0 t 1 d ξ h 0 0 ξ h 0 1 d ξ 0 h 0 e 0 e a t d a 0 h 0 e 0 e f d a where refers to the final state corresponding to the limiting e f in addition the average degree of dewatering is defined in terms of relative water mass loss as 34 u w t 0 h 0 w 0 w a t d a 0 h 0 w 0 d a note that it is assumed that the water could be completely lost in eq 34 which is only theoretically possible for a thin deposit under extremely dry conditions in practice the flow will be restricted when water becomes discontinuous at low s r close to the ground surface thus u w t can never reach unity 5 2 1 effects of evaporation the evaporation is essentially a thermodynamic process involving water vapor and turbulent diffusion in the air overlying the surface which however has not been integrated into the proposed models as such an estimated time dependent ae rate must be imposed at the top boundary for making reasonable predictions for practical applications the wilson penman ae model wilson 1990 was used herein 35 a e p e γ η γ η exp 10 δ ψ g w m γ f r u 273 15 t s where ψ osmotic suction matric suction and osmotic component is neglected in our model η psychrometric constant 0 06733 kpa w m molecular mass of water 0 018 kg mol r u universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k γ slope of saturation vapor pressure versus temperature curve in kpa which depends on the value of surface temperature t s in and δ suction adjustment factor eq 35 gives the relationship between relative evaporation and suction by combining penman s equation for pe depending on local meteorological factors with lord kelvin s equation for relative humidity in the surficial ground the lord kelvin s equation i e the exponential part in eq 35 was derived based on the thermodynamic equilibrium principle at the evaporative plane that was assumed to remain in the vicinity of ground surface this assumption however contradicts the fact that the evaporative plane gradually recedes to deeper depths and the top unsaturated materials will exert an evaporative resistance unlike the pe contingent on the meteorological parameters the resistance mechanism is closely associated the material internal features e g pore structure salinity water retention and conductivity which are empirically considered through adjusting suction by a factor of 10 δ the complicated resistance mechanism challenges selection of δ for example the formula δ lg 3000 s r e s where s r e s is the residual suction suggested by fredlund et al 2016 has led to reasonable predictions of the average s r variation over time on one shrinkage test in krisdani et al 2008 when being combined with the large strain consolidation model fig 5 a but yielded an overestimated evaporation rate fig 5 b for the column test of daliri 2013 the overestimation for the latter case was due to the higher evaporative resistance from the surface salinity which implies a larger δ thus the parametric analyses were conducted by using different combinations of δ and pe values fig 6 a as the pe boundary on a 0 2 m high porous stratum fig 6 b c shows that for the same pe 10 mm day varying δ results in no differences in the predicted u w and u s until the imposed ae starts to deviate from pe at the respective s r as δ increases the value of s r for this deviation also increases fig 6 a and the dewatering consolidation ends up earlier with lower u w u s and suction fig 6 b c d the non thoroughness of dewatering consolidation for larger δ case is due to that the ae vanishes at larger s r in the surface element for practical implications smaller values of δ are usually observed in clayey materials for which the evaporation has a more prolonged effect for the same δ 2 decreasing the pe will delay the wd ed stage switching point since it requires longer times to consume the supernatant water as a result the time required to reach the same u w and u s is approximately doubled when pe is halved fig 6 b c however all cases for the same δ value will reach the same u w and u s sooner or later depending on pe finally the predictions with supernatant decantation are also included as the dashed curves which gradually approach the respective predictions for the no decantation cases despite no delay of the stage switch for lower pe cases 5 2 2 effects of compressibility the effects of the skeleton stiffness in fully and partially saturated conditions are investigated by varying λ and n respectively the pre adopted reference λ 0 15 represents the average stiffness of the saturated granitic residual soils in krisdani et al 2008 according to the regression model that correlates compressibility with atterberg limits and e 0 han et al 2022 however λ depends also on many other factors which for instance might increase remarkably with increasing fines content carrera et al 2011 hu et al 2017 thus four values of λ range 0 1 to 0 2 lying in the 95 confidence interval from the regression analysis by han et al 2022 were used in the parametric study fig 7 a shows that as expected a lower saturated stiffness i e larger λ leads to a denser state i e higher u s and u w at the end of wd stage consequently a larger amount of supernatant water needs longer evaporative time when ae pe resulting in a delayed onset of desaturation nevertheless this delay does not have a profound or subversive influence on the subsequent ed stage i e a larger λ will always lead to a higher u s throughout the process the reasons are twofold i u s itself is higher before the start of the ed stage ii the ae is also higher for a larger λ the latter is the result of sophisticated coupling between the skeleton volumetric and water flow behaviors a rough explanation is that the denser skeleton structure for larger λ implies a higher s r and a lower s given approximately the same amount of w see fig 7 b therefore a higher ae is expected according to wilson 1990 s model i e eq 35 likewise the pre adopted reference n 4 provides an average stiffness of the granitic residual soils under capillary stress whose value is also affected by many factors for instance a much stiffer response smaller n and lower plasticity was observed in krisdani et al 2008 for a lower fine content sample the parametric results show that the value of n over the studied range only has a limited and insignificant influence on u s and u w respectively in the second half of the ed stage i e when u s 0 6 these differences in u s may also be attributed to the sophisticated coupling as explained above despite smaller differences compared to those from varying λ the time span required to reach a high degree of consolidation e g u s 0 95 for smaller n is still noticeably longer than for larger n noting that fig 7 c is plotted in log time scale 5 2 3 effects of permeability as with the deformation model the adopted permeability model comprises two components k s e and k r s r for saturated and unsaturated conditions whose variations with e and s r are controlled by β and m respectively see appendix c thus β and m were varied in separate groups of analyses to distinguish their influences ghezzehei et al 2007 geng and yu 2017 fig 8 a b shows the input k s e and k k s s r relationships for the considered ranges of β and m respectively note that k s is normalized by α which equals k s at e 1 fig 9 illustrates that varying β only affects the wd stage the consolidation rate increases with increasing β because a larger β gives a higher k for the ranges of e 1 44 1 47 in this stage as marked in fig 8 a the wd stage ends up with the same values of u w and u s which are dictated by terzaghi s effective stress induced by the same weight through the same skeleton deformation model therefore in all varying β cases the same amounts of supernatant water should have been accumulated and require the same lengths of time to fully evaporate for ae pe before desaturation consequently the ed stages start after the same time elapsed from identical initial configuration settings i e same depth distribution of all physical quantities thus there are no differences in u w and u s after onset of desaturation fig 10 a illustrates that varying m only affects the ed stage to be more precise there are differences only when u w 0 7 or u s 0 9 from which the dewatering consolidation rate decreases with decreasing m this is attributed to lower ae rates for smaller m cases the desaturation penetrates gradually downward from the surface and a smaller m will amplify the permeability difference between the top lower s r and bottom higher s r zones a higher hydraulic gradient has been stimulated to compensate the blocking effect of the top lower k zone on the upward water migration to fulfill the ae needs near the surface thus the non uniformity of the depth profile of s must be more significant for smaller m cases this will in turn augment the non uniformity of depth profile of s r and therefore of k as the dewatering proceeds fig 10 b c compares the depth profiles of s and s r for varying m cases at two same values of u w 0 5 0 7 a higher s or lower s r at the surface will cause ae attenuation and limit the ed forces for smaller m cases see fig 10 d showing ae over time for different m cases it appears that larger volumetric compressions under higher capillary stresses near the surface would also reduce the water transport ability see fig 8 a and further augment the non uniformity this influence however is considered to be secondary compared to the smaller m for practical implications smaller values of m are usually observed in clayey soils since its pore structural feature likely increases the flow resistances at lower s r which is dominated by the adsorbed film flow corner flow and vapor diffusion ghezzehei et al 2007 5 2 4 depth of drying front lastly the development of drying front was investigated under different evaporation conditions and for different permeability at the engineering scale h 0 2 0 m is used herein for illustration based on the case in table 2 the depth of the drying front d d f which marks the interface between saturated and unsaturated zones is graphically shown through two simplified diagrams in fig 11 a numerically we use the depth at which the suction reaches the nominal air entry value 1 φ e ψ see eq c2 gallipoli 2012 as d d f fig 11 a b shows that the time histories of d d f and ae at different pes are divided by two segments by an clear cusp at a characteristic d d f similar to the experimental results shahraeeni et al 2012 in the first stage the drying front first penetrates rapidly into the porous medium under the effect of high ae and then stabilizes toward the characteristic d d f with the rapid decay of ae as the surface s r decreases the shallow capillary can maintain continuous viscous flow above characteristic d d f in this stage the cusp indicates that s r at surface reaches a critical value hayek 2015 and the surface water transport changes from viscous flow to vapor diffusion in the second stage an accelerate decreases of k r after the critical s r fig 8 b results in a larger suction gradient fig 10 c to satisfy the needs of ae thus the fast penetration of d d f is reactivated which re stabilizes eventually as the ae 0 it can be found that pe only changes the onset and duration of these two stages without affecting the characteristic and final values of d d f which are controlled by the coupling of the permeability evaporation and retention models or et al 2013 the relationship between ae and d d f is given in fig 11 c d to explore the influences of the evaporation and permeability on the predicted d d f large δ in the evaporation model implies a high evaporation resistance at the surface e g coarse soil and saline soil which will impede the penetration of the drying front however the final d d f is not significantly affected by δ except for the cases with ultra high evaporation resistance e g δ 3 when δ 3 ae decays to zero before the characteristic d d f is reached so that the final d d f is smaller than the other cases the value of m for relative permeability has a significant effect on d d f fig 11 d especially after the characteristic d d f under the same evaporation conditions a smaller m leads to a larger gradient of s r near the surface e g fig 10 b and the resulting sharp change in permeability along the depth will hinder the internal water transport and lead to the stabilization of the final drying front at a shallower depth when ae 0 in particular for m 0 2 the penetration of drying front is limited to the first stage and the final d d f only approaches its characteristic value 6 conclusions based on gibson s large deformation theory and poromechanics for unsaturated porous medium the one dimensional consolidation theory that couples the large deformation of the skeleton to saturated unsaturated fluid flow are derived through mapping the momentum mass balance equations from current convective to initial lagrangian coordinate systems and by incorporating the general incremental form of nonlinear constitutive models for unsaturated materials as such the geometric nonlinearity through equation mapping is superimposed on the material nonlinearity the theory is presented by two different forms of governing equations depending on the primary independents σ v u w total vertical stress pore fluid pressure and w gravimetric water content both in the fixed configuration two finite element codes with distinct features are developed to deal with the dual nonlinearity embedded in the equation coefficients and to provide diverse solutions for mutual validations the loose constraints on the forms of constitutive laws imply that the derived formulation has a strong capability to be compatible with arbitrary constitutive models e g the two parameter incremental model for the skeleton deformation the two finite element formulations are applied to a tailings column test which has been simulated by a finite difference solution to the governing equations in continually deforming configuration in a piece wise linear manner qi et al 2020 the inter formulation comparison demonstrates the inherent equivalence among three different formulations and the good accuracy of the associated numerical solutions to dealing with such a dual nonlinearity problem the present theories can very well capture the entire large deformation consolidation process and clearly distinguish between the weight driven wd saturated stage and the evaporation driven wd unsaturated stage by accurately tracking the variation of the supernatant thickness this indicates the new theories can naturally revert to the gibson s theory the effects of evaporation material s compressibility and permeability were parametrically studied the sub parameters in each of the three influencing elements which corresponds to saturated and unsaturated regimes respectively were found to independently affect the consolidation dewatering rates in the corresponding first wd and second ed stages respectively though the different parameters for saturated regime e g the saturated compressibility might have cascade effects on the consolidation dewatering degree in the subsequent ed stage and the sub parameters in both regimes will likely change concurrently with the material inherent structures the parametric results can still provide good references for understanding the large deformation consolidation process of a porous stratum under alternating saturated unsaturated conditions in addition the present numerical schemes do not have a rigorous coupling of evaporation processes but a robust evaporation model is successfully applied at different scales in particular the study of water transport in large scale simulations is an essential guidance for setting soil atmosphere boundaries in engineering applications in future research simulations of the response when changing more constitutive parameters are necessary and a greater focus on the coupling of surface evaporation resistance and cracking into the governing equations could produce interesting findings credit

2342,flood has long been known as one of the most catastrophic natural hazards worldwide mapping flood prone areas is an important part of flood disaster management in this study a flood susceptibility mapping framework was developed based on a novel integration of nature inspired algorithms into support vector regression svr to this end various remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis datasets were applied to the hybridized svr models to map flood susceptibility in ahwaz township iran the proposed framework has two main steps 1 updating the flood inventory historical flooded locations using the proposed rs based flood detection method developed within the google earth engine gee platform the mosaicked images of multi temporal sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar sar data have been used in this step 2 producing flood susceptibility map using the standalone svr and hybridized model of svr the hybridized methods were derived from a novel integration of svr with meta heuristic algorithms hence forming the svr bat algorithm svr ba svr invasive weed optimization svr iwo and svr firefly algorithm svr fa a spatial database of flood locations and 11 conditioning factors altitude slope angle aspect topographic wetness index stream power index normalized difference vegetation index ndvi distance to stream curvature rainfall soil type and land use cover were built for the susceptibility modelling the accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated using the statistical and sensitivity indices such as root mean square error rmse receiver operating characteristic roc and area under the roc curve auroc index the results indicated that all hybridized models outperformed the standalone svr according to auroc values the predictive power of the svr fa was the highest with the value of 0 81 followed by svr iwo svr ba and svr with values of 0 80 0 79 and 0 77 respectively keywords flood susceptibility mapping support vector regression svr nature inspired algorithms sar imagery remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flood is a natural disaster khosravi et al 2016 chen et al 2020 with many socio economic repercussions tien bui et al 2018 resulting in several other disasters such as erosion landslide and sinkholes arabameri et al 2019 therefore it is required to monitor floods using advanced techniques and develop accurate flood risk models samanta et al 2018b to decrease the negative socio economic effects of floods it is important for governors and decision makers to follow effective flood management plans the most important part of flood management plans is to use the most accurate methods to identify and model the flood prone areas within watersheds rahmati et al 2016b tien bui et al 2018 parsian et al 2021 contrary to flood prevention which is not entirely possible prediction of flood prone areas is practical bui et al 2016 falah et al 2019 in general methods used for flood susceptibility mapping can be categorized into four groups including physically based models multi criteria decision analysis statistical and machine learning liu et al 2021 the primary problem with physically based models in several areas like iran is that acquisition of various types of datasets is almost impractical due to many limitations shahabi et al 2020 physically based models often need a significant level of computation and enough expertise to consider proper hydrological parameters mosavi et al 2018 the multi criteria decision analysis methods such as the analytic hierarchy process are well known for their simplicity making them widely used for flood susceptibility assessment multi criteria decision analysis methods heavily rely on the judgement of experts hence the results can inevitably be accompanied by subjectivities and uncertainties de brito et al 2019 statistical methods generally include bivariate statistical analysis and multivariate statistical analysis liu et al 2021 the frequency ratio fr is one of the most popular statistical bivariate statistical analysis methods ranjgar et al 2021 which has frequently been used to estimate the influence of each class of factors on flooding logistic regression is also a common statistical multivariate statistical analysis method which can be used to determine the effect of conditioning factors on flooding the predicted variables in these statistical methods are based on linear assumptions while flood has generally been a phenomenon with a nonlinear structure liu et al 2021 the disadvantages of the physically based models multi criteria decision analysis and statistical models have led the researchers to use advanced data driven models such as machine learning algorithms for studies of flood susceptibility modelling mosavi et al 2018 the main reason that these models are more popular is because they can numerically formulate the complex nonlinearity of relationships between flood conditioning factors and flood potentiality among the machine learning methods the artificial neural network tiwari and chatterjee 2010 kim et al 2016 neuro fuzzy dineva et al 2014 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis pourghasemi et al 2019 optimization of the anfis tien bui et al 2018 random forest wang et al 2015 decision tree support vector machine svm suykens and vandewalle 1999 tehrany et al 2015a and support vector regression svr rahmati et al 2020 siam et al 2021 have been widely employed for producing flood susceptibility maps many studies have attempted to incorporate the metaheuristic algorithms into the aforementioned machine learning methods to introduce near optimal solutions ata reasonable computational cost for instance termeh et al 2018 investigated a combination of anfis with metaheuristic algorithms including ant colony optimization genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization pso for flood susceptibility mapping according to their results the ensemble of anfis pso was the superior model in their study area pourghasemi et al 2020 have also investigated the capabilities of combining anfis with four metaheuristicalgorithms to flood zoning and assessments their results indicated that their proposed ensemble approaches were useful for flood hazard management producing flood susceptibility maps using svm has increasingly been popular over recent years tehrany et al 2015a tehrany et al 2019b b the main reason is its generalization excellence choubin et al 2019 the issue of the generalization problem implicates how well the trained system can predict the cases that were not the targets of training liu et al 2021 therefore the generalization excellence helps to predict beyond the range of the training dataset moreover svm s independence from the subjective determination of weights as opposed to multi criteria decision analysis methods and its capability to work without a large number of model parameters as opposed to physically based models were the other reasons for its popularity svm has also been extended as a regression tool known as svr ansari and akhoondzadeh 2020 rahmati et al 2020 balogun et al 2021 generating flood susceptibility maps using svr models has frequently been reported to have successful results rahmati et al 2020 however the optimum determination of the svr parameters is difficult and important this challenge has led to the introduction of optimization based svr models the remarkable outcomes of many novel hybridized svr methods with regard to accuracy generalization uncertainty performance and robustness have been reported in the literature hong 2008 de moel et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 young et al 2017 historical flooded regions flood inventory maps are usually the foundation of flood susceptibility map generation samanta et al 2018b tehrany et al 2014 the flooded locations provided by field measurements are usually accurate however monitoring and modelling flood and flood related parameters using in situ data has many challenges such as the limited number of measurements coarse inadequate spatial distribution and outdated data due to such limitations quick large scale and fine resolution monitoring of the inundated areas using the traditional field measurements is almost impractical xu et al 2020 therefore updated flood inventory maps are required to publicly identify the vulnerable areas that would be endangered in the near future flood events the most practical way to quickly update a flood inventory is through remote sensing rs methods that use frequent near real time data ngo et al 2021 over recent years large scale hydrological data processing and accurate production of susceptibility maps have become feasible due to the recent developments in rs geographic information system gis machine learning and cloud computing services tien bui et al 2018 mahdavi et al 2019 shahabi et al 2020 large scale flood studies inevitably have to cope with a vast quantity of data processing and computational complexity shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 despite the significant advances in the rs field and the availability of time series datasets a major challenge is processing big geodata which can be resolved by cloud computing platforms such as the google earth engine gee mehravar et al 2021 the specific geographical climatic attributes of iran such as its large extent abrupt climate changes and spatially varying ranges of precipitation have intensively made it a flood prone country flood damage in iran has considerably increased over the past decades rahmati et al 2016a termeh et al 2018 panahi et al 2021 for example the latest major floods in iran which occurred in february and march 2019 have caused 78 dead people and economic losses of about 1 8 billion usd particularly in the city of ahwaz these floods have caused thousands of partial complete collapses of the structural systems and building shifts accordingly 13 villages went thoroughly under water therefore this study aims at flood susceptibility map production over the city of ahwaz iran as per the limitations of the current methods discussed above the present study used the bitemporal ground range detected grd product of sentinel 1 sar to update the outdated flood inventory maps in this regard a novel rs based method for large scale flood detection was developed in gee then a novel integration of svr with three nature inspired metaheuristic algorithms has been used to model flood susceptibility in ahwaz aiming to fine tune the parameters of the model svr was integrated with three metaheuristic optimization algorithms including bat algorithm ba invasive weed optimization iwo and firefly algorithm fa algorithms 2 study area and data 2 1 study area ahwaz is a city in the southwest ofiran fig 1 a with a population of about 1 300 000 the city has an average elevation of 11 m above sea level ahwaz has an average temperature of 25 degreesc and its average value of annual rainfall is 213 mm indicating an arid climate region the northern and central parts of ahwaz contain flat and fertile plains while its west and east halves have a considerable number of sandy hills an infertile dry plain is also extended from the south to the south westernmost areas many high risk riverine floods have occurred in this city over the recent years and the latest dates back to april 2016 february 2019 april 2019 and november 2020 respectively fig 1b one of the latest applications of rs as a flood warning system was the emergency declaration of the european commission s emergency response coordinate centre ercc on the 1st of april 2019 for the case of khuzestan province iran according to the ercc report heavy rainfall was expected within 24 h after the 1st of april 2019 leading to large amounts of water moving downstream into the province of khuzestan and potentially causing rivers to overflow their banks 2 2 datasets in this study the vv polarization of the sentinel 1 grd data with a spatial resolution of 10 m was used for flood mapping the grd products used in this study were two mosaicked images among which the first one corresponded to the time before the flood event mosaic of the images acquired on march 11th 2019 and march 24th 2019 the second one corresponded to the time of the sequential flood event mosaic of the images acquired on april 7th 2019 and april 16th 2019 in this study the flood map of the copernicus emergency management service website address https www erccportal jrc ec europa eu for the city of ahwaz for the same flood event was used to evaluate the accuracy of the produced flood maps 3 method the workflow of the proposed method fig 2 is divided into two main sections 1 the flood detection methodology for producing and updating flood inventory maps and 2 the modelling approach which was used for flood susceptibility map production in general the main steps of the proposed method are 1 an updated flood inventory map is generated using a novel flood detection method applied to sentinel 1 sar data within the gee platform section 3 1 2 a spatial database was formed using the produced flood inventory and the layers of the flood conditioning factors 3 the multi collinearity test and relieff algorithms were used to analyze the suitability and relative importance of the flood conditioning factors the frequency ratio fr model was then used to assess the effect of each flood conditioning factor on flood occurrences 4 the flood inventory derived from gee was categorized into training 70 and testing 30 samples 5 the training samples were utilized to optimize the parameters in the svr using the ba iwo and fa meta heuristic algorithms 6 the susceptibility maps were separately produced using the svr ba svr iwo svr and fa svr algorithms 7 the generated flood susceptibility maps were evaluated using root mean square error rmse and the receiver operating characteristic roc curves 3 1 updating the flood inventory using the proposed flood mapping algorithm the initial flood inventory map was obtained from two sources the first source was the historical flood locations provided by the local agricultural department these datasets include the locations that have frequently been affected by floods the second source was a flood map generated using the proposed method since the proposed flood mapping method benefits from the ready to use sentinel 1 datasets and processing power of gee https earthengine google com platform it can be a practical choice for mapping large floods which require heavy computation of massive data as depicted in fig 3 the proposed method for flood detection had five main steps 1 sar data preprocessing 2 change detection 3 water body detection 4 flood inventory generation and 5 validation these steps are briefly explained below in the first step two subsets of the same descending ascending sentinel 1 data were extracted from gee data collection pre flood sar image i 1 and post flood sar image i 2 afterwards the vv polarization of these images was employed for further processing of flood detection many studies in the literature have reported that slightly higher thematic accuracies could be obtained using the vv polarization instead of the vh polarization for flood mapping monitoring twele et al 2016 martinis et al 2018 this is mainly due to the better contrast between water and no water areas in the vv polarization data to reduce the intrinsic speckle effect of pre and post flood images i 1 v v and i 2 v v a smoothing filter with a window size of 7 7 was utilized in the second step a reliable binary change map of floods was produced by applying an appropriate decision function on a difference image to this end the bitemporal smoothed images of i 1 v v and i 2 v v were first utilized to generate three difference images generated by the normalized difference flood index cian et al 2018 log ratio index and mean ratio index moghimi et al 2017a as follow 1 m e a n r a t i o i n d e x 1 m i n mean σ 0 i 1 v v mean σ 0 i 2 v v mean σ 0 i 2 v v mean σ 0 i 1 v v 2 log r a t i o i n d e x ln σ 0 i 2 v v σ 0 i 1 v v ln σ 0 i 2 v v ln σ 0 i 1 v v 3 n o r m a l i z e d d i f f e r e n c e f l o o d i n d e x mean σ 0 i 1 v v m i n σ 0 i 1 v v σ 0 i 2 v v mean σ 0 i 1 v v m i n σ 0 i 1 v v σ 0 i 2 v v where mean and min refers to the local mean and minimum operators although the mean ratio index can well highlight the changed flooded regions it intensifies noise and artifacts on the other hand the log ratio index is usually robust to residual speckle effect owing to log transformation in converting the multiplicative noise to additive noise moghimi et al 2017b however the changed flooded regions and their boundaries are less highlighted in this index in addition to the advantages and disadvantages of the log ratio index and mean ratio index they do not completely embody the nature of the scattering behavior of sar images in detecting flooded regions in this regard the normalized difference flood index reflects more accurate structural information for flooded regions resulting in better differentiation of these areas than non smooth surfaces e g urban zones forests and agriculture cian et al 2018 this can be mainly due to the simultaneous use of ratio and minimum operators in the normalized difference flood index equation nevertheless noise like patterns anomalies are highlighted more in this index compared to the log ratio index resulting in a noisy change map moreover some geometrical details of changed flooded areas may be lost in the normalized difference flood index resulting in miss detection errors in general a single index cannot accurately demonstrate the information of the flooded regions and their geometric details aiming to address this issue we strengthen the normalized difference flood index by combining it with the log ratio index and the mean ratio index based on a simple operator the second root of multiplying to generate a single ideal difference index as the proposed method eq 4 using the proposed method flooded regions can be detected with better accuracy and anomalies can be lessened 4 p r o p o s e d m e t h o d m e a n r a t i o i n d e x l o g r a t i o i n d e x 2 n o r m a l i z e d d i f f e r e n c e f l o o d i n d e x in this study the proposed method was adjusted further using the srtm dem from pixels with slope values 5 subsequently a change map was produced by applying the k means algorithm macqueen 1967 with k 2 referring to change and no change classes to the refined difference index finally the surface water layer was excluded from the change map to generate an ideal map specialized for flood detection applications besides the flooded areas the change map might include the other land cover changes resulting in false detection the water body map derived from a post flood image should be masked from the change map to reduce such false alarms in this study the water body was first detected by applying otsu thresholding otsu 1979 on the post flood sar image i 2 v v the flood extent map was then produced by intersecting the change map and water body map then it was evaluated by the flood map provided by the copernicus emergency management service finally the flood inventory map was produced by adding new locations from the flood extent map to the historical flood points 3 2 flood conditioning factors the selection of the optimal flood conditioning factors is a prerequisite for producing flood susceptibility maps in this study based on the results of previous studies arabameri et al 2019 janizadeh et al 2019 kalantar et al 2021 11 flood conditioning factors fig 4 including altitude slope angle aspect topographic wetness index stream power index normalized difference vegetation index ndvi distance to stream curvature rainfall soil type and land cover were employed among the selected factors altitude is of considerable importance which has been reported to be a key factor in many previous studies tehrany et al 2014 dodangeh et al 2020 some of the aforementioned flood conditioning factors including altitude curvature distance to streams slope angle aspect stream power index and topographic wetness index were produced from the 30 m srtm dem the altitude range in the study area is very low 3 to178 m and the region is mostly covered by flat plains farmlands and bare lands the slope is an important factor that controls the velocity of water on the ground surface hence affecting the infiltration and runoff in fact the infiltration depth is high and the runoff is low wherever the slope is low al juaidi et al 2018 curvature has also been reported to have the potential to influence flood occurrences surface runoff and infiltration cao et al 2016 chapi et al 2017 the distance to stream factor is reported to have a substantial effect on flood extent and severity termeh et al 2018 the hydrological flood conditioning factors such as the stream power index and topographic wetness index also play a key role in the flood models since the stream power index can denote the potential of the stream to trigger erosion it plays an imperative role in terrain stability level hence being a widely used factor in most flood modelling studies the topographic wetness index can also be used to quantify the topographical impact on hydrological processes tehrany et al 2019a and it is computed by dividing the specific basin area by the region slope arora et al 2021 the topographic wetness index and stream power index have been calculated from dem in qgis using eq 5 and 6 5 t o p o g r a p h i c w e t n e s s i n d e x l n a s β 6 s t r e a m p o w e r i n d e x a s t a n β where a s shows the particular catchment area and β denotes the slope angle the stream power index indicates the erosive power of surface runoff in this study the land cover map of the study area with a spatial resolution of 10 m was used ghorbanian et al 2020 moreover the rainfall thematic layer was derived from the last decade of rainfall data in the region stations of the region heavy rainfall is reported to be the mainfactorforfloods occurrence samanta et al 2018a khosravi et al 2019a b the rainfall thematic layer was acquired from the khuzestan meteorological organization based upon the data over the 2010 2020 period provided from stations in the city of ahwaz the inverse distance weighted technique was applied in this study to interpolate rainfall values the soil type conditioning factor was also selected due to its noticeable effect on runoff risk since the infiltration of water mainly relies on soil texture the soil type can be an effective parameter for the activation of hydrological processes the soil type formation layer was obtained from the pedological map of ahwaz at 1 100 000 scale the soil data were classified into five classes including inceptisols dune lands entisols aridisols marsh and badlands according to the literature there is a negative relation between flooding and vegetation density therefore the ndvi can be considered an appropriate factor to show the relationship between flooding and vegetation in a basin the ndvi map of the study area was produced from the landsat 8 oli imagery for the year 2019 using eq 7 and its values varied between 0 6 and 0 91 7 n d v i nearinfrared r e d nearinfrared r e d 3 3 flood susceptibility modeling in this study the hybridization of svr and three metaheuristic algorithms of ba iwo mehrabian and lucas 2006 and fa yang 2009 were used for flood susceptibility modelling the ba iwo and fa were used to optimize the parameters of svr to obtain the optimized svr model the fr method was also employed to evaluate the effect of each flood conditioning factor on flood occurrences fr is a bivariate statistical method for estimating the probability relationship between dependent and independent factors which is commonly used in modeling of the environmental risks as a geostatistical assessment tool ranjgar et al 2021 the suitability and relative importance of these factors were analyzed using the multi collinearity test and relieff algorithm respectively 3 3 1 multi collinearity analysis multi collinearity among conditioning factors could cause a reduction in model performance accuracy due to the bias between variables it could lead saha et al 2021 in other words a multi collinearity test is necessary to determine the suitability of factors for modelling application the multi collinearity analysis is carried out using tolerance and variance inflation factor vif where values of tolerance less than 0 1 and a vif 10 signify the existence of collinearity among factors arabameri et al 2019 3 3 2 relieff feature selection method feature selection is a vital preprocessing stage in data mining applications especially when feature space has many variables the relief based approaches are the only filter based methods that are capable of identifying feature dependencies urbanowicz et al 2018 however the original relief method is scarcely used nowadays and has been substituted by relieff kononenko 1994 the f in relieff denotes that the algorithm is the sixth variation of the original algorithm this variation is the best known and most used relief based algorithm in practice up to date relieff is another algorithm similar to relieff that uses intermediate weights to compute the final predictor weights differently from relieff the details of this method can be found in robnik šikonja and kononenko 1997 3 3 3 optimization of svr with metaheuristics algorithms the values of the svr parameters have a significant impact on its prediction efficiency dodangeh et al 2020 panahi et al 2020 in this study ba fa and iwo were used as metaheuristic algorithms to improve the results of the svr algorithm and for fine tuning its parameters furthermore rmse eq 8 is used as the objective function that the optimization must minimize 8 r m s e i 1 n x o b s x p r e d 2 n where x obs is the target data x pred is the predicted value resulting from the considered flood susceptibility models moreover n is the total number of training or test datasets when the final conditions are met with the best output the optimization process stops otherwise the optimization of the parameters is repeated 3 4 validation 3 4 1 evaluation criteria for flood maps the reference flood map was generated by manual rectification of the flood map derived from the copernicus emergency management service aiming to do so the surface water was first omitted from the flood map of the copernicus emergency management service and then manually refined from noise and artefacts five evaluation metrics of the miss alarm rate p m a false alarm rate p f a total error rate p t e overall accuracy o a f1 score f 1 and kappa coefficient k a p see eq 9 15 which were calculated based on the reference flood map were employed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed flood detection method 9 p m a f p f p t n 100 10 p f a f n f n t p 100 11 p t e f n f p f n

number of non flooded pixels which were wrongly labelled as the flooded pixels and false negative fn denotes the number of flood pixels that were wrongly labelled as non flooded pixels moreover the number of flooded and flooded pixels which were correctly detected are respectively represented by t p true positive and t n true negative 3 4 2 modelling evaluation the rmse and the roc curves were used for the quantitative accuracy assessment of the fs models considering the binary pattern of the input modelling data 0 non flooded 1 flooded the rmse was calculated using eq 8 the area under the roc curve auroc is also a typical tool for evaluating the performance and prediction power of models farhangi et al 2020 razavi termeh et al 2020 auroc values range from 0 to 1 where the higher values represent more reliable and accurate model performance the qualitative relationship between auroc and prediction accuracy of the model can be categorized as follows 0 5 0 6 poor 0 6 0 7 moderate 0 7 0 8 good 0 8 0 9 very good and 0 9 1 excellent ranjgar et al 2021 shogrkhodaei et al 2021 4 results 4 1 flood detection results the visual comparison of the results of the proposed flood detection method normalized difference flood index log ratio index and mean ratio index shown in fig 5 indicated that the flooded areas in the mean ratio index image were more prominent than those obtained by other methods nevertheless it is dramatically affected by the noise and artefacts which can result in a high false detection in the final flood map fig 5c moreover although the log ratio index was more robust to anomalies it missed some parts of the flooded area and did not preserve its geometric details e g boundaries fig 5d in contrast the flooded areas were more prominent in the normalized difference flood index owing to basic insights into the backscattering behavior in its formula however the loss of geometrical details of the flooded area is still observed in the results of the normalized difference flood index fig 5e overall the proposed flood detection method which combines the normalized difference flood index with difference images obtained by the mean ratio index and log ratio index provided better discrimination between flooded and non flooded regions fig 5f for instance some changed areas that were discarded in the normalized difference flood index and difference images generated by the log ratio index were well highlighted in the results of the proposed method fig 5d f this can be mainly due to taking advantage of all mentioned difference images in the form of a single difference image which boosts the intensity of flood regions while reducing the noise the results of the proposed flood detection method were statistically compared with those of the recently proposed flood detection methods cian et al 2018 moharrami et al 2021 where the results are provided in table 1 and fig 6 as can be observed from table 1 the proposed method outperformed the normalized difference flood index and otsu based methods considering different accuracy measures for example the proposed method could respectively increase the overall accuracy f score and kappa by 0 7 5 and 5 51 compared to the normalized difference flood index however the performance of the proposed method on miss alarm is worse than that of the otsu based method meanwhile the otsu based method with an overall accuracy of 91 42 and a kappa coefficient of 63 12 achieved the worst accuracy among all methods in fact the lack of using the pre flood image in this method led to recognizing the lakes rivers and other smooth surfaces as flood areas and resulted in substantial false alarms 4 2 flood susceptibility mapping 4 2 1 multicollinearity test a multicollinearity test was performed to ensure that the regression assumptions in this study are correct the vif and tolerance were implemented to diagnose collinearity in multiple regression and to detect multicollinearity for each flood conditioning factor see table 2 it was observed that vif values for all factors were less than 1 8 indicating that the value of vif for all independent variables is free of a multicollinearity issue the vif score in table 2 denotes the strength of the correlation between the independent variables moreover the tolerance criterion with values 0 566 indicated satisfying results that confirmed the suitability of all selected flood conditioning factors for further analyses 4 2 2 feature selection using the relieff method the results of the relieff method indicating the importance level of the selected flood conditioning factors are shown in fig 7 feature weights or feature scores are a type of feature statistic that ranges from 1 the worst to 1 the best the results denoted that all 11 factors were appropriate to predict flood probabilities in this research in the flood model the aspect factor was the best predictor followed by distance to stream land cover ndvi rainfall topographic wetness index altitude soil slope and curvature 4 2 3 result of fr model the results of spatial interaction between the flood incidence and the selected flood conditioning factors were obtained using the fr model see table 3 on average fr values greater than one express larger correlations and vice versa termeh et al 2018 the analysis of the fr between flood and altitude indicated that the altitudes of the 24 41 m range had the largest fr values 1 77 all flood occurrences were also in altitudes less than 41 m as per the distance to stream factor the highest fr value was in the range of 0 200 m 1 73 and as distance to stream value increased the fr value declined considering the slope factor more than half of the flood events occurred within the range of 0 1 8 degrees with an fr value of 1 13 the ndvi with the least values within the range of 0 6 0 11 has the highest fr value of 2 25 the topographic wetness index class within the 12 75 16 range showed an fr value of 1 42 as the maximum correlation also by the increment of topographic wetness index values the fr values has increased regarding the stream power index the values belonging to the 20 40 class showed the largest fr furthermore floods occurrences showed drastic drops by the increase of the stream power index values according to the rainfall factor the highest 9 52 and lowest values of fr 0 42 was seen in the 259 7 mm and less than 163 86 mm classes respectively regarding the land lover factor farmlands and vegetation experienced the largest 105 and the smallest 1 number of floods respectively and water body class had the highest fr according to the soil factor most floods occurred in the entisols aridisols class while inceptisols had the highest fr value 3 07 in the case of the aspect factor an almost equal distribution of floods was observed in different directions and the n class had the highest fr value 1 29 4 2 4 flood susceptibility mapping using hybrid algorithms the locations of the flooded points needed for modelling were selected from both historical points and the flood detected areas obtained from the proposed rs based method in total 300 flood and 300 non flood points were selected for each flood and non flood group 70 of the data 210 points was randomly used for the modelling training procedure and 30 90 points was used for the validation the spatial distribution of the flood and non flood locations is shown in fig 8 after normalizing the weights derived from the fr model and assigning them to the factor classes all the input locations and their corresponding values of flood conditioning factors were imported into the matlab r2017b software according to the rmse results of the training and validation samples shown in table 4 svr fa with the rmse values of 0 3058 and 0 3538 for training and validation respectively outperformed the other algorithms followed by svr iwo 0 3177 0 3742 svr ba 0 333 0 3783 and svr 0 3602 0 3952 respectively the optimum parameters of the svr including c and γ were also calculated by setting an iteration process in each hybrid algorithm based on minimizing the rmse value as the optimization criterion the optimized parameters of the svr ba svr iwo and svr fa hybrid algorithms are also provided in table 4 the target and output values of the employed models for all flood samples are shown in fig 9 to display the levels of prediction error according to fig 9a the difference between the targets and outputs in the svr model was considerably greater than those of the hybrid methods this result is even worse in the case of validation samples indicating that the optimization algorithms could significantly improve the svr performance the highest overall accuracy of the 420 training samples was obtained by the svr fa model while the non optimized version of svr denoted the least level of correlation for the validation samples after conducting svr hybrid modelling with metaheuristics the outputs were transferred into the arcgis 10 3 software to produce the simulation results of the proposed hybrid methods based on the natural break classifier the classified flood susceptibility maps were divided into five susceptibility classes of very low low medium high and very high susceptibility levels termeh et al 2018 based on the results demonstrated in fig 10 all investigated models showed almost similar susceptibility maps e g approximately similar extent and spatial distribution of susceptibility classes the extent percentages of flood susceptibility classes obtained from the proposed models were summarized in table 5 compared to the other models the svr allocated a smaller number of pixels to the very low susceptibility class while showing the largest extent of low susceptible areas with 39 the svr fa as the more accurate model indicated that the susceptibility classes of very low low moderate high and very high roughly corresponded to 12 36 31 17 and 3 of the study area the percentages of such susceptibility classes for svr ba were 18 38 27 15 and 2 respectively similarly the corresponding percentages of svr iwo were 18 31 30 17 and 4 respectively considering all models almost a fifth of the entire study area was prone to high and very high flood susceptible classes 4 2 5 validation of flood susceptibility maps in general auroc values of 0 5 are usually known as the suitable range for validation purposes according to the roc curves fig 11 and auroc results table 6 all models indicated satisfying sensitivity results with auroc values 0 77 implying the fact that these models were appropriate for flood susceptibility analyses the predictive power of the svr fa was the highest with the auroc value of 0 806 which was followed by svr iwo svr ba and svr with the values of 0 802 0 793 and 0 774 respectively this indicated the high predictive performance of all three hybrid models compared to the standalone svr 5 discussion 5 1 impact of flood conditioning factors on flood the importance analysis of the flood related variables derived from the relieff method showed that the aspect distance to stream and land cover conditioning factors were respectively the most significant variables that contributed to the flood occurrence this is almost in contrast with the results reported by hong et al 2018 and razavi termeh et al 2018 the most important flood conditioning factors in the study conducted by hong et al 2018 were altitude topographic wetness index and distance from the river razavi termeh et al 2018 also reported that the slope rainfall and altitude were the most important factors contributing to the floods in their case study the reason why the aspect was more important in this study could be due to its indirect effect on the surface runoff through its impact on other factors like rainfall regime soil humidity and solar radiation the aspect showed that the largest extent of the study area was along the south direction followed by south east and south west this is consistent with results reported by regmi et al 2014 distance to stream is of high importance because those regions that are closer to streams and main rivers are obviously more prone to inundations and runoffs the significant role of distance to stream in flood occurrence has frequently been addressed in the literature i e danumah et al 2016 gigović et al 2017 the significance of land cover is because the land cover of an area determines its water infiltration rate the high contribution of land cover in flood occurrence found in this study could be justifiable since bare lands or scantily vegetated areas have been reported to be more susceptible to flooding due to their low percolation level and high runoff talha et al 2019 souissi et al 2020 as regards the land cover factor see table 3 the water body class farmlands and wetlands were respectively the most susceptible areas to flooding with the highest fr values regarding the land cover map a large portion of the water body and farmland classes was specifically located in the central northern regions of the study area where two of the main rivers dez and karoun enter ahwaz city this region is where the highly susceptible areas were located in the produced flood susceptibility maps larger changes in slope were also observed in such areas this could be a reason for the water runoff of the mentioned rivers the noticeable influence of the class of water bodies on flood susceptibility has also been addressed by paul et al 2019 and tella and balogun 2020 the farmlands at the river banks were observed at special risk of flood hazards presumably due to the frequent runoff occurrences in the vicinity of the main streams and tributaries moreover the low permeability and limited water infiltration of wetlands have the potential to lead to the maximum water capacity spillage or overflow after a series of rainfall events hence floating a large amount of water to downstream areas through surface flows as per the altitude factor the largest fr value was observed for the altitudes less than 24 m and the low altitudes of the region can be considered as the flood prone areas according to fig 10 very high susceptible areas of the susceptibility maps can be found in both high and low altitudes the topographic wetness index indicated that its larger values had the larger fr values large values of the topographic wetness index were reported to correspond to the regions that are prone to water accumulation and high runoff and indicate how low drainage representing more saturated land can trigger flash flooding swain et al 2020 the inverse relation between the stream power index and fr values was observed the stream power index delineates soil water content and erosion power of floods to flow downwards in a watershed hence some areas with the potential of flow accumulation are indicated by the lower values of the stream power index this was the reason why most floods in the study area occurred in places with lower values of the stream power index this inverse relation has also been addressed by swain et al 2020 in accordance with the ndvi values less than 0 11 were found to have higher fr indicating that regions with low vegetation levels were more flood prone and vice versa this relation is also addressed by bui et al 2019 5 2 analysis of flood maps considering the flood maps illustrated in fig 6 the maps produced by the otsu based method were considerably affected by noise and anomalies where plenty of surface water or water bodies were misclassified as flooded areas this limitation was well addressed by the normalized difference flood index and the proposed approach fig 6c f most of the flooded regions were accurately detected using the normalized difference flood index but with several false alarms compared to the proposed method moreover the geometrical details of the flood areas were more preserved by the proposed method fig 6c 6f this is probably due to a combination of change detection and water body detection in its process nevertheless multiple small flooded areas were missed in the maps generated by the normalized difference flood index and the proposed method which can be due to the lack of the contextual information used in the core of these methods fig 6c 6e and 7f in this study the remotely detected flood maps could provide the model input with numerous training points while traditionally made maps usually suffer from the inadequate spatial distribution of data points moreover since the employed sar data is not subject to clouds and atmospheric conditions the proposed method took advantage of multi temporal consistently available data 5 3 comparison of the flood susceptibility models based on figs 9 and 11 and table 6 the fa svr outperformed the other models while the non optimized svr was found as the weakest model although the final flood susceptibility maps of the hybrid models were in line with each other the standalone svr was relatively different the same results were observed for the level of prediction power of the models where the hybrid models showed a close performance see roc curves in fig 11 however svr had the lowest accuracy in predicting the same pattern the efficiency of the employed meta heuristic algorithms for optimization of the flood susceptibility maps has been addressed by khosravi et al 2018a b which is consistent with the results of this study the better predictive power of the hybridized svr models using meta heuristic algorithms was also approved by pourghasemi et al 2020 which was in line with the results of this study aiming at spatial modelling of urban flood inundation the efficiency of some hybridized integrated with a configuration of the wavelet transform grey wolf optimizer and bat optimizer and standalone svr models was evaluated by rahmati et al 2020 their results showed the superiority of the hybridized svr against the standalone svr models generally the high efficiency of hybridized svr models as a solution to linear and non linear problems has been reported for many practical problems especially flood susceptibility modelling saha et al 2021 siam et al 2021 many ensemble models that combine several single statistical or machine learning methods have proved effective in improving the flood mapping results i e shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 islam et al 2021 in this study the fa iwo and ba algorithms had the highest accuracy in optimizing the svr model respectively auto segmentation and the ability to handle a multi quality challenge are two of the fa algorithm s main advantages with the help of the fa algorithm the total population will be divided into subgroups with a mean interval and each group will be able to conquer an optimal location this division makes it possible to find the best one at a time unlike other meta heuristic algorithms the iwo permits all potential candidates to participate in the reproduction process one of the disadvantages of the iwo algorithm is the increase of computational time and convergence to local optimization ahmadi and mojallali 2012 the ba is simple flexible and easy to implement but this algorithm converges very quickly in the early stages and then slows down there is also no mathematical analysis for the relationship between the parameters and the convergence rate therefore in this study this algorithm was less accurate than the other two algorithms 5 4 comparison limitation and future work several approaches have so far been used for flood susceptibility mapping among of which the methods depending on the geomorphologic characteristics of a basin have frequently been employed in many studies nardi et al 2006 degiorgis et al 2012 samela et al 2018 although hydrogeomorphic methods extensively use dems and terrain analysis for preliminary floodplains characterizations accurate inundation flood mapping is generally based on advanced hydrologic and hydraulic modelling grimaldi et al 2013 ezzine et al 2020 these methods cannot replace hydrology and hydraulic modelling which are based on actual physical processes vojtek and vojteková 2019 the conventional hydrologic and hydraulic modeling approaches need various types of resources to collect the required data and run the models after appropriate calibration and validation in this regard some of the important data consist of dem soil land use river bathymetry hydrological data and details of man made structures along the intended reach this approach is commonly employed to create flood maps for individual river segments where such data is available or can be acquired through resources on the other hand flood maps generated through modeling can suffer from high level of uncertainty in data scarce areas jafarzadegan and merwade 2017 although the hydrologic and hydraulic modeling approach should always be the first priority for inundation flood mapping efforts the proposed method of this study could be employed as an alternate approach when the required data is limited or unavailable especially in large scale analysis or in developing countries a notable limitation of the proposed flood detection method could be the limited temporal resolution of satellite imagery because it can lead to missing the flood extent map at its peak time moreover another limitation of the proposed susceptibility mapping method is that it highly relies on the quality and precision of the flood conditioning factors which are usually provided from diverse sources in large scale flood susceptibility mapping tasks finding the optimal balance between the flood susceptibility model complexity and the accuracy and amount of the input data is generally challenging aiming to address this issue future studies can deal with the challenges related to data consolidation especially by improving their original scale resolution or generalization moreover rs data can be applied to hydrological and hydraulic modelling through three different scenarios 1 model input integration by providing information on the basin or boundary conditions 2 model calibration or parameter estimation and 3 data assimilation xu et al 2014 future studies can investigate novel capability integrations of hydrological modelling rs gis and geomorphology to provide accurate inferences about the dynamics of flooded areas and flood prone regions 6 conclusion flood is one of the most catastrophic phenomena in the world and is a drastic danger to many aspects of life aiming to mitigate human losses and flood damage producing a flood hazard susceptibility map is an important step in any flood management plan one challenge of susceptibility map generations in many countries is the lack of adequate and up to date field data to be used for the training step of machine learning methods moreover flood susceptibility map production is generally subject to two main components pace and accuracy in this study a combination of rs gee and gis capabilities were used to produce the required speed and accuracy in susceptibility map generations in this regard a novel rs based flood detection method along with three hybridized svr models was developed to automatically and quickly produce susceptibility maps the rmse results of the training and validation samples used in this study indicated that the svr fa could outperform the other models the evaluation of the prediction power of all models also showed that the svr fa was superior with a larger auroc value in general the weakest model was the standalone svr model which indicates the efficient impact of using the optimum svr parameters on modelling the flood susceptibility map results showed that the northern areas of ahwaz where a couple of main rivers and tributaries come together were the most vulnerable regions and farmlands were the high risk regions the produced flood susceptibility maps of this study can help the governors and planners water resources organizations environment related organizations and natural resource managers to take proper actions for flood damage reductions

2342,flood has long been known as one of the most catastrophic natural hazards worldwide mapping flood prone areas is an important part of flood disaster management in this study a flood susceptibility mapping framework was developed based on a novel integration of nature inspired algorithms into support vector regression svr to this end various remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis datasets were applied to the hybridized svr models to map flood susceptibility in ahwaz township iran the proposed framework has two main steps 1 updating the flood inventory historical flooded locations using the proposed rs based flood detection method developed within the google earth engine gee platform the mosaicked images of multi temporal sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar sar data have been used in this step 2 producing flood susceptibility map using the standalone svr and hybridized model of svr the hybridized methods were derived from a novel integration of svr with meta heuristic algorithms hence forming the svr bat algorithm svr ba svr invasive weed optimization svr iwo and svr firefly algorithm svr fa a spatial database of flood locations and 11 conditioning factors altitude slope angle aspect topographic wetness index stream power index normalized difference vegetation index ndvi distance to stream curvature rainfall soil type and land use cover were built for the susceptibility modelling the accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated using the statistical and sensitivity indices such as root mean square error rmse receiver operating characteristic roc and area under the roc curve auroc index the results indicated that all hybridized models outperformed the standalone svr according to auroc values the predictive power of the svr fa was the highest with the value of 0 81 followed by svr iwo svr ba and svr with values of 0 80 0 79 and 0 77 respectively keywords flood susceptibility mapping support vector regression svr nature inspired algorithms sar imagery remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flood is a natural disaster khosravi et al 2016 chen et al 2020 with many socio economic repercussions tien bui et al 2018 resulting in several other disasters such as erosion landslide and sinkholes arabameri et al 2019 therefore it is required to monitor floods using advanced techniques and develop accurate flood risk models samanta et al 2018b to decrease the negative socio economic effects of floods it is important for governors and decision makers to follow effective flood management plans the most important part of flood management plans is to use the most accurate methods to identify and model the flood prone areas within watersheds rahmati et al 2016b tien bui et al 2018 parsian et al 2021 contrary to flood prevention which is not entirely possible prediction of flood prone areas is practical bui et al 2016 falah et al 2019 in general methods used for flood susceptibility mapping can be categorized into four groups including physically based models multi criteria decision analysis statistical and machine learning liu et al 2021 the primary problem with physically based models in several areas like iran is that acquisition of various types of datasets is almost impractical due to many limitations shahabi et al 2020 physically based models often need a significant level of computation and enough expertise to consider proper hydrological parameters mosavi et al 2018 the multi criteria decision analysis methods such as the analytic hierarchy process are well known for their simplicity making them widely used for flood susceptibility assessment multi criteria decision analysis methods heavily rely on the judgement of experts hence the results can inevitably be accompanied by subjectivities and uncertainties de brito et al 2019 statistical methods generally include bivariate statistical analysis and multivariate statistical analysis liu et al 2021 the frequency ratio fr is one of the most popular statistical bivariate statistical analysis methods ranjgar et al 2021 which has frequently been used to estimate the influence of each class of factors on flooding logistic regression is also a common statistical multivariate statistical analysis method which can be used to determine the effect of conditioning factors on flooding the predicted variables in these statistical methods are based on linear assumptions while flood has generally been a phenomenon with a nonlinear structure liu et al 2021 the disadvantages of the physically based models multi criteria decision analysis and statistical models have led the researchers to use advanced data driven models such as machine learning algorithms for studies of flood susceptibility modelling mosavi et al 2018 the main reason that these models are more popular is because they can numerically formulate the complex nonlinearity of relationships between flood conditioning factors and flood potentiality among the machine learning methods the artificial neural network tiwari and chatterjee 2010 kim et al 2016 neuro fuzzy dineva et al 2014 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis pourghasemi et al 2019 optimization of the anfis tien bui et al 2018 random forest wang et al 2015 decision tree support vector machine svm suykens and vandewalle 1999 tehrany et al 2015a and support vector regression svr rahmati et al 2020 siam et al 2021 have been widely employed for producing flood susceptibility maps many studies have attempted to incorporate the metaheuristic algorithms into the aforementioned machine learning methods to introduce near optimal solutions ata reasonable computational cost for instance termeh et al 2018 investigated a combination of anfis with metaheuristic algorithms including ant colony optimization genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization pso for flood susceptibility mapping according to their results the ensemble of anfis pso was the superior model in their study area pourghasemi et al 2020 have also investigated the capabilities of combining anfis with four metaheuristicalgorithms to flood zoning and assessments their results indicated that their proposed ensemble approaches were useful for flood hazard management producing flood susceptibility maps using svm has increasingly been popular over recent years tehrany et al 2015a tehrany et al 2019b b the main reason is its generalization excellence choubin et al 2019 the issue of the generalization problem implicates how well the trained system can predict the cases that were not the targets of training liu et al 2021 therefore the generalization excellence helps to predict beyond the range of the training dataset moreover svm s independence from the subjective determination of weights as opposed to multi criteria decision analysis methods and its capability to work without a large number of model parameters as opposed to physically based models were the other reasons for its popularity svm has also been extended as a regression tool known as svr ansari and akhoondzadeh 2020 rahmati et al 2020 balogun et al 2021 generating flood susceptibility maps using svr models has frequently been reported to have successful results rahmati et al 2020 however the optimum determination of the svr parameters is difficult and important this challenge has led to the introduction of optimization based svr models the remarkable outcomes of many novel hybridized svr methods with regard to accuracy generalization uncertainty performance and robustness have been reported in the literature hong 2008 de moel et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 young et al 2017 historical flooded regions flood inventory maps are usually the foundation of flood susceptibility map generation samanta et al 2018b tehrany et al 2014 the flooded locations provided by field measurements are usually accurate however monitoring and modelling flood and flood related parameters using in situ data has many challenges such as the limited number of measurements coarse inadequate spatial distribution and outdated data due to such limitations quick large scale and fine resolution monitoring of the inundated areas using the traditional field measurements is almost impractical xu et al 2020 therefore updated flood inventory maps are required to publicly identify the vulnerable areas that would be endangered in the near future flood events the most practical way to quickly update a flood inventory is through remote sensing rs methods that use frequent near real time data ngo et al 2021 over recent years large scale hydrological data processing and accurate production of susceptibility maps have become feasible due to the recent developments in rs geographic information system gis machine learning and cloud computing services tien bui et al 2018 mahdavi et al 2019 shahabi et al 2020 large scale flood studies inevitably have to cope with a vast quantity of data processing and computational complexity shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 despite the significant advances in the rs field and the availability of time series datasets a major challenge is processing big geodata which can be resolved by cloud computing platforms such as the google earth engine gee mehravar et al 2021 the specific geographical climatic attributes of iran such as its large extent abrupt climate changes and spatially varying ranges of precipitation have intensively made it a flood prone country flood damage in iran has considerably increased over the past decades rahmati et al 2016a termeh et al 2018 panahi et al 2021 for example the latest major floods in iran which occurred in february and march 2019 have caused 78 dead people and economic losses of about 1 8 billion usd particularly in the city of ahwaz these floods have caused thousands of partial complete collapses of the structural systems and building shifts accordingly 13 villages went thoroughly under water therefore this study aims at flood susceptibility map production over the city of ahwaz iran as per the limitations of the current methods discussed above the present study used the bitemporal ground range detected grd product of sentinel 1 sar to update the outdated flood inventory maps in this regard a novel rs based method for large scale flood detection was developed in gee then a novel integration of svr with three nature inspired metaheuristic algorithms has been used to model flood susceptibility in ahwaz aiming to fine tune the parameters of the model svr was integrated with three metaheuristic optimization algorithms including bat algorithm ba invasive weed optimization iwo and firefly algorithm fa algorithms 2 study area and data 2 1 study area ahwaz is a city in the southwest ofiran fig 1 a with a population of about 1 300 000 the city has an average elevation of 11 m above sea level ahwaz has an average temperature of 25 degreesc and its average value of annual rainfall is 213 mm indicating an arid climate region the northern and central parts of ahwaz contain flat and fertile plains while its west and east halves have a considerable number of sandy hills an infertile dry plain is also extended from the south to the south westernmost areas many high risk riverine floods have occurred in this city over the recent years and the latest dates back to april 2016 february 2019 april 2019 and november 2020 respectively fig 1b one of the latest applications of rs as a flood warning system was the emergency declaration of the european commission s emergency response coordinate centre ercc on the 1st of april 2019 for the case of khuzestan province iran according to the ercc report heavy rainfall was expected within 24 h after the 1st of april 2019 leading to large amounts of water moving downstream into the province of khuzestan and potentially causing rivers to overflow their banks 2 2 datasets in this study the vv polarization of the sentinel 1 grd data with a spatial resolution of 10 m was used for flood mapping the grd products used in this study were two mosaicked images among which the first one corresponded to the time before the flood event mosaic of the images acquired on march 11th 2019 and march 24th 2019 the second one corresponded to the time of the sequential flood event mosaic of the images acquired on april 7th 2019 and april 16th 2019 in this study the flood map of the copernicus emergency management service website address https www erccportal jrc ec europa eu for the city of ahwaz for the same flood event was used to evaluate the accuracy of the produced flood maps 3 method the workflow of the proposed method fig 2 is divided into two main sections 1 the flood detection methodology for producing and updating flood inventory maps and 2 the modelling approach which was used for flood susceptibility map production in general the main steps of the proposed method are 1 an updated flood inventory map is generated using a novel flood detection method applied to sentinel 1 sar data within the gee platform section 3 1 2 a spatial database was formed using the produced flood inventory and the layers of the flood conditioning factors 3 the multi collinearity test and relieff algorithms were used to analyze the suitability and relative importance of the flood conditioning factors the frequency ratio fr model was then used to assess the effect of each flood conditioning factor on flood occurrences 4 the flood inventory derived from gee was categorized into training 70 and testing 30 samples 5 the training samples were utilized to optimize the parameters in the svr using the ba iwo and fa meta heuristic algorithms 6 the susceptibility maps were separately produced using the svr ba svr iwo svr and fa svr algorithms 7 the generated flood susceptibility maps were evaluated using root mean square error rmse and the receiver operating characteristic roc curves 3 1 updating the flood inventory using the proposed flood mapping algorithm the initial flood inventory map was obtained from two sources the first source was the historical flood locations provided by the local agricultural department these datasets include the locations that have frequently been affected by floods the second source was a flood map generated using the proposed method since the proposed flood mapping method benefits from the ready to use sentinel 1 datasets and processing power of gee https earthengine google com platform it can be a practical choice for mapping large floods which require heavy computation of massive data as depicted in fig 3 the proposed method for flood detection had five main steps 1 sar data preprocessing 2 change detection 3 water body detection 4 flood inventory generation and 5 validation these steps are briefly explained below in the first step two subsets of the same descending ascending sentinel 1 data were extracted from gee data collection pre flood sar image i 1 and post flood sar image i 2 afterwards the vv polarization of these images was employed for further processing of flood detection many studies in the literature have reported that slightly higher thematic accuracies could be obtained using the vv polarization instead of the vh polarization for flood mapping monitoring twele et al 2016 martinis et al 2018 this is mainly due to the better contrast between water and no water areas in the vv polarization data to reduce the intrinsic speckle effect of pre and post flood images i 1 v v and i 2 v v a smoothing filter with a window size of 7 7 was utilized in the second step a reliable binary change map of floods was produced by applying an appropriate decision function on a difference image to this end the bitemporal smoothed images of i 1 v v and i 2 v v were first utilized to generate three difference images generated by the normalized difference flood index cian et al 2018 log ratio index and mean ratio index moghimi et al 2017a as follow 1 m e a n r a t i o i n d e x 1 m i n mean σ 0 i 1 v v mean σ 0 i 2 v v mean σ 0 i 2 v v mean σ 0 i 1 v v 2 log r a t i o i n d

v v σ 0 i 2 v v where mean and min refers to the local mean and minimum operators although the mean ratio index can well highlight the changed flooded regions it intensifies noise and artifacts on the other hand the log ratio index is usually robust to residual speckle effect owing to log transformation in converting the multiplicative noise to additive noise moghimi et al 2017b however the changed flooded regions and their boundaries are less highlighted in this index in addition to the advantages and disadvantages of the log ratio index and mean ratio index they do not completely embody the nature of the scattering behavior of sar images in detecting flooded regions in this regard the normalized difference flood index reflects more accurate structural information for flooded regions resulting in better differentiation of these areas than non smooth surfaces e g urban zones forests and agriculture cian et al 2018 this can be mainly due to the simultaneous use of ratio and minimum operators in the normalized difference flood index equation nevertheless noise like patterns anomalies are highlighted more in this index compared to the log ratio index resulting in a noisy change map moreover some geometrical details of changed flooded areas may be lost in the normalized difference flood index resulting in miss detection errors in general a single index cannot accurately demonstrate the information of the flooded regions and their geometric details aiming to address this issue we strengthen the normalized difference flood index by combining it with the log ratio index and the mean ratio index based on a simple operator the second root of multiplying to generate a single ideal difference index as the proposed method eq 4 using the proposed method flooded regions can be detected with better accuracy and anomalies can be lessened 4 p r o p o s e d m e t h o d m e a n r a t i o i n d e x l o g r a t i o i n d e x 2 n o r m a l i z e d d i f f e r e n c e f l o o d i n d e x in this study the proposed method was adjusted further using the srtm dem from pixels with slope values 5 subsequently a change map was produced by applying the k means algorithm macqueen 1967 with k 2 referring to change and no change classes to the refined difference index finally the surface water layer was excluded from the change map to generate an ideal map specialized for flood detection applications besides the flooded areas the change map might include the other land cover changes resulting in false detection the water body map derived from a post flood image should be masked from the change map to reduce such false alarms in this study the water body was first detected by applying otsu thresholding otsu 1979 on the post flood sar image i 2 v v the flood extent map was then produced by intersecting the change map and water body map then it was evaluated by the flood map provided by the copernicus emergency management service finally the flood inventory map was produced by adding new locations from the flood extent map to the historical flood points 3 2 flood conditioning factors the selection of the optimal flood conditioning factors is a prerequisite for producing flood susceptibility maps in this study based on the results of previous studies arabameri et al 2019 janizadeh et al 2019 kalantar et al 2021 11 flood conditioning factors fig 4 including altitude slope angle aspect topographic wetness index stream power index normalized difference vegetation index ndvi distance to stream curvature rainfall soil type and land cover were employed among the selected factors altitude is of considerable importance which has been reported to be a key factor in many previous studies tehrany et al 2014 dodangeh et al 2020 some of the aforementioned flood conditioning factors including altitude curvature distance to streams slope angle aspect stream power index and topographic wetness index were produced from the 30 m srtm dem the altitude range in the study area is very low 3 to178 m and the region is mostly covered by flat plains farmlands and bare lands the slope is an important factor that controls the velocity of water on the ground surface hence affecting the infiltration and runoff in fact the infiltration depth is high and the runoff is low wherever the slope is low al juaidi et al 2018 curvature has also been reported to have the potential to influence flood occurrences surface runoff and infiltration cao et al 2016 chapi et al 2017 the distance to stream factor is reported to have a substantial effect on flood extent and severity termeh et al 2018 the hydrological flood conditioning factors such as the stream power index and topographic wetness index also play a key role in the flood models since the stream power index can denote the potential of the stream to trigger erosion it plays an imperative role in terrain stability level hence being a widely used factor in most flood modelling studies the topographic wetness index can also be used to quantify the topographical impact on hydrological processes tehrany et al 2019a and it is computed by dividing the specific basin area by the region slope arora et al 2021 the topographic wetness index and stream power index have been calculated from dem in qgis using eq 5 and 6 5 t o p o g r a p h i c w e t n e s s i n d e x l n a s β 6 s t r e a m p o w e r i n d e x a s t a n β where a s shows the particular catchment area and β denotes the slope angle the stream power index indicates the erosive power of surface runoff in this study the land cover map of the study area with a spatial resolution of 10 m was used ghorbanian et al 2020 moreover the rainfall thematic layer was derived from the last decade of rainfall data in the region stations of the region heavy rainfall is reported to be the mainfactorforfloods occurrence samanta et al 2018a khosravi et al 2019a b the rainfall thematic layer was acquired from the khuzestan meteorological organization based upon the data over the 2010 2020 period provided from stations in the city of ahwaz the inverse distance weighted technique was applied in this study to interpolate rainfall values the soil type conditioning factor was also selected due to its noticeable effect on runoff risk since the infiltration of water mainly relies on soil texture the soil type can be an effective parameter for the activation of hydrological processes the soil type formation layer was obtained from the pedological map of ahwaz at 1 100 000 scale the soil data were classified into five classes including inceptisols dune lands entisols aridisols marsh and badlands according to the literature there is a negative relation between flooding and vegetation density therefore the ndvi can be considered an appropriate factor to show the relationship between flooding and vegetation in a basin the ndvi map of the study area was produced from the landsat 8 oli imagery for the year 2019 using eq 7 and its values varied between 0 6 and 0 91 7 n d v i nearinfrared r e d nearinfrared r e d 3 3 flood susceptibility modeling in this study the hybridization of svr and three metaheuristic algorithms of ba iwo mehrabian and lucas 2006 and fa yang 2009 were used for flood susceptibility modelling the ba iwo and fa were used to optimize the parameters of svr to obtain the optimized svr model the fr method was also employed to evaluate the effect of each flood conditioning factor on flood occurrences fr is a bivariate statistical method for estimating the probability relationship between dependent and independent factors which is commonly used in modeling of the environmental risks as a geostatistical assessment tool ranjgar et al 2021 the suitability and relative importance of these factors were analyzed using the multi collinearity test and relieff algorithm respectively 3 3 1 multi collinearity analysis multi collinearity among conditioning factors could cause a reduction in model performance accuracy due to the bias between variables it could lead saha et al 2021 in other words a multi collinearity test is necessary to determine the suitability of factors for modelling application the multi collinearity analysis is carried out using tolerance and variance inflation factor vif where values of tolerance less than 0 1 and a vif 10 signify the existence of collinearity among factors arabameri et al 2019 3 3 2 relieff feature selection method feature selection is a vital preprocessing stage in data mining applications especially when feature space has many variables the relief based approaches are the only filter based methods that are capable of identifying feature dependencies urbanowicz et al 2018 however the original relief method is scarcely used nowadays and has been substituted by relieff kononenko 1994 the f in relieff denotes that the algorithm is the sixth variation of the original algorithm this variation is the best known and most used relief based algorithm in practice up to date relieff is another algorithm similar to relieff that uses intermediate weights to compute the final predictor weights differently from relieff the details of this method can be found in robnik šikonja and kononenko 1997 3 3 3 optimization of svr with metaheuristics algorithms the values of the svr parameters have a significant impact on its prediction efficiency dodangeh et al 2020 panahi et al 2020 in this study ba fa and iwo were used as metaheuristic algorithms to improve the results of the svr algorithm and for fine tuning its parameters furthermore rmse eq 8 is used as the objective function that the optimization must minimize 8 r m s e i 1 n x o b s x p r e d 2 n where x obs is the target data x pred is the predicted value resulting from the considered flood susceptibility models moreover n is the total number of training or test datasets when the final conditions are met with the best output the optimization process stops otherwise the optimization of the parameters is repeated 3 4 validation 3 4 1 evaluation criteria for flood maps the reference flood map was generated by manual rectification of the flood map derived from the copernicus emergency management service aiming to do so the surface water was first omitted from the flood map of the copernicus emergency management service and then manually refined from noise and artefacts five evaluation metrics of the miss alarm rate p m a false alarm rate p f a total error rate p t e overall accuracy o a f1 score f 1 and kappa coefficient k a p see eq 9 15 which were calculated based on the reference flood map were employed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed flood detection method 9 p m a f p f p t n 100 10 p f a f n f n t p 100 11 p t e f n f p f n

number of non flooded pixels which were wrongly labelled as the flooded pixels and false negative fn denotes the number of flood pixels that were wrongly labelled as non flooded pixels moreover the number of flooded and flooded pixels which were correctly detected are respectively represented by t p true positive and t n true negative 3 4 2 modelling evaluation the rmse and the roc curves were used for the quantitative accuracy assessment of the fs models considering the binary pattern of the input modelling data 0 non flooded 1 flooded the rmse was calculated using eq 8 the area under the roc curve auroc is also a typical tool for evaluating the performance and prediction power of models farhangi et al 2020 razavi termeh et al 2020 auroc values range from 0 to 1 where the higher values represent more reliable and accurate model performance the qualitative relationship between auroc and prediction accuracy of the model can be categorized as follows 0 5 0 6 poor 0 6 0 7 moderate 0 7 0 8 good 0 8 0 9 very good and 0 9 1 excellent ranjgar et al 2021 shogrkhodaei et al 2021 4 results 4 1 flood detection results the visual comparison of the results of the proposed flood detection method normalized difference flood index log ratio index and mean ratio index shown in fig 5 indicated that the flooded areas in the mean ratio index image were more prominent than those obtained by other methods nevertheless it is dramatically affected by the noise and artefacts which can result in a high false detection in the final flood map fig 5c moreover although the log ratio index was more robust to anomalies it missed some parts of the flooded area and did not preserve its geometric details e g boundaries fig 5d in contrast the flooded areas were more prominent in the normalized difference flood index owing to basic insights into the backscattering behavior in its formula however the loss of geometrical details of the flooded area is still observed in the results of the normalized difference flood index fig 5e overall the proposed flood detection method which combines the normalized difference flood index with difference images obtained by the mean ratio index and log ratio index provided better discrimination between flooded and non flooded regions fig 5f for instance some changed areas that were discarded in the normalized difference flood index and difference images generated by the log ratio index were well highlighted in the results of the proposed method fig 5d f this can be mainly due to taking advantage of all mentioned difference images in the form of a single difference image which boosts the intensity of flood regions while reducing the noise the results of the proposed flood detection method were statistically compared with those of the recently proposed flood detection methods cian et al 2018 moharrami et al 2021 where the results are provided in table 1 and fig 6 as can be observed from table 1 the proposed method outperformed the normalized difference flood index and otsu based methods considering different accuracy measures for example the proposed method could respectively increase the overall accuracy f score and kappa by 0 7 5 and 5 51 compared to the normalized difference flood index however the performance of the proposed method on miss alarm is worse than that of the otsu based method meanwhile the otsu based method with an overall accuracy of 91 42 and a kappa coefficient of 63 12 achieved the worst accuracy among all methods in fact the lack of using the pre flood image in this method led to recognizing the lakes rivers and other smooth surfaces as flood areas and resulted in substantial false alarms 4 2 flood susceptibility mapping 4 2 1 multicollinearity test a multicollinearity test was performed to ensure that the regression assumptions in this study are correct the vif and tolerance were implemented to diagnose collinearity in multiple regression and to detect multicollinearity for each flood conditioning factor see table 2 it was observed that vif values for all factors were less than 1 8 indicating that the value of vif for all independent variables is free of a multicollinearity issue the vif score in table 2 denotes the strength of the correlation between the independent variables moreover the tolerance criterion with values 0 566 indicated satisfying results that confirmed the suitability of all selected flood conditioning factors for further analyses 4 2 2 feature selection using the relieff method the results of the relieff method indicating the importance level of the selected flood conditioning factors are shown in fig 7 feature weights or feature scores are a type of feature statistic that ranges from 1 the worst to 1 the best the results denoted that all 11 factors were appropriate to predict flood probabilities in this research in the flood model the aspect factor was the best predictor followed by distance to stream land cover ndvi rainfall topographic wetness index altitude soil slope and curvature 4 2 3 result of fr model the results of spatial interaction between the flood incidence and the selected flood conditioning factors were obtained using the fr model see table 3 on average fr values greater than one express larger correlations and vice versa termeh et al 2018 the analysis of the fr between flood and altitude indicated that the altitudes of the 24 41 m range had the largest fr values 1 77 all flood occurrences were also in altitudes less than 41 m as per the distance to stream factor the highest fr value was in the range of 0 200 m 1 73 and as distance to stream value increased the fr value declined considering the slope factor more than half of the flood events occurred within the range of 0 1 8 degrees with an fr value of 1 13 the ndvi with the least values within the range of 0 6 0 11 has the highest fr value of 2 25 the topographic wetness index class within the 12 75 16 range showed an fr value of 1 42 as the maximum correlation also by the increment of topographic wetness index values the fr values has increased regarding the stream power index the values belonging to the 20 40 class showed the largest fr furthermore floods occurrences showed drastic drops by the increase of the stream power index values according to the rainfall factor the highest 9 52 and lowest values of fr 0 42 was seen in the 259 7 mm and less than 163 86 mm classes respectively regarding the land lover factor farmlands and vegetation experienced the largest 105 and the smallest 1 number of floods respectively and water body class had the highest fr according to the soil factor most floods occurred in the entisols aridisols class while inceptisols had the highest fr value 3 07 in the case of the aspect factor an almost equal distribution of floods was observed in different directions and the n class had the highest fr value 1 29 4 2 4 flood susceptibility mapping using hybrid algorithms the locations of the flooded points needed for modelling were selected from both historical points and the flood detected areas obtained from the proposed rs based method in total 300 flood and 300 non flood points were selected for each flood and non flood group 70 of the data 210 points was randomly used for the modelling training procedure and 30 90 points was used for the validation the spatial distribution of the flood and non flood locations is shown in fig 8 after normalizing the weights derived from the fr model and assigning them to the factor classes all the input locations and their corresponding values of flood conditioning factors were imported into the matlab r2017b software according to the rmse results of the training and validation samples shown in table 4 svr fa with the rmse values of 0 3058 and 0 3538 for training and validation respectively outperformed the other algorithms followed by svr iwo 0 3177 0 3742 svr ba 0 333 0 3783 and svr 0 3602 0 3952 respectively the optimum parameters of the svr including c and γ were also calculated by setting an iteration process in each hybrid algorithm based on minimizing the rmse value as the optimization criterion the optimized parameters of the svr ba svr iwo and svr fa hybrid algorithms are also provided in table 4 the target and output values of the employed models for all flood samples are shown in fig 9 to display the levels of prediction error according to fig 9a the difference between the targets and outputs in the svr model was considerably greater than those of the hybrid methods this result is even worse in the case of validation samples indicating that the optimization algorithms could significantly improve the svr performance the highest overall accuracy of the 420 training samples was obtained by the svr fa model while the non optimized version of svr denoted the least level of correlation for the validation samples after conducting svr hybrid modelling with metaheuristics the outputs were transferred into the arcgis 10 3 software to produce the simulation results of the proposed hybrid methods based on the natural break classifier the classified flood susceptibility maps were divided into five susceptibility classes of very low low medium high and very high susceptibility levels termeh et al 2018 based on the results demonstrated in fig 10 all investigated models showed almost similar susceptibility maps e g approximately similar extent and spatial distribution of susceptibility classes the extent percentages of flood susceptibility classes obtained from the proposed models were summarized in table 5 compared to the other models the svr allocated a smaller number of pixels to the very low susceptibility class while showing the largest extent of low susceptible areas with 39 the svr fa as the more accurate model indicated that the susceptibility classes of very low low moderate high and very high roughly corresponded to 12 36 31 17 and 3 of the study area the percentages of such susceptibility classes for svr ba were 18 38 27 15 and 2 respectively similarly the corresponding percentages of svr iwo were 18 31 30 17 and 4 respectively considering all models almost a fifth of the entire study area was prone to high and very high flood susceptible classes 4 2 5 validation of flood susceptibility maps in general auroc values of 0 5 are usually known as the suitable range for validation purposes according to the roc curves fig 11 and auroc results table 6 all models indicated satisfying sensitivity results with auroc values 0 77 implying the fact that these models were appropriate for flood susceptibility analyses the predictive power of the svr fa was the highest with the auroc value of 0 806 which was followed by svr iwo svr ba and svr with the values of 0 802 0 793 and 0 774 respectively this indicated the high predictive performance of all three hybrid models compared to the standalone svr 5 discussion 5 1 impact of flood conditioning factors on flood the importance analysis of the flood related variables derived from the relieff method showed that the aspect distance to stream and land cover conditioning factors were respectively the most significant variables that contributed to the flood occurrence this is almost in contrast with the results reported by hong et al 2018 and razavi termeh et al 2018 the most important flood conditioning factors in the study conducted by hong et al 2018 were altitude topographic wetness index and distance from the river razavi termeh et al 2018 also reported that the slope rainfall and altitude were the most important factors contributing to the floods in their case study the reason why the aspect was more important in this study could be due to its indirect effect on the surface runoff through its impact on other factors like rainfall regime soil humidity and solar radiation the aspect showed that the largest extent of the study area was along the south direction followed by south east and south west this is consistent with results reported by regmi et al 2014 distance to stream is of high importance because those regions that are closer to streams and main rivers are obviously more prone to inundations and runoffs the significant role of distance to stream in flood occurrence has frequently been addressed in the literature i e danumah et al 2016 gigović et al 2017 the significance of land cover is because the land cover of an area determines its water infiltration rate the high contribution of land cover in flood occurrence found in this study could be justifiable since bare lands or scantily vegetated areas have been reported to be more susceptible to flooding due to their low percolation level and high runoff talha et al 2019 souissi et al 2020 as regards the land cover factor see table 3 the water body class farmlands and wetlands were respectively the most susceptible areas to flooding with the highest fr values regarding the land cover map a large portion of the water body and farmland classes was specifically located in the central northern regions of the study area where two of the main rivers dez and karoun enter ahwaz city this region is where the highly susceptible areas were located in the produced flood susceptibility maps larger changes in slope were also observed in such areas this could be a reason for the water runoff of the mentioned rivers the noticeable influence of the class of water bodies on flood susceptibility has also been addressed by paul et al 2019 and tella and balogun 2020 the farmlands at the river banks were observed at special risk of flood hazards presumably due to the frequent runoff occurrences in the vicinity of the main streams and tributaries moreover the low permeability and limited water infiltration of wetlands have the potential to lead to the maximum water capacity spillage or overflow after a series of rainfall events hence floating a large amount of water to downstream areas through surface flows as per the altitude factor the largest fr value was observed for the altitudes less than 24 m and the low altitudes of the region can be considered as the flood prone areas according to fig 10 very high susceptible areas of the susceptibility maps can be found in both high and low altitudes the topographic wetness index indicated that its larger values had the larger fr values large values of the topographic wetness index were reported to correspond to the regions that are prone to water accumulation and high runoff and indicate how low drainage representing more saturated land can trigger flash flooding swain et al 2020 the inverse relation between the stream power index and fr values was observed the stream power index delineates soil water content and erosion power of floods to flow downwards in a watershed hence some areas with the potential of flow accumulation are indicated by the lower values of the stream power index this was the reason why most floods in the study area occurred in places with lower values of the stream power index this inverse relation has also been addressed by swain et al 2020 in accordance with the ndvi values less than 0 11 were found to have higher fr indicating that regions with low vegetation levels were more flood prone and vice versa this relation is also addressed by bui et al 2019 5 2 analysis of flood maps considering the flood maps illustrated in fig 6 the maps produced by the otsu based method were considerably affected by noise and anomalies where plenty of surface water or water bodies were misclassified as flooded areas this limitation was well addressed by the normalized difference flood index and the proposed approach fig 6c f most of the flooded regions were accurately detected using the normalized difference flood index but with several false alarms compared to the proposed method moreover the geometrical details of the flood areas were more preserved by the proposed method fig 6c 6f this is probably due to a combination of change detection and water body detection in its process nevertheless multiple small flooded areas were missed in the maps generated by the normalized difference flood index and the proposed method which can be due to the lack of the contextual information used in the core of these methods fig 6c 6e and 7f in this study the remotely detected flood maps could provide the model input with numerous training points while traditionally made maps usually suffer from the inadequate spatial distribution of data points moreover since the employed sar data is not subject to clouds and atmospheric conditions the proposed method took advantage of multi temporal consistently available data 5 3 comparison of the flood susceptibility models based on figs 9 and 11 and table 6 the fa svr outperformed the other models while the non optimized svr was found as the weakest model although the final flood susceptibility maps of the hybrid models were in line with each other the standalone svr was relatively different the same results were observed for the level of prediction power of the models where the hybrid models showed a close performance see roc curves in fig 11 however svr had the lowest accuracy in predicting the same pattern the efficiency of the employed meta heuristic algorithms for optimization of the flood susceptibility maps has been addressed by khosravi et al 2018a b which is consistent with the results of this study the better predictive power of the hybridized svr models using meta heuristic algorithms was also approved by pourghasemi et al 2020 which was in line with the results of this study aiming at spatial modelling of urban flood inundation the efficiency of some hybridized integrated with a configuration of the wavelet transform grey wolf optimizer and bat optimizer and standalone svr models was evaluated by rahmati et al 2020 their results showed the superiority of the hybridized svr against the standalone svr models generally the high efficiency of hybridized svr models as a solution to linear and non linear problems has been reported for many practical problems especially flood susceptibility modelling saha et al 2021 siam et al 2021 many ensemble models that combine several single statistical or machine learning methods have proved effective in improving the flood mapping results i e shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 islam et al 2021 in this study the fa iwo and ba algorithms had the highest accuracy in optimizing the svr model respectively auto segmentation and the ability to handle a multi quality challenge are two of the fa algorithm s main advantages with the help of the fa algorithm the total population will be divided into subgroups with a mean interval and each group will be able to conquer an optimal location this division makes it possible to find the best one at a time unlike other meta heuristic algorithms the iwo permits all potential candidates to participate in the reproduction process one of the disadvantages of the iwo algorithm is the increase of computational time and convergence to local optimization ahmadi and mojallali 2012 the ba is simple flexible and easy to implement but this algorithm converges very quickly in the early stages and then slows down there is also no mathematical analysis for the relationship between the parameters and the convergence rate therefore in this study this algorithm was less accurate than the other two algorithms 5 4 comparison limitation and future work several approaches have so far been used for flood susceptibility mapping among of which the methods depending on the geomorphologic characteristics of a basin have frequently been employed in many studies nardi et al 2006 degiorgis et al 2012 samela et al 2018 although hydrogeomorphic methods extensively use dems and terrain analysis for preliminary floodplains characterizations accurate inundation flood mapping is generally based on advanced hydrologic and hydraulic modelling grimaldi et al 2013 ezzine et al 2020 these methods cannot replace hydrology and hydraulic modelling which are based on actual physical processes vojtek and vojteková 2019 the conventional hydrologic and hydraulic modeling approaches need various types of resources to collect the required data and run the models after appropriate calibration and validation in this regard some of the important data consist of dem soil land use river bathymetry hydrological data and details of man made structures along the intended reach this approach is commonly employed to create flood maps for individual river segments where such data is available or can be acquired through resources on the other hand flood maps generated through modeling can suffer from high level of uncertainty in data scarce areas jafarzadegan and merwade 2017 although the hydrologic and hydraulic modeling approach should always be the first priority for inundation flood mapping efforts the proposed method of this study could be employed as an alternate approach when the required data is limited or unavailable especially in large scale analysis or in developing countries a notable limitation of the proposed flood detection method could be the limited temporal resolution of satellite imagery because it can lead to missing the flood extent map at its peak time moreover another limitation of the proposed susceptibility mapping method is that it highly relies on the quality and precision of the flood conditioning factors which are usually provided from diverse sources in large scale flood susceptibility mapping tasks finding the optimal balance between the flood susceptibility model complexity and the accuracy and amount of the input data is generally challenging aiming to address this issue future studies can deal with the challenges related to data consolidation especially by improving their original scale resolution or generalization moreover rs data can be applied to hydrological and hydraulic modelling through three different scenarios 1 model input integration by providing information on the basin or boundary conditions 2 model calibration or parameter estimation and 3 data assimilation xu et al 2014 future studies can investigate novel capability integrations of hydrological modelling rs gis and geomorphology to provide accurate inferences about the dynamics of flooded areas and flood prone regions 6 conclusion flood is one of the most catastrophic phenomena in the world and is a drastic danger to many aspects of life aiming to mitigate human losses and flood damage producing a flood hazard susceptibility map is an important step in any flood management plan one challenge of susceptibility map generations in many countries is the lack of adequate and up to date field data to be used for the training step of machine learning methods moreover flood susceptibility map production is generally subject to two main components pace and accuracy in this study a combination of rs gee and gis capabilities were used to produce the required speed and accuracy in susceptibility map generations in this regard a novel rs based flood detection method along with three hybridized svr models was developed to automatically and quickly produce susceptibility maps the rmse results of the training and validation samples used in this study indicated that the svr fa could outperform the other models the evaluation of the prediction power of all models also showed that the svr fa was superior with a larger auroc value in general the weakest model was the standalone svr model which indicates the efficient impact of using the optimum svr parameters on modelling the flood susceptibility map results showed that the northern areas of ahwaz where a couple of main rivers and tributaries come together were the most vulnerable regions and farmlands were the high risk regions the produced flood susceptibility maps of this study can help the governors and planners water resources organizations environment related organizations and natural resource managers to take proper actions for flood damage reductions

2343,flow indicators based on daily flow data are commonly used to characterize the hydrologic regimes of rivers and to investigate links between flow and ecological condition discharge data measured at a daily timestep is considered essential for such investigations because there is an underlying premise that longer timesteps e g monthly are not suitable for capturing the variability in flow behaviour of most relevance to ecologically important processes this paper investigates this assumption by examining the information content of daily and monthly streamflow data for a diversity of perennial intermittent and ephemeral flow regimes across australia using a novel approach of comparing daily and monthly flow indicators rather than observed flow timeseries results show that many flow indicators derived using daily and monthly data are strongly correlated spearman ρ greater than 0 9 partial least squares regression shows that the majority of daily flow indicators can be predicted using monthly flow indicators and that as few as six monthly flow indicators can be used to estimate a wide range of daily flow characteristics including those relating to flow magnitudes and durations of high and low flow events daily indicators relating to the frequency and seasonal timing of high and low flows cannot be predicted as accurately r2 between 0 4 and 0 9 suggesting that information on these facets of the flow regime is partially lost when aggregating to a monthly timestep results from this study point to the utility of monthly based flow indicators in river ecology

its related fields freeman et al 2022 poff and zimmerman 2010 richter et al 1996 flow statistics also known as flow indicators are a common tool for describing specific facets of the observed flow

sensitive to combinations of specific facets of a flow regime such as the magnitude of early autumn pulses or the duration of floodplain inundation events over a range of timescales from sub daily to

2018 even in areas relatively well serviced by streamflow gauges the observed data is likely to be affected by upstream diversions and impoundments may only be representative of a small proportion of the overall stream network or a limited range of environmental contexts or else may only provide information on a limited period of record grabs 2009 krabbenhoft et al 2022 an additional challenge is that many studies use observed flow ecology responses to predict ecological conditions under future conditions but future flow scenarios are also often unavailable at a daily resolution most studies address these challenges by using some form of streamflow modelling such as rainfall runoff modelling or water resource modelling allowing both synthesis of daily flow patterns and estimation of flows for future scenarios typically these models use a daily timestep john et al 2021 providing the level of detail assumed necessary for ecological inferences however there are some well recognized drawbacks shorter timesteps such as daily often result in poorer performance during model calibration engel et al 2007 moriasi et al 1983 and significantly increased processing time wang et al 2011 also shorter timestep rainfall runoff models are often calibrated with a specific aspect of the flow regime in mind such as peak flows or low flows and this may lead to poorer model performance with respect to other parts of the flow regime euser et al 2013 john et al 2021 in addition inputs to models may be unreliable at a daily scale such as global climate model rainfall simulations adla et al 2019 or water resource operational data such as dam inflows consumptive extraction rules or pumping rates developing streamflow models on a weekly or monthly timestep may be a more viable option for several reasons first model input data is often more available and or reliable at longer timesteps and other model inputs such as climate or river operations data are frequently more robust at longer timesteps this improved data availability and quality combined with smaller datasets can lead to greater ease of data infilling and preparation better model optimization and reduced computational intensity helgeson et al 2021 second the outputs of longer timestep models can usually be post processed to obtain daily information many approaches are available to synthesize a daily flow series from monthly streamflow data such as spatio temporal disaggregation hughes and slaughter 2015 john et al 2021 slaughter et al 2015 and stochastic methods rebora et al 2016 or else information on the daily flow exceedances can be inferred from monthly flow exceedances smakhtin 2000 despite these potential advantages longer timestep data is rarely used for flow ecology research largely due to the implicit assumption that it is unable to capture the short duration variability which is essential for ecosystems in many waterways freeman et al 2022 as seen in the example timeseries plot in fig 1 daily data provides significantly more information about flow variability than the monthly data such as the timing and duration of freshes or pulses rates of rise and fall or the duration of low flow spells riverine ecosystems often depend on these kinds of short term characteristics for a range of functions such as breeding signals or habitat maintenance freeman et al 2022 poff and zimmerman 2010 in essence there is a logical belief that information about short duration flow variability is lost within longer timesteps rendering it unhelpful for understanding ecological responses to hydrologic conditions this study investigates the defensibility of that premise exploring whether and if so how much of the flow regime information represented by the daily flow indices are also present in monthly indices using a novel approach of comparing daily and monthly flow indicators rather than flow timeseries we assess whether monthly data can be used as an alternative to daily data for the purposes of characterising daily flow regimes this is most useful in areas which are data poor and daily flow timeseries are more difficult to synthesize but where established suites of flow indicators need to be applied it is important to note that this study is not primarily attempting to predict daily flow indicators rather it tests whether the daily flow regime is essentially captured or described in longer timestep data we examine whether monthly indicators can be used to characterize the major facets of the daily flow regime including flow magnitude duration frequency timing of low and high flow events and rates of rise and fall in a way which can assist with ecological research and sustainable flow management we do this for a diversity of perennial intermittent and ephemeral rivers across australia this range of river systems is representative of the types of river systems that are seen globally with the exception of significant snow melt systems we use multivariate prediction of individual daily indicators to explore which major facets of the daily flow regime are retained in monthly data we also address issues of redundancy to identify which monthly flow indicators explain the most variation in daily indicators 2 data and methods the approach to this study focuses on comparing flow indicators calculated using daily data with those based on monthly data using daily streamflow records for sites across australia we initially calculate daily flow indicators for each site next we aggregate the flow data to a monthly timestep and repeat the calculations using a subset of the indicators where it is possible to adapt them to monthly input various statistical approaches are used to assess correlations between daily and monthly indicators to predict daily indicators using monthly data and finally to determine which monthly indicators are most useful to describe daily flow behaviour for the purposes of this study the terms monthly flow and daily flow refer to the total discharge flowing past a point in a waterway during a calendar day or month respectively 2 1 streamflow data streamflow data is sourced from a set of 467 sites around australia available from the bureau of meteorology bureau of meteorology 2020 all sites are relatively unregulated with at least 30 years of continuous daily data with records for most sites ending in early 2019 all sites in the database have a maximum of 5 missing observations and are available with missing data fully infilled using the gr4j rainfall runoff model perrin et al 2003 for this study all records are adjusted to only include full calendar years some sites with extremely low annual runoff are excluded resulting in 456 sites used in subsequent analyses fig 2 while this is an australia wide dataset there is a greater representation of sites along the east coast with additional small clusters in the south west and in the north there also appears to be a tendency toward larger catchments in central and north western regions hydrological classification of sites is applied fig 2 to gain a better understanding of whether relationships between monthly and daily flow indicators vary according to flow regime type the flow regime categories are predicted from the model of kennard et al 2010b based on many of the same gauges 2 2 flow indicators many suites of flow indicators exist henriksen et al 2006 kennard et al 2010b richter et al 1996 vogel et al 2007 and many approaches have been developed for using these indicators to assess flow regime alteration and ecological threats jumani et al 2020 for this study we adopt the suite of 171 indicators originally collated by olden and poff 2003 and adapted by henriksen et al 2006 however several modifications to the indicator calculation methods are required to address inconsistencies between previous studies in addition many of these indicators were developed in northern america and europe without consideration of highly ephemeral rivers accordingly some indicators are adjusted to accommodate ephemeral rivers with a high proportion of zero flow days please refer to supplementary material for further details not all indicators can be meaningfully converted to a monthly timestep an issue which has been noted in other studies where monthly indicators have been trialled laizé et al 2014 pumo et al 2018 some are effectively identical with a monthly or daily timestep such as the mean annual discharge some indicators are not quite identical yet translate well to a monthly timestep such as the mean annual maximum daily discharge which corresponds to the mean annual maximum monthly discharge other indicators translate poorly to a monthly timestep such as the average daily rate of rise which corresponds to the average monthly rate of rise the latter having little practical meaning of the 171 daily indicators adopted for this study 115 can be meaningfully converted to a monthly calculation or were already in a monthly format two indicators based on circular statistics are replaced with their sine and cosine components giving 173 daily and 117 monthly indicators overall the complete list of indicators and their definitions is given in supplementary material all indicators are consolidated into manageable categories table 1 based on different facets of the flow regime as proposed by olden and poff 2003 namely magnitude average low high frequency low high duration low high timing and rate of change 2 3 statistical analysis simple correlation techniques are used to assess the direct associations between pairs of monthly and daily indicators fig 3 initially correlation is assessed between matching pairs of daily and monthly indicators such as ma1 daily and ma1 monthly next correlations are assessed between all non matching pairs of indicators such as ma1 daily and ra6 monthly many of the indicators have highly non normal distributions so the rank based spearman ρ is an appropriate correlation statistic which helps to moderate the effect of outliers partial least squares regression is applied to predict daily indicators for each site based on monthly indicator values fig 4 it has been previously established that the available indicators contain a high degree of collinearity and redundancy gao et al 2009 olden and poff 2003 making traditional regression techniques unsuitable partial least squares regression plsr sometimes known as projection to latent structures regression vinzi et al 2010 wold et al 2001 is a technique which can identify links between two datasets while also directly addressing the challenges of collinearity and redundancy it is the ability to simultaneously undertake regression and eliminate the existing collinearity in the flow indicators which makes this an ideal technique the inputs to the plsr model are the values for all 173 daily indicators and 117 monthly indicators representing the dependant and independent variables respectively in effect the model is constructed to predict all 173 daily indicators based on 117 monthly indicators pre processing with either box cox or yeo johnson transformations followed by z score calculation ensures that data for each indicator is as close to normally distributed as possible validation and performance testing is undertaken using 10 fold cross validation james et al 2021 a model validation technique similar to bootstrapping with each fold consisting of 10 of sites selected randomly the plsr model was calibrated to 20 components conceptually similar to principal components with each representing an independent function of the monthly indicators which explain most of the variance of the daily indicators these 20 components are then used in a regression model to estimate the daily indicators the estimated daily indicators produced by the model are compared with the observed daily indicators to calculate r2 and rmse performance statistics for more details of the plsr model inputs calibration and performance statistics refer to supplementary material we use the loadings from the plsr analysis fig 4 to identify a small subset of monthly indicators which contain the most information about daily flow behaviour we use two different approaches to achieve this but in both cases analyse the first 6 of the 20 model components because the calibration process demonstrates that these explain the majority of daily regime variability refer to supplementary material for calibration details we identify the monthly indicator with the highest loading for each of the first 6 components this is a common technique often used with principal component analysis to eliminate redundancy gao et al 2009 john et al 2021 monk et al 2007 olden and poff 2003 as an alternative approach we also identify monthly indicators with the highest aggregate loading across the first 6 components combined in effect we are finding monthly indicators which are relevant across multiple components not just a single component 3 results 3 1 associations between daily and monthly indicators indicators based on observed monthly data had moderate to strong correlations with their equivalent based on observed daily data in the majority of cases fig 5 of the 117 monthly indicators 76 89 have spearman rank correlations with their daily counterpart greater than 0 6 and 54 63 have correlations exceeding 0 9 some daily monthly indicator pairs demonstrated weaker associations within the average magnitude ma category the group of 12 indicators with the weakest correlations all relate to monthly variability e g variability in january flows within the high flow duration dh category the indicators describing magnitude and variability of higher flows tend to have stronger correlations while indicators describing the duration of high flow events tend to have weaker correlations indicators within the low flow frequency fl and high flow frequency fh categories typically show weaker correlations example comparisons demonstrate different types of associations between daily and monthly indicators and the spearman correlation obtained in each case fig 6 all correlations between matching monthly and daily indicator pairs were found to be statistically significant with p values effectively equal to zero p 0 0001 in most cases refer to supplementary material for full results the highest p value obtained was 0 0054 for indicator fl1 suggesting that even this weak correlation result is unlikely to be the result of random noise there are strong correlations between many daily and monthly indicators not just directly matching pairs although this varies between different facets of the flow regime the color highlighting of the diagonal of the cross correlation matrix fig 7 is formed by many strong correlations previously observed between matching indicator pairs fig 5 beyond the diagonal there are numerous moderate to strong correlations with indicators relating to flow magnitude ma ml mh low flow event durations dl and rates of rise and fall ra conversely there are fewer moderate to strong correlations with indicators relating to low and high flow event frequency fl fh and seasonal timing ta tl th suggesting both a lack of redundancy as well as a lack of association between these monthly and daily indicators also there are many daily indicators columns and monthly indicators rows with similar correlation patterns providing a visual representation of redundancy between indicators gao et al 2009 monk et al 2007 olden and poff 2003 relationships between daily and monthly indicators are complex with most daily indicators fig 7 columns showing relationships with numerous monthly indicators fig 7 rows this demonstrates that there are often several monthly indicators that correlate with each daily indicator and could potentially be used to predict daily values although some indicators could not be calculated using a monthly timestep the daily flow behavior they represent is not necessarily lost for example there are a number of daily indicators fig 7 columns in the low and high flow magnitude ml and mh categories which could not be calculated at a monthly timestep yet these indicators have moderate to strong correlations with other monthly indicators fig 7 rows notably the rates of rise and fall ra category has no equivalent monthly indicators yet includes some moderate to strong correlations suggesting that information about this aspect of short term daily flow variability is well represented in the monthly flow regime 3 2 estimation of daily indicators the partial least squares regression pslr model was able to predict daily indices from monthly data reasonably well with the proportion of variance explained r2 greater than 60 for more than 90 of daily flow indicators although the strength of predictions varied between different facets of the flow regime fig 8 the poorest model performance was for the low and high frequency categories fl and fh where the prediction error rmse and the variance explained r2 were generally poorer than any other category however the model performance for these categories is still considered moderate to strong with r2 typically between 0 55 and 0 85 suggesting that around 55 to 85 of daily flow information is captured in the monthly data other categories had better results although with considerable scatter the model performance for the indicators in the rates of rise and fall ra category are notable given that they have no monthly equivalent where these indicators were predicted with an r2 of typically 0 75 to 0 85 suggesting that around 75 to 85 of this facet of daily flow information is present in the monthly data uncertainty in model performance was assessed by comparing the performance metrics across each of the 10 validation folds a technique similar to bootstrapping this showed that the variance explained r2 and prediction error rmse were very consistent across the majority of indicators for the overall model with all sites and indicators combined the variance in the r2 results across the 10 folds showed that monthly flow indicators contain between approximately 82 and 86 of the information contained in the daily flow data refer to supplementary material for full results model performance was evaluated separately for individual sites fig 9 there is considerable scatter in the variance explained r2 at each site however the majority of sites have r2 values greater than 0 6 there is a trend toward larger prediction error rmse for more intermittent sites although the variance explained r2 remains broadly similar to other flow regime types we trialled separate plsr models for intermittent rivers however this did not improve model performance see supplementary material model performance is generally good for most sites across australia fig 10 while trends for poorer model performance are indistinct the majority of sites with lower variance explained r2 appear to be clustered in the south east and south west of the continent and many sites in central and north western australia appear to have larger prediction error rmse given the relatively small numbers of sites in several regions these spatial trends are unlikely to be statistically significant however they are suggestive of several possible issues which may be influencing model performance such as flow regime class very large catchment areas or differences in regional climate other catchment characteristics such as vegetation geology and terrain may also have influence the first 6 components of the plsr model were found to explain most 80 of the variability in daily flow behaviour refer supplementary material the monthly indicators with the highest individual loadings in each of those 6 components were identified table 2 also monthly indicators with the highest sum of loadings across the first 6 components combined were identified table 3 mean monthly flows ma12 ma23 feature prominently in both lists along with fh1 however remaining indicators differ for example the first indicator in table 2 is ma9 describing the spread of flows however there is no indicator in table 3 which relates to the spread of flows 4 discussion it is commonly assumed that streamflow data at a monthly timestep is unable to capture information about daily flow behaviour especially as it relates to short duration variability although this is rarely stated explicitly this paper aimed to test this assumption by evaluating statistical associations between monthly and daily hydrological indicators for a diversity of perennial intermittent and ephemeral flow regimes the analysis comparing pairs of monthly and daily indicators showed that over three quarters of 117 monthly indicators demonstrated strong correlations with their daily equivalent spearman rank correlations greater than 0 60 it also revealed that many indicators relating to daily variability and the frequency and duration of short term flow events correlated poorly with monthly indicators ρ 0 6 fig 5 short duration flow variability such as frequency of high flow events showed little correlation with their monthly equivalent however when we applied multivariate models we found that daily flow characteristics could be predicted at least moderately well with a reasonable degree of variance explained r2 greater than 0 6 for most indicators this suggests that the daily flow information is still present in monthly data but is distributed amongst multiple monthly indicators and that multivariate techniques are required to extract it to better understand the physical basis of how a multivariate approach can help to estimate daily flow behaviour it is useful to examine hydroclimatological similarities between sites using the model regression results consider a single indicator as an example fh11 is the average number of events per year exceeding the 1 67 year ari peak flow for which there was a poor correlation ρ 0 22 between the daily and monthly indicators fig 5 using plsr the daily version of fh11 can be predicted with a moderate degree of variance explained r2 0 52 fig 8 indicating that 52 of the information in fh11 retained in the monthly data the regression coefficients β refer to supplementary material identify the most important monthly indicators for estimating the daily version of fh11 namely the average number of months between 1 67 year ari peak month events dh22 β 0 16 and the duration in months of low flow events below the 75 exceedance flow dl16 β 0 15 in short sites with a greater number of high flow events per year are likely to also have shorter intervals between high flow events and shorter durations of low flow events this combination of coefficients makes intuitive sense suggesting a flow regime with multiple high flow events each year leaving little scope for extended dry spells as a further example of the physical basis of how daily flow information is retained in monthly data consider the daily indicator ra1 it represents the rate of rise in flow as a proportion of the previous day averaged across all rising days there is no monthly equivalent and yet the plsr model predicted daily values of ra1 with 84 of variance explained r2 0 84 rmse 0 40 fig 8 the coefficients indicate that a high rate of rise can be expected at sites where the average duration of high flow events is short dh19 β 0 08 and where the variability in the number of zero flow days each year is high dl19 β 0 08 once again these links make intuitive sense providing a reasonable description of a flow regime with a flashy rainfall runoff response associated with short duration peak flow events and where even a modest rainfall event can produce a significant flow giving a variable number of zero flow days 5 limitations the plsr approach was less successful for some sites but the reasons are not clear looking beyond the simplest explanation of poor quality flow data it is possible that it reflects some inherent model limitations which could have implications for future work in general prediction error was poorer for sites with more ephemeral regimes fig 9 but the variance explained did not show this trend similarly spatial trends in prediction error did not appear to be reflected in the variance explained fig 10 however these trends in model performance exhibit considerable scatter making the causes difficult to identify patterns between sites with poorer prediction error suggest that flow regime class regional climate or sites with large catchment areas could be influencing model performance it is notable that the distribution of sites is not consistent across regions or across flow regime classes with study sites being dominated by perennial or partly ephemeral sites located along the eastern seaboard and relatively few sites in inland and north western australia where flow regimes are often highly ephemeral one possible explanation could be that the model has been developed with a dataset dominated by more perennial sites and therefore works best for sites with a similar flow regime clearly the model can only perform well for the types of flow regimes it has been calibrated with so careful selection of representative training sites is essential in addition the poorer prediction error in more ephemeral catchments may relate to the choice of indicators and how well they describe these flow regimes many of the flow indicators were originally sourced from studies undertaken for locations where waterways tend to be more perennial clausen et al 2000 clausen and biggs 1997 richards 1989 wood et al 2000 and were developed to capture key information about the flow regimes in these areas it is difficult to know whether the information captured by this particular suite of indicators is equally descriptive of the flow regime in locations where the flow regime is ephemeral with a high level of interannual variability such as inland and north western australia it is possible that the model may perform better at some sites with a different suite of indicators which have been tailored to characterise their typical flow regimes in essence information about daily flow behaviour may be present in monthly data but can only be extracted if the indicators have been carefully chosen to identify useful traits about the flow regimes present at the study sites the period of record available for the majority of sites in this study was at least 35 years but it is likely that model performance will be poorer with shorter records long term flow records can be difficult to obtain in many parts of the world grabs 2009 krabbenhoft et al 2022 and predictability of flow indicators has been shown to decrease with shorter lengths of record kennard et al 2010a it is therefore likely that model performance will also be poorer with shorter lengths of record but it is unclear whether this will be the case for all facets of the flow regime and for all classes of flow regime additional research is warranted to identify the effect of shorter periods of monthly records on their information content with respect to daily flow behaviour providing valuable guidance for situations where flow data is less comprehensive while this study has focused on waterways within australia it is reasonable to hypothesize that in principle monthly data is likely to contain considerable amounts of information about daily flow behaviour in many other parts of the world poff et al 2006 the variability of streamflow sites selected across australia is representative of the hydrological variability seen globally perhaps except for snow melt systems that said some of the more specific conclusions about individual indicators or facets of the flow regime are not easily transferable making it necessary to conduct a separate investigation to demonstrate the information content of monthly data in each region such a study would need to include enough sites with both observed daily and observed monthly flows to ensure correlations loadings and coefficients are statistically significant if the purpose of such a study was to obtain accurate predictions of daily flow behaviour with the eventual aim of applying predictions to data poor sites then it may also be useful to include additional independent variables such as climate vegetation terrain or geology which are likely to improve model performance by contextualizing the daily monthly associations while this study has shown that it is possible to extract daily flow statistics from monthly data without the need for synthesizing a daily flow sequence it remains unclear which approach provides more accurate estimates of daily flow characteristics the multivariate indicator approach adopted for this study involves significantly less effort and is less data intensive than calibrating daily rainfall runoff models for each site however further work is required to understand whether the multivariate approach produces more accurate predictions for some indicators or for individual facets of the flow regime 6 implications and conclusions this study demonstrates that monthly and daily indicators are strongly linked and that monthly indicators contain a considerable amount of information about daily flow behaviour it also shows that most of the variability in daily flow behaviour between sites can be represented with a small handful of monthly indicators the techniques used in this study provide a practical alternative to disaggregation of monthly model outputs or development of daily models we have shown that it is possible to extract daily flow statistics directly from monthly timeseries data without the need for synthesizing a daily flow sequence and the epistemic uncertainty that entails helgeson et al 2021 this has immediate ramifications for a wide range of studies including studies of hydrological threats to ecosystems laizé et al 2014 ruhí et al 2016 thompson et al 2014 and studies assessing impacts to flow regimes in monthly water resource models pumo et al 2018 schneider et al 2013 zimmerman et al 2018 although we have demonstrated the links between daily and monthly indicators there are also some important limitations not all indicators can be predicted equally well and indicators at some sites proved less predictable demonstrating that some daily flow regime information is lost at the monthly timestep the results we present are broadly applicable to most flow regimes found in australia but further work may be required for use with highly ephemeral sites or flow regimes such as snow melt dominated catchments which are not well represented within australia in any application the techniques we present will work best when the model is calibrated with flow data from representative sites using a suite of indicators carefully selected to best describe the key elements of the flow regime relevant to a particular study while traditional techniques of rainfall runoff modelling disaggregation and other daily flow synthesis techniques will continue to be essential tools in hydrological studies this study has shown the value of longer timestep data paving the way for a new approach which can play an important role in areas where daily data is poor or non existent helping to directly estimate daily behaviour without the intermediate step of

2343,flow indicators based on daily flow data are commonly used to characterize the hydrologic regimes of rivers and to investigate links between flow and ecological condition discharge data measured at a daily timestep is considered essential for such investigations because there is an underlying premise that longer timesteps e g monthly are not suitable for capturing the variability in flow behaviour of most relevance to ecologically important processes this paper investigates this assumption by examining the information content of daily and monthly streamflow data for a diversity of perennial intermittent and ephemeral flow regimes across australia using a novel approach of comparing daily and monthly flow indicators rather than observed flow timeseries results show that many flow indicators derived using daily and monthly data are strongly correlated spearman ρ greater than 0 9 partial least squares regression shows that the majority of daily flow indicators can be predicted using monthly flow indicators and that as few as six monthly flow indicators can be used to estimate a wide range of daily flow characteristics including those relating to flow magnitudes and durations of high and low flow events daily indicators relating to the frequency and seasonal timing of high and low flows cannot be predicted as accurately r2 between 0 4 and 0 9 suggesting that information on these facets of the flow regime is partially lost when aggregating to a monthly timestep results from this study point to the utility of monthly based flow indicators in river ecology

sensitive to combinations of specific facets of a flow regime such as the magnitude of early autumn pulses or the duration of floodplain inundation events over a range of timescales from sub daily to multi annual sofi et al 2020 consequently most established suites of indicators use flow timeseries data at a daily timestep as the basis for calculations eng et al 2017 jumani et al 2020 this standard requirement for daily flow data presents a major challenge because good quality observed daily streamflow data is not available for most sites around the world olden et al 2021 ruhi et al

the overall stream network or a limited range of environmental contexts or else may only provide information on a limited period of record grabs 2009 krabbenhoft et al 2022 an additional challenge is that many studies use observed flow ecology responses to predict ecological conditions under future conditions but future flow scenarios are also often unavailable at a daily resolution most studies address these challenges by using some form of streamflow modelling such as rainfall runoff modelling or water resource modelling allowing both synthesis of daily flow patterns and estimation of flows

sites ending in early 2019 all sites in the database have a maximum of 5 missing observations and are available with missing data fully infilled using the gr4j rainfall runoff model perrin et al 2003 for this study all records are adjusted to only include full calendar years some sites with extremely low annual runoff are excluded resulting in 456 sites used in subsequent analyses fig 2 while this is an australia wide dataset there is a greater representation of sites along the east coast with additional small clusters in the south west and in the north there also appears to be a tendency toward larger catchments in central and north western regions hydrological classification of sites is applied fig 2 to gain a better understanding of whether relationships between monthly and daily flow indicators vary according to flow regime type the flow regime categories are predicted from the model of kennard et al 2010b based on many of the same gauges 2 2 flow indicators many suites of flow indicators exist henriksen et al 2006 kennard et al 2010b richter et al 1996 vogel et al 2007 and many approaches have been developed for using these indicators to assess flow regime alteration and ecological threats jumani et al 2020 for this study we adopt the suite of 171 indicators originally collated by olden and poff 2003 and adapted by henriksen et al 2006 however several modifications to the indicator calculation methods are required to address inconsistencies between previous studies in addition many of these indicators were developed in northern america and europe without consideration of highly ephemeral rivers accordingly some indicators are adjusted to accommodate ephemeral rivers with a high proportion of zero flow days please refer to supplementary material for further details not all indicators can be meaningfully converted to a monthly timestep an issue which has been noted in other studies where monthly indicators have been trialled laizé et al 2014 pumo et al 2018 some are effectively identical with a monthly or daily timestep such as the mean annual discharge some indicators are not quite identical yet translate well to a monthly timestep such as the mean annual maximum daily discharge which corresponds to the mean annual maximum monthly discharge other indicators translate poorly to a monthly timestep such as the average daily rate of rise which corresponds to the average monthly rate of rise the latter having little practical meaning of the 171 daily indicators adopted for this study 115 can be meaningfully converted to a monthly calculation or were already in a monthly format two indicators based on circular statistics are replaced with their sine and cosine components giving 173 daily and 117 monthly indicators overall the complete list of indicators and their definitions is given in supplementary material all indicators are consolidated into manageable categories table 1 based on different facets of the flow regime as proposed by olden and poff 2003 namely magnitude average low high frequency low high duration low high timing and rate of change 2 3 statistical analysis simple correlation techniques are used to assess the direct associations between pairs of monthly and daily indicators fig 3 initially correlation is assessed between matching pairs of daily and monthly indicators such as ma1 daily and ma1 monthly next correlations are assessed between all non matching pairs of indicators such as ma1 daily and ra6 monthly many of the indicators have highly non normal distributions so the rank based spearman ρ is an appropriate correlation statistic which helps to moderate the effect of outliers partial least squares regression is applied to predict daily indicators for each site based on monthly indicator values fig 4 it has been previously established that the available indicators contain a high degree of collinearity and redundancy gao et al 2009 olden and poff 2003 making traditional regression techniques unsuitable partial least squares regression plsr sometimes known as projection to latent structures regression vinzi et al 2010 wold et al 2001 is a technique which can identify links between two datasets while also directly addressing the challenges of collinearity and redundancy it is the ability to simultaneously undertake regression and eliminate the existing collinearity in the flow indicators which makes this an ideal technique the inputs to the plsr model are the values for all 173 daily indicators and 117 monthly indicators representing the dependant and independent variables respectively in effect the model is constructed to predict all 173 daily indicators based on 117 monthly indicators pre processing with either box cox or yeo johnson transformations followed by z score calculation ensures that data for each indicator is as close to normally distributed as possible validation and performance testing is undertaken using 10 fold cross validation james et al 2021 a model validation technique similar to bootstrapping with each fold consisting of 10 of sites selected randomly the plsr model was calibrated to 20 components conceptually similar to principal components with each representing an independent function of the monthly indicators which explain most of the variance of the daily indicators these 20 components are then used in a regression model to estimate the daily indicators the estimated daily indicators produced by the model are compared with the observed daily indicators to calculate r2 and rmse performance statistics for more details of the plsr model inputs calibration and performance statistics refer to supplementary material we use the loadings from the plsr analysis fig 4 to identify a small subset of monthly indicators which contain the most information about daily flow behaviour we use two different approaches to achieve this but in both cases analyse the first 6 of the 20 model components because the calibration process demonstrates that these explain the majority of daily regime variability refer to supplementary material for calibration details we identify the monthly indicator with the highest loading for each of the first 6 components this is a common technique often used with principal component analysis to eliminate redundancy gao et al 2009 john et al 2021 monk et al 2007 olden and poff 2003 as an alternative approach we also identify monthly indicators with the highest aggregate loading across the first 6 components combined in effect we are finding monthly indicators which are relevant across multiple components not just a single component 3 results 3 1 associations between daily and monthly indicators indicators based on observed monthly data had moderate to strong correlations with their equivalent based on observed daily data in the majority of cases fig 5 of the 117 monthly indicators 76 89 have spearman rank correlations with their daily counterpart greater than 0 6 and 54 63 have correlations exceeding 0 9 some daily monthly indicator pairs demonstrated weaker associations within the average magnitude ma category the group of 12 indicators with the weakest correlations all relate to monthly variability e g variability in january flows within the high flow duration dh category the indicators describing magnitude and variability of higher flows tend to have stronger correlations while indicators describing the duration of high flow events tend to have weaker correlations indicators within the low flow frequency fl and high flow frequency fh categories typically show weaker correlations example comparisons demonstrate different types of associations between daily and monthly indicators and the spearman correlation obtained in each case fig 6 all correlations between matching monthly and daily indicator pairs were found to be statistically significant with p values effectively equal to zero p 0 0001 in most cases refer to supplementary material for full results the highest p value obtained was 0 0054 for indicator fl1 suggesting that even this weak correlation result is unlikely to be the result of random noise there are strong correlations between many daily and monthly indicators not just directly matching pairs although this varies between different facets of the flow regime the color highlighting of the diagonal of the cross correlation matrix fig 7 is formed by many strong correlations previously observed between matching indicator pairs fig 5 beyond the diagonal there are numerous moderate to strong correlations with indicators relating to flow magnitude ma ml mh low flow event durations dl and rates of rise and fall ra conversely there are fewer moderate to strong correlations with indicators relating to low and high flow event frequency fl fh and seasonal timing ta tl th suggesting both a lack of redundancy as well as a lack of association between these monthly and daily indicators also there are many daily indicators columns and monthly indicators rows with similar correlation patterns providing a visual representation of redundancy between indicators gao et al 2009 monk et al 2007 olden and poff 2003 relationships between daily and monthly indicators are complex with most daily indicators fig 7 columns showing relationships with numerous monthly indicators fig 7 rows this demonstrates that there are often several monthly indicators that correlate with each daily indicator and could potentially be used to predict daily values although some indicators could not be calculated using a monthly timestep the daily flow behavior they represent is not necessarily lost for example there are a number of daily indicators fig 7 columns in the low and high flow magnitude ml and mh categories which could not be calculated at a monthly timestep yet these indicators have moderate to strong correlations with other monthly indicators fig 7 rows notably the rates of rise and fall ra category has no equivalent monthly indicators yet includes some moderate to strong correlations suggesting that information about this aspect of short term daily flow variability is well represented in the monthly flow regime 3 2 estimation of daily indicators the partial least squares regression pslr model was able to predict daily indices from monthly data reasonably well with the proportion of variance explained r2 greater than 60 for more than 90 of daily flow indicators although the strength of predictions varied between different facets of the flow regime fig 8 the poorest model performance was for the low and high frequency categories fl and fh where the prediction error rmse and the variance explained r2 were generally poorer than any other category however the model performance for these categories is still considered moderate to strong with r2 typically between 0 55 and 0 85 suggesting that around 55 to 85 of daily flow information is captured in the monthly data other categories had better results although with considerable scatter the model performance for the indicators in the rates of rise and fall ra category are notable given that they have no monthly equivalent where these indicators were predicted with an r2 of typically 0 75 to 0 85 suggesting that around 75 to 85 of this facet of daily flow information is present in the monthly data uncertainty in model performance was assessed by comparing the performance metrics across each of the 10 validation folds a technique similar to bootstrapping this showed that the variance explained r2 and prediction error rmse were very consistent across the majority of indicators for the overall model with all sites and indicators combined the variance in the r2 results across the 10 folds showed that monthly flow indicators contain between approximately 82 and 86 of the information contained in the daily flow data refer to supplementary material for full results model performance was evaluated separately for individual sites fig 9 there is considerable scatter in the variance explained r2 at each site however the majority of sites have r2 values greater than 0 6 there is a trend toward larger prediction error rmse for more intermittent sites although the variance explained r2 remains broadly similar to other flow regime types we trialled separate plsr models for intermittent rivers however this did not improve model performance see supplementary material model performance is generally good for most sites across australia fig 10 while trends for poorer model performance are indistinct the majority of sites with lower variance explained r2 appear to be clustered in the south east and south west of the continent and many sites in central and north western australia appear to have larger prediction error rmse given the relatively small numbers of sites in several regions these spatial trends are unlikely to be statistically significant however they are suggestive of several possible issues which may be influencing model performance such as flow regime class very large catchment areas or differences in regional climate other catchment characteristics such as vegetation geology and terrain may also have influence the first 6 components of the plsr model were found to explain most 80 of the variability in daily flow behaviour refer supplementary material the monthly indicators with the highest individual loadings in each of those 6 components were identified table 2 also monthly indicators with the highest sum of loadings across the first 6 components combined were identified table 3 mean monthly flows ma12 ma23 feature prominently in both lists along with fh1 however remaining indicators differ for example the first indicator in table 2 is ma9 describing the spread of flows however there is no indicator in table 3 which relates to the spread of flows 4 discussion it is commonly assumed that streamflow data at a monthly timestep is unable to capture information about daily flow behaviour especially as it relates to short duration variability although this is rarely stated explicitly this paper aimed to test this assumption by evaluating statistical associations between monthly and daily hydrological indicators for a diversity of perennial intermittent and ephemeral flow regimes the analysis comparing pairs of monthly and daily indicators showed that over three quarters of 117 monthly indicators demonstrated strong correlations with their daily equivalent spearman rank correlations greater than 0 60 it also revealed that many indicators relating to daily variability and the frequency and duration of short term flow events correlated poorly with monthly indicators ρ 0 6 fig 5 short duration flow variability such as frequency of high flow events showed little correlation with their monthly equivalent however when we applied multivariate models we found that daily flow characteristics could be predicted at least moderately well with a reasonable degree of variance explained r2 greater than 0 6 for most indicators this suggests that the daily flow information is still present in monthly data but is distributed amongst multiple monthly indicators and that multivariate techniques are required to extract it to better understand the physical basis of how a multivariate approach can help to estimate daily flow behaviour it is useful to examine hydroclimatological similarities between sites using the model regression results consider a single indicator as an example fh11 is the average number of events per year exceeding the 1 67 year ari peak flow for which there was a poor correlation ρ 0 22 between the daily and monthly indicators fig 5 using plsr the daily version of fh11 can be predicted with a moderate degree of variance explained r2 0 52 fig 8 indicating that 52 of the information in fh11 retained in the monthly data the regression coefficients β refer to supplementary material identify the most important monthly indicators for estimating the daily version of fh11 namely the average number of months between 1 67 year ari peak month events dh22 β 0 16 and the duration in months of low flow events below the 75 exceedance flow dl16 β 0 15 in short sites with a greater number of high flow events per year are likely to also have shorter intervals between high flow events and shorter durations of low flow events this combination of coefficients makes intuitive sense suggesting a flow regime with multiple high flow events each year leaving little scope for extended dry spells as a further example of the physical basis of how daily flow information is retained in monthly data consider the daily indicator ra1 it represents the rate of rise in flow as a proportion of the previous day averaged across all rising days there is no monthly equivalent and yet the plsr model predicted daily values of ra1 with 84 of variance explained r2 0 84 rmse 0 40 fig 8 the coefficients indicate that a high rate of rise can be expected at sites where the average duration of high flow events is short dh19 β 0 08 and where the variability in the number of zero flow days each year is high dl19 β 0 08 once again these links make intuitive sense providing a reasonable description of a flow regime with a flashy rainfall runoff response associated with short duration peak flow events and where even a modest rainfall event can produce a significant flow giving a variable number of zero flow days 5 limitations the plsr approach was less successful for some sites but the reasons are not clear looking beyond the simplest explanation of poor quality flow data it is possible that it reflects some inherent model limitations which could have implications for future work in general prediction error was poorer for sites with more ephemeral regimes fig 9 but the variance explained did not show this trend similarly spatial trends in prediction error did not appear to be reflected in the variance explained fig 10 however these trends in model performance exhibit considerable scatter making the causes difficult to identify patterns between sites with poorer prediction error suggest that flow regime class regional climate or sites with large catchment areas could be influencing model performance it is notable that the distribution of sites is not consistent across regions or across flow regime classes with study sites being dominated by perennial or partly ephemeral sites located along the eastern seaboard and relatively few sites in inland and north western australia where flow regimes are often highly ephemeral one possible explanation could be that the model has been developed with a dataset dominated by more perennial sites and therefore works best for sites with a similar flow regime clearly the model can only perform well for the types of flow regimes it has been calibrated with so careful selection of representative training sites is essential in addition the poorer prediction error in more ephemeral catchments may relate to the choice of indicators and how well they describe these flow regimes many of the flow indicators were originally sourced from studies undertaken for locations where waterways tend to be more perennial clausen et al 2000 clausen and biggs 1997 richards 1989 wood et al 2000 and were developed to capture key information about the flow regimes in these areas it is difficult to know whether the information captured by this particular suite of indicators is equally descriptive of the flow regime in locations where the flow regime is ephemeral with a high level of interannual variability such as inland and north western australia it is possible that the model may perform better at some sites with a different suite of indicators which have been tailored to characterise their typical flow regimes in essence information about daily flow behaviour may be present in monthly data but can only be extracted if the indicators have been carefully chosen to identify useful traits about the flow regimes present at the study sites the period of record available for the majority of sites in this study was at least 35 years but it is likely that model performance will be poorer with shorter records long term flow records can be difficult to obtain in many parts of the world grabs 2009 krabbenhoft et al 2022 and predictability of flow indicators has been shown to decrease with shorter lengths of record kennard et al 2010a it is therefore likely that model performance will also be poorer with shorter lengths of record but it is unclear whether this will be the case for all facets of the flow regime and for all classes of flow regime additional research is warranted to identify the effect of shorter periods of monthly records on their information content with respect to daily flow behaviour providing valuable guidance for situations where flow data is less comprehensive while this study has focused on waterways within australia it is reasonable to hypothesize that in principle monthly data is likely to contain considerable amounts of information about daily flow behaviour in many other parts of the world poff et al 2006 the variability of streamflow sites selected across australia is representative of the hydrological variability seen globally perhaps except for snow melt systems that said some of the more specific conclusions about individual indicators or facets of the flow regime are not easily transferable making it necessary to conduct a separate investigation to demonstrate the information content of monthly data in each region such a study would need to include enough sites with both observed daily and observed monthly flows to ensure correlations loadings and coefficients are statistically significant if the purpose of such a study was to obtain accurate predictions of daily flow behaviour with the eventual aim of applying predictions to data poor sites then it may also be useful to include additional independent variables such as climate vegetation terrain or geology which are likely to improve model performance by contextualizing the daily monthly associations while this study has shown that it is possible to extract daily flow statistics from monthly data without the need for synthesizing a daily flow sequence it remains unclear which approach provides more accurate estimates of daily flow characteristics the multivariate indicator approach adopted for this study involves significantly less effort and is less data intensive than calibrating daily rainfall runoff models for each site however further work is required to understand whether the multivariate approach produces more accurate predictions for some indicators or for individual facets of the flow regime 6 implications and conclusions this study demonstrates that monthly and daily indicators are strongly linked and that monthly indicators contain a considerable amount of information about daily flow behaviour it also shows that most of the variability in daily flow behaviour between sites can be represented with a small handful of monthly indicators the techniques used in this study provide a practical alternative to disaggregation of monthly model outputs or development of daily models we have shown that it is possible to extract daily flow statistics directly from monthly timeseries data without the need for synthesizing a daily flow sequence and the epistemic uncertainty that entails helgeson et al 2021 this has immediate ramifications for a wide range of studies including studies of hydrological threats to ecosystems laizé et al 2014 ruhí et al 2016 thompson et al 2014 and studies assessing impacts to flow regimes in monthly water resource models pumo et al 2018 schneider et al 2013 zimmerman et al 2018 although we have demonstrated the links between daily and monthly indicators there are also some important limitations not all indicators can be predicted equally well and indicators at some sites proved less predictable demonstrating that some daily flow regime information is lost at the monthly timestep the results we present are broadly applicable to most flow regimes found in australia but further work may be required for use with highly ephemeral sites or flow regimes such as snow melt dominated catchments which are not well represented within australia in any application the techniques we present will work best when the model is calibrated with flow data from representative sites using a suite of indicators carefully selected to best describe the key elements of the flow regime relevant to a particular study while traditional techniques of rainfall runoff modelling disaggregation and other daily flow synthesis techniques will continue to be essential tools in hydrological studies this study has shown the value of longer timestep data paving the way for a new approach which can play an important role in areas where daily data is poor or non existent helping to directly estimate daily behaviour without the intermediate step of

2344,exploration of the temporal and spatial evolutionary trends of future extreme precipitation under different emission scenarios is of considerable importance for promoting active response to climate change based on the output of cmip6 global climate models gcms with four shared socioeconomic pathways ssps precipitation data for the jialing river basin china were obtained through cmhyd downscaling and correction a relative threshold of 95 percentile of each year was used to extract extreme precipitation in the basin and historical observational data were used to verify the capability of the gcms to simulate extreme precipitation based on extreme point symmetric mode decomposition the trends and periodic characteristics of future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin under four different emission scenarios ssp2 6 ssp4 5 ssp7 0 and ssp8 5 were simulated and analyzed the future temporal and spatial distributions of extreme precipitation frequency and intensity in different periods were described the results revealed the following 1 future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin is likely to increase with rates of 21 8 mm 10a 11 4 mm 10a 8 7 mm 10a and 8 3 mm 10a for ssp8 5 ssp 7 0 ssp4 5 and ssp2 6 respectively 2 the frequency of extreme precipitation decreased in the whole basin with a 1 day decrease of 3 88 ssp8 5 7 11 ssp7 0 5 66 ssp4 5 and 2 40 ssp2 6 from historical levels 3 the intensity of extreme precipitation increased with a 1 day increase of 11 18 ssp8 5 6 80 ssp7 0 5 04 ssp4 5 and 4 57 ssp2 6 from historical levels over time the change of extreme precipitation showed strong periodic characteristics with three periodic components of 2 3 4 6 and 9 12 years in terms of spatial distribution the frequency intensity center of extreme precipitation in the next 80 years will be distributed in the south southeast of the basin compared with historical observations the area of extreme precipitation intensity in the future accounted for a larger proportion while the area of extreme precipitation frequency accounted for a smaller proportion in terms of increased emission levels the extreme precipitation frequency would decrease and the intensity would increase the conclusions of this study could provide a reference for disaster prevention and mitigation of the effects of extreme precipitation under future climate change keywords cmip6 extreme precipitation ssp frequency intensity temporal and spatial distribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global warming has been accepted as an indisputable fact rahmstorf et al 2017 data show that the global average surface temperature increased by 0 85 c during 1980 2012 ipcc 2013 and this trend is continuing global warming has led to the retreat of glaciers in both mountains and oceans resulting in a sharp increase in evaporation and a significant increase in precipitation worldwide resulting in the frequent occurrence of extreme precipitation events which have an obvious socio economic impact and serious consequences araya osses et al 2020 therefore it is important to understand the effects of climate change on spatiotemporal evolutionary trends of extreme precipitation under different emission patterns extreme precipitation events refer to events that occur less frequently in a statistical sense when the state of the precipitation is so markedly deviated from its average state compared with normal precipitation extreme precipitation events are characterized by sudden occurrence and severe destruction wang 2015 liu et al 2017 su et al 2021 many recent studies have investigated extreme precipitation some studies analyzed the interannual variation seasonal abundance and dieback of extreme precipitation events using historical observational data for example ferrari et al 2021 conducted in depth analysis of seven different extreme precipitation events that affected the liguria region italy in the past 10 years using numerical simulations with nearly 1 km resolution and the latest non hydrostatic weather rodrigues et al 2021 studied the annual variation of extreme precipitation events and natural disasters in natal brazil in the period 1984 2014 as well as the seasonal variation of abundance and dieback some studies adopted the classical mann kendall trend test and other methods to investigate the spatial distribution of historical extreme precipitation events for example based on daily precipitation data 1961 2017 from 28 meteorological stations in and around the weihe river basin china zou et al 2021 selected six extreme precipitation indices and adopted the mann kendall trend test and wavelet transform method to comprehensively analyze the temporal and spatial evolutionary laws of extreme precipitation in the studied basin alavinia and zarei 2021 analyzed the spatial trends of climate change and the distribution of extreme precipitation events using daily precipitation data 1966 2015 from 37 meteorological stations by the nonparametric mann kendall test and sen s slope method thomas et al 2021 analyzed the characteristics of the indian subcontinent monsoon low pressure system for the period 1979 2015 together with its accompanying extreme precipitation events messmer and simmonds 2021 studied compound extreme events including extreme precipitation on the global scale using 3 hourly era5 reanalysis data 1979 2018 and two independent cyclone detection and tracking algorithms kang et al 2021 studied the change trends of six extreme precipitation indices in relation to the suzhou wuxi changzhou urban agglomeration china for the period 1980 2015 and they estimated the contribution rate of urbanization to extreme precipitation the above studies were all based on historical data in terms of extreme precipitation prediction some studies have used a variety of cmip5 universal global climate models gcms for comparative analysis of future changes in extreme precipitation for example tabari 2021 used 24 cmip5 general gcms to conduct a comparative analysis of the impact of climate change on extreme precipitation indices for the periods 1971 2000 and 2070 2099 some studies have used gcms or regional climate models to study the impact of 1 5 and 2 0 warming on future extreme precipitation for example shi et al 2021 used a gcm to study global extreme precipitation events and their changes in a 1 5 and 2 0 warmer climate based on precipitation data of five gcms under isis mip ding et al 2020 used nine indices including precipitation intensity daily maximum precipitation and frequency of heavy precipitation to evaluate the changes of extreme precipitation in the lancang river basin china under future global warming of 1 5 and 2 0 ao et al 2020 estimated the changes of extreme climate events in northeast china under 1 5 and 2 0 warming scenarios using daily temperature and precipitation data from the regcm4 regional climate model in addition to the impact of warming on future extreme precipitation some studies used cmip5 gcms to investigate the changes of future extreme precipitation under different emission scenarios from the perspective of emission patterns for example amnuaylojaroen 2021 used the output of a nested regional climate model and the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 emission scenarios to calculate five different extreme precipitation indices and explore predicted extreme precipitation in thailand for the period 2020 2029 based on six regional climate simulation systems harpa et al 2019 predicted the changes of three extreme rainfall indices in relation to romania during 2041 2070 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios using 18 cmip5 gcms mo et al 2021 obtained rainfall data through application of the lars wg downscaling model and calculated 11 extreme rainfall indices under two scenarios i e rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the period 2041 2070 generally depending on the particularities of different study regions the above studies analyzed extreme precipitation events during a specific period and studied the influence of temperature rise on extreme precipitation however most studies used only historical data to analyze the spatial and temporal distributions of extreme precipitation and more studies of climate models and emission scenarios are needed moreover current research on extreme precipitation prediction is based mostly on the cmip5 dataset however the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change which was based on the new climate models in cmip6 developed a set of new emission scenarios called shared socioeconomic pathways ssps driven by different social and economic models su et al 2021 li et al 2022 these ssps were developed to replace the four rcps in cmip5 and to increase the simulation accuracy of extreme precipitation amounts in terms of simulation and prediction of extreme precipitation events the cmip6 dataset has better accuracy than the cmip5 dataset cao et al 2012 gusain et al 2020 but comparatively research based on the cmip6 dataset is lacking this study adopted relative threshold ao et al 2020 and frequency intensity duration methods liu et al 2017 to identify and analyze extreme precipitation in the basin using regional precipitation observation data and five cmip6 gcms data from 1960 to 2100 sustainable development moderate development local inconsistent development and conventional development scenarios i e ssp2 6 ssp4 5 ssp7 0 and ssp8 5 respectively gütschow et al 2021 were selected to study the spatial and temporal evolutionary trends of future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin china under different emission scenarios the impact of different emission scenarios on changes in extreme precipitation was also discussed this study is expected to provide a technical reference for the influence evaluation of future extreme precipitation 2 materials 2 1 study area the jialing river originates from qinling mountains and has a total length of 1120 km it runs from north to south through the central part of the sichuan basin and flows into the yangtze river in the city of chongqing the jialing river is the largest tributary of the yangtze river in terms of basin area with an approximate area of 160 000 km2 it is also the second largest tributary in terms of water resources accounting for approximately 17 5 of the yangtze river zhang et al 2021 the elevation of the jialing river basin 29 40 34 30 n 103 30 108 10 e decreases gradually from northwest to southeast this basin has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with southerly winds in summer warm hot temperatures and concentrated periods of heavy rain floods primarily caused by heavy rain in this basin generally have large peak heights and short duration luo and chen 2021 the extreme disastrous weather with increasing frequency in jialing river basin has led to the water environment deterioration and water quality decline wang 2015 therefore the extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin plays an important role in the flood and water environment disasters of the jialing river and the yangtze river the meteorological stations in the jialing river basin and the elevation of the watershed terrain are shown

includes determining effective precipitation data counting continuous precipitation data determining an extreme precipitation threshold and identifying extreme precipitation events owing to the spatial variation of the extreme precipitation threshold meteorological stations were adopted as the units with which to identify extreme precipitation events in the basin 1 determining effective precipitation data to calculate the precipitation in the basin daily precipitation greater than 0 1 mm was taken as effective precipitation and such data for each station were counted if the daily precipitation of a meteorological station in the basin is p i then the effective precipitation pe i of the station can be expressed as follows 1 pe i p i i f p i 0 1 m m 2 counting continuous precipitation data the extreme precipitation data lasting for 3 days 3d 5 days 5d and 7 days 7d can be achieved by counting the continuous effective precipitation data using the sliding accumulation method the effective precipitation series for several consecutive days are pe i pe i 1 pe i 2 pe i 3 pe i n and then the continuous precipitation p 3 d i p 5 d i and p 7 d i of 3d 5d and 7d at a meteorological station can each be expressed as follows 2 p 3 d i j 0 2 pe i j p 3 d i 1 j 0 2 pe i 1 j 3 p 5 d i j 0 4 pe i j p 5 d i 1 j 0 4 pe i 1 j 4 p 7 d i j 0 6 pe i j p 7 d i 1 j 0 6 pe i 1 j 3 determining extreme precipitation thresholds the percentile method sierks et al 2020 was used to calculate the threshold of extreme precipitation in the basin after obtaining the continuous precipitation series 1d 3d 5d and 7d for each meteorological station in the basin the 95th percentile was taken as the threshold of extreme precipitation for each station that is the first 5 precipitation of the whole time series of each station was identified as the extreme precipitation threshold the continuous precipitation series of a meteorological station can be arranged in an ascending order as follows 5 p 1 d 1 p 1 d 2 p 1 d 3 p 1 d n 1 p 3 d 1 p 3 d 2 p 3 d 3 p 3 d n 3 p 5 d 1 p 5 d 2 p 5 d 3 p 5 d n 5 p 7 d 1 p 7 d 2 p 7 d 3 p 7 d n 7 then the extreme precipitation

1 n 7 3 2 processing and validation of cmip6 data the spatial resolution of the data provided by the cmip6 models is relatively low and thus downscaling was needed to improve the spatial resolution of the precipitation data gusain et al 2020 historical observational data were used to correct the deviation of the simulated data to meet the accuracy requirements of the simulation of extreme precipitation in the basin a software cmhyd https swat tamu edu software cmhyd was used for data extraction and model data downscaling to the actual locations of the meteorological stations in this study this tool embeds eight deviation correction methods for simulation results such as linear scaling delta change correction precipitation local intensity scaling power transformation of precipitation and distribution mapping of precipitation teutschbein and seibert 2012 singh et al 2021 through comparing the simulated data with historical observational data the delta change correction method had the highest processing accuracy and the smallest error and it was finally adopted to the model deviation correction in the jialing river basin the cmip6 gcms daily precipitation data 1960 2014 in the jialing river basin were compared with the historical observational data in the same period to evaluate the capability of the model to simulate extreme precipitation a total of 20 gcms were screened by trial calculation in this study three indices of total amount frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation from 1960 to 2014 in each model were simulated respectively and compared with the historical measured results according to the relative errors and the spatial efficiency metric value between the simulations and the measurements the top five cmip6 gcms access cm2 bcc csm2 mr cmcc esm2 inm cm4 8 and miorc6 were determined as final models in order to improve the simulation accuracy the predictions of five gcms were coupled to get the mean value of extreme precipitation for each scenario the annual average of the three indices including extreme precipitation extreme precipitation frequency and intensity were calculated to determine the overall level of consistency between the modelled and observational data in the jialing river basin the model credible degree was distinguished by the relative errors the spatial efficiency metric spaef method was adopted to explore the spatial simulation ability of the model which is an index to evaluate the spatial performance of the model from correlation variability and bias ahmed et al 2019 demirel et al 2018 methods for evaluation indices were as follows 1 average if x i is the climate variable of interannual variation and n is the time scale in years corresponding to x i the mean value x can be used

observations and simulations 3 3 spatiotemporal evolution of extreme precipitation under different emission scenarios a precipitation series in a basin is a nonlinear nonstationary series that contains various periodic and trend components in the process of studying the change trend of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin from 2021 to 2100 four different emission scenarios were selected i e ssp2 6 ssp4 5 ssp7 0 and ssp8 5 the outputs of the four emission scenarios were compared with each other to reveal the detailed change trend of future basin extreme precipitation in the process of simulating extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin from 2021 to 2100 under the four emission scenarios extreme precipitation at each of the 23 meteorological stations was extracted using threshold values extreme precipitation of whole basin was obtained by summing the extreme precipitation of all stations each year extreme point symmetric mode decomposition esmd li and yue 2020 was used to analyze the characteristics of trend and periodicity of the total extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin in the trend analysis the adaptive global mean and linear fitting methods were used to reveal the change of future extreme precipitation in the analysis of periodicity the periodic components were used to examine the periodicity of future extreme precipitation and the upper envelope was taken to represent the corresponding fluctuation amplitudes of different periodic components the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation were calculated annually to facilitate assessment of the level of future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin absolute intensity was adopted in this study i e daily precipitation exceeding the threshold value of extreme precipitation was defined directly as the intensity of extreme precipitation liu et al 2017 the annual average frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation in the basin were counted in terms of the meteorological stations and the spatial distributions of extreme precipitation frequency and intensity in the basin were analyzed using the isoline method in arcgis the specific analysis and calculation method were shown below 1 extreme point symmetric mode decomposition esmd the esmd was used to study the trend and periodic variation characteristics of the discrete time series by determining the position and number of poles the climate variable x t is decomposed into the trend component r t and the modal component m i t affected by the number of poles i which can be expressed as follows 15 x t m i t r t the periodic component m i t and the optimal adaptive global mean curve r t were obtained by multiple decomposition the fast fourier transform was used to calculate the power spectrum of the decomposed different modal components the frequency of the climate variable x t signal was obtained according to the magnitude of the amplitude and the average period of each modal component was calculated the formula for calculation of the power spectrum p n ω can be expressed as follows 16 p n ω 1 n o n ω 2 17 o n ω v 0 n 1 o n v e j ω where n is the sample size of climate variable x t o n v is the energy finite signal o n ω is the frequency value of the fast fourier transform of o n v v is the random analog signal and ω is the signal frequency of the fast fourier transform the signals of different periods were separated using frequency domain transformation and the graphs of the different periodic components in the temporal domain were obtained the envelope of the graph was used to represent the corresponding amplitude of each periodic component 2 temporal frequency the temporal frequency of extreme precipitation f i t i 1 3 5 7 t 2021 2100 is the number of extreme precipitation in the entire basin in each year which was used to reveal the temporal variation of extreme precipitation frequency the formula for its calculation can be expressed as follows 18 f i t j 1 n f i j t where i represents the duration of extreme precipitation unit d n is the number of meteorological stations in the basin t represents the time scale in years and f i j t is the frequency of extreme precipitation at each meteorological station in each year 3 spatial frequency the spatial extreme precipitation frequency f i j i 1 3 5 7 j 1 n is the average number of extreme precipitation at j th meteorological station in years which was used to represent the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation frequency the formula for its calculation can be expressed as follows 19 f i j 1 t t 1 t f i j t where t is the total year of simulation from 2021 to 2100 equaling 80 4 temporal intensity the temporal extreme precipitation intensity i i t i 1 3 5 7 is the average intensity of extreme precipitation in the entire basin in a year which was used to represent the temporal variation of extreme precipitation intensity the formula for its calculation can be expressed as follows 20 i i t j 1 n p i j t f i t i 1 3 5 7 t 1 t where p i j t is the extreme precipitation data with different durations for a station in one year 5 spatial intensity the spatial

model simulation capability based on the observed and simulated daily precipitation data of the base period 1960 2014 each index of extreme precipitation for 1d 3d 5d and 7d over the jialing river basin was calculated the capabilities of the gcms in terms of spatial and temporal simulation were evaluated from the perspectives of average annual precipitation extreme precipitation frequency and extreme precipitation intensity the calibration results are presented in tables 1 2 as seen from table 1 and table 2 the five gcms selected in this paper have good spatial and temporal correlation in the jialing river basin the relative errors are within 10 and the spaef values are close to 1 in order to simplify the calculation and improve the simulation accuracy five models are coupled and the average value of each model simulation result is taken as the result of the coupling model the results are presented in tables 3 5 the calibration results show that there is little difference between the simulated average annual precipitation and the actual situation and that the coupled model can better simulate the overall magnitude of precipitation in the basin the average values of extreme precipitation frequency and intensity are similar and the maximum relative error is 6 58 which has strong robustness the minimum value of spaef is 0 45 and there is also a strong spatial correlation the results indicate that the coupled model is well capable of simulating the spatial and temporal distributions and variation tendencies of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin 4 2 variation characteristics of future extreme precipitation under four emission scenarios 4 2 1 trends of the amount of extreme precipitation precipitation exceeding the threshold of extreme precipitation was counted and the average of the annual extreme precipitation at each station was taken as the total amount of extreme precipitation in the basin in one year the overall trends of future extreme precipitation during 2021 2100 under four emission scenarios are shown in fig 2 in the future average extreme precipitation at each station in the jialing river basin shows an increasing trend over time under different emission scenarios the averaged extreme precipitation in the next 80 years would be 423 68 19 98 mm 433 85 20 49 mm 440 75 17 16 mm and 460 99 6 32 mm with the average growth rate of 8 3 mm 10a 8 7 mm 10a 11 4 mm 10a and 21 8 mm 10a for ssp2 6 ssp4 5 ssp7 0 and ssp8 5 respectively average extreme precipitation at the end of the 21st century will be 504 99 mm ssp2 6 506 51 mm ssp4 5 513 11 mm ssp7 0 and 549 98 mm ssp8 5 4 2 2 the period and amplitude of extreme precipitation periodicity refers to the phenomenon that the historical evolution of a hydrological element appears again after a certain period it should be noted that the cycle mentioned in this paper is not a cycle in the strict mathematical sense but the variation of hydrological elements in certain time periods and after certain time intervals a similar change trend appears again thus periodicity itself is not permanent in the change of time the above results show that the average extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin from 2021 to 2100 is 423 68 19 98 mm ssp2 6 433 85 20 49 mm ssp4 5 440 75 17 16 mm ssp7 0 and 460 99 6 32 mm ssp8 5 on this basis esmd was used to decompose the extreme precipitation series and remove the trend component and the periodic components of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin under the four emission scenarios were obtained as shown in fig 3 as seen in fig 3 under the four scenarios the future extreme precipitation series is divided into three different periodic modes the characteristics of the period and average amplitude of each mode are described in the table 6 the change in extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin is likely to be considerable in the next 80 years although the predicted extreme precipitation shows an upward trend in general there are many periodic modes of fluctuation and the fluctuation range is large in some years extreme precipitation might be much higher than expected and in some future years extreme precipitation might be lower than the present situation because the amplitude range is much greater than the growth rate the period of each mode is relatively stable the amplitude fluctuation of extreme precipitation with small cycles could occur easily whereas the amplitude fluctuation of extreme precipitation with large cycles would occur less often 4 2 3 trends of future extreme precipitation frequency and intensity when analyzing the change characteristics of the frequency of extreme precipitation the total number of extreme precipitation events at all stations in the basin was taken as the frequency of extreme precipitation in the basin in any specific year then the variation trend of extreme precipitation frequency under the four emission scenarios during 2021 2100 was obtained using esmd fig 4 in the next 80 years the frequency of extreme precipitation would fluctuate over the entire basin the frequency of extreme precipitation with 1d duration is 212 05 5 27 times a ssp2 6 204 97 11 42 times a ssp4 5 201 84 3 57 times a ssp7 0 and 208 84 3 00 times a ssp8 5 the frequency of extreme precipitation with 3d duration is 95 19 14 09 times a ssp2 6 87 16 8 26 times a ssp4 5 83 18 8 56 times a ssp7 0 and 89 82 3 41 times a ssp8 5 the frequency of extreme precipitation with 5d duration is 40 46 6 83 times a ssp2 6 40 04 6 17 times a ssp4 5 37 25 4 29 times a ssp7 0 and 41 54 4 00 times a ssp8 5 the frequency of extreme precipitation with 7d duration is 18 85 6 54 times a ssp2 6 19 96 7 38 times a ssp4 5 18 80 4 45 times a ssp7 0 and 19 15 4 39 times a ssp8 5 from 1d to 7d the frequency of extreme precipitation decreases gradually for any station in the basin the annual average frequency of extreme precipitation events is shown in table 7 the present extreme precipitation frequency is 208 13 times a 88 26 times a 37 86 times a and 18 43 times a for 1d 3d 5d and 7d duration respectively as seen from table 7 the frequency distribution of future extreme precipitation at one point in jialing river basin is as follows the extreme precipitation with 1d duration is about 8 9 times per year the extreme precipitation with 3d duration is about 3 4 times the extreme precipitation with 5d duration is about 1 2 times and extreme precipitation with 7d duration is less than one multi day extreme precipitation intensity is the sum of multi day precipitation then the variation trend of extreme precipitation intensity with time under four emission scenarios during 2021 2100 was obtained using esmd fig 5 the trend of extreme precipitation intensity in the next 80 years fluctuated and the longer the precipitation lasted the more severe the fluctuation fluctuations in intensity increased with emission levels the duration of extreme precipitation changed from 1d to 7d and the intensity gradually increased the intensity of 1d extreme precipitation was approximately 47 76 0 98 mm ssp2 6 47 97 3 21 mm ssp4 5 48 78 5 40 mm ssp7 0 and 50 78 8 78 mm ssp8 5 the intensity of 3d extreme precipitation was approximately 113 44 1 03 mm ssp2 6 116 18 3 07 mm ssp4 5 117 12 8 34 mm ssp7 0 and 124 16 13 44 mm ssp8 5 the intensity of 5d extreme precipitation was approximately 160 12 0 60 mm ssp2 6 166 02 3 19 mm ssp4 5 164 95 5 90 mm ssp7 0 and 175 63 19 45 mm ssp8 5 the intensity of 7d extreme precipitation was approximately 186 72 0 89 mm ssp2 6 191 91 3 34 mm ssp4 5 175 38 12 52 mm ssp7 0 and 204 51 13 92 mm ssp8 5 the intensity of predicted extreme precipitation with duration of 1d 3d 5d and 7 d was greater than the current corresponding intensity 4 2 4 spatial distribution of future extreme precipitation frequency and intensity the spatial distributions of extreme precipitation frequency in the jialing river basin under the four emission scenarios during 2021 2100 are shown in fig 6 as seen in fig 6 under the four global emission scenarios the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation frequency decreases from southeast to northwest the frequency of extreme precipitation decreased with the increase of precipitation duration from 1d to 7d the spatial peak of 1d and 3d extreme precipitation frequency was distributed in the southern part of the basin while the peak of 5d and 7d extreme precipitation frequency was distributed in the southeastern part of the basin the reason for this spatial distribution may be that influenced by the southeast pacific monsoon the air humidity in the southeast part of the basin is higher so the frequency of continuous multi day precipitation increases the area where the frequency of daily extreme precipitation reached 10 times per year accounted for 40 ssp2 6 26 ssp4 5 4 ssp7 0 and 21 ssp8 5 of the total watershed area the proportion of area of extreme precipitation frequency in the future was smaller than that in the historical scenario the spatial distributions of average extreme precipitation intensity over the jialing river basin in 2021 2100 under the four emission scenarios are shown in fig 7 in the next 80 years the extreme precipitation intensity in the jialing river basin is likely to decrease spatially from the southeast to the northwest showing a center radial shape and the intensity center would be in the southeast of the watershed the intensity of extreme precipitation would increase gradually with the continuous transition from 1d to 7d the areas with extreme precipitation intensity of 75 mm 1d accounted for 30 ssp2 6 33 ssp4 5 36 ssp7 0 and 42 ssp8 5 of the total watershed area areas of 125 mm 3d intensity accounted for 61 ssp2 6 65 ssp4 5 67 ssp7 0 and 63 ssp8 5 the proportion of areas with an intensity of 175 mm 5d was 60 ssp2 6 69 ssp4 5 69 ssp7 0 and 74 ssp8 5 the proportion of zones up to 250 mm 7d was 57 ssp2 6 49 ssp4 5 55 ssp7 0 and 36 ssp8 5 compared with the historical observations the area of extreme precipitation intensity in the future would be larger 5 discussion 5 1 discussion of different emission scenarios the ssps represent a new set of emission scenarios driven by different socioeconomic models developed using the new cmip6 climate models the ssps replace the rcps of cmip5 and represent an important upgrade to cmip6 in this study the sustainable development scenario ssp2 6 moderate development scenario ssp4 5 local inconsistent development scenario ssp7 0 and conventional development scenario ssp8 5 were selected the frequency and intensity of future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin under the four emission scenarios are compared in figs 8 and 9 respectively in terms of the frequency of extreme precipitation the frequency peak under ssp8 5 was the highest and the frequency peaks under other scenarios were not very different indicating that with the increase of emission level the maximum level of extreme precipitation frequency was basically unchanged but excessive emission level could lead to an increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation as emission levels increase the average frequency decreased except for the ssp8 5 emission scenario which increased relative to the ssp7 0 scenario it showed that with the increase of the emission level the total level of extreme precipitation frequency in the jialing river basin decreased but when the emission level is too high ssp8 5 the frequency of extreme precipitation increased the median frequency decreased with increasing emission levels except for the ssp8 5 scenario which was greater than the median frequency for the ssp7 0 scenario the median frequency decreased with increasing emission levels except for the ssp8 5 scenario which was greater than the median frequency for the ssp7 0 scenario it showed that the occurrence probability of extreme precipitation decreased with the emission level however when the emission level reached the level of the ssp8 5 scenario the probability of extreme precipitation events would increase generally the frequency of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin showed a dramatic change trend in the next 80 years the frequency of extreme precipitation decreased with the emission level but when the emission level was too high ssp8 5 the frequency of extreme precipitation increased again in terms of extreme precipitation intensity the peak value of extreme precipitation intensity generally increased with the increase of emission level the extreme precipitation intensity fluctuates for some durations and the amplitude of extreme precipitation intensity for multiple days was larger with the increase of the emission level the average value of the extreme precipitation intensity would gradually increase indicating that the magnitude of the extreme precipitation intensity in the jialing river basin increased with the emission level and the development pattern of increasing emissions would lead to the occurrence of high intensity extreme precipitation events the median intensity increased with emission levels indicating a greater probability of extreme precipitation in developmental models with high emission levels 5 2 comparative discussion of future and historical changes in extreme precipitation 5 2 1 overall change in total extreme precipitation comparing with the historical situation the overall change of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin in the future was assessed the annual average of total extreme precipitation in jialing river basin from 1960 to 2020 and the average of total extreme precipitation under different emission scenarios from 2021 to 2100 were calculated and the mean of total extreme precipitation in jialing river basin under different emission scenarios and time scales was shown in fig 10 table 8 shows the relative change rate of total extreme precipitation in the future with respect to history as seen from figs 3 10 and tables 4 5 under the four emission scenarios extreme precipitation in jialing river basin would be greater than the historical situation in the next 80 years specifically the precipitation growth rate of 1d extreme precipitation was small while that of multi day extreme precipitation was large indicating that the probability of long term extreme precipitation events in the jialing river basin would be greater than the historical situation in the future 5 2 2 overall change in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation the change rates of the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation during 2021 2100 under the four emission scenarios in comparison with the base period are listed in table 9 compared with history the future extreme precipitation frequency overall decline under different emission scenarios the largest decline rate would be 2 40 ssp2 6 6 39 ssp4 5 10 67 ssp7 0 and 3 88 ssp8 5 future extreme precipitation intensity would increase the largest increase rate would be 15 43 ssp2 6 19 68 ssp4 5 18 91 ssp7 0 and 26 61 ssp8 5 compared with the rate of frequency decrease the growth rate of intensity was larger indicating that the future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin would generally increase the frequency of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin would decrease but the intensity of single precipitation might be increase indicating that the future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin would be more disastrous generally the frequency of future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin would decrease but its intensity is likely to increase extreme precipitation in the basin would become more intense 5 3 comparative discussion with previous studies on jialing river basin in recent years the global climate has changed dramatically which has aggravated the uneven spatialtemporal distribution of water resources the study of bador et al 2020 pointed out that global extreme hydrometeorological events show a polarized development i e the intensity of both extreme droughts and extreme precipitation is increasing as the jialing river basin is located in a typical monsoon climate zone floods induced by precipitation are prominent the results of this study show that the total amount of extreme precipitation shows an increasing trend and the intensity of extreme precipitation is also increasing in this area the overall trend of precipitation in this basin is consistent with the global changes which is a concrete manifestation of the global climate in a local area focusing on the extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin luo and chen 2021 used the mann kendall analysis method to study the changing trend of the extreme precipitation days in the basin based on the measured precipitation data from 1960 to 2015 accordingly the results indicate that the historical extreme precipitation days show a decreasing trend and the change rate of rainstorm days is 2 55 times 10a this conclusion is basically consistent with the finding in this study that is the frequency of 1d extreme precipitation under the ssp2 6 scenario is decreased of 2 44 furthermore based on the measured precipitation data from 1961 to 2010 zeng et al 2014 has studied the changing trends of the maximum 1d precipitation and the annual maximum 3d precipitation in the jialing river basin by using the mann kendall analysis method they found that the maximum 1d and 3d precipitation in the basin is on the rise and the mann kendall values the significant interval is 1 69 are 2 00 and 1 73 respectively both showing a significant upward trend in this study the extreme precipitation intensity on the 1d and 3d also show an increasing trend with a growth rate of 4 57 and 13 57 ssp2 6 respectively 6 conclusions in this study the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin china from 2021 to 2100 were predicted by five cmip6 gcms four emission scenarios i e ssp2 6 ssp4 5 ssp7 0 and ssp8 5 respectively were considered to study its effects on extreme precipitation the main conclusions derived are as follows 1 the simulation of interannual variation showed that the average extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin would be 423 68 19 98 mm ssp2 6 433 85 20 49 mm ssp4 5 440 75 17 16 mm ssp7 0 and 460 99 6 32 mm ssp8 5 over the next 80 years with an increase rate of 8 3 mm 10a ssp2 6 8 7 mm 10a ssp4 5 11 4 mm 10a ssp7 0 and 21 8 mm 10a ssp8 5 respectively future extreme precipitation presented strong periodic characteristics exhibiting three periodic components with period of approximately 2 3 4 6 and 9 12 years the overall frequency of extreme precipitation is projected to decrease the overall intensity of extreme precipitation might increase the largest increase rate would be 15 43 ssp2 6 19 68 ssp4 5 18 91 ssp7 0 and 26 61 ssp8 5 for 5d duration 3 the simulation results of the spatial distribution showed that the frequency of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin over the next 80 years would decrease from south to north the extreme precipitation intensity is likely to decrease spatially from the southeast to the northwest showing a center radial shape and the center of rainfall intensity would appear in the southeast of the basin 4 the emission level has considerable influence on future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin with an increase in emission levels in the future the frequency of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin would decrease but when the emission level is too high ssp8 5 the frequency of extreme precipitation increases again as an increase in emission levels in the future the intensity of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin may continue to increase the fluctuation might become more intense and the magnitude would increase 5 compared with historical scenarios the total amount of extreme precipitation would increase in the future the precipitation growth rate of 1d extreme precipitation is small while that of multi day extreme precipitation is large with the maximum growth rate of 6 47 1d 20 97 3d 24 72 5d and 21 62 7d compared with the historical situation the frequency of extreme precipitation in the future is likely to decrease and extreme precipitation intensity would increase credit authorship contribution statement shanghong zhang resources supervision funding acquisition

2344,exploration of the temporal and spatial evolutionary trends of future extreme precipitation under different emission scenarios is of considerable importance for promoting active response to climate change based on the output of cmip6 global climate models gcms with four shared socioeconomic pathways ssps precipitation data for the jialing river basin china were obtained through cmhyd downscaling and correction a relative threshold of 95 percentile of each year was used to extract extreme precipitation in the basin and historical observational data were used to verify the capability of the gcms to simulate extreme precipitation based on extreme point symmetric mode decomposition the trends and periodic characteristics of future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin under four different emission scenarios ssp2 6 ssp4 5 ssp7 0 and ssp8 5 were simulated and analyzed the future temporal and spatial distributions of extreme precipitation frequency and intensity in different periods were described the results revealed the following 1 future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin is likely to increase with rates of 21 8 mm 10a 11 4 mm 10a 8 7 mm 10a and 8 3 mm 10a for ssp8 5 ssp 7 0 ssp4 5 and ssp2 6 respectively 2 the frequency of extreme precipitation decreased in the whole basin with a 1 day decrease of 3 88 ssp8 5 7 11 ssp7 0 5 66 ssp4 5 and 2 40 ssp2 6 from historical levels 3 the intensity of extreme precipitation increased with a 1 day increase of 11 18 ssp8 5 6 80 ssp7 0 5 04 ssp4 5 and 4 57 ssp2 6 from historical levels over time the change of extreme precipitation showed strong periodic characteristics with three periodic components of 2 3 4 6 and 9 12 years in terms of spatial distribution the frequency intensity center of extreme precipitation in the next 80 years will be distributed in the south southeast of the basin compared with historical observations the area of extreme precipitation intensity in the future accounted for a larger proportion while the area of extreme precipitation frequency accounted for a smaller proportion in terms of increased emission levels the extreme precipitation frequency would decrease and the intensity would increase the conclusions of this study could provide a reference for disaster prevention and mitigation of the effects of extreme precipitation under future climate change keywords cmip6 extreme precipitation ssp frequency intensity temporal and spatial distribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global warming has been accepted as an indisputable fact rahmstorf et al 2017 data show that the global average surface temperature increased by 0 85 c during 1980 2012 ipcc 2013 and this trend is continuing global warming has led to the retreat of glaciers in both mountains and oceans resulting in a sharp increase in evaporation and a significant increase in precipitation worldwide resulting in the frequent occurrence of extreme precipitation events which have an obvious socio economic impact and serious consequences araya osses et al 2020 therefore it is important to understand the effects of climate change on spatiotemporal evolutionary trends of extreme precipitation under different emission patterns extreme precipitation events refer to events that occur less frequently in a statistical sense when the state of the precipitation is so markedly deviated from its average state compared with normal precipitation extreme precipitation events are characterized by sudden occurrence and severe destruction wang 2015 liu et al 2017 su et al 2021 many recent studies have investigated extreme precipitation some studies analyzed the interannual variation seasonal abundance and dieback of extreme precipitation events using historical observational data for example ferrari et al 2021 conducted in depth analysis of seven different extreme precipitation events that affected the liguria region italy in the past 10 years using numerical simulations with nearly 1 km resolution and the latest non hydrostatic weather rodrigues et al 2021 studied the annual variation of extreme precipitation events and natural disasters in natal brazil in the period 1984 2014 as well as the seasonal variation of abundance and dieback some studies adopted the classical mann kendall trend test and other methods to investigate the spatial distribution of historical extreme precipitation events for example based on daily precipitation data 1961 2017 from 28 meteorological stations in and around the weihe river basin china zou et al 2021 selected six extreme precipitation indices and adopted the mann kendall trend test and wavelet transform method to comprehensively analyze the temporal and spatial evolutionary laws of extreme precipitation in the studied basin alavinia and zarei 2021 analyzed the spatial trends of climate change and the distribution of extreme precipitation events using daily precipitation data 1966 2015 from 37 meteorological stations by the nonparametric mann kendall test and sen s slope method thomas et al 2021 analyzed the characteristics of the indian subcontinent monsoon low pressure system for the period 1979 2015 together with its accompanying extreme precipitation events messmer and simmonds 2021 studied compound extreme events including extreme precipitation on the global scale using 3 hourly era5 reanalysis data 1979 2018 and two independent cyclone detection and tracking algorithms kang et al 2021 studied the change trends of six extreme precipitation indices in relation to the suzhou wuxi changzhou urban agglomeration china for the period 1980 2015 and they estimated the contribution rate of urbanization to extreme precipitation the above studies were all based on historical data in terms of extreme precipitation prediction some studies have used a variety of cmip5 universal global climate models gcms for comparative analysis of future changes in extreme precipitation for example tabari 2021 used 24 cmip5 general gcms to conduct a comparative analysis of the impact of climate change on extreme precipitation indices for the periods 1971 2000 and 2070 2099 some studies have used gcms or regional climate models to study the impact of 1 5 and 2 0 warming on future extreme precipitation for example shi et al 2021 used a gcm to study global extreme precipitation events and their changes in a 1 5 and 2 0 warmer climate based on precipitation data of five gcms under isis mip ding et al 2020 used nine indices including precipitation intensity daily maximum precipitation and frequency of heavy precipitation to evaluate the changes of extreme precipitation in the lancang river basin china under future global warming of 1 5 and 2 0 ao et al 2020 estimated the changes of extreme climate events in northeast china under 1 5 and 2 0 warming scenarios using daily temperature and precipitation data from the regcm4 regional climate model in addition to the impact of warming on future extreme precipitation some studies used cmip5 gcms to investigate the changes of future extreme precipitation under different emission scenarios from the perspective of emission patterns for example amnuaylojaroen 2021 used the output of a nested regional climate model and the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 emission scenarios to calculate five different extreme precipitation indices and explore predicted extreme precipitation in thailand for the period 2020 2029 based on six regional climate simulation systems harpa et al 2019 predicted the changes of three extreme rainfall indices in relation to romania during 2041 2070 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios using 18 cmip5 gcms mo et al 2021 obtained rainfall data through application of the lars wg downscaling model and calculated 11 extreme rainfall indices under two scenarios i e rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the period 2041 2070 generally depending on the particularities of different study regions the above studies analyzed extreme precipitation events during a specific period and studied the influence of temperature rise on extreme precipitation however most studies used only historical data to analyze the spatial and temporal distributions of extreme precipitation and more studies of climate models and emission scenarios are needed moreover current research on extreme precipitation prediction is based mostly on the cmip5 dataset however the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change which was based on the new climate models in cmip6 developed a set of new emission scenarios called shared socioeconomic pathways ssps driven by different social and economic models su et al 2021 li et al 2022 these ssps were developed to replace the four rcps in cmip5 and to increase the simulation accuracy of extreme precipitation amounts in terms of simulation and prediction of extreme precipitation events the cmip6 dataset has better accuracy than the cmip5 dataset cao et al 2012 gusain et al 2020 but comparatively research based on the cmip6 dataset is lacking this study adopted relative threshold ao et al 2020 and frequency intensity duration methods liu et al 2017 to identify and analyze extreme precipitation in the basin using regional precipitation observation data and five cmip6 gcms data from 1960 to 2100 sustainable development moderate development local inconsistent development and conventional development scenarios i e ssp2 6 ssp4 5 ssp7 0 and ssp8 5 respectively gütschow et al 2021 were selected to study the spatial and temporal evolutionary trends of future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin china under different emission scenarios the impact of different emission scenarios on changes in extreme precipitation was also discussed this study is expected to provide a technical reference for the influence evaluation of future extreme precipitation 2 materials 2 1 study area the jialing river originates from qinling mountains and has a total length of 1120 km it runs from north to south through the central part of the sichuan basin and flows into the yangtze river in the city of chongqing the jialing river is the largest tributary of the yangtze river in terms of basin area with an approximate area of 160 000 km2 it is also the second largest tributary in terms of water resources accounting for approximately 17 5 of the yangtze river zhang et al 2021 the elevation of the jialing river basin 29 40 34 30 n 103 30 108 10 e decreases gradually from northwest to southeast this basin has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with southerly winds in summer warm hot temperatures and concentrated periods of heavy rain floods primarily caused by heavy rain in this basin generally have large peak heights and short duration luo and chen 2021 the extreme disastrous weather with increasing frequency in jialing river basin has led to the water environment deterioration and water quality decline wang 2015 therefore the extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin plays an important role in the flood and water environment disasters of the jialing river and the yangtze river the meteorological stations in the jialing river basin and the elevation of the watershed terrain are shown in fig 1 2 2 data source the boundary data river system information and digital elevation model resolution is 30 m of the jialing river basin were downloaded and extracted from the national earth system science data sharing service platform http www geodata cn historical daily precipitation observational data 1960 2020 from 23 stations distributed throughout the jialing river basin were downloaded from the national meteorological science data center https data cma cn and precipitation forecast data in 2021 2100 under four emission scenarios i e ssp2 6 ssp4 5 ssp7 0 and ssp8 5 were

includes determining effective precipitation data counting continuous precipitation data determining an extreme precipitation threshold and identifying extreme precipitation events owing to the spatial variation of the extreme precipitation threshold meteorological stations were adopted as the units with which to identify extreme precipitation events in the basin 1 determining effective precipitation data to calculate the precipitation in the basin daily precipitation greater than 0 1 mm was taken as effective precipitation and such data for each station were counted if the daily precipitation of a meteorological station in the basin is p i then the effective precipitation pe i of the station can be expressed as follows 1 pe i p i i f p i 0 1 m m 2 counting continuous precipitation data the extreme precipitation data lasting for 3 days 3d 5 days 5d and 7 days 7d can be achieved by counting the continuous effective precipitation data using the sliding accumulation method the effective precipitation series for several consecutive days are pe i pe i 1 pe i 2 pe i 3 pe i n and then the continuous precipitation p 3 d i p 5 d i and p 7 d i of 3d 5d and 7d at a meteorological station can each be expressed as follows 2 p 3 d i j 0 2 pe i j p 3 d i 1 j 0 2 pe i 1 j 3 p 5 d i j 0 4 pe i j p 5 d i 1 j 0 4 pe i 1 j 4 p 7 d i j 0 6 pe i j p 7 d i 1 j 0 6 pe i 1 j 3 determining extreme precipitation thresholds the percentile method sierks et al 2020 was used to calculate the threshold of extreme precipitation in the basin after obtaining the continuous precipitation series 1d 3d 5d and 7d for each meteorological station in the basin the 95th percentile was taken as the threshold of extreme precipitation for each station that is the first 5 precipitation of the whole time series of each station was identified as the extreme precipitation threshold the continuous precipitation series of a meteorological station can be arranged in an ascending order as follows 5 p 1 d 1 p 1 d 2 p 1 d 3 p 1 d n 1 p 3 d 1 p 3 d 2 p 3 d 3 p 3 d n 3 p 5 d 1 p 5 d 2 p 5 d 3 p 5 d n 5 p 7 d 1 p 7 d 2 p 7 d 3 p 7 d n 7 then the extreme precipitation threshold of the station can be calculated using the following formula where i n t x is the integer of x 6 t 1 d p 1 d int n 1 95 t 3 d p 3 d int n 3 95 t 5 d p 5 d int n 5 95 t 7 d p 7 d int n 7 95 4 identifying extreme precipitation events precipitation exceeding the threshold of extreme precipitation was defined as the extreme precipitation of each meteorological station pex 1 3 5 7 d i which can be expressed as follows 7 pex 1 d i p 1 d i i f p 1 d i t 1 d i 1 n 1 pex 3 d i p 3 d i i f p 3 d i t 3 d i 1 n 3 pex 5 d i p 5 d i i f p 5 d i t 5 d i 1 n 5 pex 7 d i p 7 d i i f p 7 d i t 7 d i 1 n 7 3 2 processing and validation of cmip6 data the spatial resolution of the data provided by the cmip6 models is relatively low and thus downscaling was needed to improve the spatial resolution of the precipitation data gusain et al 2020 historical observational data were used to correct the deviation of the simulated data to meet the accuracy requirements of the simulation of extreme precipitation in the basin a software cmhyd https swat tamu edu software cmhyd was used for data extraction and model data downscaling to the actual locations of the meteorological stations in this study this tool embeds eight deviation correction methods for simulation results such as linear scaling delta change correction precipitation local intensity scaling power transformation of precipitation and distribution mapping of precipitation teutschbein and seibert 2012 singh et al 2021 through comparing the simulated data with historical observational data the delta change correction method had the highest processing accuracy and the smallest error and it was finally adopted to the model deviation correction in the jialing river basin the cmip6 gcms daily precipitation data 1960 2014 in the jialing river basin were compared with the historical observational data in the same period to evaluate the capability of the model to simulate extreme precipitation a total of 20 gcms were screened by trial calculation in this study three indices of total amount frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation from 1960 to 2014 in each model were simulated respectively and compared with the historical measured results according to the relative errors and the spatial efficiency metric value between the simulations and the measurements the top five cmip6 gcms access cm2 bcc csm2 mr cmcc esm2 inm cm4 8 and miorc6 were determined as final models in order to improve the simulation accuracy the predictions of five gcms were coupled to get the mean value of extreme precipitation for each scenario the annual average of the three indices including extreme precipitation extreme precipitation frequency and intensity were calculated to determine the overall level of consistency between the modelled and observational data in the jialing river basin the model credible degree was distinguished by the relative errors the spatial efficiency metric spaef method was adopted to explore the spatial simulation ability of the model which is an index to evaluate the spatial performance of the model from correlation variability and bias ahmed et al 2019 demirel et al 2018 methods for evaluation indices were as follows 1 average if x i is the climate variable of interannual variation and n is the time scale in years corresponding to x i the mean value x can be used to represent the average level of the sample the calculation formula is as follows 8 x 1 n i 1 n x i 2 relative error the absolute error δ is expressed as the difference between model simulation results x m and the observed data value x o the relative error can be obtained by dividing the absolute error δ by the observed data value x o 9 δ δ x o 100 10 δ x m x o 3 spatial efficiency metric spaef spaef is a commonly used metric in hydrological modelling to evaluate discharge simulations it is characterized by three equally weighted components i e correlation α variability β and bias γ the calculation formula is as follows 11 s p a e f 1 α 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 12 α x x y y x x 2 y y 2 13 β σ gcm μ gcm σ obs μ obs 14 γ j 1 n m i n k j l j j 1 n k j where α is the pearson correlation coefficient between observed and gcm simulated data β is the coefficient of variation representing spatial variability σ and μ are the standard deviation and expectation of data respectively γ is the intersection of the historical measurement k and the gcm model simulation l the values of spaef is in the range of 1 where a value closer to 1 indicates higher spatial similarity between the observations and simulations 3 3 spatiotemporal evolution of extreme precipitation under different emission scenarios a precipitation series in a basin is a nonlinear nonstationary series that contains various periodic and trend components in the process of studying the change trend of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin from 2021 to 2100 four different emission scenarios were selected i e ssp2 6 ssp4 5 ssp7 0 and ssp8 5 the outputs of the four emission scenarios were compared with each other to reveal the detailed change trend of future basin extreme precipitation in the process of simulating extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin from 2021 to 2100 under the four emission scenarios extreme precipitation at each of the 23 meteorological stations was extracted using threshold values extreme precipitation of whole basin was obtained by summing the extreme precipitation of all stations each year extreme point symmetric mode decomposition esmd li and yue 2020 was used to analyze the characteristics of trend and periodicity of the total extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin in the trend analysis the adaptive global mean and linear fitting methods were used to reveal the change of future extreme precipitation in the analysis of periodicity the periodic components were used to examine the periodicity of future extreme precipitation and the upper envelope was taken to represent the corresponding fluctuation amplitudes of different periodic components the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation were calculated annually to facilitate assessment of the level of future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin absolute intensity was adopted in this study i e daily precipitation exceeding the threshold value of extreme precipitation was defined directly as the intensity of extreme precipitation liu et al 2017 the annual average frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation in the basin were counted in terms of the meteorological stations and the spatial distributions of extreme precipitation frequency and intensity in the basin were analyzed using the isoline method in arcgis the specific analysis and calculation method were shown below 1 extreme point symmetric mode decomposition esmd the esmd was used to study the trend and periodic variation characteristics of the discrete time series by determining the position and number of poles the climate variable x t is decomposed into the trend component r t and the modal component m i t affected by the number of poles i which can be expressed as follows 15 x t m i t r t the periodic component m i t and the optimal adaptive global mean curve r t were obtained by multiple decomposition the fast fourier transform was used to calculate the power spectrum of the decomposed different modal components the frequency of the climate variable x t signal was obtained according to the magnitude of the amplitude and the average period of each modal component was calculated the formula for calculation of the power spectrum p n ω can be expressed as follows 16 p n ω 1 n o n ω 2 17 o n ω v 0 n 1 o n v e j ω where n is the sample size of climate variable x t o n v is the energy finite signal o n ω is the frequency value of the fast fourier transform of o n v v is the random analog signal and ω is the signal frequency of the fast fourier transform the signals of different periods were separated using frequency domain transformation and the graphs of the different periodic components in the temporal domain were obtained the envelope of the graph was used to represent the corresponding amplitude of each periodic component 2 temporal frequency the temporal frequency of extreme precipitation f i t i 1 3 5 7 t 2021 2100 is the number of extreme precipitation in the entire basin in each year which was used to reveal the temporal variation of extreme precipitation frequency the formula for its calculation can be expressed as follows 18 f i t j 1 n f i j t where i represents the duration of extreme precipitation unit d n is the number of meteorological stations in the basin t represents the time scale in years and f i j t is the frequency of extreme precipitation at each meteorological station in each year 3 spatial frequency the spatial extreme precipitation frequency f i j i 1 3 5 7 j 1 n is the average number of extreme precipitation at j th meteorological station in years which was used to represent the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation frequency the formula for its calculation can be expressed as follows 19 f i j 1 t t 1 t f i j t where t is the total year of simulation from 2021 to 2100 equaling 80 4 temporal intensity the temporal extreme precipitation intensity i i t i 1 3 5 7 is the average intensity of extreme precipitation in the entire basin in a year which was used to represent the temporal variation of extreme precipitation intensity the formula for its calculation can be expressed as follows 20 i i t j 1 n p i j t f i t i 1 3 5 7 t 1 t where p i j t is the extreme precipitation data with different durations for a station in one year 5 spatial intensity the spatial

model simulation capability based on the observed and simulated daily precipitation data of the base period 1960 2014 each index of extreme precipitation for 1d 3d 5d and 7d over the jialing river basin was calculated the capabilities of the gcms in terms of spatial and temporal simulation were evaluated from the perspectives of average annual precipitation extreme precipitation frequency and extreme precipitation intensity the calibration results are presented in tables 1 2 as seen from table 1 and table 2 the five gcms selected in this paper have good spatial and temporal correlation in the jialing river basin the relative errors are within 10 and the spaef values are close to 1 in order to simplify the calculation and improve the simulation accuracy five models are coupled and the average value of each model simulation result is taken as the result of the coupling model the results are presented in tables 3 5 the calibration results show that there is little difference between the simulated average annual precipitation and the actual situation and that the coupled model can better simulate the overall magnitude of precipitation in the basin the average values of extreme precipitation frequency and intensity are similar and the maximum relative error is 6 58 which has strong robustness the minimum value of spaef is 0 45 and there is also a strong spatial correlation the results indicate that the coupled model is well capable of simulating the spatial and temporal distributions and variation tendencies of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin 4 2 variation characteristics of future extreme precipitation under four emission scenarios 4 2 1 trends of the amount of extreme precipitation precipitation exceeding the threshold of extreme precipitation was counted and the average of the annual extreme precipitation at each station was taken as the total amount of extreme precipitation in the basin in one year the overall trends of future extreme precipitation during 2021 2100 under four emission scenarios are shown in fig 2 in the future average extreme precipitation at each station in the jialing river basin shows an increasing trend over time under different emission scenarios the averaged extreme precipitation in the next 80 years would be 423 68 19 98 mm 433 85 20 49 mm 440 75 17 16 mm and 460 99 6 32 mm with the average growth rate of 8 3 mm 10a 8 7 mm 10a 11 4 mm 10a and 21 8 mm 10a for ssp2 6 ssp4 5 ssp7 0 and ssp8 5 respectively average extreme precipitation at the end of the 21st century will be 504 99 mm ssp2 6 506 51 mm ssp4 5 513 11 mm ssp7 0 and 549 98 mm ssp8 5 4 2 2 the period and amplitude of extreme precipitation periodicity refers to the phenomenon that the historical evolution of a hydrological element appears again after a certain period it should be noted that the cycle mentioned in this paper is not a cycle in the strict mathematical sense but the variation of hydrological elements in certain time periods and after certain time intervals a similar change trend appears again thus periodicity itself is not permanent in the change of time the above results show that the average extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin from 2021 to 2100 is 423 68 19 98 mm ssp2 6 433 85 20 49 mm ssp4 5 440 75 17 16 mm ssp7 0 and 460 99 6 32 mm ssp8 5 on this basis esmd was used to decompose the extreme precipitation series and remove the trend component and the periodic components of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin under the four emission scenarios were obtained as shown in fig 3 as seen in fig 3 under the four scenarios the future extreme precipitation series is divided into three different periodic modes the characteristics of the period and average amplitude of each mode are described in the table 6 the change in extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin is likely to be considerable in the next 80 years although the predicted extreme precipitation shows an upward trend in general there are many periodic modes of fluctuation and the fluctuation range is large in some years extreme precipitation might be much higher than expected and in some future years extreme precipitation might be lower than the present situation because the amplitude range is much greater than the growth rate the period of each mode is relatively stable the amplitude fluctuation of extreme precipitation with small cycles could occur easily whereas the amplitude fluctuation of extreme precipitation with large cycles would occur less often 4 2 3 trends of future extreme precipitation frequency and intensity when analyzing the change characteristics of the frequency of extreme precipitation the total number of extreme precipitation events at all stations in the basin was taken as the frequency of extreme precipitation in the basin in any specific year then the variation trend of extreme precipitation frequency under the four emission scenarios during 2021 2100 was obtained using esmd fig 4 in the next 80 years the frequency of extreme precipitation would fluctuate over the entire basin the frequency of extreme precipitation with 1d duration is 212 05 5 27 times a ssp2 6 204 97 11 42 times a ssp4 5 201 84 3 57 times a ssp7 0 and 208 84 3 00 times a ssp8 5 the frequency of extreme precipitation with 3d duration is 95 19 14 09 times a ssp2 6 87 16 8 26 times a ssp4 5 83 18 8 56 times a ssp7 0 and 89 82 3 41 times a ssp8 5 the frequency of extreme precipitation with 5d duration is 40 46 6 83 times a ssp2 6 40 04 6 17 times a ssp4 5 37 25 4 29 times a ssp7 0 and 41 54 4 00 times a ssp8 5 the frequency of extreme precipitation with 7d duration is 18 85 6 54 times a ssp2 6 19 96 7 38 times a ssp4 5 18 80 4 45 times a ssp7 0 and 19 15 4 39 times a ssp8 5 from 1d to 7d the frequency of extreme precipitation decreases gradually for any station in the basin the annual average frequency of extreme precipitation events is shown in table 7 the present extreme precipitation frequency is 208 13 times a 88 26 times a 37 86 times a and 18 43 times a for 1d 3d 5d and 7d duration respectively as seen from table 7 the frequency distribution of future extreme precipitation at one point in jialing river basin is as follows the extreme precipitation with 1d duration is about 8 9 times per year the extreme precipitation with 3d duration is about 3 4 times the extreme precipitation with 5d duration is about 1 2 times and extreme precipitation with 7d duration is less than one multi day extreme precipitation intensity is the sum of multi day precipitation then the variation trend of extreme precipitation intensity with time under four emission scenarios during 2021 2100 was obtained using esmd fig 5 the trend of extreme precipitation intensity in the next 80 years fluctuated and the longer the precipitation lasted the more severe the fluctuation fluctuations in intensity increased with emission levels the duration of extreme precipitation changed from 1d to 7d and the intensity gradually increased the intensity of 1d extreme precipitation was approximately 47 76 0 98 mm ssp2 6 47 97 3 21 mm ssp4 5 48 78 5 40 mm ssp7 0 and 50 78 8 78 mm ssp8 5 the intensity of 3d extreme precipitation was approximately 113 44 1 03 mm ssp2 6 116 18 3 07 mm ssp4 5 117 12 8 34 mm ssp7 0 and 124 16 13 44 mm ssp8 5 the intensity of 5d extreme precipitation was approximately 160 12 0 60 mm ssp2 6 166 02 3 19 mm ssp4 5 164 95 5 90 mm ssp7 0 and 175 63 19 45 mm ssp8 5 the intensity of 7d extreme precipitation was approximately 186 72 0 89 mm ssp2 6 191 91 3 34 mm ssp4 5 175 38 12 52 mm ssp7 0 and 204 51 13 92 mm ssp8 5 the intensity of predicted extreme precipitation with duration of 1d 3d 5d and 7 d was greater than the current corresponding intensity 4 2 4 spatial distribution of future extreme precipitation frequency and intensity the spatial distributions of extreme precipitation frequency in the jialing river basin under the four emission scenarios during 2021 2100 are shown in fig 6 as seen in fig 6 under the four global emission scenarios the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation frequency decreases from southeast to northwest the frequency of extreme precipitation decreased with the increase of precipitation duration from 1d to 7d the spatial peak of 1d and 3d extreme precipitation frequency was distributed in the southern part of the basin while the peak of 5d and 7d extreme precipitation frequency was distributed in the southeastern part of the basin the reason for this spatial distribution may be that influenced by the southeast pacific monsoon the air humidity in the southeast part of the basin is higher so the frequency of continuous multi day precipitation increases the area where the frequency of daily extreme precipitation reached 10 times per year accounted for 40 ssp2 6 26 ssp4 5 4 ssp7 0 and 21 ssp8 5 of the total watershed area the proportion of area of extreme precipitation frequency in the future was smaller than that in the historical scenario the spatial distributions of average extreme precipitation intensity over the jialing river basin in 2021 2100 under the four emission scenarios are shown in fig 7 in the next 80 years the extreme precipitation intensity in the jialing river basin is likely to decrease spatially from the southeast to the northwest showing a center radial shape and the intensity center would be in the southeast of the watershed the intensity of extreme precipitation would increase gradually with the continuous transition from 1d to 7d the areas with extreme precipitation intensity of 75 mm 1d accounted for 30 ssp2 6 33 ssp4 5 36 ssp7 0 and 42 ssp8 5 of the total watershed area areas of 125 mm 3d intensity accounted for 61 ssp2 6 65 ssp4 5 67 ssp7 0 and 63 ssp8 5 the proportion of areas with an intensity of 175 mm 5d was 60 ssp2 6 69 ssp4 5 69 ssp7 0 and 74 ssp8 5 the proportion of zones up to 250 mm 7d was 57 ssp2 6 49 ssp4 5 55 ssp7 0 and 36 ssp8 5 compared with the historical observations the area of extreme precipitation intensity in the future would be larger 5 discussion 5 1 discussion of different emission scenarios the ssps represent a new set of emission scenarios driven by different socioeconomic models developed using the new cmip6 climate models the ssps replace the rcps of cmip5 and represent an important upgrade to cmip6 in this study the sustainable development scenario ssp2 6 moderate development scenario ssp4 5 local inconsistent development scenario ssp7 0 and conventional development scenario ssp8 5 were selected the frequency and intensity of future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin under the four emission scenarios are compared in figs 8 and 9 respectively in terms of the frequency of extreme precipitation the frequency peak under ssp8 5 was the highest and the frequency peaks under other scenarios were not very different indicating that with the increase of emission level the maximum level of extreme precipitation frequency was basically unchanged but excessive emission level could lead to an increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation as emission levels increase the average frequency decreased except for the ssp8 5 emission scenario which increased relative to the ssp7 0 scenario it showed that with the increase of the emission level the total level of extreme precipitation frequency in the jialing river basin decreased but when the emission level is too high ssp8 5 the frequency of extreme precipitation increased the median frequency decreased with increasing emission levels except for the ssp8 5 scenario which was greater than the median frequency for the ssp7 0 scenario the median frequency decreased with increasing emission levels except for the ssp8 5 scenario which was greater than the median frequency for the ssp7 0 scenario it showed that the occurrence probability of extreme precipitation decreased with the emission level however when the emission level reached the level of the ssp8 5 scenario the probability of extreme precipitation events would increase generally the frequency of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin showed a dramatic change trend in the next 80 years the frequency of extreme precipitation decreased with the emission level but when the emission level was too high ssp8 5 the frequency of extreme precipitation increased again in terms of extreme precipitation intensity the peak value of extreme precipitation intensity generally increased with the increase of emission level the extreme precipitation intensity fluctuates for some durations and the amplitude of extreme precipitation intensity for multiple days was larger with the increase of the emission level the average value of the extreme precipitation intensity would gradually increase indicating that the magnitude of the extreme precipitation intensity in the jialing river basin increased with the emission level and the development pattern of increasing emissions would lead to the occurrence of high intensity extreme precipitation events the median intensity increased with emission levels indicating a greater probability of extreme precipitation in developmental models with high emission levels 5 2 comparative discussion of future and historical changes in extreme precipitation 5 2 1 overall change in total extreme precipitation comparing with the historical situation the overall change of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin in the future was assessed the annual average of total extreme precipitation in jialing river basin from 1960 to 2020 and the average of total extreme precipitation under different emission scenarios from 2021 to 2100 were calculated and the mean of total extreme precipitation in jialing river basin under different emission scenarios and time scales was shown in fig 10 table 8 shows the relative change rate of total extreme precipitation in the future with respect to history as seen from figs 3 10 and tables 4 5 under the four emission scenarios extreme precipitation in jialing river basin would be greater than the historical situation in the next 80 years specifically the precipitation growth rate of 1d extreme precipitation was small while that of multi day extreme precipitation was large indicating that the probability of long term extreme precipitation events in the jialing river basin would be greater than the historical situation in the future 5 2 2 overall change in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation the change rates of the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation during 2021 2100 under the four emission scenarios in comparison with the base period are listed in table 9 compared with history the future extreme precipitation frequency overall decline under different emission scenarios the largest decline rate would be 2 40 ssp2 6 6 39 ssp4 5 10 67 ssp7 0 and 3 88 ssp8 5 future extreme precipitation intensity would increase the largest increase rate would be 15 43 ssp2 6 19 68 ssp4 5 18 91 ssp7 0 and 26 61 ssp8 5 compared with the rate of frequency decrease the growth rate of intensity was larger indicating that the future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin would generally increase the frequency of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin would decrease but the intensity of single precipitation might be increase indicating that the future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin would be more disastrous generally the frequency of future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin would decrease but its intensity is likely to increase extreme precipitation in the basin would become more intense 5 3 comparative discussion with previous studies on jialing river basin in recent years the global climate has changed dramatically which has aggravated the uneven spatialtemporal distribution of water resources the study of bador et al 2020 pointed out that global extreme hydrometeorological events show a polarized development i e the intensity of both extreme droughts and extreme precipitation is increasing as the jialing river basin is located in a typical monsoon climate zone floods induced by precipitation are prominent the results of this study show that the total amount of extreme precipitation shows an increasing trend and the intensity of extreme precipitation is also increasing in this area the overall trend of precipitation in this basin is consistent with the global changes which is a concrete manifestation of the global climate in a local area focusing on the extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin luo and chen 2021 used the mann kendall analysis method to study the changing trend of the extreme precipitation days in the basin based on the measured precipitation data from 1960 to 2015 accordingly the results indicate that the historical extreme precipitation days show a decreasing trend and the change rate of rainstorm days is 2 55 times 10a this conclusion is basically consistent with the finding in this study that is the frequency of 1d extreme precipitation under the ssp2 6 scenario is decreased of 2 44 furthermore based on the measured precipitation data from 1961 to 2010 zeng et al 2014 has studied the changing trends of the maximum 1d precipitation and the annual maximum 3d precipitation in the jialing river basin by using the mann kendall analysis method they found that the maximum 1d and 3d precipitation in the basin is on the rise and the mann kendall values the significant interval is 1 69 are 2 00 and 1 73 respectively both showing a significant upward trend in this study the extreme precipitation intensity on the 1d and 3d also show an increasing trend with a growth rate of 4 57 and 13 57 ssp2 6 respectively 6 conclusions in this study the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin china from 2021 to 2100 were predicted by five cmip6 gcms four emission scenarios i e ssp2 6 ssp4 5 ssp7 0 and ssp8 5 respectively were considered to study its effects on extreme precipitation the main conclusions derived are as follows 1 the simulation of interannual variation showed that the average extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin would be 423 68 19 98 mm ssp2 6 433 85 20 49 mm ssp4 5 440 75 17 16 mm ssp7 0 and 460 99 6 32 mm ssp8 5 over the next 80 years with an increase rate of 8 3 mm 10a ssp2 6 8 7 mm 10a ssp4 5 11 4 mm 10a ssp7 0 and 21 8 mm 10a ssp8 5 respectively future extreme precipitation presented strong periodic characteristics exhibiting three periodic components with period of approximately 2 3 4 6 and 9 12 years the overall frequency of extreme precipitation is projected to decrease the overall intensity of extreme precipitation might increase the largest increase rate would be 15 43 ssp2 6 19 68 ssp4 5 18 91 ssp7 0 and 26 61 ssp8 5 for 5d duration 3 the simulation results of the spatial distribution showed that the frequency of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin over the next 80 years would decrease from south to north the extreme precipitation intensity is likely to decrease spatially from the southeast to the northwest showing a center radial shape and the center of rainfall intensity would appear in the southeast of the basin 4 the emission level has considerable influence on future extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin with an increase in emission levels in the future the frequency of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin would decrease but when the emission level is too high ssp8 5 the frequency of extreme precipitation increases again as an increase in emission levels in the future the intensity of extreme precipitation in the jialing river basin may continue to increase the fluctuation might become more intense and the magnitude would increase 5 compared with historical scenarios the total amount of extreme precipitation would increase in the future the precipitation growth rate of 1d extreme precipitation is small while that of multi day extreme precipitation is large with the maximum growth rate of 6 47 1d 20 97 3d 24 72 5d and 21 62 7d compared with the historical situation the frequency of extreme precipitation in the future is likely to decrease and extreme precipitation intensity would increase credit authorship contribution statement shanghong zhang resources supervision funding acquisition
