4845,co2 geologic storage in deep saline aquifers is a promising technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and maintain the pace of economic development the dissolution and convection of co2 injected into brines are the primary trapping mechanisms to enhance storage efficiency and provide long term storage security the spatial mass transfer characteristics of convection in porous media remain poorly understood in this study two kinds of analogous fluid pairs were used as the equivalents of co2 saturated brine and in situ brine density driven convection experiments using magnetic resonance imaging mri technology in heterogeneous porous media were performed at various stages including the diffusion stage the unstable trigger stage and the convection development stage combined with the spatial evolution of the fingers and the change in mri mean intensity the local fluid concentration and overall mass transfer behavior could be quantified physical quantities associated with mass transfer by convection such as the mixing layer thickness and scalar dissipation rate at the diffusion stages the onset time at the unstable trigger stage the average velocity of the front finger the finger number the transverse concentration gradient of the finger and the sweep area of the finger at the convection development stage were also analyzed systematically we found that convective mixing substantially promotes mass transfer over pure diffusion and the dissolution rate can be further enhanced by improving the injection method at each stage the range of ra in this study covers most co2 capture and storage ccs sites and can provide basic data for engineering applications keywords geological storage density driven convection mass transfer mri dissolution rates 1 introduction co2 capture and storage ccs technology has the potential to significantly slow the pace of global climate change by reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas mainly co2 emissions this technology involves injecting compressed co2 or supercritical co2 scco2 a critical temperature of 304 13 k and a critical pressure of 7 38 mpa into a deep saline aquifer causing convective mixing between co2 and formation fluids e g brine during the late stage of deployment among the various factors that may limit co2 storage efficiency the mass transfer behavior of co2 and the formed brine plays a significant role in affecting plume development the co2 dissolution rate and storage safety in a deep saline aquifer the convective mixing process mainly includes three stages the diffusion unstable trigger and convection development stages the schematic diagram of the mass transfer behavior is shown in fig 1 1 in the diffusion stage stage 1 in the figure the injected co2 can easily spread out laterally varying with time below the caprock co2 molecules diffuse into the brine and further dissolve due to the high solubility of co2 xu et al 2006 in the laboratory the apparent diffusion coefficient was found to increase sharply in the early stage and decrease with time tang et al 2019 kim 2016 considered the effect of swelling when co2 was dissolved into the brine interface motion plays a small role in buoyancy driven convection in slightly dissolved systems and co2 swelling in highly dissolved systems accelerates the onset of unstable interface motion moreover the presence of gas impurities such as a mixture of n2 and co2 reduces the gas solubility and diffusion coefficient which has the opposite effect on the stability of the diffusion boundary layer mahmoodpour et al 2018 during the diffusion stage reactions between co2 rich brine and host mineralogy or precipitating carbonate minerals may change the permeability and porosity of the brine formation ennis king and paterson 2007 further affecting the mass transfer in the subsequent stage the diffusion stage acts as a prerequisite for the occurrence of interface instability and convective mass transfer 2 in the unstable trigger stage stage 2 in the figure the rayleigh number ra a dimensionless parameter of the density gradient is the stability criterion for interface behavior instability occurs when the density gradient exceeds a critical value rac rac 4π2 jiang et al 2019a evidently the reservoir environment song et al 2005 temperature and pressure porous medium properties ennis king et al 2005 teng et al 2017a wettability and heterogeneity fluid properties blair and quinn 1969 mahmoodpour et al 2018 density viscosity and salinity and mineralization reactions ennis king and paterson 2007 can affect fluid instability the onset of transient convective instability has been evaluated by many experimental and simulation studies farajzadeh et al studied the effect of ra and the model aspect ratio on instability by simulation analysis and found that the onset time decreased as ra or the model aspect ratio increased farajzadeh et al 2007 the development of density driven fingering instability and the dynamics of convective dissolution have also been controlled by interface boundary conditions raad et al 2019 the initial wavelength and onset time can be determined by linear stability analysis the double diffusion effect makes the system stable or unstable depending on the values of the diffusion rate and buoyancy ratio kim and song 2017 kim 2015 used linear stability theory and the brinkman equation to predict the convection of hele shaw cells the onset time of convection in hele shaw cells was governed by the ra and brinkman numbers hassanzadeh et al 2006 concluded that the onset time and initial wavelength for high ra at all boundary condition convection instabilities were independent of the thickness of the pores increasing heterogeneity could hinder the onset time of convection and the existence of many low velocity regions in the heterogeneous permeability field reduces convection instability chen et al 2013 furthermore the influence of the geothermal gradient on instability cannot be neglected co2 in a shallow cold basin is conducive to the occurrence of density driven instability and reduces the onset time rasmusson et al 2015 3 in the convection development stage stage 3 in the figure after convection occurs the rate of the co2 front was found to increase first and then decrease monotonously due to the decreased difference in density islam and sun 2015 the time for co2 to reach the bottom of the domain was related to the power law of ra in a deep saline aquifer the local dissolution rate decreases due to the interaction between plume migration and convection which may interfere with the newly emerging fingers and cause the lateral migration of brine elenius et al 2015 the mixing efficiency of natural density driven convection is related to reservoir permeability farajzadeh et al 2011 the total dissolved mass of co2 is higher in heterogeneous reservoirs than in homogeneous reservoirs islam and sun 2015 the dynamic mass transfer behavior in the stages described above provides predictive information for calculating dissolution rates and analyzing the potential of co2 storage however predictions of reservoir time and space scales are difficult to validate because data are generally sparse and the study of mass transfer by convective mixing in real porous media in the laboratory is urgently needed as a nondestructive testing technology mri may provide a new method to observe density driven convective mixing in porous media mri has advantages over the experimental methods mentioned above such as fluid selection diversification and quick and accurate image capture in recent years some new pure phase encoding measurement methods have been development which can offer a wealth of information of fluid behavior in porous media such as self diffusion fridjonsson et al 2012 flow velocity adair et al 2020 o neill et al 2016 and fluid distribution szomolanyi et al 2001 verganelakis et al 2005 behaviors in addition the influence of the use of color indicators on convective mixing kinetics was avoided during the visual experimental work to quantify the convective dissolution characteristics of co2 thomas et al 2015 the consideration of actual reservoir conditions during studies of co2 natural convection presents several limitations thus simplified and convenient experimental methods are necessary analogous fluid systems d2o h2o and mncl2 solution h2o were used in this study to replace the co2 brine system in an aquifer which has been proven to be suitable for co2 natural convection studies jiang et al 2019a raad and hassanzadeh 2015 the processes of density driven convection were visualized in a centimeter scale sand pack using mri equipment while the range of ra was determined by data obtained by referring to the geological reservoir at ccs sites we quantified the evolution of the density driven convection process in three stages the diffusion stage instability occurrence stage and convection development stage except for the basic characteristic parameters of convective mixing such as the mixing layer thickness scalar dissipation rate onset time finger growth velocity and mixing efficiency discussions related to the convection dissolution rate are also provided 2 experimental section 2 1 experimental materials and procedures a high field mri system was used to conduct a convective mixing experiment under normal pressure via the rapid detection of protons in a liquid the magnetic field intensity of the instrument was 9 4 tesla the imaging frequency was 400 mhz and the maximum power provided by the gradient coil was 50 gauss cm in this test the body diameter of the magnetic cavity was 40 mm which can accommodate a vessel with a 30 mm diameter a spin echo multislice pulse sequence sems was used in this study a single slice of 2d mri image data will be obtained every time a sequence is acquired which contains the hydrogen proton density information of a 2 0 mm thick slice the position information of the mri slices in this study can be found in fig s1 see the supporting information compared with 3d images obtained by mri the single slice 2d images with voxel sizes can be acquired quickly which is convenient for quantitative analysis and can also show the development stage of the convective fingers as representative images as has been widely used in the fluid field in previous studies teng et al 2017b wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the main parameters of the sems are listed in table 1 the vessel employed in this study consisted of a nonmagnetic material polymethyl methacrylate with an inside volume of 70 65 ml an inner diameter of 30 mm and a height of 100 mm in addition the experimental system included a rotary vane vacuum and an injection pump with a syringe it is difficult and time consuming to conduct convective mixing experiments for a real fluid system brine saturated with co2 and in situ brine under reservoir conditions in a laboratory thus two simulated fluid pairs mncl2 solution 0 99 wt h2o and d2o h2o were selected to replace the real fluid system with similar density properties see table 2 this experimental method has been proved in the literature jiang et al 2019a teng et al 2017a tsai et al 2013a four kinds of mixed sand consisting of artificial glass beads jiang et al 2019b or artificial plastic beads patmonoaji and suekane 2017 with heterogeneous structures were used to create a wide range of ra values the detailed parameters of the fluids and porous media are shown in table 3 the experimental procedures used for each case are described in this section first the mixed sand was tightly packed into the vessel step 1 the vessel full of sand was placed into a vacuum container with deionized water lighter fluid note that there were open holes at both ends of the vessel to allow the deionized water to completely saturate the porous medium under the vacuum condition step 2 once the porous medium was saturated it was kept vertical on the frame and the dense fluid was slowly injected 0 5 ml min from the bottom to fill half of the vessel step 3 both ends of the vessel were plugged after injection and finally the vessel was inverted and placed into the mri chamber mri images were collected continuously by a lab assistant step 4 the experimental system diagram and the operation steps are shown in fig 2 2 2 image processing the original images obtained by 1h mri scanning were grayscale images of 0 255 the brighter area was liquid water and the darker area was liquid without 1h such as the mncl2 solution mn2 as a paramagnetic ion in a water based solution at a certain concentration is dark in the mri images and d2o 1h and d can be distinguished easily the original mri images were guaranteed to have good quality and a reliable signal to noise ratio first the redundant black background was removed leaving the area of interest from the original image and then the image was enhanced by a gaussian filter to reduce noise these preliminary processed images were used to measure the fluid distribution and perform quantitative analysis the images were further processed in pseudocolor as a schematic diagram of convective mixing evolution the color bar shows the concentration of the fluid distribution 2 3 analysis parameters we defined four measurable parameters for the quantitative analysis of each stage of the convective instability process and compared the corresponding density driven convection behavior under various conditions the parameters were as follows 1 dimensionless time td was defined as td u b φ h t where u b is the maximum buoyancy velocity and defined as u b k δ ρ g μ where k and φ are the sand permeability and porosity respectively δρis the density difference between fluids g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m2 s î¼ is the fluid viscosity h is the vessel length and t is the real time 2 the rayleigh number ra the ratio of buoyancy to diffusivity can characterize the initiation of density driven convective mixing and the degree of instability at fluid contact surfaces convection theoretically occurs when ra 4π2 and is defined as ra h δ ρ g k φ d μ where d is the molecular diffusion coefficient 3 the scalar dissipation rate χ is a global measure of the mixing rate and defined as χ diff w r a 4 π s 02 2 t d ra 1 2 in the early period diffusion stage and χ conv 4 π 1 4 λ c r a convection development stage where w is the dimensionless width w is always equal to 1 s 0 is the dimensionless initial mixing layer thickness and λ c is the dimensionless critical wavelength we assume that s 0 0 to simplify the calculation in this study the detailed parameters can be found in juan s hidalgo et al 2015 study 4 the sherwood number shm the ratio of convection mass flux to diffusion flux is characterized as the co2 dissolution rate and defined as shm f φ δ d h where f φ v δ is the convection flux whose simplified formula is expressed as shm vh d v is the velocity at the contact interface of two fluids and the numerical assumption was equal to the finger growth velocity 3 results 3 1 finger growth patterns the finger dynamics evolution can be quantified by the normalized mri mean intensity the selected area was the upper half of the initial fluid interface while the signal intensity of porous media fully saturated with d2o was 0 the signal intensity of porous media fully saturated with h2o mixed with d2o mass ratio of 1 1 was set to 1 and it was assumed that the signal varies linearly with the mass ratio of the fluid mixture during convection mixing process the variation curve of the normalized mri mean intensity of the selected area with dimensionless time td and mri images obtained in some stages are provided in fig 3 the time varying mri images obtained for a series of convective mixing processes for cases b1 b4 can be found in s1 see the supporting information the different development stages of convection correspond to different change curves and gray values the convective mixing process was mainly divided into three stages diffusion stage ab convection stage bd and steady stage de taking case b1 as an example before the occurrence of interface instability only diffusion dominated mass transfer almost no changes were observed from the mri images and the mean intensity mi of the ab stage remained unchanged the onset time of fingering depended on the properties of the reservoir rock and the fluid once instability was triggered the mis increased rapidly bd stage the fingers with a nearly cylindrical shape moved downward once convection was triggered the fingers expanded merged and split and newly generated fingers could be visualized in this stage interestingly the mis continued to increase with a relatively low slope after point c therefore we subdivided the bd stage into two substages according to the transformation of mis the rapid convection stage bc stage and late mixing stage cd stage a similarly detailed analysis of the stage of local fingers can be found in section 3 3 2 the mass transfer rate in the bc stage was faster than that in the cd stage due to the large density difference between the fluids at the beginning the density difference decreased with mixing indicating the arrival of the cd stage no clear finger boundary was observed from the mri images however a local concentration gradient between the fluids still existed in this stage finally fluid mixing completed when the mis reached the steady state de stage the mis increased when d2o was mixed with h2o because h was evenly distributed in the whole solution and formed a higher concentration region after mixing relative to the initial state namely the porous media saturated by d2o for the different analog fluid system mncl2 h2o can reach a consistent stage of convective mixing 3 2 mass transfer characteristics along the fluid boundary convective mass transfer is dominated by the state of the initial fluid interface as mentioned in section 1 therefore quantification of the interface behavior at the early stage is essential this section mainly introduces the mass transfer process before fingers develop including boundary layer thickening dominated by diffusion the scalar dissipation rate in the diffusion stage corresponding to stage 1 in section 1 and the onset time of the fingering instability corresponding to stage 2 in section 1 3 2 1 mixing layer thickness during the diffusion stage competition between convective compression and diffusive expansion exists for an incompressible fluid system it has been proved that interface deformation is attributable not to the balance of forces but rather to the nonuniform distribution resulting from mixing the fluids wang et al 2018 the unstable fluid interface consists of a downward moving dense fluid a gradually thickening mixing layer and an upward moving light fluid the properties of the fluid and porous media determine the initial unstable state such as the unstable trigger time jiang et al 2019a density of folds and mixing layer thickness δ z nakanishi et al 2016 mri images can capture the change in the mixing layer by the gray value fig 4 shows the definition of δ z based on the mri mean intensity in this study the intensity of the two fluids at the upper and lower ends remained nearly stable and the intensity of the transition zone sloped five lines were selected from left to right for measurement the measurement error is small as shown in the figure the mean value of the five curves was used and the distance between the intersection of two straight lines and a diagonal line was defined as δ z which greatly simplified the complex estimation of δ z however this was based on two assumptions 1 heterogeneity has a small effect on the fluid interface before instability was triggered which was ignored in this test and 2 the initial fluid interface was controlled by the artificial error of the pre injection process which was ignored because the injection rates and injection positions were the same for each case the related details can be found in previous studies lehoux et al 2016 raimbault et al 2020 the mixing layer thickness was calculated in a previous numerical simulation neufeld et al 2010 and experimental method wang et al 2018 using mass balance theory this can be applied in our test but the accuracy of the calculation based on image segmentation should be considered the value of δ z varied with time before the onset time for case a1 as shown in fig 5 a and the error bar in the figure was the average value of the left middle and right sides of the fluid boundary in the experiment the value of δ z thickened with time before instability was triggered and the trend of the curve is nearly linear with r2 0 91 from the perspective of the mixing layer thickness increasing the diffusion rate in unit time will shorten the time to reach convection instability for co2 geological sequestration injection of co2 premixed with brine and injection of co2 with nanoparticles are beneficial for speeding up mixing fig 5 b compares the δ z values of different ra values and found that the maximum δ z value decreased with increasing ra for the same fluid this indicated that interface instability would be triggered earlier for large pores the required δ z value was smaller under large ra conditions when interface instability was triggered which shortened the time scale of convective occurrence in the initial stage 3 2 2 the scalar dissipation rate a mixing process occurred when the initial concentration distribution was uniform when the two fluids were in contact with each other the scalar dissipation rate can quantify the mixing rate and the formula can be found in section 2 3 as summarized from hidalgo et al 2015 work before instability at the fluid interface was triggered the fluid interface remained stable and î increased by diffusion only fig 6 indicates that χ diff decreased with increasing td in the diffusion stage which is consistent with fig 5 a where î increases slowly in the late stage however the mixing rate was independent of time once convection occurred the scalar dissipation rate was higher for lower ra especially for the convection stage this may have been related to the slow movement of fingers which could be fully mixed with the surrounding fluid if given enough time in contrast diffusive mass transfer dominated the early diffusion stage so χ diff was 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than χ conv for each case 3 2 3 onset time the end of the diffusion mixing stage corresponds to the onset time of convection the moment tonset was obtained by using the mri mean value of the fluid interface and the details can be found in a previous study wang et al 2020 fig 7 shows the variation curve of tonset with ra the instability of the contact interface between the two fluids increased with increasing ra accelerating the start of convective mixing because the experimental capture frequency was 102 s slice the instability phenomenon may have occurred during the capture process for case b4 so the results should be neglected in theory tonset was inversely proportional to the square of ra and the difference was the value of the prefactor in some simulation and experimental results emami meybodi et al 2015 c was 1 55 108 as obtained from the fitting curve in this study in contrast the trend of the boundary layer thickness was related to the onset time due to the difference in the fluid contact time although convection was triggered when ra was lower ra 70 81 it was approximately two orders of magnitude larger than when ra 6783 01 a reasonable choice of injection site with high permeability sand or an improved co2 injection method to increase the initial density difference of the fluid may effectively reduce the onset time and increase the co2 dissolution rate 3 3 mass transfer characteristics of finger development the investigation of the temporal and spatial concentration distributions of the fingers and the mass transfer characteristics in the development stage was still challenging this section mainly introduces the mass transfer process in the finger development stage corresponding to stage 3 in section 1 including the driving force at the interface derived from the asymmetric mass flux finger growth velocity and co2 mixing efficiency 3 3 1 vector mass flux using the initial interface as the central boundary white dotted line in fig 8 b we calculated the change in convective mass flux between the upper and lower halves of the fov the change in convective mass flux f at the fluid interface along the width of the vessel for cases b3 and b4 is shown in fig 8 a the mass flux of gravity driven convection downward fingers was set to a positive value and buoyancy driven convection upward fingers was set to a negative value f at the same position was expressed as the vector value of the two added together furthermore the mri images of the fingers at two moments for case b4 are provided in fig 8 b upward fingers and downward fingers exist along the width in both cases taking case b4 as an example gravity was the dominant force at w 14 mm indicating that downward fingers dominate reducing the extent of the counterflow process f at td 0 07 is greater than f at td 0 04 which was favorable for co2 sequestration conversely the downward migration of d2o dense fluid was not favored when the process was buoyancy driven f 0 at w 2 5 mm for case b4 or when gravity was the main driving force first and then buoyancy dominated f 0 at td 0 27 and f 0 at td 0 51 at w 25 mm for case b3 from the specific values of the vector mass flux in the whole slice layer as listed in fig 8 c we can conclude that the fov was dominated by density driven convection on the whole during the convection stage and the vector mass flux was usually greater at large ra values such quantitative analysis may be enlightening for the geological sequestration of co2 so we can infer that more co2 will be dissolved in the brine at the initial phase interface as ra increases reducing the counterflow of the brine and increasing density driven downward fingering flows will be favorable for co2 dissolution processes 3 3 2 finger growth velocity the convection finger growth rate v is related to the mass transfer rate of co2 in the brine note the influence of the rayleigh number on v fig 9 a shows that the average velocity v of the front fingers increases with increasing ra these data contain both the d2o h2o fluid system and mncl2 solution h2o fluid system a higher v value can effectively reduce the time scale of co2 dissolution furthermore fig 9 b plots the dimensionless experimentally obtained time it takes for the front fingers to reach the bottom th versus the different ra values for the sake of comparison th d h2 ts as defined in previous studies faisal et al 2015 farajzadeh et al 2007 where ts is the time it takes for an instability finger to reach the bottom of the fov a power relationship exists between th and ra ra c t s n where c is a constant and n is the exponential term in the formula which is the same tendency observed in the previous study in this study c 0 33 and n 1 09 n 1 in the single phase numerical simulations of farajzadeh et al and n 1 45 in the hele shaw cell experiment of faisal et al 2015 farajzadeh et al 2007 the transverse concentration variation of a dynamic finger helps us understand the mass transfer behavior between the finger and the surrounding fluid the normalized concentration c of one representative finger transverse varies with time for case b1 as shown in fig 10 the selected position was below the initial fluid boundary and the change in the fingers appearing after completely mixing nine times was monitored the normalized concentration c was characterized by the signal intensity of the hydrogen proton density weighted images the signal intensity of porous media fully saturated with h2o brightest was set to 1 and the signal intensity of porous media fully saturated with d2o darkest was 0 the values of the fluid mixtures with different mass ratios were set between 0 and 1 here we assumed that the signal varies linearly with the mass ratio of the fluid mixture c in the center of the selected location gradually decreased with the appearance and continuous downward movement of the front finger and the transverse concentration gradient of note can be noted that the transverse concentration gradient was maximized at td 0 833 in fig 10 a we defined this stage as the local rapid convection stage stage i when td 0 833 in which the shear rates between the two fluids was greater resulting in a lower mixing efficiency of the finger with the surrounding fluid when td 0 833 the boundary between two fluids became less clear and the transverse concentration gradient decreased as seen in fig 10 b this stage is defined as the local late mixing stage stage ii mixing was complete when the curve was almost flat again the c value in the final mixture td 1 768 was less than that in the initial fluid td 0 057 3 3 3 fluid mixing efficiency in addition to the finger growth rate v mentioned above the finger number fn was related to the mass transfer capacity of co2 in the brine this means that a large fn value per unit volume corresponded to a larger contact interface area between the fluids and further enhanced the storage capacity fig 11 shows the variation of the mri images for different numbers of fingers from a single finger to multiple fingers with time at different ra values when there was no interference between the front fingers half of a finger for case a2 and a single finger for case a3 the fluid contact interface depended only on the expansion of the finger combined with the results of the scalar dissipation rate in the convection stage in fig 6 this indicates that the convective and mixing mass transfer efficiencies were lower for low permeability porous media however the mass transfer behavior was different when multiple fingers advanced together during the convection stage more than one finger for cases b2 and b3 the fns increased first due to the time difference in the triggering of instability at the interface and then decreased because of the collision and mixing of adjacent fingers the maximum fns increased with increasing ra as seen in fig 11 in contrast the fluid disturbance increased with increasing mass transfer rates and mixing efficiency in the case of multiple fingers to quantify the sweep area of the fingers fig 12 provides the mass fraction of the downward fingers represented as a lh where a is the increased area below the fluid interface and l and h are the width and length of the vessel respectively as a function of td before the main finger reached the bottom the mass fraction of the downward fingers did not change much initially and diffusion was the main mass transfer mechanism in this stage the curve then increased almost linearly note that the inflection point changed more smoothly when ra was small although multiple fingers could theoretically facilitate mixing during the convection stage the mass fraction of the multiple downward fingers before the main finger reached the bottom was the smallest a lhmax 43 5 for case a3 and a lhmax 66 2 for case b3 therefore during the convection of the co2 brine system in the reservoir the effect of competition between the co2 sweep area and mixing efficiency on mass transfer is worth discussing because a larger sweep area can enhance the co2 dissolution volume in the unit volume of the reservoir 4 discussion 4 1 sherwood number the total co2 dissolution rate of convective mixing can be characterized by shm which can be used to relate the laboratory observations to the field settings fig 13 b shows the power law relationship between ra and shm with a comparison of previous results from the literature the range of ra mainly focused on 40 7000 and accounted for 73 5 of the 34 ccs sites covered in this paper including the saline aquifers in the usa alberta basin and the sleipner site in the north sea which were summarized in the work of szulczewski et al 2012 and liyanage et al 2019 the probability distributions are shown in fig 13 a this range was more likely to be expected deep in the potential ccs sites and the results in this paper can provide basic data for project applications the curve was fit by shm arab where a 0 155 and b 0 997 the total co2 dissolution rate increased with increasing ra which is consistent with previous research convection was the main co2 mass transfer process and was favored over molecular diffusion as ra increased this indicates that compared with the larger sweep area at low ra values the higher finger growth velocity and mixing efficiency at large ra values were more dominant in mass transfer compared to that of experimental studies using analogous fluids teng et al and tsai et al the shm of the present study was slightly lower due to the different properties of the fluid especially those of the fluid used for the viscosity contrast the difference between the assumptions of the model and the boundary conditions using the numerical simulation methods caused the shm values to be higher or lower than the those of this study jerome et al and hewitt et al moreover differences in the size of the experimental vessel may also cause the errors of the results as discussed above the prediction of shm was essential for the time scale of dissolution the dissolution rate of the lower ra range based on the experimental method was supplemented in this section which can also provide data to support the simulation analysis 4 2 dissolution rates the convective mixing process can enhance the dissolution rate dr in a deep saline aquifer and greatly reduce the time scale of co2 dissolution fig 14 compares the dr of the convection process with that of the pure diffusion process with reference to the results of liyanage et al 2019 the experimental method was similar to ours the purely diffusive scenario was the numerical solution in their paper and the blue asterisks denote the maximum dissolution rates determined from their results we plotted the dr variation with time in three cases with different ra values which was equal to the mass of the downward moving dense fluid divided by the duration of the process we assumed that the space was consistent with that of liyanage et al for the sake of comparison the initial dr of the curve decreased and was almost consistent with the trend of the diffusion curve the curve transformed after the onset time and then peaked in the convection stage cases b2 and b3 however the diffusion process could hardly be observed at large ra instability occurred in the beginning and the maximum dissolution rate drmax was reached case b4 for the d2o h2o fluid system in this study drmax 0 33 g min at 117 3 min for ra 558 88 8 02 times the diffusion rate drmax 0 79 g min at 22 1 min for ra 2073 23 8 10 times the diffusion rate and drmax 9 58 g min at 1 7 min for ra 6783 01 28 60 times the diffusion rate in summary drmax promoted by convective mixing was several to dozens of times higher than the diffusion rate for the ra range in this article which may correspond to thousands or tens of thousands of years under reservoir conditions 5 conclusions secure and efficient co2 storage in deep saline aquifers can be affected by the mass transfer of the convective mixing process so this characteristic at various stages requires a systematic investigation by visualizing the convective mixing process in heterogeneous porous media using analogous fluids the temporal and spatial variations of the fingers were determined and the mass transfer characteristics in the diffusion stage the unstable trigger stage and the convection development stage were analyzed in detail 1 three stages were found during the convective mixing process according to the mis the diffusion stage convection stage including two substages the rapid convection stage and late mixing stage and steady stage the mis tended to increase with different degrees during the process 2 during the diffusion stage the mixing layer thickness δ z increased with time before instability was triggered and the variation trend seemed to be nonlinear the scalar dissipation rate χ diff was a function of time and decreased with increasing td indicating that the thickening rates of δ z became slow δ z decreased with increasing ra for the same fluid 3 the onset time was inversely proportional to the square of ra the value of prefactor a was 1 55 108 as obtained from the fitting curve in this study the quick triggering of instability at large ra is useful for the safe storage of co2 4 during the convection development stage it was advantageous when the density driven mass flux was greater than the buoyancy the average velocity v of the front fingers increased with increasing ra and the higher v value could effectively reduce the time scale of co2 dissolution there was a power relationship between the time it took for the front fingers to reach the bottom and ra and these results are consistent with previous studies the transverse concentration gradient of a front finger increased first at one position which was accompanied by a larger shear rate between the fluids with increasing mixing strength in the later stage the transverse concentration gradient decreased until mixing was complete moreover for different permeable reservoirs the maximum number of fingers increased with ra and fingers collided with each other to enhance mass transfer however the sweep area was found to be larger for lower ra values with little interaction between fingers the total co2 dissolution rate increased with ra which indicated that the higher finger growth velocity and mixing efficiency at large ra were more dominant in mass transfer than the larger sweep area at low ra the curve was fit by shm arab where a 0 155 and b 0 997 the range of ra values covers most ccs sites which can provide basic data for engineering applications and simulation studies in addition drmax promoted by convective mixing was several to dozens of times higher than the diffusion rate for the ra range in this article which substantially shortens the time

4845,co2 geologic storage in deep saline aquifers is a promising technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and maintain the pace of economic development the dissolution and convection of co2 injected into brines are the primary trapping mechanisms to enhance storage efficiency and provide long term storage security the spatial mass transfer characteristics of convection in porous media remain poorly understood in this study two kinds of analogous fluid pairs were used as the equivalents of co2 saturated brine and in situ brine density driven convection experiments using magnetic resonance imaging mri technology in heterogeneous porous media were performed at various stages including the diffusion stage the unstable trigger stage and the convection development stage combined with the spatial evolution of the fingers and the change in mri mean intensity the local fluid concentration and overall mass transfer behavior could be quantified physical quantities associated with mass transfer by convection such as the mixing layer thickness and scalar dissipation rate at the diffusion stages the onset time at the unstable trigger stage the average velocity of the front finger the finger number the transverse concentration gradient of the finger and the sweep area of the finger at the convection development stage were also analyzed systematically we found that convective mixing substantially promotes mass transfer over pure diffusion and the dissolution rate can be further enhanced by improving the injection method at each stage the range of ra in this study covers most co2 capture and storage ccs sites and can provide basic data for engineering applications keywords geological storage density driven convection mass transfer mri dissolution rates 1 introduction co2 capture and storage ccs technology has the potential to significantly slow the pace of global climate change by reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas mainly co2 emissions this technology involves injecting compressed co2 or supercritical co2 scco2 a critical temperature of 304 13 k and a critical pressure of 7 38 mpa into a deep saline aquifer causing convective mixing between co2 and formation fluids e g brine during the late stage of deployment among the various factors that may limit co2 storage efficiency the mass transfer behavior of co2 and the formed brine plays a significant role in affecting plume development the co2 dissolution rate and storage safety in a deep saline aquifer the convective mixing process mainly includes three stages the diffusion unstable trigger and convection development stages the schematic diagram of the mass transfer behavior is shown in fig 1 1 in the diffusion stage stage 1 in the figure the injected co2 can easily spread out laterally varying with time below the caprock co2 molecules diffuse into the brine and further dissolve due to the high solubility of co2 xu et al 2006 in the laboratory the apparent diffusion coefficient was found to increase sharply in the early stage and decrease with time tang et al 2019 kim 2016 considered the effect of swelling when co2 was dissolved into the brine interface motion plays a small role in buoyancy driven convection in slightly dissolved systems and co2 swelling in highly dissolved systems accelerates the onset of unstable interface motion moreover the presence of gas impurities such as a mixture of n2 and co2 reduces the gas solubility and diffusion coefficient which has the opposite effect on the stability of the diffusion boundary layer mahmoodpour et al 2018 during the diffusion stage reactions between co2 rich brine and host mineralogy or precipitating carbonate minerals may change the permeability and porosity of the brine formation ennis king and paterson 2007 further affecting the mass transfer in the subsequent stage the diffusion stage acts as a prerequisite for the occurrence of interface instability and convective mass transfer 2 in the unstable trigger stage stage 2 in the figure the rayleigh number ra a dimensionless parameter of the density gradient is the stability criterion for interface behavior instability occurs when the density gradient exceeds a critical value rac rac 4π2 jiang et al 2019a evidently the reservoir environment song et al 2005 temperature and pressure porous medium properties ennis king et al 2005 teng et al 2017a wettability and heterogeneity fluid properties blair and quinn 1969 mahmoodpour et al 2018 density viscosity and salinity and mineralization reactions ennis king and paterson 2007 can affect fluid instability the onset of transient convective instability has been evaluated by many experimental and simulation studies farajzadeh et al studied the effect of ra and the model aspect ratio on instability by simulation analysis and found that the onset time decreased as ra or the model aspect ratio increased farajzadeh et al 2007 the development of density driven fingering instability and the dynamics of convective dissolution have also been controlled by interface boundary conditions raad et al 2019 the initial wavelength and onset time can be determined by linear stability analysis the double diffusion effect makes the system stable or unstable depending on the values of the diffusion rate and buoyancy ratio kim and song 2017 kim 2015 used linear stability theory and the brinkman equation to predict the convection of hele shaw cells the onset time of convection in hele shaw cells was governed by the ra and brinkman numbers hassanzadeh et al 2006 concluded that the onset time and initial wavelength for high ra at all boundary condition convection instabilities were independent of the thickness of the pores increasing heterogeneity could hinder the onset time of convection and the existence of many low velocity regions in the heterogeneous permeability field reduces convection instability chen et al 2013 furthermore the influence of the geothermal gradient on instability cannot be neglected co2 in a shallow cold basin is conducive to the occurrence of density driven instability and reduces the onset time rasmusson et al 2015 3 in the convection development stage stage 3 in the figure after convection occurs the rate of the co2 front was found to increase first and then decrease monotonously due to the decreased difference in density islam and sun 2015 the time for co2 to reach the bottom of the domain was related to the power law of ra in a deep saline aquifer the local dissolution rate decreases due to the interaction between plume migration and convection which may interfere with the newly emerging fingers and cause the lateral migration of brine elenius et al 2015 the mixing efficiency of natural density driven convection is related to reservoir permeability farajzadeh et al 2011 the total dissolved mass of co2 is higher in heterogeneous reservoirs than in homogeneous reservoirs islam and sun 2015 the dynamic mass transfer behavior in the stages described above provides predictive information for calculating dissolution rates and analyzing the potential of co2 storage however predictions of reservoir time and space scales are difficult to validate because data are generally sparse and the study of mass transfer by convective mixing in real porous media in the laboratory is urgently needed as a nondestructive testing technology mri may provide a new method to observe density driven convective mixing in porous media mri has advantages over the experimental methods mentioned above such as fluid selection diversification and quick and accurate image capture in recent years some new pure phase encoding measurement methods have been development which can offer a wealth of information of fluid behavior in porous media such as self diffusion fridjonsson et al 2012 flow velocity adair et al 2020 o neill et al 2016 and fluid distribution szomolanyi et al 2001 verganelakis et al 2005 behaviors in addition the influence of the use of color indicators on convective mixing kinetics was avoided during the visual experimental work to quantify the convective dissolution characteristics of co2 thomas et al 2015 the consideration of actual reservoir conditions during studies of co2 natural convection presents several limitations thus simplified and convenient experimental methods are necessary analogous fluid systems d2o h2o and mncl2 solution h2o were used in this study to replace the co2 brine system in an aquifer which has been proven to be suitable for co2 natural convection studies jiang et al 2019a raad and hassanzadeh 2015 the processes of density driven convection were visualized in a centimeter scale sand pack using mri equipment while the range of ra was determined by data obtained by referring to the geological reservoir at ccs sites we quantified the evolution of the density driven convection process in three stages the diffusion stage instability occurrence stage and convection development stage except for the basic characteristic parameters of convective mixing such as the mixing layer thickness scalar dissipation rate onset time finger growth velocity and mixing efficiency discussions related to the convection dissolution rate are also provided 2 experimental section 2 1 experimental materials and procedures a high field mri system was used to conduct a convective mixing experiment under normal pressure via the rapid detection of protons in a liquid the magnetic field intensity of the instrument was 9 4 tesla the imaging frequency was 400 mhz and the maximum power provided by the gradient coil was 50 gauss cm in this test the body diameter of the magnetic cavity was 40 mm which can accommodate a vessel with a 30 mm diameter a spin echo multislice pulse sequence sems was used in this study a single slice of 2d mri image data will be obtained every time a sequence is acquired which contains the hydrogen proton density information of a 2 0 mm thick slice the position information of the mri slices in this study can be found in fig s1 see the supporting information compared with 3d images obtained by mri the single slice 2d images with voxel sizes can be acquired quickly which is convenient for quantitative analysis and can also show the development stage of the convective fingers as representative images as has been widely used in the fluid field in previous studies teng et al 2017b wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the main parameters of the sems are listed in table 1 the vessel employed in this study consisted of a nonmagnetic material polymethyl methacrylate with an inside volume of 70 65 ml an inner diameter of 30 mm and a height of 100 mm in addition the experimental system included a rotary vane vacuum and an injection pump with a syringe it is difficult and time consuming to conduct convective mixing experiments for a real fluid system brine saturated with co2 and in situ brine under reservoir conditions in a laboratory thus two simulated fluid pairs mncl2 solution 0 99 wt h2o and d2o h2o were selected to replace the real fluid system with similar density properties see table 2 this experimental method has been proved in the literature jiang et al 2019a teng et al 2017a tsai et al 2013a four kinds of mixed sand consisting of artificial glass beads jiang et al 2019b or artificial plastic beads patmonoaji and suekane 2017 with heterogeneous structures were used to create a wide range of ra values the detailed parameters of the fluids and porous media are shown in table 3 the experimental procedures used for each case are described in this section first the mixed sand was tightly packed into the vessel step 1 the vessel full of sand was placed into a vacuum container with deionized water lighter fluid note that there were open holes at both ends of the vessel to allow the deionized water to completely saturate the porous medium under the vacuum condition step 2 once the porous medium was saturated it was kept vertical on the frame and the dense fluid was slowly injected 0 5 ml min from the bottom to fill half of the vessel step 3 both ends of the vessel were plugged after injection and finally the vessel was inverted and placed into the mri chamber mri images were collected continuously by a lab assistant step 4 the experimental system diagram and the operation steps are shown in fig 2 2 2 image processing the original images obtained by 1h mri scanning were grayscale images of 0 255 the brighter area was liquid water and the darker area was liquid without 1h such as the mncl2 solution mn2 as a paramagnetic ion in a water based solution at a certain concentration is dark in the mri images and d2o 1h and d can be distinguished easily the original mri images were guaranteed to have good quality and a reliable signal to noise ratio first the redundant black background was removed leaving the area of interest from the original image and then the image was enhanced by a gaussian filter to reduce noise these preliminary processed images were used to measure the fluid distribution and perform quantitative analysis the images were further processed in pseudocolor as a schematic diagram of convective mixing evolution the color bar shows the concentration of the fluid distribution 2 3 analysis parameters we defined four measurable parameters for the quantitative analysis of each stage of the convective instability process and compared the corresponding density driven convection behavior under various conditions the parameters were as follows 1 dimensionless time td was defined as td u b φ h t where u b is the maximum buoyancy velocity and defined as u b k δ ρ g μ where k and φ are the sand permeability and porosity respectively δρis the density difference between fluids g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m2 s î¼ is the fluid viscosity h is the vessel length and t is the real time 2 the rayleigh number ra the ratio of buoyancy to diffusivity can characterize the initiation of density driven convective mixing and the degree of instability at fluid contact surfaces convection theoretically occurs when ra 4π2 and is defined as ra h δ ρ g k φ d μ where d is the molecular diffusion coefficient 3 the scalar dissipation rate χ is a global measure of the mixing rate and defined as χ diff w r a 4 π s 02 2 t d ra 1 2 in the early period diffusion stage and χ conv 4 π 1 4 λ c r a convection development stage where w is the dimensionless width w is always equal to 1 s 0 is the dimensionless initial mixing layer thickness and λ c is the dimensionless critical wavelength we assume that s 0 0 to simplify the calculation in this study the detailed parameters can be found in juan s hidalgo et al 2015 study 4 the sherwood number shm the ratio of convection mass flux to diffusion flux is characterized as the co2 dissolution rate and defined as shm f φ δ d h where f φ v δ is the convection flux whose simplified formula is expressed as shm vh d v is the velocity at the contact interface of two fluids and the numerical assumption was equal to the finger growth velocity 3 results 3 1 finger growth patterns the finger dynamics evolution can be quantified by the normalized mri mean intensity the selected area was the upper half of the initial fluid interface while the signal intensity of porous media fully saturated with d2o was 0 the signal intensity of porous media fully saturated with h2o mixed with d2o mass ratio of 1 1 was set to 1 and it was assumed that the signal varies linearly with the mass ratio of the fluid mixture during convection mixing process the variation curve of the normalized mri mean intensity of the selected area with dimensionless time td and mri images obtained in some stages are provided in fig 3 the time varying mri images obtained for a series of convective mixing processes for cases b1 b4 can be found in s1 see the supporting information the different development stages of convection correspond to different change curves and gray values the convective mixing process was mainly divided into three stages diffusion stage ab convection stage bd and steady stage de taking case b1 as an example before the occurrence of interface instability only diffusion dominated mass transfer almost no changes were observed from the mri images and the mean intensity mi of the ab stage remained unchanged the onset time of fingering depended on the properties of the reservoir rock and the fluid once instability was triggered the mis increased rapidly bd stage the fingers with a nearly cylindrical shape moved downward once convection was triggered the fingers expanded merged and split and newly generated fingers could be visualized in this stage interestingly the mis continued to increase with a relatively low slope after point c therefore we subdivided the bd stage into two substages according to the transformation of mis the rapid convection stage bc stage and late mixing stage cd stage a similarly detailed analysis of the stage of local fingers can be found in section 3 3 2 the mass transfer rate in the bc stage was faster than that in the cd stage due to the large density difference between the fluids at the beginning the density difference decreased with mixing indicating the arrival of the cd stage no clear finger boundary was observed from the mri images however a local concentration gradient between the fluids still existed in this stage finally fluid mixing completed when the mis reached the steady state de stage the mis increased when d2o was mixed with h2o because h was evenly distributed in the whole solution and formed a higher concentration region after mixing relative to the initial state namely the porous media saturated by d2o for the different analog fluid system mncl2 h2o can reach a consistent stage of convective mixing 3 2 mass transfer characteristics along the fluid boundary convective mass transfer is dominated by the state of the initial fluid interface as mentioned in section 1 therefore quantification of the interface behavior at the early stage is essential this section mainly introduces the mass transfer process before fingers develop including boundary layer thickening dominated by diffusion the scalar dissipation rate in the diffusion stage corresponding to stage 1 in section 1 and the onset time of the fingering instability corresponding to stage 2 in section 1 3 2 1 mixing layer thickness during the diffusion stage competition between convective compression and diffusive expansion exists for an incompressible fluid system it has been proved that interface deformation is attributable not to the balance of forces but rather to the nonuniform distribution resulting from mixing the fluids wang et al 2018 the unstable fluid interface consists of a downward moving dense fluid a gradually thickening mixing layer and an upward moving light fluid the properties of the fluid and porous media determine the initial unstable state such as the unstable trigger time jiang et al 2019a density of folds and mixing layer thickness δ z nakanishi et al 2016 mri images can capture the change in the mixing layer by the gray value fig 4 shows the definition of δ z based on the mri mean intensity in this study the intensity of the two fluids at the upper and lower ends remained nearly stable and the intensity of the transition zone sloped five lines were selected from left to right for measurement the measurement error is small as shown in the figure the mean value of the five curves was used and the distance between the intersection of two straight lines and a diagonal line was defined as δ z which greatly simplified the complex estimation of δ z however this was based on two assumptions 1 heterogeneity has a small effect on the fluid interface before instability was triggered which was ignored in this test and 2 the initial fluid interface was controlled by the artificial error of the pre injection process which was ignored because the injection rates and injection positions were the same for each case the related details can be found in previous studies lehoux et al 2016 raimbault et al 2020 the mixing layer thickness was calculated in a previous numerical simulation neufeld et al 2010 and experimental method wang et al 2018 using mass balance theory this can be applied in our test but the accuracy of the calculation based on image segmentation should be considered the value of δ z varied with time before the onset time for case a1 as shown in fig 5 a and the error bar in the figure was the average value of the left middle and right sides of the fluid boundary in the experiment the value of δ z thickened with time before instability was triggered and the trend of the curve is nearly linear with r2 0 91 from the perspective of the mixing layer thickness increasing the diffusion rate in unit time will shorten the time to reach convection instability for co2 geological sequestration injection of co2 premixed with brine and injection of co2 with nanoparticles are beneficial for speeding up mixing fig 5 b compares the δ z values of different ra values and found that the maximum δ z value decreased with increasing ra for the same fluid this indicated that interface instability would be triggered earlier for large pores the required δ z value was smaller under large ra conditions when interface instability was triggered which shortened the time scale of convective occurrence in the initial stage 3 2 2 the scalar dissipation rate a mixing process occurred when the initial concentration distribution was uniform when the two fluids were in contact with each other the scalar dissipation rate can quantify the mixing rate and the formula can be found in section 2 3 as summarized from hidalgo et al 2015 work before instability at the fluid interface was triggered the fluid interface remained stable and î increased by diffusion only fig 6 indicates that χ diff decreased with increasing td in the diffusion stage which is consistent with fig 5 a where î increases slowly in the late stage however the mixing rate was independent of time once convection occurred the scalar dissipation rate was higher for lower ra especially for the convection stage this may have been related to the slow movement of fingers which could be fully mixed with the surrounding fluid if given enough time in contrast diffusive mass transfer dominated the early diffusion stage so χ diff was 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than χ conv for each case 3 2 3 onset time the end of the diffusion mixing stage corresponds to the onset time of convection the moment tonset was obtained by using the mri mean value of the fluid interface and the details can be found in a previous study wang et al 2020 fig 7 shows the variation curve of tonset with ra the instability of the contact interface between the two fluids increased with increasing ra accelerating the start of convective mixing because the experimental capture frequency was 102 s slice the instability phenomenon may have occurred during the capture process for case b4 so the results should be neglected in theory tonset was inversely proportional to the square of ra and the difference was the value of the prefactor in some simulation and experimental results emami meybodi et al 2015 c was 1 55 108 as obtained from the fitting curve in this study in contrast the trend of the boundary layer thickness was related to the onset time due to the difference in the fluid contact time although convection was triggered when ra was lower ra 70 81 it was approximately two orders of magnitude larger than when ra 6783 01 a reasonable choice of injection site with high permeability sand or an improved co2 injection method to increase the initial density difference of the fluid may effectively reduce the onset time and increase the co2 dissolution rate 3 3 mass transfer characteristics of finger development the investigation of the temporal and spatial concentration distributions of the fingers and the mass transfer characteristics in the development stage was still challenging this section mainly introduces the mass transfer process in the finger development stage corresponding to stage 3 in section 1 including the driving force at the interface derived from the asymmetric mass flux finger growth velocity and co2 mixing efficiency 3 3 1 vector mass flux using the initial interface as the central boundary white dotted line in fig 8 b we calculated the change in convective mass flux between the upper and lower halves of the fov the change in convective mass flux f at the fluid interface along the width of the vessel for cases b3 and b4 is shown in fig 8 a the mass flux of gravity driven convection downward fingers was set to a positive value and buoyancy driven convection upward fingers was set to a negative value f at the same position was expressed as the vector value of the two added together furthermore the mri images of the fingers at two moments for case b4 are provided in fig 8 b upward fingers and downward fingers exist along the width in both cases taking case b4 as an example gravity was the dominant force at w 14 mm indicating that downward fingers dominate reducing the extent of the counterflow process f at td 0 07 is greater than f at td 0 04 which was favorable for co2 sequestration conversely the downward migration of d2o dense fluid was not favored when the process was buoyancy driven f 0 at w 2 5 mm for case b4 or when gravity was the main driving force first and then buoyancy dominated f 0 at td 0 27 and f 0 at td 0 51 at w 25 mm for case b3 from the specific values of the vector mass flux in the whole slice layer as listed in fig 8 c we can conclude that the fov was dominated by density driven convection on the whole during the convection stage and the vector mass flux was usually greater at large ra values such quantitative analysis may be enlightening for the geological sequestration of co2 so we can infer that more co2 will be dissolved in the brine at the initial phase interface as ra increases reducing the counterflow of the brine and increasing density driven downward fingering flows will be favorable for co2 dissolution processes 3 3 2 finger growth velocity the convection finger growth rate v is related to the mass transfer rate of co2 in the brine note the influence of the rayleigh number on v fig 9 a shows that the average velocity v of the front fingers increases with increasing ra these data contain both the d2o h2o fluid system and mncl2 solution h2o fluid system a higher v value can effectively reduce the time scale of co2 dissolution furthermore fig 9 b plots the dimensionless experimentally obtained time it takes for the front fingers to reach the bottom th versus the different ra values for the sake of comparison th d h2 ts as defined in previous studies faisal et al 2015 farajzadeh et al 2007 where ts is the time it takes for an instability finger to reach the bottom of the fov a power relationship exists between th and ra ra c t s n where c is a constant and n is the exponential term in the formula which is the same tendency observed in the previous study in this study c 0 33 and n 1 09 n 1 in the single phase numerical simulations of farajzadeh et al and n 1 45 in the hele shaw cell experiment of faisal et al 2015 farajzadeh et al 2007 the transverse concentration variation of a dynamic finger helps us understand the mass transfer behavior between the finger and the surrounding fluid the normalized concentration c of one representative finger transverse varies with time for case b1 as shown in fig 10 the selected position was below the initial fluid boundary and the change in the fingers appearing after completely mixing nine times was monitored the normalized concentration c was characterized by the signal intensity of the hydrogen proton density weighted images the signal intensity of porous media fully saturated with h2o brightest was set to 1 and the signal intensity of porous media fully saturated with d2o darkest was 0 the values of the fluid mixtures with different mass ratios were set between 0 and 1 here we assumed that the signal varies linearly with the mass ratio of the fluid mixture c in the center of the selected location gradually decreased with the appearance and continuous downward movement of the front finger and the transverse concentration gradient of note can be noted that the transverse concentration gradient was maximized at td 0 833 in fig 10 a we defined this stage as the local rapid convection stage stage i when td 0 833 in which the shear rates between the two fluids was greater resulting in a lower mixing efficiency of the finger with the surrounding fluid when td 0 833 the boundary between two fluids became less clear and the transverse concentration gradient decreased as seen in fig 10 b this stage is defined as the local late mixing stage stage ii mixing was complete when the curve was almost flat again the c value in the final mixture td 1 768 was less than that in the initial fluid td 0 057 3 3 3 fluid mixing efficiency in addition to the finger growth rate v mentioned above the finger number fn was related to the mass transfer capacity of co2 in the brine this means that a large fn value per unit volume corresponded to a larger contact interface area between the fluids and further enhanced the storage capacity fig 11 shows the variation of the mri images for different numbers of fingers from a single finger to multiple fingers with time at different ra values when there was no interference between the front fingers half of a finger for case a2 and a single finger for case a3 the fluid contact interface depended only on the expansion of the finger combined with the results of the scalar dissipation rate in the convection stage in fig 6 this indicates that the convective and mixing mass transfer efficiencies were lower for low permeability porous media however the mass transfer behavior was different when multiple fingers advanced together during the convection stage more than one finger for cases b2 and b3 the fns increased first due to the time difference in the triggering of instability at the interface and then decreased because of the collision and mixing of adjacent fingers the maximum fns increased with increasing ra as seen in fig 11 in contrast the fluid disturbance increased with increasing mass transfer rates and mixing efficiency in the case of multiple fingers to quantify the sweep area of the fingers fig 12 provides the mass fraction of the downward fingers represented as a lh where a is the increased area below the fluid interface and l and h are the width and length of the vessel respectively as a function of td before the main finger reached the bottom the mass fraction of the downward fingers did not change much initially and diffusion was the main mass transfer mechanism in this stage the curve then increased almost linearly note that the inflection point changed more smoothly when ra was small although multiple fingers could theoretically facilitate mixing during the convection stage the mass fraction of the multiple downward fingers before the main finger reached the bottom was the smallest a lhmax 43 5 for case a3 and a lhmax 66 2 for case b3 therefore during the convection of the co2 brine system in the reservoir the effect of competition between the co2 sweep area and mixing efficiency on mass transfer is worth discussing because a larger sweep area can enhance the co2 dissolution volume in the unit volume of the reservoir 4 discussion 4 1 sherwood number the total co2 dissolution rate of convective mixing can be characterized by shm which can be used to relate the laboratory observations to the field settings fig 13 b shows the power law relationship between ra and shm with a comparison of previous results from the literature the range of ra mainly focused on 40 7000 and accounted for 73 5 of the 34 ccs sites covered in this paper including the saline aquifers in the usa alberta basin and the sleipner site in the north sea which were summarized in the work of szulczewski et al 2012 and liyanage et al 2019 the probability distributions are shown in fig 13 a this range was more likely to be expected deep in the potential ccs sites and the results in this paper can provide basic data for project applications the curve was fit by shm arab where a 0 155 and b 0 997 the total co2 dissolution rate increased with increasing ra which is consistent with previous research convection was the main co2 mass transfer process and was favored over molecular diffusion as ra increased this indicates that compared with the larger sweep area at low ra values the higher finger growth velocity and mixing efficiency at large ra values were more dominant in mass transfer compared to that of experimental studies using analogous fluids teng et al and tsai et al the shm of the present study was slightly lower due to the different properties of the fluid especially those of the fluid used for the viscosity contrast the difference between the assumptions of the model and the boundary conditions using the numerical simulation methods caused the shm values to be higher or lower than the those of this study jerome et al and hewitt et al moreover differences in the size of the experimental vessel may also cause the errors of the results as discussed above the prediction of shm was essential for the time scale of dissolution the dissolution rate of the lower ra range based on the experimental method was supplemented in this section which can also provide data to support the simulation analysis 4 2 dissolution rates the convective mixing process can enhance the dissolution rate dr in a deep saline aquifer and greatly reduce the time scale of co2 dissolution fig 14 compares the dr of the convection process with that of the pure diffusion process with reference to the results of liyanage et al 2019 the experimental method was similar to ours the purely diffusive scenario was the numerical solution in their paper and the blue asterisks denote the maximum dissolution rates determined from their results we plotted the dr variation with time in three cases with different ra values which was equal to the mass of the downward moving dense fluid divided by the duration of the process we assumed that the space was consistent with that of liyanage et al for the sake of comparison the initial dr of the curve decreased and was almost consistent with the trend of the diffusion curve the curve transformed after the onset time and then peaked in the convection stage cases b2 and b3 however the diffusion process could hardly be observed at large ra instability occurred in the beginning and the maximum dissolution rate drmax was reached case b4 for the d2o h2o fluid system in this study drmax 0 33 g min at 117 3 min for ra 558 88 8 02 times the diffusion rate drmax 0 79 g min at 22 1 min for ra 2073 23 8 10 times the diffusion rate and drmax 9 58 g min at 1 7 min for ra 6783 01 28 60 times the diffusion rate in summary drmax promoted by convective mixing was several to dozens of times higher than the diffusion rate for the ra range in this article which may correspond to thousands or tens of thousands of years under reservoir conditions 5 conclusions secure and efficient co2 storage in deep saline aquifers can be affected by the mass transfer of the convective mixing process so this characteristic at various stages requires a systematic investigation by visualizing the convective mixing process in heterogeneous porous media using analogous fluids the temporal and spatial variations of the fingers were determined and the mass transfer characteristics in the diffusion stage the unstable trigger stage and the convection development stage were analyzed in detail 1 three stages were found during the convective mixing process according to the mis the diffusion stage convection stage including two substages the rapid convection stage and late mixing stage and steady stage the mis tended to increase with different degrees during the process 2 during the diffusion stage the mixing layer thickness δ z increased with time before instability was triggered and the variation trend seemed to be nonlinear the scalar dissipation rate χ diff was a function of time and decreased with increasing td indicating that the thickening rates of δ z became slow δ z decreased with increasing ra for the same fluid 3 the onset time was inversely proportional to the square of ra the value of prefactor a was 1 55 108 as obtained from the fitting curve in this study the quick triggering of instability at large ra is useful for the safe storage of co2 4 during the convection development stage it was advantageous when the density driven mass flux was greater than the buoyancy the average velocity v of the front fingers increased with increasing ra and the higher v value could effectively reduce the time scale of co2 dissolution there was a power relationship between the time it took for the front fingers to reach the bottom and ra and these results are consistent with previous studies the transverse concentration gradient of a front finger increased first at one position which was accompanied by a larger shear rate between the fluids with increasing mixing strength in the later stage the transverse concentration gradient decreased until mixing was complete moreover for different permeable reservoirs the maximum number of fingers increased with ra and fingers collided with each other to enhance mass transfer however the sweep area was found to be larger for lower ra values with little interaction between fingers the total co2 dissolution rate increased with ra which indicated that the higher finger growth velocity and mixing efficiency at large ra were more dominant in mass transfer than the larger sweep area at low ra the curve was fit by shm arab where a 0 155 and b 0 997 the range of ra values covers most ccs sites which can provide basic data for engineering applications and simulation studies in addition drmax promoted by convective mixing was several to dozens of times higher than the diffusion rate for the ra range in this article which substantially shortens the time

4846,in order to test the performance of the incomplete mixing model including the advection dispersion reaction equation im adre in simulating bimolecular reactive transport in fractured media the laboratory controlled experiments and numerical modeling were conducted in a single rough wall fracture bimolecular reaction of aniline an 1 2 napthoquinone 4 sulfonic acid nqs 1 2 naphthoquinone 4 aminobenzen nqab was employed three different flow rates 0 15 0 825 and 1 5 ml s and three fracture apertures 2 3 and 4 mm were considered in the experiment the numerical simulation was analyzed and discussed based on the péclet pe number and damköhler da number the results showed that although the spatial distribution of product concentration varied with the pe number the im adre model could simulate it well the discrepancy between the simulated and measured peak product concentrations was less than 0 7 which was far less than the value of 5 in previous study qian et al 2015 produced by the im adre model used to modeling the reactive transport in porous media this meant that the im adre model was effective for simulating and predicting the experimental results of bimolecular reactive transport in a single rough wall fracture due to the instability of the product the simulated value of the peak product concentration was always higher than the experimental value through further analysis of the model parameters it was found that the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d changed significantly with the change of pe number the parameters m and β 0 were linearly correlated with the pe number in addition the im adre model was more sensitive to the parameters m and β 0 but less sensitive to d keywords bimolecular reaction a single rough wall fracture solute transport sensitivity analysis the model parameter 1 introduction bimolecular reaction a b ab represents a common reaction in nature as the foundation to understand reactive solute transport in fractured media kapoor et al 1998 numerous studies concentrate on this topic but most of them consider an irreversible homogeneous bimolecular reaction kapoor et al 1997 benson and meerschaert 2008 tartakovsky et al 2009 willingham et al 2010 which can serve as an ideal benchmark to characterize the impact of microscale process on upscale parameters and provide a further guidance for the study of more complex reactive solute transport fractures and fracture networks widely existing in nature are the most effective pathways for solute transport in fractured media tang et al 2017 understanding the mechanism of bimolecular reactive solute transport in a single fracture is the basis for studying the behavior of reactive solute in complex fracture networks when pollutants are transported together with groundwater in the fractures a series of physical and chemical reactions will occur predicting the fate of pollutants in fractures is essential to remediate groundwater pollution due to the wide application of reactive solutes in porous media research has been conducted for decades dentz et al 2011a ding et al 2013 jiménez martínez et al 2015 wang et al 2020a 2020b lots of effective models have been established to predict reactive transport in porous media gramling et al 2002 sanchez vila et al 2010 qian et al 2015 porta et al 2016 sund et al 2017 benson et al 2019 among them numerical modeling has attracted more and more attentions because it has been proved valid and widely used in predicting reactive transport besnard et al 2011 accurately quantifying the effective reaction rate and solute dispersion is the key to capture the evolution of reactive transport hochstetler and kitanidis 2013 the advection dispersion reaction equation adre model is established by coupling fickian transport with chemical reaction equation the adre model is widely used to describe solute evolution in a continuum formulation rubin 1983 such as treating the porous media as macroscopic equivalent porous media to describe the reactive transport sanchez vila et al 2010 qian et al 2015 according to the adre model the theoretical framework is assumed to be two scale separation conditions sanchez vila et al 2010 however these two ideal assumptions are invalid for predicting reaction rates in column scale and field scale tests the measured value is generally much less than the predicted value many researchers attribute the difference to the complexity of the media and the incomplete mixing of two or more substances which affects the rates of homogeneous reactions de anna et al 2014 jose and cirpka 2004 suggested that the over prediction of peak product concentration was due to the fact that the model simulating incomplete mixing was actually a complete mixed model the traditional adre model has been widely used to predict the concentration of reactive products in porous media however it can neither solve the problem of over prediction of the peak product concentration of bimolecular reaction nor can it capture the tailing of the product concentration well therefore a different macroscopic description of the underlying processes tartakovsky et al 2009 is required many researches reveal that incomplete mixing is the main reason for the large discrepancy between the simulated and observed results tartakovsky et al 2008 rolle et al 2009 bolster et al 2012 hochstetler and kitanidis 2013 tartakovsky et al 2008 and katz et al 2011 found that when studying problems involving precipitation migration it was possible to refine the grid to simulate certain characteristics of the reaction migration process they also pointed out that there was no accurate quantification method through studying the bimolecular reactive transport of cu2 edta4 cuedta2 in a column filled with cryolite sand gramling et al 2002 found that the pore scale mixing was over predicted by the advection dispersion equation ade model for this reason homogeneous chemical reaction was over predicted by the traditional adre model thus the simulated result was more than 20 higher than the observed value the reason for the over prediction or tailing is that the traditional bimolecular second order kinetic reaction rate is linearly related to the concentration of reactants r βc a c b where β is the reaction rate constant the improved adre model is based on three adjustable parameters d β0 and m a time dependent term i e β β 0t m is proposed to the coefficient β in the equation where the coefficient β 0 and exponent m need to be adjusted according to the time dependent experimental measurement sanchez vila et al 2010 sanchez vila et al 2010 introduced the incomplete mixing to the adre model and used analytical solution to interpret the column experiment reported by gramling et al 2002 and the simulation precision was improved and the maximum discrepancy was reduced to 12 the incomplete mixing model including advection dispersion reaction equation im adre was verified by the experimental data the uncertainty of the simulation was greatly reduced and the accuracy was significantly improved qian et al 2015 used the numerical solution of im adre model to fit the column experiment of bimolecular reactive transport an nqs nqab and found that the numerical solution was effective for the model analysis which verified the effectiveness of im adre model in porous media the numerical analysis of the im adre model can provide appropriate predictions for the dispersion and fate of contaminants in the subsurface according to the initial conditions and boundary conditions most studies on advection diffusive transport of bimolecular reactive solute are carried out in porous media however up to now there is no reliable numerical model can be used to predict the transport of contaminants in fractures due to the complexity of fracture networks fractures are morepermeable than rock matrix sudicky and frind 1982 and have the potential to be the most effective pathways for solute and water transport the assumptions of the im adre model are basically consistent with the mixing and reaction conditions of reactive solutes thus the deviation between the simulation results and the actual situation is less significant reactive transport in rough fractures are involved in many numerical simulations dou et al 2016 o brien et al 2003 however the results are lack of experimental validation singurindy and berkowitz 2005 there is no appropriate model that can accurately describe the diffusion of bimolecular reactive solutes and predict the concentration of products in a single fracture the accuracy of the model seems to be related to two important parameters péclet pe and damköhler da numbers pe number is used to characterize the equilibrium between convection and diffusion wright et al 2017 while the da number quantifies the relative equilibrium between diffusion and reaction effects sanchez vila et al 2007 valocchi et al 2019 in this study the bimolecular reactive transport an nqs nqab in a single rough wall fracture was investigated the accuracy of the im dare model was verified by the experimental and numerical analysis of the bimolecular reaction and the determination of the model parameters the change characteristics of model parameters m β0 d pe and da were discussed the results can provide a foundation for predicting reactive transport in fracture networks this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the theoretical model of the bimolecular reaction used in this study is illustrated section 3

peak product concentration measured in the experiment 3 experiment setup and methods 3 1 experimental setup in order to investigate the dynamics of reactive transport and further understand the bimolecular reaction in fractured media a series of experiments are performed in a single rough wall fracture the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 the single rough wall fracture is made up of a pair of plexiglass boards with a smooth surface opposed to a rough surface a plexiglass board without slotting is treated as the smooth surface while the rough surface is obtained by slotting transverse of 4 0 mm wide and 4 0 mm deep opened at intervals of 4 0 mm on a plexiglass board the fracture is 600 mm long and 150 mm wide the apertures between the two surfaces are adjustable and controllable which are set as 2 0 mm pattern 1 3 0 mm pattern 2 and 4 0 mm pattern 3 in this study respectively the relative roughness of the fracture were calculated and shown in table 1 in this study the relative roughness referred to the ratio of the height of the rough element to the average fracture aperture which was a dimensionless number the two ends of the single rough wall fracture were attached to two constant head reservoirs using latex tubing respectively which the left end in the upstream and the right end in the downstream 3 2 experimental methods in this study an reacted with nqs to generate nqab were chosen as the bimolecular reaction during the reaction the two reactants could react instantaneously and completely after mixing and the color of the product nqab benefits the determination of its concentration solutions of an and nqs were prepared in deionized water at 0 20 mmol l and the ph was adjusted to 7 using phosphate buffer solution of 55 mm ionic strength 10 70 mm na2hpo4 10 55 mm nah2po4 13 60 mm nacl an and nqs solids were weighed by a balance fa2004n with an accuracy of 0 1 mg before the reactive solute transport experiments a calibration of the uniformity of nqs solution concentration in the fracture was performed by measuring the absorbance values at the inlet sampling port and outlet of the fracture respectively bimolecular reactive transport started with opening the peristaltic pump and the time was counted at the appearance of an solution at the inlet the an solution was injected into the single fracture at different flow rates which were 0 150 0 825 and 1 500 ml s respectively the flow rates were controlled by a peristaltic pump different flow velocities were obtained by fracture apertures and peristaltic pump speeds table 1 water samples 3 0 ml were collected at the end of the fracture until thereaction was completely i e only colorless an remained in the fracture the absorbance values were determined at the specified time interval the solute concentrations were calculated based on their absorbance then the breakthrough curves of concentration time were plotted a 752n spectrophotometer shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd china was used to measure the solute concentrations the absorbance values of nqs an and nqab were determined at 276 370 and 476 nm wavelengths by the method of raje and kapoor 2000 respectively the concentrations of the three species were calculated according to the beer lambert law and the breakthrough curves of the reactants and product changing with time were obtained the im adre model was used to simulate the experiment results and the parameters d β0 and m were calculated by the model the effects of experimental conditions on reactive transport and parameters were investigated and discussed through contrastive analysis 4 results and discussions 4 1 experimental results under three patterns bimolecular reactive solute transport experiments at three different flow rates were conducted separately the minimum value of re in this experiment was 2 15 while the maximum value was 21 5 table 2 turbulent flow begin to occur when re is more than 100 according to tzelepis et al s report 2015 obviously the re in this study was far less than this value therefore from the perspective of the entire experiments the flow in the single fracture in this study was considered as laminar flow although local reflow might occur in rough elements zou et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the process of solute transport involves adsorption dispersion and advection wang et al 2017 since the fracture in this experiment was made of plexiglass boards the influence of the adsorption process on solute transport could be ignored in this study the fracture apertures had little influence on the pe numbers thus the differences of pe numbers under different fracture apertures were ignored the experiments were performed at high pe numbers which indicated that the main contribution to solute dispersion was mechanical dispersion rather than molecular diffusion in the reaction system pe numbers da numbers indicated that the two reactants mixed almost instantaneously and reacted completely porta et al 2013 and incomplete mixing had little effect on the reaction rate the reaction rate was mainly dominated by reaction rather than mixing the results of the bimolecular reactive solute transport experiments are shown in the scatter plots in fig 2 under the same da number the change of pe number has a significant impact on the product concentration fig 2 it could be clearly seen that when pe numbers was small the product concentration distribution was close to the gaussian distribution with the increase of pe number the peak value of the product concentration became larger and the tailing of the product concentration became more obvious zhang et al 2014 found a similar phenomenon in the study of reactive solute transport in porous media the increase of pe numbers meant the intensification of convection in the fracture dejam 2019 stronger convection was conducive to better mixing of reactants valocchi et al 2019 and collisions between reactants was faster and more violent therefore the peak product concentration reached earlier and the value was higher however the rapid mixing between the solutions also made the product dilute rapidly resulting in a rapid decrease in concentration after reaching the peak the tailing in the experiment might be related to the eddy in the system the eddy zones captured the solutes and then released them back to the main flow wang et al 2020a 2020b which led to the delay in solutes transport in this study a high pe number corresponded to a high re number a higher re numbers resulted in a larger eddy current region wang et al 2020a 2020b and a heavier tailing dou et al 2018 the effects of da numbers on the concentration of the three substances in this study did not seem to be significant this might be due to the fact that there was no significant difference in the fracture apertures among the three patterns in this study 4 2 comparison of the experimental and fitted results the validity of the im adre model on the bimolecular reactive transport of an and nqs was checked by the experiments in a single rough wall fracture the fitting results of the breakthrough curves of the three species concentrations an nqs and nqab using the im adre model within different pe numbers and da numbers are shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows that the simulated concentration breakthrough curves are basically consistent with the measured values of the three species when the da number was 332 the simulated peak concentration of nqab was 0 33 more than the measured value at the pe number of 1937 similarly the simulated peak value of nqab were 0 22 and 0 09 more than the measured values at the pe numbers of 10 649 and 19 373 respectively with the increase of pe number the simulation result was getting closer and closer to the measured values this illustrated that stronger convection promoted the mechanical mixing of the reactants porta et al 2013 and the reaction system was closer to the instantaneous mixing and complete reaction assumed by the adre model this was different from tartakovsky et al s result 2009 in which the accuracy of the darcy scale model of the mixing controlled would decrease with the increase of pe number when the da numbers were 512 and 728 the results showed a similar performance with the increase of pe numbers at the da number of 512 the simulated peak value were 0 69 0 53 and 0 46 higher than that of experimental measurement when pe number were 1937 10 649 and 19 373 respectively at the da number of 728 with the increase of pe number the simulated peak concentration exceeded the measured values by 0 67 0 24 and 0 02 respectively it was worth noting that although the pe number and da number were different under different water flow velocities and fracture apertures which affected the fitting accuracy of the model to the experimental data the discrepancy of the im adre model was very small the discrepancy was no more than 0 69 which was far less than that of 40 simulated by traditional adre model in porous media raje and kapoor 2000 the discrepancy was also less than 6 of the revised adre model sanchez vila et al 2010 explaining the gramling s et al experiment 2002 and the 5 of the im adre model simulating the bimolecular reactive solute transport in porous media by qian et al 2015 this showed that the experiments in the single rough wall fracture could be simulated well by the im adre model therefore the im adre model can be used to simulate reactive solute transport in fractures considering incomplete mixing within control volume and obtain higher accuracy to further evaluate the validity of the im adre model the simulated and measured cumulative mass of the product are calculated and shown in fig 4 the simulated curves were in good agreement with the experimental data under the conditions of the three da numbers and higher pe number 19 373 and the discrepancy was only 1 55 which was much less than gramling et al s report 20 2002 however obviously no matter what the value of the da number was the discrepancy between the simulated and measured cumulative mass of the product was very large even up to 104 82 at lower pe number 1937 furthermore in the later stage of the reaction the cumulative mass curves were different from those in the early and middle stage of the reaction and the measured curves seemed to coincide with or exceed the simulated mass curves this trend seemed to be distinct with the increase of flow rates which was related to the complex tailing in the later stage of the reaction the model could accurately simulate the experimental results under high pe number fig 5 shows the logarithmic plot of nqab concentration comparing the experimental and simulated results of the bimolecular reactive solute transport it is found that there is an obvious deviation between the experimental and the simulated values in the breakthrough curves and the deviations cannotbeneglected nonetheless so far the bimolecular reaction has not beenable to quantify the direct impact of the incomplete mixing introduced into the improved model in bimolecular reaction system the boundary effect on the reaction interface caused by fluid flow molecular diffusion and drag of fracture edge affected the mixing reaction and migration of the three species the effect further led to the deviation of the model i e early arrival and tailing phenomenon 4 3 stability analysis of nqab although the im adre model has significantly reduced the discrepancy between the experimental and simulated value of the peak product concentration the simulated value is always higher than the experimental value in order to understand the reason we monitored the stability of nqab the nqab solutions with three different concentrations 0 1 mmol l 0 15 mmol l and 0 2 mmol l were placed in three containers exposed to ultraviolet light visible light and shading respectively the concentration of nqab was measured by a uv spectrophotometer at regular intervals to explore whether it would remain a constant value the results are shown in fig 6 the results showed that the concentration of nqab solution was inconstant under the three experimental conditions at the concentration of 0 1 mmol l almost no change was observed in nqab solution in the first 500 s and then the concentration decreased when the concentration was 0 15 mmol l the time for nqab solution to maintain stable concentration was shortened and the rate of concentration decrease was also increased the concentration of nqab solution further increased to 0 2 mmol l and the trend mentioned above was more obvious under the three experimental conditions the concentration changes of nqab solution were not completely the same and ultraviolet light has the greatest influence on the concentration however the concentration of nqab solution still changed significantly under visible light or shading conditions and even decreased by about 50 within 1000 s the instability of nqab solution concentration could explain why the concentration predicted by the im adre model was always higher than the measured value at the peak and initial decline stage it also suggested that if the instability of the material itself could be taken into account in the construction of the numerical model the prediction of reactive solute transport might be more accurate 4 4 parameters of the im adre model the parameters d β 0 and m used in the im adre model are shown in table 3 hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient is an indispensable parameter to describe solute transport dentz et al 2011b alhashmi et al 2015 wang and cardenas 2014 2015 shi et al 2016 porta et al 2016 the simulated reaction zone is large enough in the one dimensional fracture and the transverse dispersion is small enough to be negligible therefore the experiment only considering the influence of longitudinal diffusion on solute transport can represent the authenticity of the parameters in the traditional adre model hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients of reactants and product were simplified as the same value although they were actually different sanchez vila et al 2010 however sensitivity analysis showed that the species concentrations were sensitive to d in the im adre model sanchez vila et al 2010 which further influenced the shapes of the concentration curves sanchez vila et al s result 2010 found that even small difference of hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients might lead to large concentration deviations we used the experimental data in qian s et al work 2015 to check the accuracy of the simulation with different dispersion coefficients of reactants and products as shown in fig 7 to avoid treating the dispersion coefficients of reactants and products as the same value the discrepancy between the measured and simulated peak value was reduced from 5 20 to 0 16 and the peak arrival time was more accurately captured the results showed that the simulation accuracy could be improved by introducing the respective dispersion coefficients for different materials in this study the concentration curves were simulated by taking different d values for reactants and product in the im adre model and different concentration responses were obtained in the sensitivity analysis see 4 4 for details the linear fittings of different d values at various pe numbers and da numbers are shown in fig 8 it could be seen that the dispersion coefficients decreased linearly with the increase of the relative molecular weight this confirmed raje and kapoor s research 2000 on the diffusion coefficients of an nqs and nqab molecules and was consistent with the results of gramling et al s study 2002 in this study the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient had a significant linear correlation with the relative molecular weight of the species and the difference of d was related to the species obviously if the difference was ignored the relative error would be large the result provided a valuable reference for the future research work the increase of the pe number resulted in a significant increase of d value at lower pe number d decreased with the da number however under higher pe number the relationship between d and da was undefined the parameters β 0 and m are also related to the pe numbers and da numbers fig 9 shows the linear regression relationships between β 0 and m with the pe numbers all results showed that β 0 linearly increased and m linearly decreased with the increase of the pe numbers at a certain da number although the slopes of the curves did not change much the ranges of β 0 values were very different the increase of the da number led to the significant increase of β 0 at the same range of the pe numbers however there was no reliable rule for the effect of the da number on m value the correlation coefficients decreased with the increase of the da number which meant the deviation between dates and liner fittings increased 4 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is an effective means to test the performance of mathematical models mathias and wen 2015 to test the response of im adre model to changes in specific input data a sensitivity analysis was carried out using the similar method of qian et al s study 2015 the effect of given variations of input parameters on the model output is shown in fig 10 in fig 10 a the horizontal axis represents the percentage of variation of the parameters m β 0 d an d nqs and d nqab d an d nqs and d nqab represent the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients of an nqs and nqab respectively over their chosen base values and the vertical axis represents the percentage of variation of the product concentration over its base value in fig 10 a the percentage of base nqab shows a nearly linear relationship with the percentage of based simulated value especially for d an d nqs and d nqab from the slopes of the lines the model was most sensitive to m and more sensitive to β 0 as for d the model was showed relatively sensitive to d an and d nqab but relatively insensitive to d nqs the simulated reaction rate between an and nqs would directly be affected by the parameters β 0 and m in the model the effects of the parameters β 0 and m on the breakthrough curve of product nqab can also be seen directly in fig 10 b when β 0 4 5 and m 0 4 the simulated result of the product concentration was almost consistent with the experimental data except some tailing however the maximum product concentration could not be captured well when β 0 was moreorless than4 5 under the same m value which be greatly different from the predicted results based on the same change of the baseline data to d an and d nqab the output response of the model had the opposite effect which indicated different dispersion coefficients was necessary to be applied in the model 5 conclusions to investigate the mechanism of bimolecular reactive transport in fractured media a series of experiments of an nqs nqab in a single rough wall fracture were carried out and the experimental data were interpreted by the im adre model the sensitivity analysis was conducted to check the influence of the parameters involved in the im adre model on the results the main conclusions were obtained as follows 1 the spatial distribution of product concentration varied with the pe number which deviated from gaussian distribution at a high pe number and showed a heavy tailing 2 the im adre model performed well in simulating and predicting the experimental results of bimolecular reactive transport in the single rough wall fracture the accuracy of the im adre model was related to the pe number at high pe number the peak product concentration simulated by im adre model was only 0 7 higher than that of the experiment and the cumulative mass was only over experimental results by 1 55 the relative error was much less than the errors reported by previous studies 3 the parameters of d β 0 and m were related to the pe number and the da number the increase of the pe number resulted in a significant increase of d at lower pe number d decreased with the da number at the same da number the best fit model parameters exhibited an increasing trend of β 0 over the pe numbers while m value decreased with the increase of pe numbers 4 the im adre model was most sensitive to the parameters of m and β 0 and the relatively sensitive to d an and d nqab but insensitive to d nqs credit authorship contribution statement

4846,in order to test the performance of the incomplete mixing model including the advection dispersion reaction equation im adre in simulating bimolecular reactive transport in fractured media the laboratory controlled experiments and numerical modeling were conducted in a single rough wall fracture bimolecular reaction of aniline an 1 2 napthoquinone 4 sulfonic acid nqs 1 2 naphthoquinone 4

discussed based on the péclet pe number and damköhler da number the results showed that although the spatial distribution of product concentration varied with the pe number the im adre model could simulate it well the discrepancy between the simulated and measured peak product concentrations was less than 0 7 which was far less than the value of 5 in previous study qian et al 2015 produced by the im adre model used to modeling the reactive transport in porous media this meant that the im adre model was effective for simulating and predicting the experimental results of bimolecular reactive transport in a single rough wall fracture due to the instability of the product the simulated value of the peak product concentration was always higher than the experimental value through further analysis of the model parameters it was found that the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d changed significantly with the change of pe number the parameters m and β 0 were linearly correlated with the pe number in addition the im adre model was more sensitive to the parameters m and β 0 but less sensitive to d keywords bimolecular reaction a single rough wall fracture solute transport

and solute dispersion is the key to capture the evolution of reactive transport hochstetler and kitanidis 2013 the advection dispersion reaction equation adre model is established by coupling fickian transport with chemical reaction equation the adre model is widely used to describe solute evolution in a continuum formulation rubin 1983 such as treating the porous media as macroscopic equivalent porous media to describe the reactive transport sanchez vila et al 2010 qian et al 2015 according to the adre model the theoretical framework is assumed to be two scale separation conditions sanchez vila et al 2010 however these two ideal assumptions are invalid for predicting reaction rates in column scale and field scale tests the measured value is generally much less than the predicted value many researchers attribute the difference to the complexity of the media and the incomplete mixing of two or more substances which affects the rates of homogeneous reactions de anna et al 2014 jose and cirpka 2004 suggested that the over prediction of peak product concentration was due to the fact that the model simulating incomplete mixing was actually a complete mixed model the traditional adre model has been widely used to predict the concentration of reactive products in porous media however it can neither solve the problem of over prediction of the peak product concentration of bimolecular reaction nor can it capture the tailing of the product concentration well therefore a different macroscopic description of the underlying processes tartakovsky et al 2009 is required many researches reveal that incomplete mixing is the main reason for the large discrepancy between the simulated and observed results tartakovsky et al 2008 rolle et al 2009 bolster et al 2012 hochstetler and kitanidis 2013 tartakovsky et al 2008 and katz et al 2011 found that when studying problems involving precipitation migration it was possible to refine the grid to simulate certain characteristics of the reaction migration process they also pointed out that there was no accurate quantification method through studying the bimolecular reactive transport of cu2 edta4 cuedta2 in a column filled with cryolite sand gramling et al 2002 found that the pore scale mixing was over predicted by the advection dispersion equation ade model for this reason homogeneous chemical reaction was over predicted by the traditional adre model thus the simulated result was more than 20 higher than the observed value the reason for the over prediction or tailing is that the traditional bimolecular second order kinetic reaction rate is linearly related to the concentration of reactants r βc a c b where β is the reaction rate constant the improved adre model is based on three adjustable parameters d β0 and m a time dependent term i e β β 0t m is proposed to the coefficient β in the equation where the coefficient β 0 and exponent m need to be adjusted according to the time dependent experimental measurement sanchez vila et al 2010 sanchez vila et al 2010 introduced the incomplete mixing to the adre model and used analytical solution to interpret the column experiment reported by gramling et al 2002 and the simulation precision was improved and the maximum discrepancy was reduced to 12 the incomplete mixing model including advection dispersion reaction equation im adre was verified by the experimental data the uncertainty of the simulation was greatly reduced and the accuracy was significantly improved qian et al 2015 used the numerical solution of im adre model to fit the column experiment of bimolecular reactive transport an nqs nqab and found that the numerical solution was effective for the model analysis which verified the effectiveness of im adre model in porous media the numerical analysis of the im adre model can provide appropriate predictions for the dispersion and fate of contaminants in the subsurface according to the initial conditions and boundary conditions most studies on advection diffusive transport of bimolecular reactive solute are carried out in porous media however up to now there is no reliable numerical model can be used to predict the transport of contaminants in fractures due to the complexity of fracture networks fractures are morepermeable than rock matrix sudicky and frind 1982 and have the potential to be the most effective pathways for solute and water transport the assumptions of the im adre model are basically consistent with the mixing and reaction conditions of reactive solutes thus the deviation between the simulation results and the actual situation is less significant reactive transport in rough fractures are involved in many numerical simulations dou et al 2016 o brien et al 2003 however the results are lack of experimental validation singurindy and berkowitz 2005 there is no appropriate model that can accurately describe the diffusion of bimolecular reactive solutes and predict the concentration of products in a single fracture the accuracy of the model seems to be related to two important parameters péclet pe and damköhler da numbers pe number is used to characterize the equilibrium between convection and diffusion wright et al 2017 while the da number quantifies the relative equilibrium between diffusion and reaction effects sanchez vila et al 2007 valocchi et al 2019 in this study the bimolecular reactive transport an nqs nqab in a single rough wall fracture was investigated the accuracy of the im dare model was verified by the experimental and numerical analysis of the bimolecular reaction and the determination of the model parameters the change characteristics of model parameters m β0 d pe and da were discussed the results can provide a foundation for predicting reactive transport in fracture networks this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the theoretical model of the bimolecular reaction used in this study is illustrated section 3 shows the experimental setup and methods section 4 describes the experimental results compares the experimental results with the simulated results and analyzes the parameters of the im adre model section 5 presents the key conclusions 2 theoretical models of bimolecular reaction the governing equation describing the bimolecular reactive transport in a single fracture is sun et al 2010 haggerty

peak product concentration measured in the experiment 3 experiment setup and methods 3 1 experimental setup in order to investigate the dynamics of reactive transport and further understand the bimolecular reaction in fractured media a series of experiments are performed in a single rough wall fracture the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 the single rough wall fracture is made up of a pair of plexiglass boards with a smooth surface opposed to a rough surface a plexiglass board without slotting is treated as the smooth surface while the rough surface is obtained by slotting transverse of 4 0 mm wide and 4 0 mm deep opened at intervals of 4 0 mm on a plexiglass board the fracture is 600 mm long and 150 mm wide the apertures between the two surfaces are adjustable and controllable which are set as 2 0 mm pattern 1 3 0 mm pattern 2 and 4 0 mm pattern 3 in this study respectively the relative roughness of the fracture were calculated and shown in table 1 in this study the relative roughness referred to the ratio of the height of the rough element to the average fracture aperture which was a dimensionless number the two ends of the single rough wall fracture were attached to two constant head reservoirs using latex tubing respectively which the left end in the upstream and the right end in the downstream 3 2 experimental methods in this study an reacted with nqs to generate nqab were chosen as the bimolecular reaction during the reaction the two reactants could react instantaneously and completely after mixing and the color of the product nqab benefits the determination of its concentration solutions of an and nqs were prepared in deionized water at 0 20 mmol l and the ph was adjusted to 7 using phosphate buffer solution of 55 mm ionic strength 10 70 mm na2hpo4 10 55 mm nah2po4 13 60 mm nacl an and nqs solids were weighed by a balance fa2004n with an accuracy of 0 1 mg before the reactive solute transport experiments a calibration of the uniformity of nqs solution concentration in the fracture was performed by measuring the absorbance values at the inlet sampling port and outlet of the fracture respectively bimolecular reactive transport started with opening the peristaltic pump and the time was counted at the appearance of an solution at the inlet the an solution was injected into the single fracture at different flow rates which were 0 150 0 825 and 1 500 ml s respectively the flow rates were controlled by a peristaltic pump different flow velocities were obtained by fracture apertures and peristaltic pump speeds table 1 water samples 3 0 ml were collected at the end of the fracture until thereaction was completely i e only colorless an remained in the fracture the absorbance values were determined at the specified time interval the solute concentrations were calculated based on their absorbance then the breakthrough curves of concentration time were plotted a 752n spectrophotometer shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd china was used to measure the solute concentrations the absorbance values of nqs an and nqab were determined at 276 370 and 476 nm wavelengths by the method of raje and kapoor 2000 respectively the concentrations of the three species were calculated according to the beer lambert law and the breakthrough curves of the reactants and product changing with time were obtained the im adre model was used to simulate the experiment results and the parameters d β0 and m were calculated by the model the effects of experimental conditions on reactive transport and parameters were investigated and discussed through contrastive analysis 4 results and discussions 4 1 experimental results under three patterns bimolecular reactive solute transport experiments at three different flow rates were conducted separately the minimum value of re in this experiment was 2 15 while the maximum value was 21 5 table 2 turbulent flow begin to occur when re is more than 100 according to tzelepis et al s report 2015 obviously the re in this study was far less than this value therefore from the perspective of the entire experiments the flow in the single fracture in this study was considered as laminar flow although local reflow might occur in rough elements zou et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the process of solute transport involves adsorption dispersion and advection wang et al 2017 since the fracture in this experiment was made of plexiglass boards the influence of the adsorption process on solute transport could be ignored in this study the fracture apertures had little influence on the pe numbers thus the differences of pe numbers under different fracture apertures were ignored the experiments were performed at high pe numbers which indicated that the main contribution to solute dispersion was mechanical dispersion rather than molecular diffusion in the reaction system pe numbers da numbers indicated that the two reactants mixed almost instantaneously and reacted completely porta et al 2013 and incomplete mixing had little effect on the reaction rate the reaction rate was mainly dominated by reaction rather than mixing the results of the bimolecular reactive solute transport experiments are shown in the scatter plots in fig 2 under the same da number the change of pe number has a significant impact on the product concentration fig 2 it could be clearly seen that when pe numbers was small the product concentration distribution was close to the gaussian distribution with the increase of pe number the peak value of the product concentration became larger and the tailing of the product concentration became more obvious zhang et al 2014 found a similar phenomenon in the study of reactive solute transport in porous media the increase of pe numbers meant the intensification of convection in the fracture dejam 2019 stronger convection was conducive to better mixing of reactants valocchi et al 2019 and collisions between reactants was faster and more violent therefore the peak product concentration reached earlier and the value was higher however the rapid mixing between the solutions also made the product dilute rapidly resulting in a rapid decrease in concentration after reaching the peak the tailing in the experiment might be related to the eddy in the system the eddy zones captured the solutes and then released them back to the main flow wang et al 2020a 2020b which led to the delay in solutes transport in this study a high pe number corresponded to a high re number a higher re numbers resulted in a larger eddy current region wang et al 2020a 2020b and a heavier tailing dou et al 2018 the effects of da numbers on the concentration of the three substances in this study did not seem to be significant this might be due to the fact that there was no significant difference in the fracture apertures among the three patterns in this study 4 2 comparison of the experimental and fitted results the validity of the im adre model on the bimolecular reactive transport of an and nqs was checked by the experiments in a single rough wall fracture the fitting results of the breakthrough curves of the three species concentrations an nqs and nqab using the im adre model within different pe numbers and da numbers are shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows that the simulated concentration breakthrough curves are basically consistent with the measured values of the three species when the da number was 332 the simulated peak concentration of nqab was 0 33 more than the measured value at the pe number of 1937 similarly the simulated peak value of nqab were 0 22 and 0 09 more than the measured values at the pe numbers of 10 649 and 19 373 respectively with the increase of pe number the simulation result was getting closer and closer to the measured values this illustrated that stronger convection promoted the mechanical mixing of the reactants porta et al 2013 and the reaction system was closer to the instantaneous mixing and complete reaction assumed by the adre model this was different from tartakovsky et al s result 2009 in which the accuracy of the darcy scale model of the mixing controlled would decrease with the increase of pe number when the da numbers were 512 and 728 the results showed a similar performance with the increase of pe numbers at the da number of 512 the simulated peak value were 0 69 0 53 and 0 46 higher than that of experimental measurement when pe number were 1937 10 649 and 19 373 respectively at the da number of 728 with the increase of pe number the simulated peak concentration exceeded the measured values by 0 67 0 24 and 0 02 respectively it was worth noting that although the pe number and da number were different under different water flow velocities and fracture apertures which affected the fitting accuracy of the model to the experimental data the discrepancy of the im adre model was very small the discrepancy was no more than 0 69 which was far less than that of 40 simulated by traditional adre model in porous media raje and kapoor 2000 the discrepancy was also less than 6 of the revised adre model sanchez vila et al 2010 explaining the gramling s et al experiment 2002 and the 5 of the im adre model simulating the bimolecular reactive solute transport in porous media by qian et al 2015 this showed that the experiments in the single rough wall fracture could be simulated well by the im adre model therefore the im adre model can be used to simulate reactive solute transport in fractures considering incomplete mixing within control volume and obtain higher accuracy to further evaluate the validity of the im adre model the simulated and measured cumulative mass of the product are calculated and shown in fig 4 the simulated curves were in good agreement with the experimental data under the conditions of the three da numbers and higher pe number 19 373 and the discrepancy was only 1 55 which was much less than gramling et al s report 20 2002 however obviously no matter what the value of the da number was the discrepancy between the simulated and measured cumulative mass of the product was very large even up to 104 82 at lower pe number 1937 furthermore in the later stage of the reaction the cumulative mass curves were different from those in the early and middle stage of the reaction and the measured curves seemed to coincide with or exceed the simulated mass curves this trend seemed to be distinct with the increase of flow rates which was related to the complex tailing in the later stage of the reaction the model could accurately simulate the experimental results under high pe number fig 5 shows the logarithmic plot of nqab concentration comparing the experimental and simulated results of the bimolecular reactive solute transport it is found that there is an obvious deviation between the experimental and the simulated values in the breakthrough curves and the deviations cannotbeneglected nonetheless so far the bimolecular reaction has not beenable to quantify the direct impact of the incomplete mixing introduced into the improved model in bimolecular reaction system the boundary effect on the reaction interface caused by fluid flow molecular diffusion and drag of fracture edge affected the mixing reaction and migration of the three species the effect further led to the deviation of the model i e early arrival and tailing phenomenon 4 3 stability analysis of nqab although the im adre model has significantly reduced the discrepancy between the experimental and simulated value of the peak product concentration the simulated value is always higher than the experimental value in order to understand the reason we monitored the stability of nqab the nqab solutions with three different concentrations 0 1 mmol l 0 15 mmol l and 0 2 mmol l were placed in three containers exposed to ultraviolet light visible light and shading respectively the concentration of nqab was measured by a uv spectrophotometer at regular intervals to explore whether it would remain a constant value the results are shown in fig 6 the results showed that the concentration of nqab solution was inconstant under the three experimental conditions at the concentration of 0 1 mmol l almost no change was observed in nqab solution in the first 500 s and then the concentration decreased when the concentration was 0 15 mmol l the time for nqab solution to maintain stable concentration was shortened and the rate of concentration decrease was also increased the concentration of nqab solution further increased to 0 2 mmol l and the trend mentioned above was more obvious under the three experimental conditions the concentration changes of nqab solution were not completely the same and ultraviolet light has the greatest influence on the concentration however the concentration of nqab solution still changed significantly under visible light or shading conditions and even decreased by about 50 within 1000 s the instability of nqab solution concentration could explain why the concentration predicted by the im adre model was always higher than the measured value at the peak and initial decline stage it also suggested that if the instability of the material itself could be taken into account in the construction of the numerical model the prediction of reactive solute transport might be more accurate 4 4 parameters of the im adre model the parameters d β 0 and m used in the im adre model are shown in table 3 hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient is an indispensable parameter to describe solute transport dentz et al 2011b alhashmi et al 2015 wang and cardenas 2014 2015 shi et al 2016 porta et al 2016 the simulated reaction zone is large enough in the one dimensional fracture and the transverse dispersion is small enough to be negligible therefore the experiment only considering the influence of longitudinal diffusion on solute transport can represent the authenticity of the parameters in the traditional adre model hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients of reactants and product were simplified as the same value although they were actually different sanchez vila et al 2010 however sensitivity analysis showed that the species concentrations were sensitive to d in the im adre model sanchez vila et al 2010 which further influenced the shapes of the concentration curves sanchez vila et al s result 2010 found that even small difference of hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients might lead to large concentration deviations we used the experimental data in qian s et al work 2015 to check the accuracy of the simulation with different dispersion coefficients of reactants and products as shown in fig 7 to avoid treating the dispersion coefficients of reactants and products as the same value the discrepancy between the measured and simulated peak value was reduced from 5 20 to 0 16 and the peak arrival time was more accurately captured the results showed that the simulation accuracy could be improved by introducing the respective dispersion coefficients for different materials in this study the concentration curves were simulated by taking different d values for reactants and product in the im adre model and different concentration responses were obtained in the sensitivity analysis see 4 4 for details the linear fittings of different d values at various pe numbers and da numbers are shown in fig 8 it could be seen that the dispersion coefficients decreased linearly with the increase of the relative molecular weight this confirmed raje and kapoor s research 2000 on the diffusion coefficients of an nqs and nqab molecules and was consistent with the results of gramling et al s study 2002 in this study the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient had a significant linear correlation with the relative molecular weight of the species and the difference of d was related to the species obviously if the difference was ignored the relative error would be large the result provided a valuable reference for the future research work the increase of the pe number resulted in a significant increase of d value at lower pe number d decreased with the da number however under higher pe number the relationship between d and da was undefined the parameters β 0 and m are also related to the pe numbers and da numbers fig 9 shows the linear regression relationships between β 0 and m with the pe numbers all results showed that β 0 linearly increased and m linearly decreased with the increase of the pe numbers at a certain da number although the slopes of the curves did not change much the ranges of β 0 values were very different the increase of the da number led to the significant increase of β 0 at the same range of the pe numbers however there was no reliable rule for the effect of the da number on m value the correlation coefficients decreased with the increase of the da number which meant the deviation between dates and liner fittings increased 4 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is an effective means to test the performance of mathematical models mathias and wen 2015 to test the response of im adre model to changes in specific input data a sensitivity analysis was carried out using the similar method of qian et al s study 2015 the effect of given variations of input parameters on the model output is shown in fig 10 in fig 10 a the horizontal axis represents the percentage of variation of the parameters m β 0 d an d nqs and d nqab d an d nqs and d nqab represent the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients of an nqs and nqab respectively over their chosen base values and the vertical axis represents the percentage of variation of the product concentration over its base value in fig 10 a the percentage of base nqab shows a nearly linear relationship with the percentage of based simulated value especially for d an d nqs and d nqab from the slopes of the lines the model was most sensitive to m and more sensitive to β 0 as for d the model was showed relatively sensitive to d an and d nqab but relatively insensitive to d nqs the simulated reaction rate between an and nqs would directly be affected by the parameters β 0 and m in the model the effects of the parameters β 0 and m on the breakthrough curve of product nqab can also be seen directly in fig 10 b when β 0 4 5 and m 0 4 the simulated result of the product concentration was almost consistent with the experimental data except some tailing however the maximum product concentration could not be captured well when β 0 was moreorless than4 5 under the same m value which be greatly different from the predicted results based on the same change of the baseline data to d an and d nqab the output response of the model had the opposite effect which indicated different dispersion coefficients was necessary to be applied in the model 5 conclusions to investigate the mechanism of bimolecular reactive transport in fractured media a series of experiments of an nqs nqab in a single rough wall fracture were carried out and the experimental data were interpreted by the im adre model the sensitivity analysis was conducted to check the influence of the parameters involved in the im adre model on the results the main conclusions were obtained as follows 1 the spatial distribution of product concentration varied with the pe number which deviated from gaussian distribution at a high pe number and showed a heavy tailing 2 the im adre model performed well in simulating and predicting the experimental results of bimolecular reactive transport in the single rough wall fracture the accuracy of the im adre model was related to the pe number at high pe number the peak product concentration simulated by im adre model was only 0 7 higher than that of the experiment and the cumulative mass was only over experimental results by 1 55 the relative error was much less than the errors reported by previous studies 3 the parameters of d β 0 and m were related to the pe number and the da number the increase of the pe number resulted in a significant increase of d at lower pe number d decreased with the da number at the same da number the best fit model parameters exhibited an increasing trend of β 0 over the pe numbers while m value decreased with the increase of pe numbers 4 the im adre model was most sensitive to the parameters of m and β 0 and the relatively sensitive to d an and d nqab but insensitive to d nqs credit authorship contribution statement

4847,quasi point hydraulic properties k measured locally under laboratory or field conditions need to be upscaled to block scale k tensors for use in flow simulators the upscaled model also needs to be calibrated to hydraulic head observations the calibration must preserve spatial covariance cross covariance and non linear relations between tensor components we apply a new upscaling method that allows to compute and model the covariance between block k tensor components we use a gradual deformation method for calibration of simulated k tensor fields to measured head data our method incorporates a new bivariate transform that preserves the non linear relations between k tensor components the ensemble of calibrated realizations allows quantification of uncertainty of groundwater flow models a comparison with pest on a test case defining capture zones for water supply wells shows that our method calibrates better to measured heads than pest provides more realistic k tensors and results in larger capture zones keywords gradual deformation hydraulic conductivity tensor linear model of coregionalisation calibration pest 1 introduction the calibration of groundwater flow models by solving the inverse problem is the critical part of a standard modelling workflow anderson et al 2015 the objective of the inverse problem is to determine the values of the unknown parameters and their ranges e g hydraulic conductivity ensuring a good reproduction of the state variables e g hydraulic head inversion methods have evolved significantly over the past few decades carrera et al 2005 de marsily et al 2000 oliver and chen 2011 yeh 1986 zhou et al 2014 inversion by the direct method has been almost abandoned mainly since it requires the 3d field of hydraulic heads determined at all model nodes pasquier and marcotte 2006 ponzini and lozej 1982 zhou et al 2014 this approach is still valuable when a preliminary flow model is available as a starting point rivest et al 2008 on the other hand brouwer et al 2008 presented an interesting semi direct method based on the imposition of a double constraint which allows to calculate the hydraulic conductivity as the ratio of the flux and gradient fields the current trend of solving the inverse problem is oriented towards the indirect method as shown by a considerable number of studies reported in the literature e g alcolea et al 2006 caers 2002 carrera and neumanrrera 1986 evensen 2009 evensen 1994 hu 2000 gómez hernández et al 1997 kitanidis 1995 de marsily et al 1984 oliver et al 1997 ramarao et al 1995 todd hoffman and caers 2005 among many others in certain cases the inverse approach is the only option for simultaneously providing an adequate model fit to pressure observations and realistic k fields poeter and hill 1997 the main difficulty with the inverse problem resides in the non uniqueness of the solution it is then referred to as an ill posed problem hadamard 1932 for which several possibilities exist to reduce the solution space for example one can reduce the number of parameters to be determined impose constraints on the range of the values of the parameters using a priori information control the fluctuations during the optimization by adding a term of regularization and transform the model so as to minimize the model non linearity zhou et al 2014 a different perspective adopted in stochastic approaches is to cope with the non uniqueness of the solution by proposing a series of calibrated possible solutions the calibrated solutions reflect the uncertainty about the field state given the current information however model calibration for each realization can be tedious for complex models with a spatially varying k tensor hence efficient calibration methods must be used one such method is the gradual deformation method gdm hu 2000 ravalec et al 2000 the gdm has been applied to heterogeneous transmissivity fields in 2d in a stochastic context ravalec and mouche 2012 capilla and llopis albert 2009 with non gaussian distributions llopis albert and capilla 2009 capilla and llopis albert 2009 and for history matching in 2d marteau et al 2014 jeong et al 2010 to our knowledge gdm has never been applied to 3d stochastic k tensor fields to simplify the analysis and without real loss of generality we assume the hsu hydrostratigraphic unit model itself is considered deterministic and we apply gdm only for calibration of the k tensors defined at the block scale within each hsu if desired uncertainty on the hsu spatial distribution can be accounted for by calibrating the k tensors on one realization at a time from a series of realizations obtained by a facies simulation method e g see benoit et al 2017 k tensor components are often strongly and possibly non linearly cross correlated the preservation of these correlations is important we propose a practical method to maintain the desired cross correlation between tensor components within each hsu while applying the gdm the approach uses a linear model of coregionalization in gaussian space a bivariate transform of the gaussian lcm realizations restores the desired zero lag non linear correlations and component histograms one contribution in this paper is the use of direct geostatistical simulation of the conductivity tensors at block scale although this approach was proposed in a 2d context as early as 1993 gómez hernández and journel 1993 to our knowledge it has not been applied for 3d regional flow modelling a second contribution is the use of gdm for fast calibration of the tensor field whereas gdm was used previously only with scalar fields a third contribution is the bivariate transform used in this study that ensures reproduction of the non linear relations between the tensor components and the respect of the constraint k zz k xx not otherwise ensured by classical separate gaussian transforms followed by back transformation as usually done in geostatistical simulations the paper is structured as follows first we present the method used to upscale scalar point hydraulic conductivity to 3d block tensors of conductivity the new method allows to assess the spatial covariance and cross covariance of gaussian transformed k tensor components we then describe the simulation of 3d tensors respecting the spatial auto and cross correlation of the components combined with a bivariate transform aimed at maintaining the non linear relationships observed between tensor components we proceed with a brief review of the gdm approach before applying the methodology to a simplified case study calibration results are compared to those obtained with pest well capture zones defined with pest and our method are compared we complete the paper with discussions and conclusions 2 methodology the proposed methodology aims to characterize and calibrate a groundwater flow model with correlated k tensors the calibration is perform using gdm the approach mainly consists of optimizing the tensor components based on observation data hydraulic head using a set of k tensor realizations the methodology is divided into three main sections i hydraulic block conductivity tensor simulation ii bivariate transform and iii calibration with gdm 2 1 hydraulic block conductivity tensor simulation to define the stochastic k tensor fields used with the gdm a multi step method is proposed herein it consists of upscaling the spatial distribution of scalar k from local scale values quasi point to a block 3d k tensor this is repeated for each hsu the approach comprises four main steps i local scale simulation of the scalar k field ii upscaling of quasi point realizations into 3d block k tensors using a block by block finite element flow simulator iii definition of the spatial covariance and cross covariance of the block k tensors and iv direct geostatistical simulation of the block k tensors for regional scale modelling 2 1 1 local scale simulation of the scalar k the local scale k values can be estimated from different sources such as grain size analyses laboratory tests on borehole samples specific capacity tests or pumping tests for geostatistical processing it is important to use consistent data preferably from the same type similar support to avoid scale issues and to ensure similar levels of measurement error and spatial uncertainty for each hsu the k values can span several orders of magnitude the spatial structure of the quasi point k is therefore important to assess for block upscaling k values within a given hsu are spatially structured according to depositional processes while the covariance functions describe the spatial structures and are used in the geostatistical simulations a different point scalar k covariance model is determined for each unit a series of scalar point support realizations over local scale fields are generated for each unit using a non conditional turning band simulation tbs algorithm emery and lantuéjoul 2006 over a fine grid see section 3 2 1 non conditional simulation is used as the objective here is simply to determine block scale k tensor covariance functions the simulations are constrained by the observed quasi point k marginal distributions for each unit 2 1 2 upscaling of quasi point realizations into 3d block k tensors for regional 3d numerical modelling the k field is represented by block scale finite elements the quasi point k simulation must therefore be upscaled to equivalent block k tensors accounting for the structural connectivity of hydrofacies within each block gomez hernandez and journel 1990 gómez hernández and journel 1993 each quasi point field realization is solved for the governing flow equations along the diagonals and the three principal directions to get a series of block conductivity tensors following the approach described in benoit et al 2020 this approach works on sets of 27 blocks 3 3 3 corresponding to the central block for which the tensor is computed with the other blocks forming a skin to diminish the influence of the applied boundary equations as in zhou et al 2010 the 3d hydraulic conductivity tensors for each block were obtained by forcing flow conditions along 8 different directions using different sets of prescribed head conditions the mean heads and flux along the principal directions for the central block are then used to compute its k tensor the complete upscaling workflow is presented in fig 1 the saltflow simulator molson and frind 2017 was used to obtain the 3d velocity and head fields mean 3d components of flux q x q y q z and gradients h x h y h z were calculated and used with darcy s law to solve the full 3d k tensor 2 1 3 spatial covariance and cross covariance of the block k tensors the upscaled block k tensors are non gaussian and present non linear relationships between tensor components hence they are first gaussian transformed to determine the linear coregionalization model lcm at the block scale the spatial covariance and cross covariance of the gaussian transformed block k tensor components are computed and modelled by a lcm to simplify the modelling components of relatively negligible amplitude are discarded and components uncorrelated to the others are treated separately the off diagonal tensor components being negligible with respect to diagonal terms were set to 0 among the diagonal terms k xx appeared highly correlated to k yy to further simplify the model and because this makes sense geologically we assumed k xx k yy so finally the lcm describes two variables k horizontal and k vertical 2 1 4 geostatistical simulation of the block k tensors the last step consists of simulating the 3d k tensor for the hydrostratigraphic model complete fields of gaussian transformed block tensors are directly simulated using the lcms models of the previous step each realization of block tensor components is back transformed using a bivariate transform to preserve the non linear relationship observed between k horizontal and k vertical see section 2 2 2 2 bivariate transform the bivariate transformation uses as reference the k bivariate distribution for k xx k zz obtained in the initial upscaling phase of the point support k scalar fields the various pairs k xx k zz obtained during this phase identify a bivariate cumulative density function f k xx k zz and cdfs f k xx and f k zz similarly the bigaussian simulation of the lcm defines a bicdf f y xx y zz and cdfs f y xx and f y zz the transform was defined by computing the euclidean distance between the triplets so defined the closest triplet f k xx f k zz f k xx k zz to a simulated triplet f y xx f y zz f y xx y zz was selected for mapping y xx k xx and y zz k zz to introduce more randomness in the bivariate transform a small number of closest points to f y xx y zz in f k xx k zz are considered for possible mapping and one is randomly selected note that the transform so defined is not reversible as it is not one to one here we did not have to invert the transform because we used only unconditional simulations for conditional simulations invertibility is required in which case a projection pursuit multivariate transform barnett et al 2014 could be used but then the inequality k zz k zz is not guaranteed contrary to our approach fig 2 compares the original bivariate distributions from upscaling left and those obtained from the lcm after applying the bivariate transform to a lcm realization right a p value of 0 70 was obtained with a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test of the first principal component representing 99 of the total variance hence we have no evidence that the two distributions are different 2 3 gradual deformation method the gradual deformation method was introduced by hu 2000 as an efficient way to gradually modify realizations of gaussian fields while preserving their spatial structure and variability it linearly combines a current field y cur i 1 with a new realization y new i to form an updated field y cur i the updated field becomes the current field and the process is repeated over many iterations until no further significant improvement can be obtained the updated field is calculated with eq 1 1 y cur i y cur i 1 cos t i y new i sin t i where t i π π is the scalar parameter to optimize at iteration i and y new i and y cur 0 are independent realizations with the same desired spatial correlation structure here the t i parameter is optimized by a combination of golden search method luenberger and ye 2016 and parabolic interpolation brent 1972 which requires a small number of iterations to reach a value close to the optimum the main advantage of gdm is that it preserves by construction the spatial structure of the fields at every iteration its main disadvantage is that it tends to quickly reach a local minimum hu 2000 ravalec dupin and nøetinger 2002 lauzon and marcotte 2019 from which it can be difficult to escape parameter t i appearing in eq 1 is chosen to optimize the selected objective function of in this study we use the mean absolute errors between simulated h sim and observed h obs hydraulic heads following eq 2 2 of k 1 n i 1 n h sim i h obs i where k is the iteration index and n is the number of head observations note that at each iteration and for each different trial value for parameter t i the bivariate transform of the current field has to be applied and the flow simulator has to be run to get the simulated heads 3 study area the proposed methodology is applied on a simplified groundwater flow model representing a typical regional valley fill environment in this section we present the hydrostratigraphy of a valley fill conceptual model the characterization of the k tensor by hsu the numerical groundwater model and the gdm results of the model calibration 3 1 hydrostratigraphic model the considered study area is located in south simcoe county southern ontario canada and represents a valley partly filled with glaciolacustrine sediments fig 3 the groundwater flow system is controlled by innisfil creek flowing in the central portion of the valley fig 3c the simplified 3d numerical model contains four hsus with a sequence from the base to the top fig 3d newmarket till acting as a regional continuous aquitard atc1 a glaciofluvial sand and gravel aquifer afb2 a fine grained glaciolacustrine aquitard consisting of silt clay and subordinate fine sand atb2 and a shallow regressional coarse grained glaciolacustrine aquifer of sand and gravel afb1 the model is divided into a regular block grid with elements of 200x200x1 meters each hsu block is strongly heterogeneous with specific statistical and spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivities section 3 2 3 2 hydraulic conductivity an hsu block is composed of various proportions of geologic materials clay silt and sand for the modelling point of view the material proportions are grouped into hydrofacies or simply represented by a hydraulic conductivity k distribution the k data were collected at a point scale under field or laboratory conditions for regional modelling purposes these data needed to be regionalized and upscaled from point to block scale inner block heterogeneity was then represented by the block k tensor these steps are summarized in section 2 1 and described in more detail in benoit et al 2020 and benoit et al 2020 the characterization of k values for the groundwater flow model included the point scale characterization section 3 2 1 k upscaling from the local scale 3d field to block scale tensor fields and the definition of the geostatistical model of each hsu section 3 2 2 the latter models are used for stochastic assessment of the hsu k tensor needed for gdm application 3 2 1 point scale to block scale hydraulic conductivities several data grain size specific capacity and laboratory tests were collected per unit to characterize the variability of the hsu hydraulic conductivity only the k data estimated from grain size samples were retained as it was the only dataset with satisfactory spatial distribution and density to model the vertical covariance structure of k hsus sauerbrei s method was applied for the estimation of the k values from grain size data vukovic and soro 1992 an example for atb2 material distribution and corresponding k values is shown in fig 4 a the boxplots in fig 4b show the distribution of the units with typical value ranges for two aquifer units afb1 and afb2 and two aquitards atb1 and atc1 all units except atc1 clearly show non gaussian marginal distributions the k values were estimated from grain size samples which have a high resolution in the borehole vertical directions the covariance models all have spherical structures with a nugget effect representing 21 to 49 of the total variance the scalar conductivity is assumed isotropic horizontally and anisotropic along the vertical with a much smaller range along the vertical 2 3 7 m horizontal variograms could not be modeled based on these grain size samples due to the large distances between the boreholes instead a global horizontal range of about 1800 m was estimated from conductivity values based on relatively dense specific capacity tests from ontario well record information this range suggests that a maximum anisotropy ratio between the horizontal range ah and the vertical range av of ah av 300 can be expected unconditional realizations of scalar k were then simulated on a grid of 120 120 120 points with grid spacing of 20 m 20 m 0 1 m the grid resolution was deemed sufficient to represent small scale variability considering the much larger correlation ranges of k measurements obtained from quasi point samples and the 10 times larger size of blocks required for numerical modelling the upscaling described in section 2 1 2 was applied to obtain block values on a coarser grid of 12 12 12 blocks of size 200 m 200 m 1 m the resulting block k tensors are used in the flow simulator which integrate the small scale variability at the block scale a correction had to be made to the k tensors of the atc1 unit since the newmarket till is a very compact unit its initial k values derived from the grain size samples completely ignored the compaction effect instead laboratory permeability tests were conducted on unreworked core samples from the boreholes which conserved the compaction state results from the permeability tests indicate lower k values by about two orders of magnitude than those from the grain size analyses pasquier et al 2016 and consequently atc1 k tensor values were modified by this factor the developed hsu k tensors show a significant variability with a succession of aquifer and aquitard value ranges e g k xx ref table 1 geostatistical modelling was performed on the hsu block scale k tensors to determine the lcm spatial covariance and cross covariance structures of the components used in the block simulations the upscaling reveals a very high correlation between k xx and k yy therefore they were assumed equal moreover the off diagonal tensor components were small enough to be neglected hereafter 3 2 2 block scale hydraulic conductivity tensor modelling the geostatistical structures of the k tensor were determined only for the principal components of the groundwater flow model k xx k yy k zz oriented in the principal direction of the model axes in such case the cross components are practically negligible and were set to zero in addition to the very strong correlation between the horizontal components of the reference k tensor k yy set equal to k xx there is also a strong correlation not necessarily linear between horizontal and vertical components k xx and k zz for all units fig 5 the covariance modelling showed that the correlated log k xx and log k zz components have similar covariance structures and are thus admissible for linear models of coregionalisation lmc the structures variance and covariance of the lcm are unique for each hsu table 2 the lcm models were further used to simulate the stochastic block fields of the k tensor principal components this step involves the bivariate transform described in section 2 2 to restore the nonlinear correlations between the tensor components observed in hsu afb1 and atb1 the resulting realizations were used for calibration using the gdm see section 4 note that all realizations are unconditional as no observations of the block conductivity tensor are available at the block scale 3 3 groundwater flow model the 3d groundwater flow model was developed with the saltflow code molson and frind 2017 the considered study area was 4 km horizontal x direction by 6 km horizontal y direction by 60 m vertical z direction the model domain contains 36 000 isoparametric 3d finite elements 20 30 60 and 39 711 nodes the stream flowing in the central portion is represented by a constant head boundary condition the values along the stream vary linearly between 57 to 59 meters over a thickness of one meter the stream actually represents a major drainage boundary for the infiltrated precipitation water recharge across the study area in the model the hsus are represented by the principal components of the k tensor realizations there is one single value for each component per block the component spatial distributions were simulated with the turning band algorithm emery and lantuéjoul 2006 whereas the correlated components were simulated using a lcm model table 2 a model referred to as the true model was taken as one of the unconditional realizations fig 6 this model is used in the flow simulator to get true head values that one will seek to calibrate the average recharge rate in the model was assumed at 25 mm y which represents a fairly low rate for glaciolacustrine sediments in southern ontario such a low value is justified by the location of the study area which is restrained to a relatively narrow corridor along the stream that serves rather as a discharge zone for regional groundwater flow in addition intense agriculture activities regularly include trench drainage systems which capture considerable amounts of infiltrated water for development purposes the recharge rate was simulated using the turning band method with a small variance i e small spatial variability around the mean value which allows for a gdm of the k tensor combined with the recharge rate fig 6b fig 6c shows the head distribution of the true model to test the accuracy of the calibration procedure section 4 59 head observations were randomly selected from the 3d simulated head field covering each of the model units 6d since no field observations of the water levels are considered herein these values will represent field observations referred to as true observations that will be the target values to be attained by the gdm scenarios 4 model calibration in this section the true model k tensor fields and recharge rate fields are considered as unknown to test the proposed gdm methodology the sets of new k tensors and recharge realizations optimized by the calibrated groundwater flow model were compared against the head observation data of the true model fig 6 among all the results presented in this section a reference model section 4 1 was determined around which three scenarios are compared in order to better understand the performance of calibration by the proposed methodology the reference model is considered to best fit the true observations the different scenarios evaluate i the random effects of equivalent realizations on the variability of the solution section 4 2 ii recharge effects on the head results section 4 3 and iii the influence of the number of head data observation section 4 4 4 1 the reference model the reference model represents the base case or the so called best model compared to the unknown true model therefore the results of the other scenarios are compared to this reference model the calibration of the reference model was conducted using 100 realizations of the k tensor and recharge rate fig 7 the results of the gdm show an acceptable calibration for the reference model the head difference at observation points is considerably reduced as shown in fig 7g where the calibrated reference model adequately reproduces the true head observations fig 7h shows the simulated vs true head observations for initial field blue intermediate gdm field grey to the final gdm field red the spatial distribution of the calibrated recharge k xx and head fields figs 7d 7e and 7f respectively compare well with the initial structures figs 7d 7e and 7f the true model fields fig 6a 6b and 6c the reference model also correctly reproduced the variograms and cross variograms in different directions e g afb1 unit depicted in fig 8 most of the improvement in the of brought by the gdm occurs in the first 10 realizations fig 9 for the remaining 90 realizations from 10 to 100 a relatively small of reduction occurs and the weight cos t becomes very close to 1 indicating no further significant modification affects the calibrated field 4 2 random effects gdm was applied similarly with different initial seeds the seed controls the set of k tensor and recharge realizations available to the gdm everything else was kept identical fig 10 show four different final calibrated log k xx fields the quality of calibration on the head field is similar for the four fields although the structures globally also appear similar the spatial distribution of values is significantly different this shows that the proposed methodology can generate many different models able to calibrate the head fields in absence of other constraining information these fields appear equivalent and can thus be used to assess the uncertainty about the real field fig 11 shows the boxplots of k xx a and k zz b components of the model tensors before k xx 0 and k zz 0 and after the calibration for the four realizations k xx 1 to k xx 4 and k zz 1 to k zz 4 for each observation point located at a model node the corresponding k value is determined as the average of the eight connected elements it can be observed that the calibration has no significant effect on the local variability of the k tensors components although the hydraulic head value is measured locally it is influenced by the upstream and downstream k values even at great distances as well as by the recharge flux which in this case is also stochastic 4 3 recharge effects the uncertainty of the recharge rate affects the gdm solutions as well to illustrate these effects different recharge scenarios are considered different recharge for each gdm step constant recharge over all cells unique recharge realization for all gdm steps the k tensor realizations used in the gdm remain the same for all recharge scenarios fig 12 illustrates the studied recharge scenarios the corresponding calibrated log k xx field and the difference between the calibrated and the true log k xx field the results indicate that the recharge scenario impacts the calibrated k tensors the calibrated fields of the various scenarios show a different spatial distribution of log k xx in addition the recharge scenario affects the variogram of the calibrated k xx component fig 13 shows the variograms of the calibrated fields for k xx and k zz components as well as the cross variograms of these components of each of the three recharge scenarios and for the true model in the three main directions the quality of the fit obtained with each recharge scenario is assessed using the mae between the k tensor variograms of the true and calibrated fields under the different recharge scenarios 3 mae i h w h γ t h γ i h γ t h where h is the lag distance γ t h and γ i h are respectively the true and calibrated experimental variogram at lag h for a given realization and tensor component and w h is the weight factor applied to lag h the sum of weights is one which is defined as w h n h h 2 h n h h 2 where n h is the number of pairs per lag fig 14 shows the boxplot of the 300 maes 100 calibrated fields 3 tensor components under the three different recharge scenarios the visual comparison of boxplots indicates that the stochastic scenario best reproduces the conductivity structure of the true field the median of the mae and mean computed with eq 3 is least for the stochastic scenario indicating a better variogram reproduction with this approach 4 4 influence of number of head data in this section calibration is done on various numbers of head observations with 59 30 15 11 7 and only 3 observations the heads obtained with the calibrated models are compared over a dense 3d grid to the true head field by computing mean square error rmse and correlation fig 15 shows that the applied method calibrates well over the entire domain under the condition that there is a sufficient number of observation wells the gdm converges towards acceptable error and correlation values with only several head measurements about 10 in this case correlation and rmse steadily improves with increasing number of data 5 capture zones the proposed methodology was used to illustrate the uncertainty assessment for the delineation of well capture zones using the calibrated fields the different capture zones by gdm are compared to those determined using the commonly used pest inversion algorithm doherty 2015 5 1 pest calibration the pest inversion method is widely used in hydrogeological modelling hill and tiedeman 2006 in this section the calibration of the reference model see section 4 1 is done using pest the calibration with pest was carried out zonally i e using one homogeneous k tensor per hsu the initial values of the tensor components were set equal to the average values of the corresponding hsu in the reference model the pest inversion was constrained by the minimum and maximum values found in the reference model in each hsu the results presented in fig 16 show that the pest algorithm calibrates well using the hydraulic head observations similar to the gdm model compare with fig 9 it is interesting to note that the hydraulic head field obtained by pest with the initial k tensor generally overestimates the hydraulic head observations since pest was used zonally the algorithm had to adjust the mean tensor component values to calibrate table 3 compares the initial and calibrated values after pest and gdm inversion for inversion with pest there is approximately one order of magnitude difference between the initial and calibrated tensors for atb2 and afb2 the afb2 values are clearly inadequate after the pest calibration as calibrated log k xx log k zz by an order of magnitude something geologically unacceptable for this type of environment moreover after pest inversion the atb2 aquitard and the afb2 aquifer show approximately the same value for log k xx which is also geologically unrealistic on the contrary the mean conductivities of calibrated fields by gdm are equal to the initial means hence despite good calibration to head data the pest calibrated field is not acceptable based on geological considerations multiple zones within each hsu or the pilot point method within pest could have been used none of these approaches would allow reproducing the spatial correlations and complex relationship between tensor components therefore they were not attempted 5 2 well capture zone delineation and uncertainty to illustrate the benefit of the proposed approach 100 equivalent flow models were calibrated using gdm to assess the uncertainty regarding delineation of well capture zones the calibration is performed on head observation as described in section 4 1 for this purpose two pumping wells are added to the model one located in the surficial aquifer afb1 and one in the confined aquifer afb2 well w1 is located at coordinates x 1400 and y 3000 and well w2 at x 2600 and y 3000 the well screens extend vertically from 46 to 59 m w1 and 16 to 29 m w2 to delineate the well capture zones the capture probability concept was applied molson and frind 2012 the approach consists of quantifying a capture probability using the backward mode of the advective dispersive transport model by inverting the groundwater velocity field frind et al 2002 neupauer and wilson 2001 neupauer and wilson 2004 neupauer and wilson 2005 in this approach the macrodispersion term simulates the local scale uncertainties within elements gelhar and axness 1983 a capture probability boundary condition of p 1 is applied at well locations transient transport simulations provide the probability field which decreases up gradient fig 17 shows capture probability contours of the 100 calibrated models for probabilities p 0 5 light grey and p 0 1 dark grey after 100 years of simulation for comparison purposes the capture probability contours red are also determined for the calibrated model with pest and the true model blue wells w1 and w2 have separate capture zones well w2 shows a capture probability p 0 1 from the pest inversion that only slightly exceeds the capture probability p 0 5 of the gdm models in this example the stochastic approach appears more conservative than pest as the capture zones are wider for the same capture probability level both approaches show in plan view asymmetric capture zones for w1 and symmetric zones for w2 for w1 the river flows north south and acts as a discharge zone so the regional groundwater flow is toward the river explaining the capture zone asymmetry on the contrary w2 is not hydraulically connected to the river due to the presence of the aquitard atb2 the capture zones for the true model blue differ significantly from those obtained by pest red and are everywhere well within the interval of capture zones obtained by the stochastic approach using gdm light gray for p 0 5 and dark gray for p 0 1 6 discussion our approach includes upscaling of the quasi point conductivity to k tensor conductivity and a bivariate transformation aimed at preserving the non linear relationship between tensor components the main motivation to upscale first and then simulate directly at the block level instead of working at the point level was cpu time upscaling all model blocks would be significantly more cpu intensive requiring as many calls to the flow simulator locally as the number of blocks times the number of gdm iterations times the number of line searches needed for each gdm iteration times the number of different sets of flow boundary conditions 8 in all to obtain the tensor although the flow simulation is local it remains an important workload considering the number of times it has to be run upscaling a single block takes 3 75 s compared to 0 95 s for 36 000 blocks simulated by the lcm so there is a five orders of magnitude reduction in computer time by adopting our approach the flow simulator at the block scale took only two seconds of cpu time hence our approach delivers a flow simulation in three seconds compared to 37 h for the other approach a second reason is the size of the lcm simulation at point vs block supports the point simulation has to be done over the whole field to preserve the correlation at the block scale for a 10 10 10 discretisation of each block this represents three orders of magnitude more points to simulate with a turning band simulator or sequential gaussian simulation this would also represent three orders of magnitude more cpu time and memory for the geostatistical simulation then the tensor components were regionalized using unconditional simulations in our context scarcity of point data a single borehole was available over the study area rendered conditioning ineffective in other contexts where point conditioning is useful the required point tensor component covariances can be easily gathered during the upscaling phase to define the lcm involving now three variables point conductivity and the two main tensor components the other modification required would be to use a trivariate reversible transform for example based on the projection pursuit multivariate transform barnett et al 2014 the cpu advantage of our approach would remain the same as in the unconditional case the results clearly show that gdm is able to calibrate a highly heterogeneous 3d multi layer regional groundwater flow system while preserving the desired spatial direct and cross correlation of the k tensor the computation time of this indirect inversion method is dominated by the number of calls to the groundwater flow simulator this time can be kept reasonable by allowing only a few line search steps to find parameter t in eq 1 and by asking only a small number of gdm iterations justified by the fact that the most significant improvements to the of occur in the few first iterations see fig 9 the method allows to generate numerous equally well calibrated models which can be used to assess the uncertainty about the real field our results indicate that the recharge scenario impacts the calibrated k tensors and that the stochastic recharge scenario produced calibrated fields with k tensor component variograms closer to variograms of the true model one interesting result was that the entire head field was well approximated after calibrating on only a small number of head data n 10 using more head data barely enhanced the approximation to the entire true head field the calibrated head fields obtained by gdm and by pest were compared for the definition of capture zones defined around two pumping wells the k tensor for the different hsus appeared geologically more realistic by gdm than the calibrated k tensor obtained with pest moreover the stochastic approach leads to larger possibly more conservatives capture zones than with a single pest calibrated model no uncertainty was assumed with respect to the histogram and k variograms for each of the hydrostratigraphic units uncertainty on the model parameters can be described by priors for these parameters however we did not pursue this approach as first priors are difficult to define and second it would have required a different block tensor upgrading step for each different variogram significantly increasing the cpu time compared to the proposed approach morevoer the influence of the variogram model on the quality of the calibration is deemed negligible when compared for example to the effect of boundary conditions or to the simulation of the hsu units other sources of uncertainty could be included by selecting parameter sets from an a priori distribution but we avoid full bayesian inversion of the spatial model and model parameters as this would introduce much more complexity and significantly increase the cpu time required 7 conclusion in this study the gdm approach was applied to calibrate a groundwater flow model of a valley fill hydrostratigraphic succession within a glacial sedimentary basin the gdm successfully calibrated the groundwater flow models with stochastic correlated k tensors for each hsu obtained with a linear model of coregionalisation during the simulation the covariance structure and the tensor component nonlinear correlations were preserved thanks to a bivariate transform using different k tensor realizations gdm calibrates alternative models the latter are essential inputs to assess uncertainty of groundwater flow and

4847,quasi point hydraulic properties k measured locally under laboratory or field conditions need to be upscaled to block scale k tensors for use in flow simulators the upscaled model also needs to be calibrated to hydraulic head observations the calibration must preserve spatial covariance cross covariance and non linear relations between tensor components we apply a new upscaling method that allows to compute and model the covariance between block k tensor components we use a gradual deformation method for calibration of simulated k tensor fields to measured head data our method incorporates a new bivariate transform that preserves the non linear relations between k tensor components the ensemble of calibrated realizations allows quantification of uncertainty of groundwater flow models a comparison with pest on a test case defining capture zones for water supply wells shows that our method calibrates better to measured heads than pest provides more realistic k tensors and results in larger capture zones keywords gradual deformation hydraulic conductivity tensor linear model of coregionalisation calibration pest 1 introduction the calibration of groundwater flow models by solving the inverse problem is the critical part of a standard modelling workflow anderson et al 2015 the objective of the inverse problem is to determine the values of the unknown parameters and their ranges e g hydraulic conductivity ensuring a good reproduction of the state variables e g hydraulic head inversion methods have evolved significantly over the past few decades carrera et al 2005 de marsily et al 2000 oliver and chen 2011 yeh 1986 zhou et al 2014 inversion by the direct method has been almost abandoned mainly since it requires the 3d field of hydraulic heads determined at all model nodes pasquier and marcotte 2006 ponzini and lozej 1982 zhou et al 2014 this approach is still valuable when a preliminary flow model is available as a starting point rivest et al 2008 on the other hand brouwer et al 2008 presented an interesting semi direct method based on the imposition of a double constraint which allows to calculate the hydraulic conductivity as the ratio of the flux and gradient fields the current trend of solving the inverse problem is oriented towards the indirect method as shown by a considerable number of studies reported in the literature e g alcolea et al 2006 caers 2002 carrera and neumanrrera 1986 evensen 2009 evensen 1994 hu 2000 gómez hernández et al 1997 kitanidis 1995 de marsily et al 1984 oliver et al 1997 ramarao et al 1995 todd hoffman and caers 2005 among many others in certain cases the inverse approach is the only option for simultaneously providing an adequate model fit to pressure observations and realistic k fields poeter and hill 1997 the main difficulty with the inverse problem resides in the non uniqueness of the solution it is then referred to as an ill posed problem hadamard 1932 for which several possibilities exist to reduce the solution space for example one can reduce the number of parameters to be determined impose constraints on the range of the values of the parameters using a priori information control the fluctuations during the optimization by adding a term of regularization and transform the model so as to minimize the model non linearity zhou et al 2014 a different perspective adopted in stochastic approaches is to cope with the non uniqueness of the solution by proposing a series of calibrated possible solutions the calibrated solutions reflect the uncertainty about the field state given the current information however model calibration for each realization can be tedious for complex models with a spatially varying k tensor hence efficient calibration methods must be used one such method is the gradual deformation method gdm hu 2000 ravalec et al 2000 the gdm has been applied to heterogeneous transmissivity fields in 2d in a stochastic context ravalec and mouche 2012 capilla and llopis albert 2009 with non gaussian distributions llopis albert and capilla 2009 capilla and llopis albert 2009 and for history matching in 2d marteau et al 2014 jeong et al 2010 to our knowledge gdm has never been applied to 3d stochastic k tensor fields to simplify the analysis and without real loss of generality we assume the hsu hydrostratigraphic unit model itself is considered deterministic and we apply gdm only for calibration of the k tensors defined at the block scale within each hsu if desired uncertainty on the hsu spatial distribution can be accounted for by calibrating the k tensors on one realization at a time from a series of realizations obtained by a facies simulation method e g see benoit et al 2017 k tensor components are often strongly and possibly non linearly cross correlated the preservation of these correlations is important we propose a practical method to maintain the desired cross correlation between tensor components within each hsu while applying the gdm the approach uses a linear model of coregionalization in gaussian space a bivariate transform of the gaussian lcm realizations restores the desired zero lag non linear correlations and component histograms one contribution in this paper is the use of direct geostatistical simulation of the conductivity tensors at block scale although this approach was proposed in a 2d context as early as 1993 gómez hernández and journel 1993 to our knowledge it has not been applied for 3d regional flow modelling a second contribution is the use of gdm for fast calibration of the tensor field whereas gdm was used previously only with scalar fields a third contribution is the bivariate transform used in this study that ensures reproduction of the non linear relations between the tensor components and the respect of the constraint k zz k xx not otherwise ensured by classical separate gaussian transforms followed by back transformation as usually done in geostatistical simulations the paper is structured as follows first we present the method used to upscale scalar point hydraulic conductivity to 3d block tensors of conductivity the new method allows to assess the spatial covariance and cross covariance of gaussian transformed k tensor components we then describe the simulation of 3d tensors respecting the spatial auto and cross correlation of the components combined with a bivariate transform aimed at maintaining the non linear relationships observed between tensor components we proceed with a brief review of the gdm approach before applying the methodology to a simplified case study calibration results are compared to those obtained with pest well capture zones defined with pest and our method are compared we complete the paper with discussions and conclusions 2 methodology the proposed methodology aims to characterize and calibrate a groundwater flow model with correlated k tensors the calibration is perform using gdm the approach mainly consists of optimizing the tensor components based on observation data hydraulic head using a set of k tensor realizations the methodology is divided into three main sections i hydraulic block conductivity tensor simulation ii bivariate transform and iii calibration with gdm 2 1 hydraulic block conductivity tensor simulation to define the stochastic k tensor fields used with the gdm a multi step method is proposed herein it consists of upscaling the spatial distribution of scalar k from local scale values quasi point to a block 3d k tensor this is repeated for each hsu the approach comprises four main steps i local scale simulation of the scalar k field ii upscaling of quasi point realizations into 3d block k tensors using a block by block finite element flow simulator iii definition of the spatial covariance and cross covariance of the block k tensors and iv direct geostatistical simulation of the block k tensors for regional scale modelling 2 1 1 local scale simulation of the scalar k the local scale k values can be estimated from different sources such as grain size analyses laboratory tests on borehole samples specific capacity tests or pumping tests for geostatistical processing it is important to use consistent data preferably from the same type similar support to avoid scale issues and to ensure similar levels of measurement error and spatial uncertainty for each hsu the k values can span several orders of magnitude the spatial structure of the quasi point k is therefore important to assess for block upscaling k values within a given hsu are spatially structured according to depositional processes while the covariance functions describe the spatial structures and are used in the geostatistical simulations a different point scalar k covariance model is determined for each unit a series of scalar point support realizations over local scale fields are generated for each unit using a non conditional turning band simulation tbs algorithm emery and lantuéjoul 2006 over a fine grid see section 3 2 1 non conditional simulation is used as the objective here is simply to determine block scale k tensor covariance functions the simulations are constrained by the observed quasi point k marginal distributions for each unit 2 1 2 upscaling of quasi point realizations into 3d block k tensors for regional 3d numerical modelling the k field is represented by block scale finite elements the quasi point k simulation must therefore be upscaled to equivalent block k tensors accounting for the structural connectivity of hydrofacies within each block gomez hernandez and journel 1990 gómez hernández and journel 1993 each quasi point field realization is solved for the governing flow equations along the diagonals and the three principal directions to get a series of block conductivity tensors following the approach described in benoit et al 2020 this approach works on sets of 27 blocks 3 3 3 corresponding to the central block for which the tensor is computed with the other blocks forming a skin to diminish the influence of the applied boundary equations as in zhou et al 2010 the 3d hydraulic conductivity tensors for each block were obtained by forcing flow conditions along 8 different directions using different sets of prescribed head conditions the mean heads and flux along the principal directions for the central block are then used to compute its k tensor the complete upscaling workflow is presented in fig 1 the saltflow simulator molson and frind 2017 was used to obtain the 3d velocity and head fields mean 3d components of flux q x q y q z and gradients h x h y h z were calculated and used with darcy s law to solve the full 3d k tensor 2 1 3 spatial covariance and cross covariance of the block k tensors the upscaled block k tensors are non gaussian and present non linear relationships between tensor components hence they are first gaussian transformed to determine the linear coregionalization model lcm at the block scale the spatial covariance and cross covariance of the gaussian transformed block k tensor components are computed and modelled by a lcm to simplify the modelling components of relatively negligible amplitude are discarded and components uncorrelated to the others are treated separately the off diagonal tensor components being negligible with respect to diagonal terms were set to 0 among the diagonal terms k xx appeared highly correlated to k yy to further simplify the model and because this makes sense geologically we assumed k xx k yy so finally the lcm describes two variables k horizontal and k vertical 2 1 4 geostatistical simulation of the block k tensors the last step consists of simulating the 3d k tensor for the hydrostratigraphic model complete fields of gaussian transformed block tensors are directly simulated using the lcms models of the previous step each realization of block tensor components is back transformed using a bivariate transform to preserve the non linear relationship observed between k horizontal and k vertical see section 2 2 2 2 bivariate transform the bivariate transformation uses as reference the k bivariate distribution for k xx k zz obtained in the initial upscaling phase of the point support k scalar fields the various pairs k xx k zz obtained during this phase identify a bivariate cumulative density function f k xx k zz and cdfs f k xx and f k zz similarly the bigaussian simulation of the lcm defines a bicdf f y xx y zz and cdfs f y xx and f y zz the transform was defined by computing the euclidean distance between the triplets so defined the closest triplet f k xx f k zz f k xx k zz to a simulated triplet f y xx f y zz f y xx y zz was selected for mapping y xx k xx and y zz k zz to introduce more randomness in the bivariate transform a small number of closest points to f y xx y zz in f k xx k zz are considered for possible mapping and one is randomly selected note that the transform so defined is not reversible as it is not one to one here we did not have to invert the transform because we used only unconditional simulations for conditional simulations invertibility is required in which case a projection pursuit multivariate transform barnett et al 2014 could be used but then the inequality k zz k zz is not guaranteed contrary to our approach fig 2 compares the original bivariate distributions from upscaling left and those obtained from the lcm after applying the bivariate transform to a lcm realization right a p value of 0 70 was obtained with a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test of the first principal component representing 99 of the total variance hence we have no evidence that the two distributions are different 2 3 gradual deformation method the gradual deformation method was introduced by hu 2000 as an efficient way to gradually modify realizations of gaussian fields while preserving their spatial structure and variability it linearly combines a current field y cur i 1 with a new realization y new i to form an updated field y cur i the updated field becomes the current field and the process is repeated over many iterations until no further significant improvement can be obtained the updated field is calculated with eq 1 1 y cur i y cur i 1 cos t i y new i sin t i where t i π π is the scalar parameter to optimize at iteration i and y new i and y cur 0 are independent realizations with the same desired spatial correlation structure here the t i parameter is optimized by a combination of golden search method luenberger and ye 2016 and parabolic interpolation brent 1972 which requires a small number of iterations to reach a value close to the optimum the main advantage of gdm is that it preserves by construction the spatial structure of the fields at every iteration its main disadvantage is that it tends to quickly reach a local minimum hu 2000 ravalec dupin and nøetinger 2002 lauzon and marcotte 2019 from which it can be difficult to escape parameter t i appearing in eq 1 is chosen to optimize the selected objective function of in this study we use the mean absolute errors between simulated h sim and observed h obs hydraulic heads following eq 2 2 of k 1 n i 1 n h sim i h obs i where k is the iteration index and n is the number of head observations note that at each iteration and for each different trial value for parameter t i the bivariate transform of the current field has to be applied and the flow simulator has to be run to get the simulated heads 3 study area the proposed methodology is applied on a simplified groundwater flow model representing a typical regional valley fill environment in this section we present the hydrostratigraphy of a valley fill conceptual model the characterization of the k tensor by hsu the numerical groundwater model and the gdm results of the model calibration 3 1 hydrostratigraphic model the considered study area is located in south simcoe county southern ontario canada and represents a valley partly filled with glaciolacustrine sediments fig 3 the groundwater flow system is controlled by innisfil creek flowing in the central portion of the valley fig 3c the simplified 3d numerical model contains four hsus with a sequence from the base to the top fig 3d newmarket till acting as a regional continuous aquitard atc1 a glaciofluvial sand and gravel aquifer afb2 a fine grained glaciolacustrine aquitard consisting of silt clay and subordinate fine sand atb2 and a shallow regressional coarse grained glaciolacustrine aquifer of sand and gravel afb1 the model is divided into a regular block grid with elements of 200x200x1 meters each hsu block is strongly heterogeneous with specific statistical and spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivities section 3 2 3 2 hydraulic conductivity an hsu block is composed of various proportions of geologic materials clay silt and sand for the modelling point of view the material proportions are grouped into hydrofacies or simply represented by a hydraulic conductivity k distribution the k data were collected at a point scale under field or laboratory conditions for regional modelling purposes these data needed to be regionalized and upscaled from point to block scale inner block heterogeneity was then represented by the block k tensor these steps are summarized in section 2 1 and described in more detail in benoit et al 2020 and benoit et al 2020 the characterization of k values for the groundwater flow model included the point scale characterization section 3 2 1 k upscaling from the local scale 3d field to block scale tensor fields and the definition of the geostatistical model of each hsu section 3 2 2 the latter models are used for stochastic assessment of the hsu k tensor needed for gdm application 3 2 1 point scale to block scale hydraulic conductivities several data grain size specific capacity and laboratory tests were collected per unit to characterize the variability of the hsu hydraulic conductivity only the k data estimated from grain size samples were retained as it was the only dataset with satisfactory spatial distribution and density to model the vertical covariance structure of k hsus sauerbrei s method was applied for the estimation of the k values from grain size data vukovic and soro 1992 an example for atb2 material distribution and corresponding k values is shown in fig 4 a the boxplots in fig 4b show the distribution of the units with typical value ranges for two aquifer units afb1 and afb2 and two aquitards atb1 and atc1 all units except atc1 clearly show non gaussian marginal distributions the k values were estimated from grain size samples which have a high resolution in the borehole vertical directions the covariance models all have spherical structures with a nugget effect representing 21 to 49 of the total variance the scalar conductivity is assumed isotropic horizontally and anisotropic along the vertical with a much smaller range along the vertical 2 3 7 m horizontal variograms could not be modeled based on these grain size samples due to the large distances between the boreholes instead a global horizontal range of about 1800 m was estimated from conductivity values based on relatively dense specific capacity tests from ontario well record information this range suggests that a maximum anisotropy ratio between the horizontal range ah and the vertical range av of ah av 300 can be expected unconditional realizations of scalar k were then simulated on a grid of 120 120 120 points with grid spacing of 20 m 20 m 0 1 m the grid resolution was deemed sufficient to represent small scale variability considering the much larger correlation ranges of k measurements obtained from quasi point samples and the 10 times larger size of blocks required for numerical modelling the upscaling described in section 2 1 2 was applied to obtain block values on a coarser grid of 12 12 12 blocks of size 200 m 200 m 1 m the resulting block k tensors are used in the flow simulator which integrate the small scale variability at the block scale a correction had to be made to the k tensors of the atc1 unit since the newmarket till is a very compact unit its initial k values derived from the grain size samples completely ignored the compaction effect instead laboratory permeability tests were conducted on unreworked core samples from the boreholes which conserved the compaction state results from the permeability tests indicate lower k values by about two orders of magnitude than those from the grain size analyses pasquier et al 2016 and consequently atc1 k tensor values were modified by this factor the developed hsu k tensors show a significant variability with a succession of aquifer and aquitard value ranges e g k xx ref table 1 geostatistical modelling was performed on the hsu block scale k tensors to determine the lcm spatial covariance and cross covariance structures of the components used in the block simulations the upscaling reveals a very high correlation between k xx and k yy therefore they were assumed equal moreover the off diagonal tensor components were small enough to be neglected hereafter 3 2 2 block scale hydraulic conductivity tensor modelling the geostatistical structures of the k tensor were determined only for the principal components of the groundwater flow model k xx k yy k zz oriented in the principal direction of the model axes in such case the cross components are practically negligible and were set to zero in addition to the very strong correlation between the horizontal components of the reference k tensor k yy set equal to k xx there is also a strong correlation not necessarily linear between horizontal and vertical components k xx and k zz for all units fig 5 the covariance modelling showed that the correlated log k xx and log k zz components have similar covariance structures and are thus admissible for linear models of coregionalisation lmc the structures variance and covariance of the lcm are unique for each hsu table 2 the lcm models were further used to simulate the stochastic block fields of the k tensor principal components this step involves the bivariate transform described in section 2 2 to restore the nonlinear correlations between the tensor components observed in hsu afb1 and atb1 the resulting realizations were used for calibration using the gdm see section 4 note that all realizations are unconditional as no observations of the block conductivity tensor are available at the block scale 3 3 groundwater flow model the 3d groundwater flow model was developed with the saltflow code molson and frind 2017 the considered study area was 4 km horizontal x direction by 6 km horizontal y direction by 60 m vertical z direction the model domain contains 36 000 isoparametric 3d finite elements 20 30 60 and 39 711 nodes the stream flowing in the central portion is represented by a constant head boundary condition the values along the stream vary linearly between 57 to 59 meters over a thickness of one meter the stream actually represents a major drainage boundary for the infiltrated precipitation water recharge across the study area in the model the hsus are represented by the principal components of the k tensor realizations there is one single value for each component per block the component spatial distributions were simulated with the turning band algorithm emery and lantuéjoul 2006 whereas the correlated components were simulated using a lcm model table 2 a model referred to as the true model was taken as one of the unconditional realizations fig 6 this model is used in the flow simulator to get true head values that one will seek to calibrate the average recharge rate in the model was assumed at 25 mm y which represents a fairly low rate for glaciolacustrine sediments in southern ontario such a low value is justified by the location of the study area which is restrained to a relatively narrow corridor along the stream that serves rather as a discharge zone for regional groundwater flow in addition intense agriculture activities regularly include trench drainage systems which capture considerable amounts of infiltrated water for development purposes the recharge rate was simulated using the turning band method with a small variance i e small spatial variability around the mean value which allows for a gdm of the k tensor combined with the recharge rate fig 6b fig 6c shows the head distribution of the true model to test the accuracy of the calibration procedure section 4 59 head observations were randomly selected from the 3d simulated head field covering each of the model units 6d since no field observations of the water levels are considered herein these values will represent field observations referred to as true observations that will be the target values to be attained by the gdm scenarios 4 model calibration in this section the true model k tensor fields and recharge rate fields are considered as unknown to test the proposed gdm methodology the sets of new k tensors and recharge realizations optimized by the calibrated groundwater flow model were compared against the head observation data of the true model fig 6 among all the results presented in this section a reference model section 4 1 was determined around which three scenarios are compared in order to better understand the performance of calibration by the proposed methodology the reference model is considered to best fit the true observations the different scenarios evaluate i the random effects of equivalent realizations on the variability of the solution section 4 2 ii recharge effects on the head results section 4 3 and iii the influence of the number of head data observation section 4 4 4 1 the reference model the reference model represents the base case or the so called best model compared to the unknown true model therefore the results of the other scenarios are compared to this reference model the calibration of the reference model was conducted using 100 realizations of the k tensor and recharge rate fig 7 the results of the gdm show an acceptable calibration for the reference model the head difference at observation points is considerably reduced as shown in fig 7g where the calibrated reference model adequately reproduces the true head observations fig 7h shows the simulated vs true head observations for initial field blue intermediate gdm field grey to the final gdm field red the spatial distribution of the calibrated recharge k xx and head fields figs 7d 7e and 7f respectively compare well with the initial structures figs 7d 7e and 7f the true model fields fig 6a 6b and 6c the reference model also correctly reproduced the variograms and cross variograms in different directions e g afb1 unit depicted in fig 8 most of the improvement in the of brought by the gdm occurs in the first 10 realizations fig 9 for the remaining 90 realizations from 10 to 100 a relatively small of reduction occurs and the weight cos t becomes very close to 1 indicating no further significant modification affects the calibrated field 4 2 random effects gdm was applied similarly with different initial seeds the seed controls the set of k tensor and recharge realizations available to the gdm everything else was kept identical fig 10 show four different final calibrated log k xx fields the quality of calibration on the head field is similar for the four fields although the structures globally also appear similar the spatial distribution of values is significantly different this shows that the proposed methodology can generate many different models able to calibrate the head fields in absence of other constraining information these fields appear equivalent and can thus be used to assess the uncertainty about the real field fig 11 shows the boxplots of k xx a and k zz b components of the model tensors before k xx 0 and k zz 0 and after the calibration for the four realizations k xx 1 to k xx 4 and k zz 1 to k zz 4 for each observation point located at a model node the corresponding k value is determined as the average of the eight connected elements it can be observed that the calibration has no significant effect on the local variability of the k tensors components although the hydraulic head value is measured locally it is influenced by the upstream and downstream k values even at great distances as well as by the recharge flux which in this case is also stochastic 4 3 recharge effects the uncertainty of the recharge rate affects the gdm solutions as well to illustrate these effects different recharge scenarios are considered different recharge for each gdm step constant recharge over all cells unique recharge realization for all gdm steps the k tensor realizations used in the gdm remain the same for all recharge scenarios fig 12 illustrates the studied recharge scenarios the corresponding calibrated log k xx field and the difference between the calibrated and the true log k xx field the results indicate that the recharge scenario impacts the calibrated k tensors the calibrated fields of the various scenarios show a different spatial distribution of log k xx in addition the recharge scenario affects the variogram of the calibrated k xx component fig 13 shows the variograms of the calibrated fields for k xx and k zz components as well as the cross variograms of these components of each of the three recharge scenarios and for the true model in the three main directions the quality of the fit obtained with each recharge scenario is assessed using the mae between the k tensor variograms of the true and calibrated fields under the different recharge scenarios 3 mae i h w h γ t h γ i h γ t h where h is the lag distance γ t h and γ i h are respectively the true and calibrated experimental variogram at lag h for a given realization and tensor component and w h is the weight factor applied to lag h the sum of weights is one which is defined as w h n h h 2 h n h h 2 where n h is the number of pairs per lag fig 14 shows the boxplot of the 300 maes 100 calibrated fields 3 tensor components under the three different recharge scenarios the visual comparison of boxplots indicates that the stochastic scenario best reproduces the conductivity structure of the true field the median of the mae and mean computed with eq 3 is least for the stochastic scenario indicating a better variogram reproduction with this approach 4 4 influence of number of head data in this section calibration is done on various numbers of head observations with 59 30 15 11 7 and only 3 observations the heads obtained with the calibrated models are compared over a dense 3d grid to the true head field by computing mean square error rmse and correlation fig 15 shows that the applied method calibrates well over the entire domain under the condition that there is a sufficient number of observation wells the gdm converges towards acceptable error and correlation values with only several head measurements about 10 in this case correlation and rmse steadily improves with increasing number of data 5 capture zones the proposed methodology was used to illustrate the uncertainty assessment for the delineation of well capture zones using the calibrated fields the different capture zones by gdm are compared to those determined using the commonly used pest inversion algorithm doherty 2015 5 1 pest calibration the pest inversion method is widely used in hydrogeological modelling hill and tiedeman 2006 in this section the calibration of the reference model see section 4 1 is done using pest the calibration with pest was carried out zonally i e using one homogeneous k tensor per hsu the initial values of the tensor components were set equal to the average values of the corresponding hsu in the reference model the pest inversion was constrained by the minimum and maximum values found in the reference model in each hsu the results presented in fig 16 show that the pest algorithm calibrates well using the hydraulic head observations similar to the gdm model compare with fig 9 it is interesting to note that the hydraulic head field obtained by pest with the initial k tensor generally overestimates the hydraulic head observations since pest was used zonally the algorithm had to adjust the mean tensor component values to calibrate table 3 compares the initial and calibrated values after pest and gdm inversion for inversion with pest there is approximately one order of magnitude difference between the initial and calibrated tensors for atb2 and afb2 the afb2 values are clearly inadequate after the pest calibration as calibrated log k xx log k zz by an order of magnitude something geologically unacceptable for this type of environment moreover after pest inversion the atb2 aquitard and the afb2 aquifer show approximately the same value for log k xx which is also geologically unrealistic on the contrary the mean conductivities of calibrated fields by gdm are equal to the initial means hence despite good calibration to head data the pest calibrated field is not acceptable based on geological considerations multiple zones within each hsu or the pilot point method within pest could have been used none of these approaches would allow reproducing the spatial correlations and complex relationship between tensor components therefore they were not attempted 5 2 well capture zone delineation and uncertainty to illustrate the benefit of the proposed approach 100 equivalent flow models were calibrated using gdm to assess the uncertainty regarding delineation of well capture zones the calibration is performed on head observation as described in section 4 1 for this purpose two pumping wells are added to the model one located in the surficial aquifer afb1 and one in the confined aquifer afb2 well w1 is located at coordinates x 1400 and y 3000 and well w2 at x 2600 and y 3000 the well screens extend vertically from 46 to 59 m w1 and 16 to 29 m w2 to delineate the well capture zones the capture probability concept was applied molson and frind 2012 the approach consists of quantifying a capture probability using the backward mode of the advective dispersive transport model by inverting the groundwater velocity field frind et al 2002 neupauer and wilson 2001 neupauer and wilson 2004 neupauer and wilson 2005 in this approach the macrodispersion term simulates the local scale uncertainties within elements gelhar and axness 1983 a capture probability boundary condition of p 1 is applied at well locations transient transport simulations provide the probability field which decreases up gradient fig 17 shows capture probability contours of the 100 calibrated models for probabilities p 0 5 light grey and p 0 1 dark grey after 100 years of simulation for comparison purposes the capture probability contours red are also determined for the calibrated model with pest and the true model blue wells w1 and w2 have separate capture zones well w2 shows a capture probability p 0 1 from the pest inversion that only slightly exceeds the capture probability p 0 5 of the gdm models in this example the stochastic approach appears more conservative than pest as the capture zones are wider for the same capture probability level both approaches show in plan view asymmetric capture zones for w1 and symmetric zones for w2 for w1 the river flows north south and acts as a discharge zone so the regional groundwater flow is toward the river explaining the capture zone asymmetry on the contrary w2 is not hydraulically connected to the river due to the presence of the aquitard atb2 the capture zones for the true model blue differ significantly from those obtained by pest red and are everywhere well within the interval of capture zones obtained by the stochastic approach using gdm light gray for p 0 5 and dark gray for p 0 1 6 discussion our approach includes upscaling of the quasi point conductivity to k tensor conductivity and a bivariate transformation aimed at preserving the non linear relationship between tensor components the main motivation to upscale first and then simulate directly at the block level instead of working at the point level was cpu time upscaling all model blocks would be significantly more cpu intensive requiring as many calls to the flow simulator locally as the number of blocks times the number of gdm iterations times the number of line searches needed for each gdm iteration times the number of different sets of flow boundary conditions 8 in all to obtain the tensor although the flow simulation is local it remains an important workload considering the number of times it has to be run upscaling a single block takes 3 75 s compared to 0 95 s for 36 000 blocks simulated by the lcm so there is a five orders of magnitude reduction in computer time by adopting our approach the flow simulator at the block scale took only two seconds of cpu time hence our approach delivers a flow simulation in three seconds compared to 37 h for the other approach a second reason is the size of the lcm simulation at point vs block supports the point simulation has to be done over the whole field to preserve the correlation at the block scale for a 10 10 10 discretisation of each block this represents three orders of magnitude more points to simulate with a turning band simulator or sequential gaussian simulation this would also represent three orders of magnitude more cpu time and memory for the geostatistical simulation then the tensor components were regionalized using unconditional simulations in our context scarcity of point data a single borehole was available over the study area rendered conditioning ineffective in other contexts where point conditioning is useful the required point tensor component covariances can be easily gathered during the upscaling phase to define the lcm involving now three variables point conductivity and the two main tensor components the other modification required would be to use a trivariate reversible transform for example based on the projection pursuit multivariate transform barnett et al 2014 the cpu advantage of our approach would remain the same as in the unconditional case the results clearly show that gdm is able to calibrate a highly heterogeneous 3d multi layer regional groundwater flow system while preserving the desired spatial direct and cross correlation of the k tensor the computation time of this indirect inversion method is dominated by the number of calls to the groundwater flow simulator this time can be kept reasonable by allowing only a few line search steps to find parameter t in eq 1 and by asking only a small number of gdm iterations justified by the fact that the most significant improvements to the of occur in the few first iterations see fig 9 the method allows to generate numerous equally well calibrated models which can be used to assess the uncertainty about the real field our results indicate that the recharge scenario impacts the calibrated k tensors and that the stochastic recharge scenario produced calibrated fields with k tensor component variograms closer to variograms of the true model one interesting result was that the entire head field was well approximated after calibrating on only a small number of head data n 10 using more head data barely enhanced the approximation to the entire true head field the calibrated head fields obtained by gdm and by pest were compared for the definition of capture zones defined around two pumping wells the k tensor for the different hsus appeared geologically more realistic by gdm than the calibrated k tensor obtained with pest moreover the stochastic approach leads to larger possibly more conservatives capture zones than with a single pest calibrated model no uncertainty was assumed with respect to the histogram and k variograms for each of the hydrostratigraphic units uncertainty on the model parameters can be described by priors for these parameters however we did not pursue this approach as first priors are difficult to define and second it would have required a different block tensor upgrading step for each different variogram significantly increasing the cpu time compared to the proposed approach morevoer the influence of the variogram model on the quality of the calibration is deemed negligible when compared for example to the effect of boundary conditions or to the simulation of the hsu units other sources of uncertainty could be included by selecting parameter sets from an a priori distribution but we avoid full bayesian inversion of the spatial model and model parameters as this would introduce much more complexity and significantly increase the cpu time required 7 conclusion in this study the gdm approach was applied to calibrate a groundwater flow model of a valley fill hydrostratigraphic succession within a glacial sedimentary basin the gdm successfully calibrated the groundwater flow models with stochastic correlated k tensors for each hsu obtained with a linear model of coregionalisation during the simulation the covariance structure and the tensor component nonlinear correlations were preserved thanks to a bivariate transform using different k tensor realizations gdm calibrates alternative models the latter are essential inputs to assess uncertainty of groundwater flow and

4848,coupled migration of water and heat is one of the core problems in studying the frost heave and thaw weakening problems in cold regions determination of the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils is the key to understanding this process the hydraulic conductivity of a frozen soil is related to the liquid water flow in pores among soil solid and pore ice which differs from the hydraulic conductivity of an unfrozen soil this study develops a new hydraulic conductivity model for frozen soils based on the kozeny carman equation which is consistent in form with the hydraulic conductivity model of unfrozen soils the proposed model is validated against existing models and measured data in the literature parametric analysis of the model shows that the unfrozen water saturation and shape coefficient ratio are important parameters that affect the hydraulic conductivity in addition the proposed model can be simplified to a power function which is very easy to use the new model only

temperatures the test results showed that the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil is much lower than that of unfrozen soil which requires a high accuracy instrument to control the temperature of the sample during the flowing process of the fluid considering the long test period the complexity of testing instrument and the difficulty in evaluating the error direct measurement of the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils is not widely applied in the literature from a theoretical viewpoint various mathematical models have been proposed to describe the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil these models can be divided into three categories as shown in table 1 the first category is the empirical formula that relates hydraulic conductivity to the sub freezing temperature for example horiguchi and miller 1983 found a fitting equation for the relation between hydraulic conductivity and temperature based on the experimental results of frozen soil nixon 1991 further proposed a linear relationship for hydraulic conductivity versus temperature in double logarithmic coordinates although these formulas are simple and easy to use hydraulic conductivity does not have any direct physical relation with temperature this kind of formulas is difficult to generalize the second category is the empirical formula that relates hydraulic conductivity to the unfrozen water content spaans and baker 2016 and watanabe and osada 2016 found that frozen soil has a similar hydraulic conductivity to unfrozen soil if their water contents are identical hence the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil can be obtained by discounting the hydraulic conductivity at positive temperatures according to the unfrozen water content watanabe and osada 2016 o neill and miller 1985 watanabe and wake 2008 azmatch et al 2012 mao et al 2007 for example o neill and miller 1985 and watanabe and osada 2016 proposed an empirical equation by inputting the unfrozen water content which was indirectly determined by the swcc soil water characteristic curve it is noted that a large number of theoretical and experimental studies on sfcc are available in the literature thus it is theoretically reasonable and experimentally feasible to develop a hydraulic conductivity model of frozen soil based on sfcc watanabe and wake 2008 and azmatch et al 2012 proposed to use the directly measured unfrozen water content by sfcc this kind of expression can deliberate the contribution of the unfrozen water content to the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil which is physically reasonable but they neglect the effect of pore ice some models used an empirical impedance factor to describe the presence of ice blocks in the existing flow paths jame and norum 1980 however this empirical parameter does not have physical meaning and is not easy to determine black and hardenberg 1991 newman and wilson 1997 more recently some studies derived a model for the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil based on the state and geometry of unfrozen water in frozen soil this model provides a new method to understand this parameter for example lebeau and konrad 2012 stated that unfrozen water could be divided into two components one is dominated by capillary forces and the other is by adsorption forces these authors speculated that the unfrozen water flowed between two infinite horizontal parallel plates ice and particle the thickness of the water film can be used to calculate the frozen soil hydraulic conductivity which is determined by the disjoining pressure watanabe and flury 2008 and tang et al 2019 supposed that ice was formed in the centre of the capillary which provided a circular pipe for liquid water chen et al 2019 developed a fractal capillary bundle model for the hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil these expressions have a physical meaning that is derived from the presence of unfrozen water in soil pores however the expressions involve many undefinable parameters some of which are difficult to directly obtain which greatly limits their application therefore a method to better express the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil in a simple form with clear physical meaning remains an open question the objectives of this study are to investigate the phase state of water and growing process of ice in soils and to develop a new model for the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil the new model derives from the kozeny carman equation and extends to the sub freezing condition which can be determined as a function of the unfrozen water content the new model will be compared with various existing models and the measured data to evaluate its applicability 2 material and methods 2 1 basic assumptions it has been found that the existence of unfrozen water can be traced to slight modifications in the equilibrium phase behaviour that are induced by characteristics of the soil and its interactions with liquid water and solid ice rempel 2012 unlike the phase change in an open system the freezing thawing temperature of pore ice generally varies with the change in pore radius according to the gibbs thomson equation mitchell et al 2008 anderson et al 2009 teng et al 2019b when the temperature reaches a critical value it corresponds to the maximum radius of liquid water i e the pore water will not freeze under this maximum pore radius additionally the pore radius indicates a minimum radius of pore ice in the soil in other words in the freezing process once the temperature drops to t all soil pores larger than pore radius r will be frozen by ice and the relationship between t and r becomes 1 δ t t m t t m f γ sl cos θ r ρ s δ h f according to eq 1 the maximum radius of liquid water in frozen soil at a specific temperature is 2 r f γ sl cos θ t m ρ s δ h f t m t where t m is the bulk melting point of the solid k γ sl is the solid liquid interface free energy j m2 r is the pore radius m ρ s is the density of the solid phase kg m3 δh f is the latent heat enthalpy of fusion j kg f is the shape factor of the interface dimensionless and θ is the contact angle between the solid phase and the pore wall dimensionless there is a surface melted layer of a single crystal of ice at a plane solid interface which is called the pre melted film wilen and dash 1995 when the saturated sample is freezing between the surface of the ice particle and soil particle there is a thin water film rempel 2010 watanabe and flury 2008 lebeau and konrad 2012 this part of water is unfrozen because the dynamic equilibrium between water and ice is always maintained the disjoining pressure is the force per unit area with which ice and particle surfaces push against each other across the intervening pre melted film although a number of different surface forces are known to contribute to the disjoining pressure lebeau and konrad 2012 defined it as follows 3 π δ π e δ π m δ where π is the disjoining pressure δ is the thickness of the water film πe is the ionic electrostatic component of disjoining pressure and πm is the molecular component of disjoining pressure taking into account all the above mentioned existence of unfrozen water the following assumptions are made fig 1 1 the soil is assumed to be saturated i e the air phase in the void is neglected 2 both soil particle and pore ice are considered ideal spheres and the growth of ice is uniform the pre melted film is marked both around ice particles and soil particles 3 the effect of pore ice on the liquid water flow is assumed to be identical to that of the soil particle and only the viscous force is considered between pore ice and unfrozen liquid water 2 2 model derivation for the soil at a positive temperature there are many different models to compute the hydraulic conductivity among which the kozeny carman equation kc equation may be the most popular model the kc equation was first proposed by kozeny 1927 and further developed by carman 1937 as follows 4 k c s 1 γ 2 ρ s 2 s s 2 e 3 1 e where c s is a dimensionless shape constant γ is the tortuosity dimensionless e is the porosity ratio dimensionless and s s is the specific surface area of soil m2 kg the kc equation has been validated for coarse grained soils based on experimental results e g sands taylor 1948 lambe and whitman 1969 ren and santamarina 2018 teng et al 2020 the relationship of relevant parameters is shown in fig 2 according to the hagen poiseuille equation the intrinsic permeability k of soils can be expressed as 5 k c s ϕ r h 2 γ 2 where ϕ is the porosity dimensionless and r h is the hydraulic radius m on a section r h is defined as the ratio of the cross section area that is available for flow to the wetted perimeter as follows 6 r h a f p wp where a f is the cross section available for flow m2 i e the cross section of the water in saturated soil and p wp is the wetted perimeter m the a f and p wp on the sections of irregular shape capillary are not constant thus hydraulic radius r h should be expressed as mean hydraulic radius r h as shown in eq 7 7 r h a f p wp a f l t p wp l t 0 l t a f l d l 0 l t p wp l d l v f a sf where l t is the true length of flow channels in the soil m v f is the volume of flow channels m3 and a sf is the total surface area of flow channels m2 it is noted that the form of r h is the ratio of the volume of flow channels v f to total surface area of flow channels a sf carman 1937 ren et al 2016 in saturated soil v f and a sf can be considered void volume v v m3 and soil particle surface area a sp m2 respectively therefore in the kc equation the hydraulic radius can be further simplified as 8 r h v f a sf v v a sp e v s a sp e v s m s a sp m s e ρ s s s substituting eq 8 into eq 5 leads to the result of eq 4 because eq 4 is derived from eq 5 both of them have the same assumptions and limitations the flow is laminar and the rheological constitutive equation must conform to newton s law of viscosity i e the shear stress is proportional to the shear strain rate as for macropore channels seepage may become turbulent under high hydraulic gradient but the velocity of fluid in frozen soils is very low which means that the flow is laminar in general in clay soil the interaction between water and particle surface may make the rheological equation not conform to newton s law of viscosity due to the assumption that electrochemical reaction is neglected between solid particles and permeant eq 4 cannot be applied to clay soil carrier 2003 ren et al 2016 when the temperature of soils drops to sub zero temperature the pore ice is formed in soils according to assumption 2 the mean hydraulic radius in eq 8 should be modified as 9 r h v f a sf v v v i a sp a si where v i is the volume of ice m3 and a si is the total surface area of ice particles m2 here the unfrozen water saturation s u is defined as the ratio of the unfrozen water content θ u to the saturated water content θ s the unfrozen water saturation can be used to determine the value of v v v i 10 v v v i θ u θ s v f s u e v s the total surface area of soil particles a sp m2 in a soil sample can be expressed by a cumulative function as follows 11 a sp j r s min r s m ax n s j 4 π r s j 2 where n s j is the total number of particles with a soil specific radius in a soil sample r s j is the particle radius of soil m similarly the total surface area of ice particles a si in a soil sample can be expressed as 12 a si j r i min r i m ax n i j 4 π r i j 2 in eq 12 n i j is the total number of ice particles with a specific radius in a soil sample r i j is the particle radius of ice because soil and ice particles are spheres and their size and cross section can vary it is not easy to determine their surface area directly it is noticed that the surface area of a sphere 4πr 2 the radius of the sphere is r is equal to the lateral area of a circumscribed cylinder 4πr 2 the height of the cylinder is 2r the bottom radius of the cylinder is r therefore both soil and ice particles can be assumed as cylinders to compute ratio of their surface areas in order to find the relationship between a si and a sp they are divided by the volume of soil sample as shown in eqs 13 and 14 respectively 13 a sp v j r s min r s m ax n s j 4 π r s j 2 al 4 j r s min r s max n s j l π r s j 2 a 14 a si v j r i min r i m ax n i j 4 π r i j 2 al 4 j r i min r i max n i j l π r i j 2 a where a is the cross sectional area of soil sample m2 l is the height or length of soil sample m in eqs 13 and 14 n s j l and n i j l means the average number of soil and ice particles with a specific radius on the cross sectional area of soil sample respectively 1 m the cumulative function in eq 13 can be converted to the following form 15 j r s min r s max n s j l π r s j 2 a a s a 1 ϕ where a s is the cross sectional area of soil m2 which is the total area of the yellow part in fig 3 a the ratio of a s and a is equal to 1 ϕ in the same way the cumulative function in eq 14 can be converted to the following form 16 j r i min r i max n i j l π r i j 2 a a i a a f a a i a f ϕ 1 s u the result of the cumulative function j r i min r i max n i j l π r i j is the cross sectional area of ice a i which is the total area as the white part in fig 3 a the a f a v is total area as the light and dark blue part in fig 3 a and the ratio of a i and a f is 1 s u combining eqs 13 16 the relationship between a si and a sp can be obtained as follows 17 a si a sp j r i min r i max n i j 4 π r i j 2 a l j r s min r s max n s j 4 π r s j 2 a l 4 4 j r i min r i max n i j l π r i j 2 a j r s min r s max n s j l π r s j 2 a 4 4 ϕ 1 s u 1 ϕ 4 4 e 1 s u as mentioned above the surface area of a sphere is equal to the lateral area of a circumscribed cylinder the ratio of surface areas of two cylinders is equal to the ratio of surface areas of two spheres in the assumption both soil particles and pore ice particles are considered as ideal spheres however as shown in the fig 3 b the shapes of ice and soil particles are irregular and different in fact there are different formulas to calculate the surface areas of solids surface area of a sphere is 4π r 2 with a radius of r surface area of a cube is 6 a 2 with a side length of the cube a it is noted that the formula to calculate the surface area of a solid consists of two parts the coefficient of the surface area and the square of its characteristic length the shape factor ratio ε is used to correct the difference in shape between ice and soil particles and eq 17 can be modified as 18 a si a sp 4 4 e 1 s u ε e 1 s u combining eqs 9 18 we modify r h at sub zero temperatures as 19 r h v f v i v s a sf a si v s s u e ρ s s s 1 ε e 1 s u there is a tortuosity parameter γ in kc equation and it is note that the tortuosity is a function related to porosity ϕ in the literature koponen et al 1997 ghanbarian et al 2013 srisutthiyakorn and mavko 2017 zhang et al 2020 therefore tortuosity γ can be marked as γ ϕ to show the relationship between tortuosity and porosity when ice grows in soils the soil pores are gradually filled by ice and the tortuosity changes as well thus the tortuosity should be revised accordingly γ ϕ should be modified as γ s u ϕ in this study the expression proposed by yu and li 2004 is used to determine γ as follows 20 γ ϕ 1 2 1 1 2 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 1 1 ϕ 1 2 1 4 1 1 ϕ and eq 20 should be modified to calculate the tortuosity of frozen soil 21 γ s u ϕ 1 2 1 1 2 1 s u ϕ 1 s u ϕ 1 1 s u ϕ 1 2 1 4 1 1 s u ϕ by combining the eqs 5 19 and 21 the inherent permeability of frozen soil under negative temperatures k i can be expressed as 22 k i c s s u 3 γ 2 s u ϕ 1 ε e 1 s u 2 e 3 ρ s 2 s s 2 1 e comparing to the kc equation at positive temperatures it can be obtained that 23a k i λ k 23b λ γ 2 ϕ s u 3 γ 2 s u ϕ 1 ε e 1 s u 2 as shown in eq 23a the expression of the inherent permeability under negative temperatures is continuous with the kc equation under positive temperatures which can be considered a generalization of the kc equation at the same time parameters s u e and ϕ in the expression can be experimentally measured and γ can be calculated by eq 21 while parameters c s and εhave clear physical meaning and are easy to determine the expression of the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil can be derived from the intrinsic permeability as follows 24 k ρ g η c s s u 3 γ 2 s u e 1 e 1 ε e 1 s u 2 e 3 ρ s 2 s s 2 1 e where ρ and η are the density kg m3 and dynamic viscosity pa s of water respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 validation of the proposed model in the literature there are limited measured data for the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil lebeau and konrad 2012 proposed a model to predict the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil and evaluated the model based on the experimental results from horiguchi and miller 1983 the soil properties in their study are shown in table 2 the experimental parameters obtained from the experiments of horiguchi and miller 1983 are adopted in this study to validate the proposed model assigning the parameter in eq 19 by the values in table 2 the hydraulic conductivity of each soil at freezing condition can be determined the dynamic viscosity of the liquid film can be estimated by a polynomial function of absolute temperature churaev et al 1993 25 η η w 0 0 00616 t t 0 0 00212 t t 0 2 where iw 0 0 00175 pa s is the dynamic viscosity of the bulk water at reference absolute temperature t 0 273 15 k the density of the water is herein approximated with the sixth order polynomial function for supercooled water hare and sorensen 1987 as follows 26 ρ 0 99986 6 690 10 5 t t 0 8 486 10 6 t t 0 2 1 518 10 7 t t 0 3 6 9484 10 9 t t 0 4 3 6449 10 10 t t 0 5 7 497 10 12 t t 0 6 to evaluate the performance of the proposed model the prediction results of this model are compared to both experimental data from horiguchi and miller 1983 and other models proposed in the literature to determine the unfrozen water content the expression of the soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc proposed by lebeau and konrad 2012 is adopted in this study as follows 27 θ w θ w c 1 θ w c θ s θ w a θ w c θ s h m h m a θ

volumetric moisture content at saturation dimensionless θ w c and θ w a are the volumetric moisture contents contributed by the capillary force and adsorption force respectively dimensionless θ w 0 is the volumetric water content due to adsorption at the matrix head of 1 m dimensionless ν w and ν i are the specific volumes of water and ice respectively m3 kg l w o is the specific latent heat of fusion of water at 273 15 k χ is the constant of proportionality dimensionless and is 2 2 and h m dry is the matric head at oven dryness 105 m other parameters are shown in table 1 the values of the fitting parameters are shown in fig 4 the variations of other parameters in the model density and dynamic viscosity of water tortuosity with decreasing temperature are shown in fig 5 the relative hydraulic conductivity is uniformly used for normalization and the relative hydraulic conductivity k r is defined as 28 k r k k s where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m s fig 6 shows that the computed result by the proposed model is consistent with the experimental data where the starting point of the temperature is the freezing point of water 273 15 k the value of ε is obtained by using least squares estimation to fit the experimental data in the result of calgary silt in fig 6 c the model proposed by lebeau and konrad 2012 cannot predict the hydraulic conductivity according to the soil properties and sfcc which is considered to be caused by experimental errors to make a prediction s s in the model of lebeau and konrad 2012 is changed from 1 89 107 m2 m3 to 1 40 107 m2 m3 the green short dash line is the result before the correction and the green dash line is the result after the correction according to the original experimental data the proposed model can predict the hydraulic conductivity under negative temperatures as shown in fig 6 c the proposed model combines the advantages of the second and third categories of frozen soil hydraulic conductivity in the proposed model the unfrozen water content is an independent variable which clearly clarifies the relationship between unfrozen water content and hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil since the model is derived based on the state and geometry of unfrozen water in frozen soil each parameter in the proposed model has a physical meaning in addition the proposed model only requires one fitting parameter which can well predict the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil 3 2 parametric analysis the input parameters of the proposed model are related to soil water and ice among them the unfrozen water saturation s u and shape factor ratio ε greatly affect the prediction of the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil the unfrozen water saturation s u determines the shape and changing trend of the model which can reflect the unfrozen water content in soils and dominate the amount of flowable water in soils as shown in fig 7 the shape and changing tendency of the predicted hydraulic conductivity at negative temperatures are consistent with the corresponding sfcc therefore the sfcc is an important parameter in this model to predict the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils particularly when using the proposed model it can be calculated without relying on a specific sfcc curve expression in the model of lebeau and konrad 2012 the relevant physical parameters must be determined by fitting measured data of sfcc then the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil can be predicted according to these input physical parameters however in the proposed model the unfrozen water content is considered an independent variable thus it does not rely on a specific sfcc expression to make a verification the sfcc model proposed by liu and yu 2013 is used 29 s u 1 1 a ln t 0 t n m where a n and m are fitting parameters and t 0 is the freezing point of water 273 15 k by applying eq 29 to best fit the experimental data of the manchester silt fraction the value of a n and m can be determined as 10162 3 2 and 0 35 respectively the sfcc predicted by the two models and the corresponding predicted hydraulic conductivities are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 if an sfcc model can well match the experimental data the corresponding hydraulic conductivity can be accurately predicted by this sfcc model this conclusion verifies that the proposed model does not rely on a specific sfcc model and that unfrozen water content s u is only an independent variable in the proposed model the shape factor ratio ε does not affect the shape of the model but it directly affects the hydraulic conductivity as shown in fig 9 with the same change in temperatures the predicted hydraulic conductivity gradually decreases with increasing ε shape factor ratio ε is a parameter related to the soil properties which reflects the difference in shape of ice and soil particles if the shape of soil particles tends to that of ice particles the shape factor ratio ε is close to 1 a greater difference in shape between soil particles and ice particles leads to a greater shape coefficient ratio ε since the difference between different surface area coefficients is generally no more than 1 order in magnitude the shape factor ratio ε is recommended to change in the range of 0 02 50 3 3 applicable conditions of the proposed model the above analysis shows that the results of the proposed model are consistent with the experimental data for silt all unfrozen water is assumed to be flowable in soils in fact not all of the unfrozen water in soils can participate in flowing which results in a certain deviation in the fitting effect of this model as shown in fig 10 the two lines are the predicted result for illite clay with different values of ε the case of ε being equal to 95 98 results in a better fitting to the experimental result in this case ε is much greater than its recommended range 0 02 50 the reason may be that the kc equation is not suitable for predicting the hydraulic conductivity of clay due to a large amount of water adsorbed on the surface of soil particles in clay which should be considered a part of soil particles ren et al 2016 therefore there is a certain error when using the proposed model to predict the hydraulic conductivity of clay at negative temperatures and it is necessary to consider the effect of immobile water to further improve this model 4 conclusion the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil is the key to study the mechanism of frost damage in cold regions due to the multiphases in frozen soil which are sensitive to the freezing temperature there are challenges in modelling the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil in this study a new theoretical model of hydraulic conductivity for frozen soil is proposed and then validated by comparing with the existing models and the experimental data in the literature the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 based on the growth mode and shape of ice in soil a new hydraulic conductivity model of frozen soil is developed the new model is derived from the kc equation at positive temperatures which can be considered an extension of the kc equation at negative temperatures 2 the predicted results of the proposed model are consistent with the experimental data which confirms the prediction accuracy of the proposed model compared to the existing models in the literature this model has a simpler form fewer input fitting parameters and a clear physical meaning 3 the parameter analysis of the model shows that the unfrozen water saturation s u and shape coefficient ratio ε are important parameters that affect the hydraulic conductivity unfrozen water saturation s u determines the shape and changing trend of the model and the shape coefficient ratio ε affects the numerical value of the permeability coefficient 4 the unfrozen water content is an input parameter in the proposed model which means that the model does not rely on a particular form of sfcc the proposed model not only can be used to determine the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils but also can be applied to the constitutive model of frozen soil for instance calculating frost heave credit

soil one of the popular forms is the power function campbell 1985 proposed a model to predict the hydraulic conductivity of unfrozen unsaturated soil according to this model tarnawski and wagner 1996 proposed an equation for the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil a1 k θ u θ s 2 b 3 k s where b is an empirical constant dimensionless tarnawski and wagner 1996 noted that constant b is related to the particle size distribution of soil and they defined b as a2 b d g 0 5 0 2 σ g d g exp m c l ln d cl m si ln d si m sa ln d sa σ g exp 1 3 m i ln d i 2 1 3 m i ln d i 2 0 5 where m cl m si and m sa are the clay silt and sand mass fractions respectively and d cl d si and d sa are the particle size limits of clay silt and sand respectively the empirical equation proposed by o neill and miller 1985 is apower function a3 k θ u θ s γ k s where γ is a negotiable constant and γ 9 according to eqs 22 24 the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil can be expressed as a4 k λ w λ i λ p k s λ w ρ ρ s η s η λ i γ ϕ γ s u ϕ 1 ε e 1 s u 2 λ p s u 3 where ρ and ρ s are the density kg m3 of the water of k and k s respectively η and η s are the viscosity pa s of the water of k and k s respectively λ w is the coefficient that considers the effect of the changes in water property at different temperatures λ i is the blocking effect of ice and λ p is the contribution of the unfrozen water content among these parameters λ i is a function of the ratio of unfrozen water content θ u to saturated water content θ s here it can be simplified as a power function λ i s u b 2 s u 2 b therefore eq a4 can be simplified as a5 k λ w s u 2 b 3 k s eq a5 is similar to eq a1 in form which verifies the rationality of the model the b is related to the properties of soils which can be determined by experimental data experimental data suggest that b is 0 0 5 for sand 0 5 3 for silt and a value greater than 3 for clay soil the results of the propose model and simplified model are shown in fig a1 
4848,coupled migration of water and heat is one of the core problems in studying the frost heave and thaw weakening problems in cold regions determination of the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils is the key to understanding this process the hydraulic conductivity of a frozen soil is related to the liquid water flow in pores among soil solid and pore ice which differs from the hydraulic conductivity of an unfrozen soil this study develops a new hydraulic conductivity model for frozen soils based on the kozeny carman equation which is consistent in form with the hydraulic conductivity model of unfrozen soils the proposed model is validated against existing models and measured data in the literature parametric analysis of the model shows that the unfrozen water saturation and shape

heave and thaw weakening damage to high speed railway embankments failure of natural gas and oil pipelines and collapse of soil slopes etc one of the core issues in these problems is the hydro thermal coupling process which is a coupled process of water vapor and heat transfer governed by the temperature and soil water potential gradient sheng et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a 2016b teng et al 2019a hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils is one of the key input parameters in studying the hydro thermal coupled process previous studies have attempted to measure hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils in the laboratory burt and williams 1974 horiguchi and miller 1983 andersland et al 1996 seyfried and murdock 1997 zhang et al 2016a 2016b for example burt and williams 1974 used a lactose solution to measure the hydraulic conductivity of a frozen soil the lactose solution can ensure that the liquid in both sides of the soil sample will not be frozen during the test and it will be blocked by membrane filters to guarantee that only liquid water flows through soil pores horiguchi and miller 1983 measured the unfrozen water content and hydraulic conductivity of a frozen soil by using the dilatometer method and the rigid wall permeameter method zhang et al 2016a zhang et al 2016b determined the hydraulic conductivity of qinghai tibet plateau silty clay under subfreezing temperatures the test results showed that the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil is much lower than that of unfrozen soil which requires a high accuracy instrument to control the temperature of the sample during the flowing process of the fluid considering the long test period the complexity of testing instrument and the difficulty in evaluating the error direct measurement of the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils is not widely applied in the literature from a theoretical viewpoint various mathematical models have been proposed to describe the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil these models can be divided into three categories as shown in table 1 the first category is the empirical formula that relates hydraulic conductivity to the sub freezing temperature for example horiguchi and miller 1983 found a fitting equation for the relation between hydraulic conductivity and temperature based on the experimental results of frozen soil nixon 1991 further proposed a linear relationship for hydraulic conductivity versus temperature in double logarithmic coordinates although these formulas are simple and easy to use hydraulic conductivity does not have any direct physical relation with temperature this kind of formulas is difficult to generalize the second category is the empirical formula that relates hydraulic conductivity to the unfrozen water content spaans and baker 2016 and watanabe and osada 2016 found that frozen soil has a similar hydraulic conductivity to unfrozen soil if their water contents are identical hence the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil can be obtained by discounting the hydraulic conductivity at positive temperatures according to the unfrozen water content watanabe and osada 2016 o neill and miller 1985 watanabe and wake 2008 azmatch et al 2012 mao et al 2007 for example o neill and miller 1985 and watanabe and osada 2016 proposed an empirical equation by inputting the unfrozen water content which was indirectly determined by the swcc soil water characteristic curve it is noted that a large number of theoretical and experimental studies on sfcc are available in the literature thus it is theoretically reasonable and experimentally feasible to develop a hydraulic conductivity model of frozen soil based on sfcc watanabe and wake 2008 and azmatch et al 2012 proposed to use the directly measured unfrozen water content by sfcc this kind of expression can deliberate the contribution of the unfrozen water content to the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil which is physically reasonable but they neglect the effect of pore ice some models used an empirical impedance factor to describe the presence of ice blocks in the existing flow paths jame and norum 1980 however this empirical parameter does not have physical meaning and is not easy to determine black and hardenberg 1991 newman and wilson 1997 more recently some studies derived a model for the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil based on the state and geometry of unfrozen water in frozen soil this model provides a new method to understand this parameter for example lebeau and konrad 2012 stated that unfrozen water could be divided into two components one is dominated by capillary forces and the other is by adsorption forces these authors speculated that the unfrozen water flowed between two infinite horizontal parallel plates ice and particle the thickness of the water film can be used to calculate the frozen soil hydraulic conductivity which is determined by the disjoining pressure watanabe and flury 2008 and tang et al 2019 supposed that ice was formed in the centre of the capillary which provided a circular pipe for liquid water chen et al 2019 developed a fractal capillary bundle model for the hydraulic conductivity of saturated frozen soil these expressions have a physical meaning that is derived from the presence of unfrozen water in soil pores however the expressions involve many undefinable parameters some of which are difficult to directly obtain which greatly limits their application therefore a method to better express the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil in a simple form with clear physical meaning remains an open question the objectives of this study are to investigate the phase state of water and growing process of ice in soils and to develop a new model for the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil the new model derives from the kozeny carman equation and extends to the sub freezing condition which can be determined as a function of the unfrozen water content the new model will be compared with various existing models and the measured data to evaluate its applicability 2 material and methods 2 1 basic assumptions it has been found that the existence of unfrozen water can be traced to slight modifications in the equilibrium phase behaviour that are induced by characteristics of the soil and its interactions with liquid water and solid ice rempel 2012 unlike the phase change in an open system the freezing thawing temperature of pore ice generally varies with the change in pore radius according to the gibbs thomson equation mitchell et al 2008 anderson et al 2009 teng et al 2019b when the temperature reaches a critical value it corresponds to the maximum radius of liquid water i e the pore water will not freeze under this maximum pore radius additionally the pore radius indicates a minimum radius of pore ice in the soil in other words in the freezing process once the temperature drops to t all soil pores larger than pore radius r will be frozen by ice and the relationship between t and r becomes 1 δ t t m t t m f γ sl cos θ r ρ s δ h f according to eq 1 the maximum radius of liquid water in frozen soil at a specific temperature is 2 r f γ sl cos θ t m ρ s δ h f t m t where t m is the bulk melting point of the solid k γ sl is the solid liquid interface free energy j m2 r is the pore radius m ρ s is the density of the solid phase kg m3 δh f is the latent heat enthalpy of fusion j kg f is the shape factor of the interface dimensionless and θ is the contact angle between the solid phase and the pore wall dimensionless there is a surface melted layer of a single crystal of ice at a plane solid interface which is called the pre melted film wilen and dash 1995 when the saturated sample is freezing between the surface of the ice particle and soil particle there is a thin water film rempel 2010 watanabe and flury 2008 lebeau and konrad 2012 this part of water is unfrozen because the dynamic equilibrium between water and ice is always maintained the disjoining pressure is the force per unit area with which ice and particle surfaces push against each other across the intervening pre melted film although a number of different surface forces are known to contribute to the disjoining pressure lebeau and konrad 2012 defined it as follows 3 π δ π e δ π m δ where π is the disjoining pressure δ is the thickness of the water film πe is the ionic electrostatic component of disjoining pressure and πm is the molecular component of disjoining pressure taking into account all the above mentioned existence of unfrozen water the following assumptions are made fig 1 1 the soil is assumed to be saturated i e the air phase in the void is neglected 2 both soil particle and pore ice are considered ideal spheres and the growth of ice is uniform the pre melted film is marked both around ice particles and soil particles 3 the effect of pore ice on the liquid water flow is assumed to be identical to that of the soil particle and only the viscous force is considered between pore ice and unfrozen liquid water 2 2 model derivation for the soil at a positive temperature there are many different models to compute the hydraulic conductivity among which the kozeny carman equation kc equation may be the most popular model the kc equation was first proposed by kozeny 1927 and further developed by carman 1937 as follows 4 k c s 1 γ 2 ρ s 2 s s 2 e 3 1 e where c s is a dimensionless shape constant γ is the tortuosity dimensionless e is the porosity ratio dimensionless and s s is the specific surface area of soil m2 kg the kc equation has been validated for coarse grained soils based on experimental results e g sands taylor 1948 lambe and whitman 1969 ren and santamarina 2018 teng et al 2020 the relationship of relevant parameters is shown in fig 2 according to the hagen poiseuille equation the intrinsic permeability k of soils can be expressed as 5 k c s ϕ r h 2 γ 2 where ϕ is the porosity dimensionless and r h is the hydraulic radius m on a section r h is defined as the ratio of the cross section area that is available for flow to the wetted perimeter as follows 6 r h a f p wp where a f is the cross section available for flow m2 i e the cross section of the water in saturated soil and p wp is the wetted perimeter m the a f and p wp on the sections of irregular shape capillary are not constant thus hydraulic radius r h should be expressed as mean hydraulic radius r h as shown in eq 7 7 r h a f p wp a f l t p wp l t 0 l t a f l d l 0 l t p wp l d l v f a sf where l t is the true length of flow channels in the soil m v f is the volume of flow channels m3 and a sf is the total surface area of flow channels m2 it is noted that the form of r h is the ratio of the volume of flow channels v f to total surface area of flow channels a sf carman 1937 ren et al 2016 in saturated soil v f and a sf can be considered void volume v v m3 and soil particle surface area a sp m2 respectively therefore in the kc equation the hydraulic radius can be further simplified as 8 r h v f a sf v v a sp e v s a sp e v s m s a sp m s e ρ s s s substituting eq 8 into eq 5 leads to the result of eq 4 because eq 4 is derived from eq 5 both of them have the same assumptions and limitations the flow is laminar and the rheological constitutive equation must conform to newton s law of viscosity i e the shear stress is proportional to the shear strain rate as for macropore channels seepage may become turbulent under high hydraulic gradient but the velocity of fluid in frozen soils is very low which means that the flow is laminar in general in clay soil the interaction between water and particle surface may make the rheological equation not conform to newton s law of viscosity due to the assumption that electrochemical reaction is neglected between solid particles and permeant eq 4 cannot be applied to clay soil carrier 2003 ren et al 2016 when the temperature of soils drops to sub zero temperature the pore ice is formed in soils according to assumption 2 the mean hydraulic radius in eq 8 should be modified as 9 r h v f a sf v v v i a sp a si where v i is the volume of ice m3 and a si is the total surface area of ice particles m2 here the unfrozen water saturation s u is defined as the ratio of the unfrozen water content θ u to the saturated water content θ s the unfrozen water saturation can be used to determine the value of v v v i 10 v v v i θ u θ s v f s u e v s the total surface area of soil particles a sp m2 in a soil sample can be expressed by a cumulative function as follows 11 a sp j r s min r s m ax n s j 4 π r s j 2 where n s j is the total number of particles with a soil specific radius in a soil sample r s j is the particle radius of soil m similarly the total surface area of ice particles a si in a soil sample can be expressed as 12 a si j r i min r i m ax n i j 4 π r i j 2 in eq 12 n i j is the total number of ice particles with a specific radius in a soil sample r i j is the particle radius of ice because soil and ice particles are spheres and their size and cross section can vary it is not easy to determine their surface area directly it is noticed that the surface area of a sphere 4πr 2 the radius of the sphere is r is equal to the lateral area of a circumscribed cylinder 4πr 2 the height of the cylinder is 2r the bottom radius of the cylinder is r therefore both soil and ice particles can be assumed as cylinders to compute ratio of their surface areas in order to find the relationship between a si and a sp they are divided by the volume of soil sample as shown in eqs 13 and 14 respectively 13 a sp v j r s min r s m ax n s j 4 π r s j 2 al 4 j r s min r s max n s j l π r s j 2 a 14 a si v j r i min r i m ax n i j 4 π r i j 2 al 4 j r i min r i max n i j l π r i j 2 a where a is the cross sectional area of soil sample m2 l is the height or length of soil sample m in eqs 13 and 14 n s j l and n i j l means the average number of soil and ice particles with a specific radius on the cross sectional area of soil sample respectively 1 m the cumulative function in eq 13 can be converted to the following form 15 j r s min r s max n s j l π r s j 2 a a s a 1 ϕ where a s is the cross sectional area of soil m2 which is the total area of the yellow part in fig 3 a the ratio of a s and a is equal to 1 ϕ in the same way the cumulative function in eq 14 can be converted to the following form 16 j r i min r i max n i j l π r i j 2 a a i a a f a a i a f ϕ 1 s u the result of the cumulative function j r i min r i max n i j l π r i j is the cross sectional area of ice a i which is the total area as the white part in fig 3 a the a f a v is total area as the light and dark blue part in fig 3 a and the ratio of a i and a f is 1 s u combining eqs 13 16 the relationship between a si and a sp can be obtained as follows 17 a si a sp j r i min r i max n i j 4 π r i j 2 a l j r s min r s max n s j 4 π r s j 2 a l 4 4 j r i min r i max n i j l π r i j 2 a j r s min r s max n s j l π r s j 2 a 4 4 ϕ 1 s u 1 ϕ 4 4 e 1 s u as mentioned above the surface area of a sphere is equal to the lateral area of a circumscribed cylinder the ratio of surface areas of two cylinders is equal to the ratio of surface areas of two spheres in the assumption both soil particles and pore ice particles are considered as ideal spheres however as shown in the fig 3 b the shapes of ice and soil particles are irregular and different in fact there are different formulas to calculate the surface areas of solids surface area of a sphere is 4π r 2 with a radius of r surface area of a cube is 6 a 2 with a side length of the cube a it is noted that the formula to calculate the surface area of a solid consists of two parts the coefficient of the surface area and the square of its characteristic length the shape factor ratio ε is used to correct the difference in shape between ice and soil particles and eq 17 can be modified as 18 a si a sp 4 4 e 1 s u ε e 1 s u combining eqs 9 18 we modify r h at sub zero temperatures as 19 r h v f v i v s a sf a si v s s u e ρ s s s 1 ε e 1 s u there is a tortuosity parameter γ in kc equation and it is note that the tortuosity is a function related to porosity ϕ in the literature koponen et al 1997 ghanbarian et al 2013 srisutthiyakorn and mavko 2017 zhang et al 2020 therefore tortuosity γ can be marked as γ ϕ to show the relationship between tortuosity and porosity when ice grows in soils the soil pores are gradually filled by ice and the tortuosity changes as well thus the tortuosity should be revised accordingly γ ϕ should be modified as γ s u ϕ in this study the expression proposed by yu and li 2004 is used to determine γ as follows 20 γ ϕ 1 2 1 1 2 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 1 1 ϕ 1 2 1 4 1 1 ϕ and eq 20 should be modified to calculate the tortuosity of frozen soil 21 γ s u ϕ 1 2 1 1 2 1 s u ϕ 1 s u ϕ 1 1 s u ϕ 1 2 1 4 1 1 s u ϕ by combining the eqs 5 19 and 21 the inherent permeability of frozen soil under negative temperatures k i can be expressed as 22 k i c s s u 3 γ 2 s u ϕ 1 ε e 1 s u 2 e 3 ρ s 2 s s 2 1 e comparing to the kc equation at positive temperatures it can be obtained that 23a k i λ k 23b λ γ 2 ϕ s u 3 γ 2 s u ϕ 1 ε e 1 s u 2 as shown in eq 23a the expression of the inherent permeability under negative temperatures is continuous with the kc equation under positive temperatures which can be considered a generalization of the kc equation at the same time parameters s u e and ϕ in the expression can be experimentally measured and γ can be calculated by eq 21 while parameters c s and εhave clear physical meaning and are easy to determine the expression of the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil can be derived from the intrinsic permeability as follows 24 k ρ g η c s s u 3 γ 2 s u e 1 e 1 ε e 1 s u 2 e 3 ρ s 2 s s 2 1 e where ρ and η are the density kg m3 and dynamic viscosity pa s of water respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 validation of the proposed model in the literature there are limited measured data for the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil lebeau and konrad 2012 proposed a model to predict the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil and evaluated the model based on the experimental results from horiguchi and miller 1983 the soil properties in their study are shown in table 2 the experimental parameters obtained from the experiments of horiguchi and miller 1983 are adopted in this study to validate the proposed model assigning the parameter in eq 19 by the values in table 2 the hydraulic conductivity of each soil at freezing condition can be determined the dynamic viscosity of the liquid film can be estimated by a polynomial function of absolute temperature churaev et al 1993 25 η η w 0 0 00616 t t 0 0 00212 t t 0 2 where iw 0 0 00175 pa s is the dynamic viscosity of the bulk water at reference absolute temperature t 0 273 15 k the density of the water is herein approximated with the sixth order polynomial function for supercooled water hare and sorensen 1987 as follows 26 ρ 0 99986 6 690 10 5 t t 0 8 486 10 6 t t 0 2 1 518 10 7 t t 0 3 6 9484 10 9 t t 0 4 3 6449 10 10 t t 0 5 7 497 10 12 t t 0 6 to evaluate the performance of the proposed model the prediction results of this model are compared to both experimental data from horiguchi and miller 1983 and other models proposed in the literature to determine the unfrozen water content the expression of the soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc proposed by lebeau and konrad 2012 is adopted in this study as follows 27 θ w θ w c 1 θ w c θ s θ w a θ w c θ s h m h m a θ s 1 2 e r f c ln χ ν w ν i l w o g l n t t 0 h m median 2 σ h m h m a θ w a θ w 0 1 ln ν w ν i l w o g l n t t 0 ln h m dry where θ w is the volumetric water content dimensionless θ s is the volumetric moisture content at saturation dimensionless θ w c and θ w a are the volumetric moisture contents contributed by the capillary force and adsorption force respectively dimensionless θ w 0 is the volumetric water content due to adsorption at the matrix head of 1 m dimensionless ν w and ν i are the specific volumes of water and ice respectively m3 kg l w o is the specific latent heat of fusion of water at 273 15 k χ is the constant of proportionality dimensionless and is 2 2 and h m dry is the matric head at oven dryness 105 m other parameters are shown in table 1 the values of the fitting parameters are shown in fig 4 the variations of other parameters in the model density and dynamic viscosity of water tortuosity with decreasing temperature are shown in fig 5 the relative hydraulic conductivity is uniformly used for normalization and the relative hydraulic conductivity k r is defined as 28 k r k k s where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m s fig 6 shows that the computed result by the proposed model is consistent with the experimental data where the starting point of the temperature is the freezing point of water 273 15 k the value of ε is obtained by using least squares estimation to fit the experimental data in the result of calgary silt in fig 6 c the model proposed by lebeau and konrad 2012 cannot predict the hydraulic conductivity according to the soil properties and sfcc which is considered to be caused by experimental errors to make a prediction s s in the model of lebeau and konrad 2012 is changed from 1 89 107 m2 m3 to 1 40 107 m2 m3 the green short dash line is the result before the correction and the green dash line is the result after the correction according to the original experimental data the proposed model can predict the hydraulic conductivity under negative temperatures as shown in fig 6 c the proposed model combines the advantages of the second and third categories of frozen soil hydraulic conductivity in the proposed model the unfrozen water content is an independent variable which clearly clarifies the relationship between unfrozen water content and hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil since the model is derived based on the state and geometry of unfrozen water in frozen soil each parameter in the proposed model has a physical meaning in addition the proposed model only requires one fitting parameter which can well predict the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil 3 2 parametric analysis the input parameters of the proposed model are related to soil water and ice among them the unfrozen water saturation s u and shape factor ratio ε greatly affect the prediction of the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil the unfrozen water saturation s u determines the shape and changing trend of the model which can reflect the unfrozen water content in soils and dominate the amount of flowable water in soils as shown in fig 7 the shape and changing tendency of the predicted hydraulic conductivity at negative temperatures are consistent with the corresponding sfcc therefore the sfcc is an important parameter in this model to predict the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils particularly when using the proposed model it can be calculated without relying on a specific sfcc curve expression in the model of lebeau and konrad 2012 the relevant physical parameters must be determined by fitting measured data of sfcc then the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil can be predicted according to these input physical parameters however in the proposed model the unfrozen water content is considered an independent variable thus it does not rely on a specific sfcc expression to make a verification the sfcc model proposed by liu and yu 2013 is used 29 s u 1 1 a ln t 0 t n m where a n and m are fitting parameters and t 0 is the freezing point of water 273 15 k by applying eq 29 to best fit the experimental data of the manchester silt fraction the value of a n and m can be determined as 10162 3 2 and 0 35 respectively the sfcc predicted by the two models and the corresponding predicted hydraulic conductivities are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 if an sfcc model can well match the experimental data the corresponding hydraulic conductivity can be accurately predicted by this sfcc model this conclusion verifies that the proposed model does not rely on a specific sfcc model and that unfrozen water content s u is only an independent variable in the proposed model the shape factor ratio ε does not affect the shape of the model but it directly affects the hydraulic conductivity as shown in fig 9 with the same change in temperatures the predicted hydraulic conductivity gradually decreases with increasing ε shape factor ratio ε is a parameter related to the soil properties which reflects the difference in shape of ice and soil particles if the shape of soil particles tends to that of ice particles the shape factor ratio ε is close to 1 a greater difference in shape between soil particles and ice particles leads to a greater shape coefficient ratio ε since the difference between different surface area coefficients is generally no more than 1 order in magnitude the shape factor ratio ε is recommended to change in the range of 0 02 50 3 3 applicable conditions of the proposed model the above analysis shows that the results of the proposed model are consistent with the experimental data for silt all unfrozen water is assumed to be flowable in soils in fact not all of the unfrozen water in soils can participate in flowing which results in a certain deviation in the fitting effect of this model as shown in fig 10 the two lines are the predicted result for illite clay with different values of ε the case of ε being equal to 95 98 results in a better fitting to the experimental result in this case ε is much greater than its recommended range 0 02 50 the reason may be that the kc equation is not suitable for predicting the hydraulic conductivity of clay due to a large amount of water adsorbed on the surface of soil particles in clay which should be considered a part of soil particles ren et al 2016 therefore there is a certain error when using the proposed model to predict the hydraulic conductivity of clay at negative temperatures and it is necessary to consider the effect of immobile water to further improve this model 4 conclusion the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil is the key to study the mechanism of frost damage in cold regions due to the multiphases in frozen soil which are sensitive to the freezing temperature there are challenges in modelling the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil in this study a new theoretical model of hydraulic conductivity for frozen soil is proposed and then validated by comparing with the existing models and the experimental data in the literature the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 based on the growth mode and shape of ice in soil a new hydraulic conductivity model of frozen soil is developed the new model is derived from the kc equation at positive temperatures which can be considered an extension of the kc equation at negative temperatures 2 the predicted results of the proposed model are consistent with the experimental data which confirms the prediction accuracy of the proposed model compared to the existing models in the literature this model has a simpler form fewer input fitting parameters and a clear physical meaning 3 the parameter analysis of the model shows that the unfrozen water saturation s u and shape coefficient ratio ε are important parameters that affect the hydraulic conductivity unfrozen water saturation s u determines the shape and changing trend of the model and the shape coefficient ratio ε affects the numerical value of the permeability coefficient 4 the unfrozen water content is an input parameter in the proposed model which means that the model does not rely on a particular form of sfcc the proposed model not only can be used to determine the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils but also can be applied to the constitutive model of frozen soil for instance calculating frost heave credit

soil one of the popular forms is the power function campbell 1985 proposed a model to predict the hydraulic conductivity of unfrozen unsaturated soil according to this model tarnawski and wagner 1996 proposed an equation for the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil a1 k θ u θ s 2 b 3 k s where b is an empirical constant dimensionless tarnawski and wagner 1996 noted that constant b is related to the particle size distribution of soil and they defined b as a2 b d g 0 5 0 2 σ g d g exp m c l ln d cl m si ln d si m sa ln d sa σ g exp 1 3 m i ln d i 2 1 3 m i ln d i 2 0 5 where m cl m si and m sa are the clay silt and sand mass fractions respectively and d cl d si and d sa are the particle size limits of clay silt and sand respectively the empirical equation proposed by o neill and miller 1985 is apower function a3 k θ u θ s γ k s where γ is a negotiable constant and γ 9 according to eqs 22 24 the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil can be expressed as a4 k λ w λ i λ p k s λ w ρ ρ s η s η λ i γ ϕ γ s u ϕ 1 ε e 1 s u 2 λ p s u 3 where ρ and ρ s are the density kg m3 of the water of k and k s respectively η and η s are the viscosity pa s of the water of k and k s respectively λ w is the coefficient that considers the effect of the changes in water property at different temperatures λ i is the blocking effect of ice and λ p is the contribution of the unfrozen water content among these parameters λ i is a function of the ratio of unfrozen water content θ u to saturated water content θ s here it can be simplified as a power function λ i s u b 2 s u 2 b therefore eq a4 can be simplified as a5 k λ w s u 2 b 3 k s eq a5 is similar to eq a1 in form which verifies the rationality of the model the b is related to the properties of soils which can be determined by experimental data experimental data suggest that b is 0 0 5 for sand 0 5 3 for silt and a value greater than 3 for clay soil the results of the propose model and simplified model are shown in fig a1 
4849,real time correction is the key to reducing hydrological forecasting errors methods of real time correction can be classified into terminal error correction tec and process error correction pec methods a state of the art pec method is the dynamic system response curve dsrc method which has been developed to improve flood forecasting but its underlying assumption of error source limits the correction accuracy this study developed a multi source error dsrc method mse dsrc to partition the total error of forecast discharge into input caused error and model caused error based on the known quantitative relationship between rain gauge density and error division ratio two different sources of error are corrected simultaneously a synthetic case study was done to evaluate the ability of the mse dsrc method to correct the variables and parameters of the hydrological model xaj model the mse dsrc method was found to overcome the limitations of the traditional dsrc method and have a high accuracy indexed with the nash sutcliffe ns efficiency increasing above 0 9 then real case studies in three basins of the huaihe river china demonstrated that the mse dsrc method achieved higher accuracy and stability than did the traditional dsrc method and can be easily applied in practice with the average improvement of ns above 50 overall the error division of the mse dsrc method opens the possibility for multi variable updating and multi source error correction which may further improve the accuracy of flood forecasting keywords flood forecasting real time correction system response operational hydrology input caused error model caused error 1 introduction flood forecasting is an important non structural measure for flood warning flood risk analysis water resources management public safety and evacuation measures and reservoir operation chen et al 2016 natural complexities human disturbances e g dam construction and its operation urbanization and deforestation and uncertainty of flood hazard cause inevitable errors in flood forecasting these errors result from less than accurate estimates of input variables and initial state variables bárdossy and das 2008 kavetski et al 2006 as well as from the inadequacy of model structure and model parameters butts et al 2004 jiang et al 2019 these errors lead to the bias between predicted and measured flood magnitudes which reduces the accuracy of flood forecasting a widely used method to correct the error is real time error updating real time correction zhang et al 2018 error updating is the last step in real time flood forecasting and is a critical step to correct errors and improve the accuracy of flood forecasting a variety of flood forecasting systems with forecast updating are available with the goal of improving the fit between forecasted and observed values emerton et al 2016 the global and or national flood forecasting platforms which employ methods for real time error correction such as the delft flood early warning system fews forecast production system abrahart and see 2000 have been developed with the result that forecast updating and error correction have become major components of flood forecasting platforms the role of real time correction in operational hydrological platforms cannot be overemphasized kauffeldt et al 2016 based on different error updating approaches real time correction methods can be grouped into two categories terminal error correction tec and process error correction pec methods tec methods are indifferent to the process error affected by intermediate factors and directly correct the terminal error and are relatively simple to update flood forecasting errors commonly used tec methods are the auto regressive ar model hasebe et al 1989 shamseldin and o connor 2001 the recursive least squares rls algorithm zhao et al 2008 liu et al 2016 and the quantile regression qr technique dogulu et al 2015 wani et al 2017 these methods evaluate the autocorrelation between terminal errors to correct them and directly update river flow discharge the real time correction pec methods reduce the terminal error by reducing the error of each link of forecasting these methods focus on the errors in the processes of hydrological forecasting e g rainfall runoff and confluence or the state variables of the forecasting model examples of such methods are the standard kalman filter kf method and its extension methods kalman 1960 weerts and el serafy 2006 which estimate flood events and correct process errors with a filtering algorithm however these two methods tec and pec methods suffer from weak physical foundation less prediction period and unsatisfactory correction effect the dynamic system response curve dsrc method bao et al 2014 which is a pec method is based on physical mechanisms is model free and does not increase the number of model parameters its theoretical basis is the differential of the system response function of the process variables and state variables such as areal mean rainfall runoff free water storage and soil moisture si et al 2015 sun et al 2018a the performance of dsrc does not deteriorate as the forecasting period i e lead time increases there have been studies on the improved dsrc method for its ill posed property of model structure si et al 2019 and its ability of multi variable estimation sun et al 2018b it has been shown that the rainfall correction of the dsrc method is superior to the streamflow correction of the ar method for both runoff depth and flood peak discharge however the dsrc method treats the discharge error as being primarily due to one or part of variables such as rainfall assuming that rainfall errors tend to be dominant in practice this presumption is untenable the model and runoff errors may also influence the calculated discharge ignoring the sources of error may lead to unreliable forecasts this study proposes and tests a new method mse dsrc to correct multi source errors in flood forecasts in contrast with the traditional dsrc methods the mse dsrc method can simultaneously correct all the errors the overall objective of this study is therefore to investigate multi variable updating and multi source error correction to improve the accuracy of flood forecasting specifically the objectives are to i quantify input caused error and model caused error and establish a relationship between rain gauge density and error division ratio ii update areal mean rainfall and model parameters via response system in order to improve process estimates and discharge forecasts generated by the xaj xinanjiang model and iii test in synthetic and real cases to show the general applicability and capability of the proposed method 2 methodology 2 1 overview of dsrc method the dsrc method is based on the system response theory and error feedback correction with the aid of system response theory the nonlinear relationship between model variables and model outputs is established this relationship is called the response system then the error feedback correction is achieved by solving the system response function using the least squares ls technique si et al 2015 2 1 1 single variable dsrc method and multi variable dsrc method consider a hydrological or flood forecasting system as indicated in fig 1 a the general mathematical formula for a hydrological model used for flood forecasting can be given as 1 q f x θ where f represents the rainfall runoff model function q represents the time ordered vector of output variables e g vector of discharge q q 1 q 2 q n t at time 1 2 n x represents the corresponding vector of input variables state variables and intermediate variables e g vector of areal mean rainfall p p 1 p 2 p m t vector of runoff r r 1 r 2 r m t vector of free water storage s s 1 s 2 s m t and vector of soil moisture w w 1 w 2 w m t and θ represents the vector of model parameters θ θ 1 θ 2 θ k t if the model is considered to have almost no error model parameters θ will not be updated and will remain the same the discharge q can only be corrected by updating variables x thus equation 1 can be simplified as 2 q f x for the single variable dsrc method equation 2 can be expanded using taylor series using the first order partial derivatives into a nonlinear form as equation 3 3 q n q n q n x 1 q n x m x x where q n is the observed discharge at time n q n is the calculated discharge obtained by the hydrologic model x x 1 x 2 x m t x x 1 x 2 x m t x m is the actual input variable state variable or the intermediate variable at time m x m is the approximate variable at time m and q n x m is the partial derivative of the output discharge at time n with respect to the variable at time m with n m equation 3 can also be described in matrix notation with time as the following system response function 4 q x q x h x x x 5 h x q 1 x 1 q 1 x m q n x 1 q n x m where q x q 1 q 2 q n t q x q 1 q 2 q n t h x is the system response matrix using the least square ls technique golub et al 1999 the variable can be estimated as 6 x h x t h x 1 h x t q x q x x for example if the update variable of rainfall in the dsrc method is the areal mean rainfall p a similar equation can be obtained by substituting p into equation 6 7 p h p t h p 1 h p t q p q p p for the multi variable dsrc method equation 3 is rewritten as the following system response function 8 q n q n q n x 1 n q n x l n x 1 n x 1 n x l n x l n where q n and q n are the observed and calculated discharge at time n subscripts 1 2 l are used to distinguish different input state and intermediate variables at the same time n thus x l n and x l n are the actual and approximate l th variable at time n the q n x l n is the partial derivative of the output at time n with respect to the nth variable at the same time 2 1 2 limitation of dsrc method obviously the traditional dsrc methods can not only correct the single variable response system but also the multi variable response system in which the variables x vary from runoff r to areal mean rainfall p specifics of the derivation proof and applications of the traditional dsrc method and its improved versions can be found in si et al 2019 sun et al 2018b results of performance metrics e g nash sutcliffe show that the dsrc methods perform better than black box methods e g ar while the dsrc method may be a simple and convenient method there are some basic assumptions that set the foundation for the framework of the method one of the assumptions of dsrc methods is that forecasts are simply determined by input variables x it is because the system response function of dsrc is more convenient for feedback correction of single source error so these dsrc methods treat the discharge error as being primarily due to input variables assuming that x caused error tend to be dominant apparently this assumption falls short of equation 1 in which output q depends on both input variables x and model parameters θ this assumption of dsrc methods is incorrect because x is not the only source of total error and this assumption becomes a limitation a response system only between x and q leads to the attribution of the total error to x optimization of θ also plays a crucial role in improving the hydrological model performance it is thus necessary to ensure the accuracy of all input variables state variables intermediate variables and model parameters in flood forecasting therefore the mse dsrc method was developed to update multi sources errors simultaneously the innovation of the mse dsrc method lies in the partition of total error and targeted correction for different source errors 2 2 multi source error dsrc method based on an established quantitative relationship the mse dsrc method partitions the terminal error total discharge error of hydrological model output e g forecasted discharge value into two parts one part is caused by the error in model inputs and the other part is caused by the error in model parameters the total discharge error is divided into x caused discharge error and θ caused discharge error referring to the system response theory the response of the system of discharge error to both the input error and parameter error is established in which the total error of discharge is corrected by incorporating these multi source errors therefore the mse dsrc method realizes the multi variable updating and the multi source error correction by correcting both x caused error and θ caused error simultaneously the steps of the mse dsrc method are presented below 1 establish a flood forecasting system function of model inputs parameters and outputs as shown in equation 9 which is the same as equation 1 9 q f x θ 2 the mse dsrc method considers both model inputs x x 1 x 2 x l t and model parameters θ θ 1 θ 2 θ k t as updatable variables then equation 9 can be expressed based on the binary taylor series expansion as equation 10 10 q n q n q x n q n q θ n q n q 1 n x 1 n q 1 n x l n x 1 n x 1 n x l n x l n q 2 n θ 1 n q 2 n θ k n θ 1 n θ 1 n θ k n θ k n where q n and q n are the observed and calculated discharge at time n q n q n is the total error q x n q n is the partial error caused by the uncertainty in model inputs x l n x l n q θ n q n is the partial error caused by the inaccuracy of the model parameters θ k n θ k n 3 since only the areal mean rainfall i e l 1 and x x 1 t p t p is selected as the delegate variable to be updated the single variable dsrc method is used to update the areal mean rainfall series p p 1 p 2 p m t at time 1 2 m the multi variable dsrc method is used to update the model parameter series θ θ 1 θ 2 θ k t e g all the 16 xaj model parameters k 16 note that all parameters of a hydrological model can be corrected but not every parameter needs to be updated then equation 10 can be converted to equation 11 11 q n q n q p n q n q θ n q n q n p 1 q n p m p p q n θ 1 n q n θ k n θ 1 n θ 1 n θ k n θ k n where q n q n is the total error q p n q n is the rainfall caused error and q θ n q n is the model caused error 4 use e t for q n q n e p for q p n q n and e m for q θ n q n to simplify equation 11 to equation 12 12 e t e p e m where the total error et is the sum of absolute deviations of calculated discharges and observed discharges fig 2 shows the deviation of the calculated discharge and the observed discharge at time n 5 for a study basin where rain gauges are abundant we can obtain different areal mean rainfall amounts according to the density of rain gauges in the basin different areal mean rainfalls correspond to different rainfall caused and model caused errors therefore a quantitative relationship between rainfall caused error e p model caused error e m and rain gauge density ρ can be established from the data of flood events available in the study basin step 1 according to the rainfall data from the j rain gauges and the discharge data from the outlet in the study basin an optimal group of model parameters θ can be determined since j is large enough the group of model parameters θ can best reflect the watershed runoff yield and concentration as the rain gauge density ρ j j f where f is the basin area is high the rainfall caused error in the basin can be ignored i e e p ρ j 0 here the total error is the model caused error i e e m ρ j e t ρ j this model caused error reflects the inherent error of the study basin and does not change with rain gauge density step 2 based on the principle of sampling stations in hydrology i 1 2 j rain gauges are randomly sampled from j rain gauges every gauge has the same probability of being chosen the number of different rain gauges i represents different rain gauge densities ρ i i f for each different ρ i the total error e t ρ i is calculated according to the rainfall data of i sampling rain gauges and the optimal model parameter θ since the optimal group of model parameters θ is always adopted for different cases of ρ i the model caused errors e m ρ i are considered to be identical i e e m ρ 1 e m ρ i e m ρ j then the corresponding rainfall caused error e p ρ i can be calculated as e p ρ i e t ρ i e m ρ i e t ρ i e m ρ j e t ρ i e t ρ j step 3 according to the quantitative relationship between ρ i and e t ρ i e p ρ i and e m ρ i the quantitative relationship between ρ i and the rainfall caused error ratio η p ρ i e p ρ i e t ρ i 1 η m ρ i 0 η p ρ i 1 and the model caused error ratio η m ρ i e m ρ i e t ρ i 1 η p ρ i 0 η m ρ i 1 is established as table 1 this established relationship can be fitted into a relation curve by the least square method 6 the known quantitative relationship can be applied to the adjacent or similar basins with lower density rain gauges to realize the total error division for the application basin with the rain gauge density ρ the total error e t ρ is divided into rainfall caused error e p ρ and model caused error e m ρ with the corresponding error ratios η p ρ and η m ρ 13 e p ρ η p ρ e t ρ 14 e m ρ η m ρ e t ρ 5 based on the system response theory the rainfall caused error e p ρ and model caused error e m ρ of the application basin are feedback corrected step 1 the areal mean rainfall correction value δ p ρ and model parameter correction value δ θ ρ are obtained as follows 15 δ p ρ a t a 1 a t q p ρ θ q p c ρ θ a t a 1 a t e p ρ 16 δ θ ρ b t b 1 b t q p θ ρ q p θ c ρ b t b 1 b t e m ρ where a is the system response matrix of the error in areal mean rainfall p c ρ is the areal mean rainfall before updating b is the system response matrix of the error in model parameters and θ c ρ are model parameters before updating step 2 results of equation 15 and equation 16 are substituted into equation 6 to obtain the updated areal mean rainfall p c ρ and updated model parameters θ c ρ 17 p c ρ p c ρ δ p ρ 18 θ c ρ θ c ρ δ θ ρ step 3 p c ρ and θ c ρ are fed into the forecasting model as input to obtain the corrected

the xaj model for the synthetic case we tested the performance of the mse dsrc method because we cannot get access to the true inputs and outputs in a real case for real cases we applied the mse dsrc method to three real basins where the proposed method was compared with the traditional dsrc method four metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the traditional dsrc method and the mse dsrc method 3 1 hydrological model and evaluation metrics the xaj model is a conceptual hydrological model developed by zhao 1992 and is one of the most widely used hydrologic models in humid and semi humid regions of china including the huaihe river basin the model is simple model parameters are easily calibrated and the discharge concentration is easily linearized therefore the xaj model was chosen as the flood forecasting system in this study fig 1b shows a generalized system diagram of the flood forecasting model and a simple input output structure of the xaj model details on the physical meaning range of values of each parameter and parameter sensitivity analysis are available in si et al 2015 zhao 1992 peak discharge peak lag time runoff depth and nash sutcliffe coefficient are the four key indices for a flood event which are used extensively bao et al 2014 si et al 2015 in general for flash floods e g a flood event in small or medium basin the peak discharge and time to peak are the most critical indices for long duration floods e g a flood event controlled by a reservoir the flood volume or runoff depth is the most essential index if we consider the whole flood process the nash sutcliffe coefficient is also an important index for the flood event thus for a comprehensive study the following metrics were selected for evaluating the performance of the mse dsrc method 1 relative error of peak discharge 20 δ q m q m obs q m c q m obs 100 2 absolute error of peak lag time 21 δ t t q m obs t q m c 3 relative error of runoff depth 22 δ r r obs r c r obs 100 4 nash sutcliffe coefficient 23 n s 1 t 1 n q obs t q c t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 5 improvement of the nash sutcliffe coefficient 24 ins 1 n i 1 n n s after i n s before i 1 n s before i 100 where q m obs and q m c are the observed discharge and computed peak discharge t q m obs and t q m c are the peak lag times of observed and computed discharges r obs and r c are the runoff depths of observed and computed flood event q obs is the observed discharge and n s before i and n s after i are the n s before and after error correction for flood event i the ins reflects the degree if improvement of n s after correction compared with its maximum value 1 before correction the larger the ins the higher the degree of improvement and the more significant the correction effect 3 2 synthetic case in the synthetic case we used the data of a real flood event flood no 20 170 709 with 59 rain gauges from the beimiaoji bmj basin fig 4b ensuring that the simulated flood event was consistent with an actual flood event the areal mean rainfall series p true and evaporation series e m true were equal to the input of flood no 20170709 the true model parameters θ true and initial conditions w true were the same as those fitted optimally under p true e m true and the bmj basin conditions true observed outputs q true were obtained by a free run of the xaj model using the predefined ptrue e m true θ true and w true fig 3 shows the flowchart of mse dsrc method first a quantitative relationship between ρ i and the error division ratio was established we carried out 59 forecasts for different densities of rain gauges ρ i i from 1 to 59 for each forecast each rain gauge density 1 000 000 random samples were taken from the rain gauges to calculate the average rainfall the corresponding parameters of the forecasting model were limited to the range of 2 of θ true after each forecast we subtracted q true from the output of forecasting to obtain the total error for the correction model we constructed 10 cases with the number of rain gauges of 2 4 6 8 10 15 20 30 40 and 55 in order to confirm the effectiveness and feasibility of the mse dsrc method 10 cases with different rain gauge densities were constructed both low and high densities were contained in the synthetic cases ensuring that the cases were representative for each case such as the 2 rain gauge case 2 rain gauges were randomly selected from 59 rain gauges for observation finally the observed areal mean rainfall and model parameters were corrected using the mse dsrc method based on the established quantitative relationship 3 3 real cases we applied the mse dsrc method to bmj huangchuan hc and huangnizhuang hnz basins of the huaihe river the locations and station distributions of the three basins are shown in fig 4 while their hydrometeorological characteristics and available data are listed in table 2 the huaihe river valley is located in china s transition terrain of northern climate and southern climate the three selected adjacent basins are hilly mountainous watersheds with a range of gauge density hilly mountainous watersheds conformed to the application requirements of xaj model a range of gauge density conformed to the application requirements of the mse dsrc method the bmj basin was selected as the experimental basin because of its high rain gauge density the average number of rain gauges per unit area is 0 0345 three eligible flood events of the experimental basin from the period 2016 2017 were selected to establish a quantitative relationship between the rain gauge density and the error division ratio since the geophysical features and meteorological and climatic characteristics of the three basins are similar the established quantitative relationship can be applied to the three basins according to hydrological similarity based on the quantitative relationship established the mse dsrc method was applied to 30 flood events in the three basins 10 flood events in each basin hourly data were used in this study to test the performance of the new method for flood forecasting the hourly data included evapotranspiration streamflow and rainfall among them the areal mean rainfall was calculated by averaging all observed rainfall within the basin the difference between the areal mean rainfall and its true value was defined as the rainfall forecast error in addition there were constraints to the correction to avoid unrealistic precipitation values and unrealistic model parameters in the ems dsrc method to avoid unrealistic precipitation values we limited the correction range of each precipitation event not exceeding its own magnitude it helps prevent over correction or negative values to avoid unrealistic model parameters we constrained these parameters to be realistic e g the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to pan evaporation was less than 1 the surface recession constants were larger than those representing interflow or baseflow and so on moreover the precipitation values near zero and the insensitive model parameters were not corrected in the ems dsrc method 4 results and discussion 4 1 results for synthetic case for the synthetic case the quantitative relationship fig 5 between rain gauge density and the error division ratio was established by using the observation data of 59 rain gauges in the bmj basin as fig 5 shows that 1 both the rainfall caused error ratio and the model caused error ratio were related to the number of rain gauges 2 the lower the rain gauge density ρ was the larger the rainfall caused error ratio η p was if there was only one rain gauge for a basin η p was the largest 3 when ρ was 0 001 i e the control area of a single rain gauge was 1000 km2 the rainfall caused error ratio η p was equal to the model caused error ratio η m i e η p 1 η m 0 5 4 when ρ reached 0 005 i e 200 km2 per gauge the decrease rate of η p slowed down and the increase rate of η m slowed down as well and 5 the higher ρ was the smaller η p was when the control area of a single rain gauge was less than 30 km2 i e ρ was 0 033 η p decreased gradually and converged to 0 0 whereas η m increased steadily and approached 1 0 in other words if the rain gauge density of a basin regardless of the area of the basin was larger than 0 033 or if the area of a basin regardless of the number of rain gauges was less than 30 km2 the rainfall caused error was almost equal to 0 these findings about the partitioning of errors may reveal a limitation of mse dsrc method in order to establish the quantitative relationship between rain gauge density and the error division ratio the rain gauge density of the basin was at least 0 033 or the area of the basin was supposed to be less than 30 km2 containing error ratios ranging almost from 0 0 to 1 0 moreover the rainfall caused error associated with the rain gauge density can be a proxy or a reference for actual rain forecast error for example when the rain gauge density was less than 0 001 or the control area of a single gauge was larger than 1000 km2 the rainfall caused error ratio was high i e the rainfall forecast error was large with these error division ratios the mse dsrc method was used in any basin with various rain gauge densities then fig 6 summaries the application results of 10 real time correction cases the number of rain gauges n was 2 4 6 8 10 15 20 30 40 and 55 respectively as shown in the figure the black circles represent the results of the xaj model the blue circles represent the results of the rainfall dsrc method and the red triangles represent the results of the mse dsrc method fig 6a compares the δ q m values the δ q m of the mse dsrc method maximum was 0 04 was smaller than that of the xaj model and the rainfall dsrc method in most cases fig 6b shows a comparison of δ t values the δ t of the mse dsrc method was almost 0 h implying that the forecasted peak time almost matched well with the observed peak time whereas δ t of other methods was almost 1 h fig 6c shows a comparison of δ r values among three methods on average δ r of the mse dsrc method was smaller than that of the two other methods and was between 0 and 0 12 average was 0 05 but it can also be seen that δ r of mse dsrc was larger than that of rainfall dsrc in the cases number 1 4 while δ r of rainfall dsrc was larger than that of mse dsrc in other cases number 5 10 fig 6d shows a comparison of n s values the n s of mse dsrc method was always larger than that of the other two methods the mse dsrc method provided the best results for this synthetic case having the largest values of n s in the cases when the rain gauge density was large enough i e 15 rain gauges with an area of 1 71 103 km2 n s of the mse dsrc method was close to 1 i e the cases numbering 6 10 in addition the rain gauge densities affected the improvement accuracy of mse dsrc and rainfall dsrc methods when the number of synthetic cases was over 5 the rain gauge density exceeded 0 0058 gauge km2 i e 171 km2 gauge as shown in fig 5 when the density exceeded 0 0058 gauge km2 the model caused error ratio steadily increased from 0 82 and approached 1 0 obviously the model caused error was dominant at this point the rainfall dsrc method only considered the rainfall source error so the accuracy of this method exhibited a decreasing trend on the contrary the mse dsrc method considered the multi source errors including rainfall caused and model caused errors and made targeted corrections so the accuracy was improving in short the performance of mse dsrc was better than that of traditional dsrc and mse dsrc was stable for different rain gauge densities of the basin in the synthetic case 4 2 results for real cases for the real case we built a quantitative relationship by using the observational data from 59 rain gauges in the bmj basin from 2016 to 2017 fig 7 presents the quantitative relationships where ρ was the density of rain gauges η p was the rainfall caused error ratio and η m 1 η p was the model caused error ratio fig 7a shows three relationships constructed for three flood events no 20160701 no 20160720 and no 20170709 respectively and fig 7b shows the average lines of these three relationships the trends for the three flood events were relatively close to each other the relationships were similar for the same basin bmj basin thus we took the average line of the three relationships in fig 7b as a standard relationship to reflect the general relationship of the bmj basin it can be seen that as ρ increased η p decreased and η m increased when ρ reached 0 01 i e 100 km2 per gauge the decrease rate of η p slowed down and the increase rate of η m also slowed down based on the standard relationship in fig 7b η p and η m of hc bmj and hnz basins were calculated for hc with ρ of 0 0024 gauge km2 η p 55 43 and η m 44 47 for bmj with ρ of 0 0058 gauge km2 η p 38 74 and η m 61 26 for hnz with ρ of 0 0075 gauge km2 η p 33 93 and η m 66 07 then the results of hc bmj and hnz basins were obtained by comparing the observed discharge modelled discharge with xaj corrected model output via rainfall dsrc method and corrected model output via mse dsrc method here we provide detailed results table 3 for 10 flood events in hc basin the lowest rain gauges density among the three basins as an example as indicated in table 3 δ q m ranged from 20 to 31 qualification rate within 10 the same below was 20 δ t ranged from 4h to 2 h δ r ranged from 9 to 28 qualification rate was 60 and n s ranged from a minimum of 0 73 to a maximum of 0 96 with a mean value of 0 86 after the correction via the rainfall dsrc method δ q m ranged from 11 to 13 qualification rate was 80 δt ranged from 4h to 2 h δ r ranged from 9 to 10 qualification rate was 100 and n s ranged from 0 89 to 0 97 with a mean value of 0 94 after the correction via mse dsrc method δ q m ranged from 5 to 8 qualification rate was 100 δr ranged from 2 h to 1 h δ r ranged from 3 to 8 qualification rate was 100 and n s ranged from 0 92 to 0 99 with a mean value of 0 97 these results suggested that the two real time correction methods were almost equal in terms of the correction of flood peak and flood volume while the mse dsrc method was superior to the rainfall dsrc method in terms of n s in some cases n s from using mse dsrc was relatively large and close to 1 e g n s of flood no 20 030 708 was 0 99 the corrected discharge via mse dsrc method was almost close to the observed discharge besides all the flood events whether major or minor were well corrected via the mse dsrc method to sum up it was clear that the accuracy of real time flood forecasting significantly improved via the mse dsrc method in the hc basin similar results were obtained for the bmj and hnz basins fig 8 shows a comparison of n s and ins metrics of the three models for the three basins fig 8a c were ordered with the rain gauge density of three basins and the 10 flood events in axis of each figure were ordered with increasing peak flood magnitude as can be seen from fig 8a c in most events n s of the corrected output via mse dsrc method was larger than that of rainfall dsrc method the n s coefficients of xaj rarely exceeded 0 9 but after real time correction via mse dsrc all the n s coefficients were above 0 9 this means that the mse dsrc method had a strong and stable correction effect on each flood event in each basin whether it was a small scale or a larger scale basin although there was still a small residual error between the updated discharge and the observed discharge fig 8d shows the improvement of n s ins metric of rainfall dsrc and mse dsrc methods for the three basins the ins for mse dsrc method was higher than that of the rainfall dsrc method for all three basins which demonstrated the superiority of the mse dsrc method besides we noted that when the density ρ of the basin was lower the ins for mse dsrc was larger for example ρ of the hc basin was the lowest and ins for this basin was the largest the correction effect was more noticeable in a basin with fewer rain gauges lower rain gauge density basin which was consistent with our knowledge when the density ρ of a basin was relatively low the error of areal mean rainfall would be large and the improvement effect of this basin would be obvious via the error correction method or when the density ρ of a basin was relatively high the error of areal mean rainfall would be small and the improvement effect of this basin would be weak via the error correction method although it was an excellent method in order to compare the three methods the results of 30 flood events were plotted according to the magnitude of peak discharge all flood events in hc basin can be classified into three grades small medium and large three flood events flood no 20050513 flood no 20030622 and flood no 20040814 were selected as representatives of the three grades respectively fig 9 shows the final correction results of these three flood events where p is the areal mean rainfall in the basin over time q obs is the observed hydrograph q c is the hydrograph forecasted by the xaj model q 1 is the hydrograph corrected by the rainfall dsrc method and q 2 is the hydrograph corrected by the mse dsrc method these three distinguishing cases in fig 9 showed a similar result that both the green line and the red line were closer to the black line than the blue line i e the flood hygrographs of q 1 and q 2 were closer to q obs than that of q c it means that both rainfall dsrc and mse dsrc methods had potential for error correction in addition the red line was closer to the black line than the green line i e the flood hygrograph of q 2 was closer to q obs than that of q 1 the corrected discharge hydrograph of the mse dsrc method was closest to the observed discharge hydrograph the peak discharge of q 2 was almost the same as that of q obs moreover the four key indices i e peak discharge peak lag time runoff depth and nash sutcliffe coefficient for mse dsrc was better than that of the rainfall dsrc all the results of the three different flood events showed that the performance of mse dsrc was satisfactory and the mse dsrc method can further improve the flood forecasting accuracy of the xaj model compared to the other dsrc method in our opinion it was because that the new method considered the multi source errors while the traditional method did not obviously it was innovative and feasible for the mse dsrc method to divide the total error into multi source errors e g rainfall caused error and model caused error and correct all the errors simultaneously therefore the mse dsrc method was a development of the traditional dsrc methods bao et al 2014 si et al 2019 sun et al 2018b for multi source error correction of flood forecasting meanwhile the results at other times or in other two basins also indicated that the mse dsrc method was an ideal correction method for both flood peak and flood process the performance of the mse dsrc method was stable in all cases all in all applications and comparisons showed that the mse dsrc method was a reasonable and effective correction approach for real time flood forecasting 5 conclusions in this study we developed an mse dsrc method for real time correction to further improve the accuracy of flood forecasting this method separated the input caused and the model caused error based on their quantitative relationships and corrected these two types of errors simultaneously based on the system response theory its multi variable updating and multi source error correction capability overcame the limitation of the traditional dsrc method and yielded more reliable forecasts than other approaches that ignored or lumped different sources of uncertainty in a simple way the mse dsrc took an important step towards more reliable uncertainty quantification and decomposition we compared the mse dsrc method with the traditional rainfall dsrc method through synthetic and real case studies conducted in three basins of the huaihe river both of the results indicated that the overall performance of the mse dsrc method was superior to that of the traditional dsrc method a series of features of a flood event such as flood peak flood volume flood rise process and flood retreat process can be corrected efficiently by using the mse dsrc method besides the performance of mse dsrc method was stable although the traditional dsrc method worked relatively well when applied to basins with lower rain gauge density the mse dsrc method performed better with stronger applicability under various rain gauge densities low or high and basin sizes small medium or large further investigations for other factors that influence the performance of mse dsrc would be done in future studies overall the mse dsrc method has a clear physical interpretation relatively simple structure and stable performance it can be easily combined with any hydrological model without the need to modify them these properties make the mse dsrc method a useful tool for improving the accuracy of real time flood forecasting in operational hydrology future work will continue to further test this method and demonstrate its applicability to other flood forecasting models and to obtain more general

4849,real time correction is the key to reducing hydrological forecasting errors methods of real time correction can be classified into terminal error correction tec and process error correction pec methods a state of the art pec method is the dynamic system response curve dsrc method which has been developed to improve flood forecasting but its underlying assumption of error source limits the correction accuracy this study developed a multi source error dsrc method mse dsrc to partition the total error of forecast discharge into input caused error and model caused error based on the known quantitative relationship between rain gauge density and error division ratio two different sources of error are corrected simultaneously a synthetic case study was done to evaluate the ability of the mse dsrc method to correct the variables and parameters of the hydrological model xaj model the mse dsrc method was found to overcome the limitations of the traditional dsrc method and have a high accuracy indexed with the nash sutcliffe ns efficiency increasing above 0 9 then real case studies in three basins of the huaihe river china demonstrated that the mse dsrc method achieved higher accuracy and stability than did the traditional dsrc method and can be easily applied in practice with the average improvement of ns above 50 overall the error division of the mse dsrc method opens the possibility for multi variable updating and multi source error correction which may further improve the accuracy of flood forecasting keywords flood forecasting real time correction system response operational hydrology input caused error model caused error 1 introduction flood forecasting is an important non structural measure for flood warning flood risk analysis water resources management public safety and evacuation measures and reservoir operation chen et al 2016 natural complexities human disturbances e g dam construction and its operation urbanization and deforestation and uncertainty of flood hazard cause inevitable errors in flood forecasting these errors result from less than accurate estimates of input variables and initial state variables bárdossy and das 2008 kavetski et al 2006 as well as from the inadequacy of model structure and model parameters butts et al 2004 jiang et al 2019 these errors lead to the bias between predicted and measured flood magnitudes which reduces the accuracy of flood forecasting a widely used method to correct the error is real time error updating real time correction zhang et al 2018 error updating is the last step in real time flood forecasting and is a critical step to correct errors and improve the accuracy of flood forecasting a variety of flood forecasting systems with forecast updating are available with the goal of improving the fit between forecasted and observed values emerton et al 2016 the global and or national flood forecasting platforms which employ methods for real time error correction such as the delft flood early warning system fews forecast production system abrahart and see 2000 have been developed with the result that forecast updating and error correction have become major components of flood forecasting platforms the role of real time correction in operational hydrological platforms cannot be overemphasized kauffeldt et al 2016 based on different error updating approaches real time correction methods can be grouped into two categories terminal error correction tec and process error correction pec methods tec methods are indifferent to the process error affected by intermediate factors and directly correct the terminal error and are relatively simple to update flood forecasting errors commonly used tec methods are the auto regressive ar model hasebe et al 1989 shamseldin and o connor 2001 the recursive least squares rls algorithm zhao et al 2008 liu et al 2016 and the quantile regression qr technique dogulu et al 2015 wani et al 2017 these methods evaluate the autocorrelation between terminal errors to correct them and directly update river flow discharge the real time correction pec methods reduce the terminal error by reducing the error of each link of forecasting these methods focus on the errors in the processes of hydrological forecasting e g rainfall runoff and confluence or the state variables of the forecasting model examples of such methods are the standard kalman filter kf method and its extension methods kalman 1960 weerts and el serafy 2006 which estimate flood events and correct process errors with a filtering algorithm however these two methods tec and pec methods suffer from weak physical foundation less prediction period and unsatisfactory correction effect the dynamic system response curve dsrc method bao et al 2014 which is a pec method is based on physical mechanisms is model free and does not increase the number of model parameters its theoretical basis is the differential of the system response function of the process variables and state variables such as areal mean rainfall runoff free water storage and soil moisture si et al 2015 sun et al 2018a the performance of dsrc does not deteriorate as the forecasting period i e lead time increases there have been studies on the improved dsrc method for its ill posed property of model structure si et al 2019 and its ability of multi variable estimation sun et al 2018b it has been shown that the rainfall correction of the dsrc method is superior to the streamflow correction of the ar method for both runoff depth and flood peak discharge however the dsrc method treats the discharge error as being primarily due to one or part of variables such as rainfall assuming that rainfall errors tend to be dominant in practice this presumption is untenable the model and runoff errors may also influence the calculated discharge ignoring the sources of error may lead to unreliable forecasts this study proposes and tests a new method mse dsrc to correct multi source errors in flood forecasts in contrast with the traditional dsrc methods the mse dsrc method can simultaneously correct all the errors the overall objective of this study is therefore to investigate multi variable updating and multi source error correction to improve the accuracy of flood forecasting specifically the objectives are to i quantify input caused error and model caused error and establish a relationship between rain gauge density and error division ratio ii update areal mean rainfall and model parameters via response system in order to improve process estimates and discharge forecasts generated by the xaj xinanjiang model and iii test in synthetic and real cases to show the general applicability and capability of the proposed method 2 methodology 2 1 overview of dsrc method the dsrc method is based on the system response theory and error feedback correction with the aid of system response theory the nonlinear relationship between model variables and model outputs is established this relationship is called the response system then the error feedback correction is achieved by solving the system response function using the least squares ls technique si et al 2015 2 1 1 single variable dsrc method and multi variable dsrc method consider a hydrological or flood forecasting system as indicated in fig 1 a the general mathematical formula for a hydrological model used for flood forecasting can be given as 1 q f x θ where f represents the rainfall runoff model function q represents the time ordered vector of output variables e g vector of discharge q q 1 q 2 q n t at time 1 2 n x represents the corresponding vector of input variables state variables and intermediate variables e g vector of areal mean rainfall p p 1 p 2 p m t vector of runoff r r 1 r 2 r m t vector of free water storage s s 1 s 2 s m t and vector of soil moisture w w 1 w 2 w m t and θ represents the vector of model parameters θ θ 1 θ 2 θ k t if the model is considered to have almost no error model parameters θ will not be updated and will remain the same the discharge q can only be corrected by updating variables x thus equation 1 can be simplified as 2 q f x for the single variable dsrc method equation 2 can be expanded using taylor series using the first order partial derivatives into a nonlinear form as equation 3 3 q n q n q n x 1 q n x m x x where q n is the observed discharge at time n q n is the calculated discharge obtained by the hydrologic model x x 1 x 2 x m t x x 1 x 2 x m t x m is the actual input variable state variable or the intermediate variable at time m x m is the approximate variable at time m and q n x m is the partial derivative of the output discharge at time n with respect to the variable at time m with n m equation 3 can also be described in matrix notation with time as the following system response function 4 q x q x h x x x 5 h x q 1 x 1 q 1 x m q n x 1 q n x m where q x q 1 q 2 q n t q x q 1 q 2 q n t h x is the system response matrix using the least square ls technique golub et al 1999 the variable can be estimated as 6 x h x t h x 1 h x t q x q x x for example if the update variable of rainfall in the dsrc method is the areal mean rainfall p a similar equation can be obtained by substituting p into equation 6 7 p h p t h p 1 h p t q p q p p for the multi variable dsrc method equation 3 is rewritten as the following system response function 8 q n q n q n x 1 n q n x l n x 1 n x 1 n x l n x l n where q n and q n are the observed and calculated discharge at time n subscripts 1 2 l are used to distinguish different input state and intermediate variables at the same time n thus x l n and x l n are the actual and approximate l th variable at time n the q n x l n is the partial derivative of the output at time n with respect to the nth variable at the same time 2 1 2 limitation of dsrc method obviously the traditional dsrc methods can not only correct the single variable response system but also the multi variable response system in which the variables x vary from runoff r to areal mean rainfall p specifics of the derivation proof and applications of the traditional dsrc method and its improved versions can be found in si et al 2019 sun et al 2018b results of performance metrics e g nash sutcliffe show that the dsrc methods perform better than black box methods e g ar while the dsrc method may be a simple and convenient method there are some basic assumptions that set the foundation for the framework of the method one of the assumptions of dsrc methods is that forecasts are simply determined by input variables x it is because the system response function of dsrc is more convenient for feedback correction of single source error so these dsrc methods treat the discharge error as being primarily due to input variables assuming that x caused error tend to be dominant apparently this assumption falls short of equation 1 in which output q depends on both input variables x and model parameters θ this assumption of dsrc methods is incorrect because x is not the only source of total error and this assumption becomes a limitation a response system only between x and q leads to the attribution of the total error to x optimization of θ also plays a crucial role in improving the hydrological model performance it is thus necessary to ensure the accuracy of all input variables state variables intermediate variables and model parameters in flood forecasting therefore the mse dsrc method was developed to update multi sources errors simultaneously the innovation of the mse dsrc method lies in the partition of total error and targeted correction for different source errors 2 2 multi source error dsrc method based on an established quantitative relationship the mse dsrc method partitions the terminal error total discharge error of hydrological model output e g forecasted discharge value into two parts one part is caused by the error in model inputs and the other part is caused by the error in model parameters the total discharge error is divided into x caused discharge error and θ caused discharge error referring to the system response theory the response of the system of discharge error to both the input error and parameter error is established in which the total error of discharge is corrected by incorporating these multi source errors therefore the mse dsrc method realizes the multi variable updating and the multi source error correction by correcting both x caused error and θ caused error simultaneously the steps of the mse dsrc method are presented below 1 establish a flood forecasting system function of model inputs parameters and outputs as shown in equation 9 which is the same as equation 1 9 q f x θ 2 the mse dsrc method considers both model inputs x x 1 x 2 x l t and model parameters θ θ 1 θ 2 θ k t as updatable variables then equation 9 can be expressed based on the binary taylor series expansion as equation 10 10 q n q n q x n q n q θ n q n q 1 n x 1 n q 1 n x l n x 1 n x 1 n x l n x l n q 2 n θ 1 n q 2 n θ k n θ 1 n θ 1 n θ k n θ k n where q n and q n are the observed and calculated discharge at time n q n q n is the total error q x n q n is the partial error caused by the uncertainty in model inputs x l n x l n q θ n q n is the partial error caused by the inaccuracy of the model parameters θ k n θ k n 3 since only the areal mean rainfall i e l 1 and x x 1 t p t p is selected as the delegate variable to be updated the single variable dsrc method is used to update the areal mean rainfall series p p 1 p 2 p m t at time 1 2 m the multi variable dsrc method is used to update the model parameter series θ θ 1 θ 2 θ k t e g all the 16 xaj model parameters k 16 note that all parameters of a hydrological model can be corrected but not every parameter needs to be updated then equation 10 can be converted to equation 11 11 q n q n q p n q n q θ n q n q n p 1 q n p m p p q n θ 1 n q n θ k n θ 1 n θ 1 n θ k n θ k n where q n q n is the total error q p n q n is the rainfall caused error and q θ n q n is the model caused error 4 use e t for q n q n e p for q p n q n and e m for q θ n q n to simplify equation 11 to equation 12 12 e t e p e m where the total error et is the sum of absolute deviations of calculated discharges and observed discharges fig 2 shows the deviation of the calculated discharge and the observed discharge at time n 5 for a study basin where rain gauges are abundant we can obtain different areal mean rainfall amounts according to the density of rain gauges in the basin different areal mean rainfalls correspond to different rainfall caused and model caused errors therefore a quantitative relationship between rainfall caused error e p model caused error e m and rain gauge density ρ can be established from the data of flood events available in the study basin step 1 according to the rainfall data from the j rain gauges and the discharge data from the outlet in the study basin an optimal group of model parameters θ can be determined since j is large enough the group of model parameters θ can best reflect the watershed runoff yield and concentration as the rain gauge density ρ j j f where f is the basin area is high the rainfall caused error in the basin can be ignored i e e p ρ j 0 here the total error is the model caused error i e e m ρ j e t ρ j this model caused error reflects the inherent error of the study basin and does not change with rain gauge density step 2 based on the principle of sampling stations in hydrology i 1 2 j rain gauges are randomly sampled from j rain gauges every gauge has the same probability of being chosen the number of different rain gauges i represents different rain gauge densities ρ i i f for each different ρ i the total error e t ρ i is calculated according to the rainfall data of i sampling rain gauges and the optimal model parameter θ since the optimal group of model parameters θ is always adopted for different cases of ρ i the model caused errors e m ρ i are considered to be identical i e e m ρ 1 e m ρ i e m ρ j then the corresponding rainfall caused error e p ρ i can be calculated as e p ρ i e t ρ i e m ρ i e t ρ i e m ρ j e t ρ i e t ρ j step 3 according to the quantitative relationship between ρ i and e t ρ i e p ρ i and e m ρ i the quantitative relationship between ρ i and the rainfall caused error ratio η p ρ i e p ρ i e t ρ i 1 η m ρ i 0 η p ρ i 1 and the model caused error ratio η m ρ i e m ρ i e t ρ i 1 η p ρ i 0 η m ρ i 1 is established as table 1 this established relationship can be fitted into a relation curve by the least square method 6 the known quantitative relationship can be applied to the adjacent or similar basins with lower density rain gauges to realize the total error division for the application basin with the rain gauge density ρ the total error e t ρ is divided into rainfall caused error e p ρ and model caused error e m ρ with the corresponding error ratios η p ρ and η m ρ 13 e p ρ η p ρ e t ρ 14 e m ρ η m ρ e t ρ 5 based on the system response theory the rainfall caused error e p ρ and model caused error e m ρ of the application basin are feedback corrected step 1 the areal mean rainfall correction value δ p ρ and model parameter correction value δ θ ρ are obtained as follows 15 δ p ρ a t a 1 a t q p ρ θ q p c ρ θ a t a 1 a t e p ρ 16 δ θ ρ b t b 1 b t q p θ ρ q p θ c ρ b t b 1 b t e m ρ where a is the system response matrix of the error in areal mean rainfall p c ρ is the areal mean rainfall before updating b is the system response matrix of the error in model parameters and θ c ρ are model parameters before updating step 2 results of equation 15 and equation 16 are substituted into equation 6 to obtain the updated

the xaj model for the synthetic case we tested the performance of the mse dsrc method because we cannot get access to the true inputs and outputs in a real case for real cases we applied the mse dsrc method to three real basins where the proposed method was compared with the traditional dsrc method four metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the traditional dsrc method and the mse dsrc method 3 1 hydrological model and evaluation metrics the xaj model is a conceptual hydrological model developed by zhao 1992 and is one of the most widely used hydrologic models in humid and semi humid regions of china including the huaihe river basin the model is simple model parameters are easily calibrated and the discharge concentration is easily linearized therefore the xaj model was chosen as the flood forecasting system in this study fig 1b shows a generalized system diagram of the flood forecasting model and a simple input output structure of the xaj model details on the physical meaning range of values of each parameter and parameter sensitivity analysis are available in si et al 2015 zhao 1992 peak discharge peak lag time runoff depth and nash sutcliffe coefficient are the four key indices for a flood event which are used extensively bao et al 2014 si et al 2015 in general for flash floods e g a flood event in small or medium basin the peak discharge and time to peak are the most critical indices for long duration floods e g a flood event controlled by a reservoir the flood volume or runoff depth is the most essential index if we consider the whole flood process the nash sutcliffe coefficient is also an important index for the flood event thus for a comprehensive study the following metrics were selected for evaluating the performance of the mse dsrc method 1 relative error of peak discharge 20 δ q m q m obs q m c q m obs 100 2 absolute error of peak lag time 21 δ t t q m obs t q m c 3 relative error of runoff depth 22 δ r r obs r c r obs 100 4 nash sutcliffe coefficient 23 n s 1 t 1 n q obs t q c t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 5 improvement of the nash sutcliffe coefficient 24 ins 1 n i 1 n n s after i n s before i 1 n s before i 100 where q m obs and q m c are the observed discharge and computed peak discharge t q m obs and t q m c are the peak lag times of observed and computed discharges r obs and r c are the runoff depths of observed and computed flood event q obs is the observed discharge and n s before i and n s after i are the n s before and after error correction for flood event i the ins reflects the degree if improvement of n s after correction compared with its maximum value 1 before correction the larger the ins the higher the degree of improvement and the more significant the correction effect 3 2 synthetic case in the synthetic case we used the data of a real flood event flood no 20 170 709 with 59 rain gauges from the beimiaoji bmj basin fig 4b ensuring that the simulated flood event was consistent with an actual flood event the areal mean rainfall series p true and evaporation series e m true were equal to the input of flood no 20170709 the true model parameters θ true and initial conditions w true were the same as those fitted optimally under p true e m true and the bmj basin conditions true observed outputs q true were obtained by a free run of the xaj model using the predefined ptrue e m true θ true and w true fig 3 shows the flowchart of mse dsrc method first a quantitative relationship between ρ i and the error division ratio was established we carried out 59 forecasts for different densities of rain gauges ρ i i from 1 to 59 for each forecast each rain gauge density 1 000 000 random samples were taken from the rain gauges to calculate the average rainfall the corresponding parameters of the forecasting model were limited to the range of 2 of θ true after each forecast we subtracted q true from the output of forecasting to obtain the total error for the correction model we constructed 10 cases with the number of rain gauges of 2 4 6 8 10 15 20 30 40 and 55 in order to confirm the effectiveness and feasibility of the mse dsrc method 10 cases with different rain gauge densities were constructed both low and high densities were contained in the synthetic cases ensuring that the cases were representative for each case such as the 2 rain gauge case 2 rain gauges were randomly selected from 59 rain gauges for observation finally the observed areal mean rainfall and model parameters were corrected using the mse dsrc method based on the established quantitative relationship 3 3 real cases we applied the mse dsrc method to bmj huangchuan hc and huangnizhuang hnz basins of the huaihe river the locations and station distributions of the three basins are shown in fig 4 while their hydrometeorological characteristics and available data are listed in table 2 the huaihe river valley is located in china s transition terrain of northern climate and southern climate the three selected adjacent basins are hilly mountainous watersheds with a range of gauge density hilly mountainous watersheds conformed to the application requirements of xaj model a range of gauge density conformed to the application requirements of the mse dsrc method the bmj basin was selected as the experimental basin because of its high rain gauge density the average number of rain gauges per unit area is 0 0345 three eligible flood events of the experimental basin from the period 2016 2017 were selected to establish a quantitative relationship between the rain gauge density and the error division ratio since the geophysical features and meteorological and climatic characteristics of the three basins are similar the established quantitative relationship can be applied to the three basins according to hydrological similarity based on the quantitative relationship established the mse dsrc method was applied to 30 flood events in the three basins 10 flood events in each basin hourly data were used in this study to test the performance of the new method for flood forecasting the hourly data included evapotranspiration streamflow and rainfall among them the areal mean rainfall was calculated by averaging all observed rainfall within the basin the difference between the areal mean rainfall and its true value was defined as the rainfall forecast error in addition there were constraints to the correction to avoid unrealistic precipitation values and unrealistic model parameters in the ems dsrc method to avoid unrealistic precipitation values we limited the correction range of each precipitation event not exceeding its own magnitude it helps prevent over correction or negative values to avoid unrealistic model parameters we constrained these parameters to be realistic e g the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to pan evaporation was less than 1 the surface recession constants were larger than those representing interflow or baseflow and so on moreover the precipitation values near zero and the insensitive model parameters were not corrected in the ems dsrc method 4 results and discussion 4 1 results for synthetic case for the synthetic case the quantitative relationship fig 5 between rain gauge density and the error division ratio was established by using the observation data of 59 rain gauges in the bmj basin as fig 5 shows that 1 both the rainfall caused error ratio and the model caused error ratio were related to the number of rain gauges 2 the lower the rain gauge density ρ was the larger the rainfall caused error ratio η p was if there was only one rain gauge for a basin η p was the largest 3 when ρ was 0 001 i e the control area of a single rain gauge was 1000 km2 the rainfall caused error ratio η p was equal to the model caused error ratio η m i e η p 1 η m 0 5 4 when ρ reached 0 005 i e 200 km2 per gauge the decrease rate of η p slowed down and the increase rate of η m slowed down as well and 5 the higher ρ was the smaller η p was when the control area of a single rain gauge was less than 30 km2 i e ρ was 0 033 η p decreased gradually and converged to 0 0 whereas η m increased steadily and approached 1 0 in other words if the rain gauge density of a basin regardless of the area of the basin was larger than 0 033 or if the area of a basin regardless of the number of rain gauges was less than 30 km2 the rainfall caused error was almost equal to 0 these findings about the partitioning of errors may reveal a limitation of mse dsrc method in order to establish the quantitative relationship between rain gauge density and the error division ratio the rain gauge density of the basin was at least 0 033 or the area of the basin was supposed to be less than 30 km2 containing error ratios ranging almost from 0 0 to 1 0 moreover the rainfall caused error associated with the rain gauge density can be a proxy or a reference for actual rain forecast error for example when the rain gauge density was less than 0 001 or the control area of a single gauge was larger than 1000 km2 the rainfall caused error ratio was high i e the rainfall forecast error was large with these error division ratios the mse dsrc method was used in any basin with various rain gauge densities then fig 6 summaries the application results of 10 real time correction cases the number of rain gauges n was 2 4 6 8 10 15 20 30 40 and 55 respectively as shown in the figure the black circles represent the results of the xaj model the blue circles represent the results of the rainfall dsrc method and the red triangles represent the results of the mse dsrc method fig 6a compares the δ q m values the δ q m of the mse dsrc method maximum was 0 04 was smaller than that of the xaj model and the rainfall dsrc method in most cases fig 6b shows a comparison of δ t values the δ t of the mse dsrc method was almost 0 h implying that the forecasted peak time almost matched well with the observed peak time whereas δ t of other methods was almost 1 h fig 6c shows a comparison of δ r values among three methods on average δ r of the mse dsrc method was smaller than that of the two other methods and was between 0 and 0 12 average was 0 05 but it can also be seen that δ r of mse dsrc was larger than that of rainfall dsrc in the cases number 1 4 while δ r of rainfall dsrc was larger than that of mse dsrc in other cases number 5 10 fig 6d shows a comparison of n s values the n s of mse dsrc method was always larger than that of the other two methods the mse dsrc method provided the best results for this synthetic case having the largest values of n s in the cases when the rain gauge density was large enough i e 15 rain gauges with an area of 1 71 103 km2 n s of the mse dsrc method was close to 1 i e the cases numbering 6 10 in addition the rain gauge densities affected the improvement accuracy of mse dsrc and rainfall dsrc methods when the number of synthetic cases was over 5 the rain gauge density exceeded 0 0058 gauge km2 i e 171 km2 gauge as shown in fig 5 when the density exceeded 0 0058 gauge km2 the model caused error ratio steadily increased from 0 82 and approached 1 0 obviously the model caused error was dominant at this point the rainfall dsrc method only considered the rainfall source error so the accuracy of this method exhibited a decreasing trend on the contrary the mse dsrc method considered the multi source errors including rainfall caused and model caused errors and made targeted corrections so the accuracy was improving in short the performance of mse dsrc was better than that of traditional dsrc and mse dsrc was stable for different rain gauge densities of the basin in the synthetic case 4 2 results for real cases for the real case we built a quantitative relationship by using the observational data from 59 rain gauges in the bmj basin from 2016 to 2017 fig 7 presents the quantitative relationships where ρ was the density of rain gauges η p was the rainfall caused error ratio and η m 1 η p was the model caused error ratio fig 7a shows three relationships constructed for three flood events no 20160701 no 20160720 and no 20170709 respectively and fig 7b shows the average lines of these three relationships the trends for the three flood events were relatively close to each other the relationships were similar for the same basin bmj basin thus we took the average line of the three relationships in fig 7b as a standard relationship to reflect the general relationship of the bmj basin it can be seen that as ρ increased η p decreased and η m increased when ρ reached 0 01 i e 100 km2 per gauge the decrease rate of η p slowed down and the increase rate of η m also slowed down based on the standard relationship in fig 7b η p and η m of hc bmj and hnz basins were calculated for hc with ρ of 0 0024 gauge km2 η p 55 43 and η m 44 47 for bmj with ρ of 0 0058 gauge km2 η p 38 74 and η m 61 26 for hnz with ρ of 0 0075 gauge km2 η p 33 93 and η m 66 07 then the results of hc bmj and hnz basins were obtained by comparing the observed discharge modelled discharge with xaj corrected model output via rainfall dsrc method and corrected model output via mse dsrc method here we provide detailed results table 3 for 10 flood events in hc basin the lowest rain gauges density among the three basins as an example as indicated in table 3 δ q m ranged from 20 to 31 qualification rate within 10 the same below was 20 δ t ranged from 4h to 2 h δ r ranged from 9 to 28 qualification rate was 60 and n s ranged from a minimum of 0 73 to a maximum of 0 96 with a mean value of 0 86 after the correction via the rainfall dsrc method δ q m ranged from 11 to 13 qualification rate was 80 δt ranged from 4h to 2 h δ r ranged from 9 to 10 qualification rate was 100 and n s ranged from 0 89 to 0 97 with a mean value of 0 94 after the correction via mse dsrc method δ q m ranged from 5 to 8 qualification rate was 100 δr ranged from 2 h to 1 h δ r ranged from 3 to 8 qualification rate was 100 and n s ranged from 0 92 to 0 99 with a mean value of 0 97 these results suggested that the two real time correction methods were almost equal in terms of the correction of flood peak and flood volume while the mse dsrc method was superior to the rainfall dsrc method in terms of n s in some cases n s from using mse dsrc was relatively large and close to 1 e g n s of flood no 20 030 708 was 0 99 the corrected discharge via mse dsrc method was almost close to the observed discharge besides all the flood events whether major or minor were well corrected via the mse dsrc method to sum up it was clear that the accuracy of real time flood forecasting significantly improved via the mse dsrc method in the hc basin similar results were obtained for the bmj and hnz basins fig 8 shows a comparison of n s and ins metrics of the three models for the three basins fig 8a c were ordered with the rain gauge density of three basins and the 10 flood events in axis of each figure were ordered with increasing peak flood magnitude as can be seen from fig 8a c in most events n s of the corrected output via mse dsrc method was larger than that of rainfall dsrc method the n s coefficients of xaj rarely exceeded 0 9 but after real time correction via mse dsrc all the n s coefficients were above 0 9 this means that the mse dsrc method had a strong and stable correction effect on each flood event in each basin whether it was a small scale or a larger scale basin although there was still a small residual error between the updated discharge and the observed discharge fig 8d shows the improvement of n s ins metric of rainfall dsrc and mse dsrc methods for the three basins the ins for mse dsrc method was higher than that of the rainfall dsrc method for all three basins which demonstrated the superiority of the mse dsrc method besides we noted that when the density ρ of the basin was lower the ins for mse dsrc was larger for example ρ of the hc basin was the lowest and ins for this basin was the largest the correction effect was more noticeable in a basin with fewer rain gauges lower rain gauge density basin which was consistent with our knowledge when the density ρ of a basin was relatively low the error of areal mean rainfall would be large and the improvement effect of this basin would be obvious via the error correction method or when the density ρ of a basin was relatively high the error of areal mean rainfall would be small and the improvement effect of this basin would be weak via the error correction method although it was an excellent method in order to compare the three methods the results of 30 flood events were plotted according to the magnitude of peak discharge all flood events in hc basin can be classified into three grades small medium and large three flood events flood no 20050513 flood no 20030622 and flood no 20040814 were selected as representatives of the three grades respectively fig 9 shows the final correction results of these three flood events where p is the areal mean rainfall in the basin over time q obs is the observed hydrograph q c is the hydrograph forecasted by the xaj model q 1 is the hydrograph corrected by the rainfall dsrc method and q 2 is the hydrograph corrected by the mse dsrc method these three distinguishing cases in fig 9 showed a similar result that both the green line and the red line were closer to the black line than the blue line i e the flood hygrographs of q 1 and q 2 were closer to q obs than that of q c it means that both rainfall dsrc and mse dsrc methods had potential for error correction in addition the red line was closer to the black line than the green line i e the flood hygrograph of q 2 was closer to q obs than that of q 1 the corrected discharge hydrograph of the mse dsrc method was closest to the observed discharge hydrograph the peak discharge of q 2 was almost the same as that of q obs moreover the four key indices i e peak discharge peak lag time runoff depth and nash sutcliffe coefficient for mse dsrc was better than that of the rainfall dsrc all the results of the three different flood events showed that the performance of mse dsrc was satisfactory and the mse dsrc method can further improve the flood forecasting accuracy of the xaj model compared to the other dsrc method in our opinion it was because that the new method considered the multi source errors while the traditional method did not obviously it was innovative and feasible for the mse dsrc method to divide the total error into multi source errors e g rainfall caused error and model caused error and correct all the errors simultaneously therefore the mse dsrc method was a development of the traditional dsrc methods bao et al 2014 si et al 2019 sun et al 2018b for multi source error correction of flood forecasting meanwhile the results at other times or in other two basins also indicated that the mse dsrc method was an ideal correction method for both flood peak and flood process the performance of the mse dsrc method was stable in all cases all in all applications and comparisons showed that the mse dsrc method was a reasonable and effective correction approach for real time flood forecasting 5 conclusions in this study we developed an mse dsrc method for real time correction to further improve the accuracy of flood forecasting this method separated the input caused and the model caused error based on their quantitative relationships and corrected these two types of errors simultaneously based on the system response theory its multi variable updating and multi source error correction capability overcame the limitation of the traditional dsrc method and yielded more reliable forecasts than other approaches that ignored or lumped different sources of uncertainty in a simple way the mse dsrc took an important step towards more reliable uncertainty quantification and decomposition we compared the mse dsrc method with the traditional rainfall dsrc method through synthetic and real case studies conducted in three basins of the huaihe river both of the results indicated that the overall performance of the mse dsrc method was superior to that of the traditional dsrc method a series of features of a flood event such as flood peak flood volume flood rise process and flood retreat process can be corrected efficiently by using the mse dsrc method besides the performance of mse dsrc method was stable although the traditional dsrc method worked relatively well when applied to basins with lower rain gauge density the mse dsrc method performed better with stronger applicability under various rain gauge densities low or high and basin sizes small medium or large further investigations for other factors that influence the performance of mse dsrc would be done in future studies overall the mse dsrc method has a clear physical interpretation relatively simple structure and stable performance it can be easily combined with any hydrological model without the need to modify them these properties make the mse dsrc method a useful tool for improving the accuracy of real time flood forecasting in operational hydrology future work will continue to further test this method and demonstrate its applicability to other flood forecasting models and to obtain more general
