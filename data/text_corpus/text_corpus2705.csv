13525,the use of conventional heating techniques in adsorbents preparation involves long synthesis time high energy consumption high cost and material fast firing recently microwave heating technique has been used to replace or complement the conventional heating in adsorbents preparation as it provides rapid selective and uniform heating consequently the adsorbent microscopic structure and adsorption performance are affected significantly the current review critically investigates the effect of using microwave heating technique on carbon based minerals and polymeric adsorbents morphology surface chemistry and pore structure in addition the adsorption performance of water pollutants using microwave synthesized adsorbents adsorption kinetics and isotherms were included a competitive comparison in terms of adsorbent morphology pore structure and adsorptive behavior between adsorbent prepared by microwave and convention heating technique were discussed finally challenging and promising routes are suggested for future development of microwave prepared adsorbents for water pollutants removal on the basis of this review using microwave technology in adsorbents

order pso pseudo second order keywords microwave heating adsorption activated carbon kinetics isotherm 1 introduction the continued dramatic increase in water pollution levels has become a worldwide concern and a major challenge for governments and industrial sectors the continuation of revealing new industrial technologies with the production of new products and wastes can threaten public health and environment if not managed properly 1 the situation is becoming worse as industrial score continue to discharge toxic and hazardous water pollutants into water bodies without proper treatment 2 to regulate the uncontrollable discharge of wastewater several technologies have been adopted such as membrane 3 biological 4 and electrochemical treatment 5 even though these technologies have proven to be efficient their high operating cost due to high energy consumption limit their application in wastewater treatment 6 another limitation is the membrane s tendency to fouling which reduces its performance in addition membrane cleaning process due to fouling requires a complete process shutdown and involves strong chemicals that may damage the membrane 7 other treatment technologies such as ion exchange chemical precipitation and chemical oxidation are used in wastewater treatment however these technologies are expensive to be implemented on a large scale as well as ineffective for heavy metals removal when the concentration ranges between 1 and 100 mg l 8 9 on the other hand adsorption technology is widely used in wastewater treatment due to its eco friendly nature simple operating mode and high efficiency 10 11 despite the fact that adsorption has a relatively high cost of insulation and maintenance system the cost can be reduced by using low cost adsorbents 12 for this purpose many adsorbents have been proposed and utilized in wastewater treatment processes such as activated carbon 13 carbon fibers 14 clay minerals 15 silica 16 etc solvothermal and sono chemical are well known synthesis methods for adsorbents preparation however they are associated with high energy consumption 17 the selection of the type of energy sources along with the preparation method are important factors as they influence the adsorbents morphology stability physicochemical properties and adsorption capacity 18 the use of conventional heating techniques such as furnace in adsorbents preparation consumes time and energy requires large equipment size and causes improper heating rate which adversely affect the adsorbent stability and morphology 1 this promoted the utilization of microwave mw technology in adsorbents synthesis several review articles have been published focusing on mw concept and heating mechanism 19 the influence of mw heating mode on porous carbon structure and properties 20 and mw industrial application 21 23 the last decade has witnessed an increasing number of research articles regarding mw assisted preparation of adsorbents and their adsorptive behavior towards water pollutants most of the recent articles focus on carbon based minerals and polymeric adsorbents preparation using mw heating technology a detailed investigation on the effect of mw power irradiation time on the activated carbon physical characteristic along with the effect of mw induced method on carbon yield was reviewed 24 the characteristics of mw assisted preparation of activated carbons from biomass sources along with their methylene blue adsorptive capability has been emphasized 25 also the adsorptive capacity and behavior of mw assisted activated carbon derived from biomass wastes towards real industrial wastewater 26 and basic dyes 27 were addressed however the adsorption of water pollutants onto mw assisted activated carbon fibers acf carbonaceous ca silica sa clay minerals cm and polymeric adsorbents pa are also reported in the literature therefore the current review aims to update the literature with the recent development in mw assisted preparation of acs and their adsorptive behavior towards various water pollutants in addition this review includes the adsorption performance of water pollutants by mw assisted synthesis of acf ca sa cm and pa the articles explore the effect of mw irradiation on the adsorbent morphology physicochemical properties and surface characteristics a comparison between mw assisted and conventional adsorbents has been carried out in terms of adsorbent morphology physicochemical characteristics and adsorption capability towards water pollutants finally the article addresses the adsorption isotherms and kinetics models applied to mw adsorbents and they were compared to the applicable models for the same adsorbent prepared by conventional heating towards the same water pollutant 2 adsorption process adsorption is the adhesion of a substrate in a gas or a liquid phase to the adsorbent surface s functional group 28 29 adsorption is a promising technology as it is a sludge free process with a high process efficiency and economical approach 28 29 the applied adsorbents for water pollutants removal include a wide range of carbon based adsorbent cm sa and pa materials an overview of the published articles in the last decade on water pollutants removal using mw synthesized adsorbents show that carbon based adsorbents are the most used followed by polymeric and mineral adsorbents 2 1 carbon based adsorbents carbon based adsorbents including ac acf and ca are widely used for water remediation application carbon based adsorbents vary in their adsorption performance due to their variation in surface area porosity and surface functional groups ac is widely used as an adsorbent in water treatment applications due to its high surface area good mechanical strength reactive surface and high stability 30 32 it is produced from several precursors that results in adsorbents with different properties and adsorption efficiency depending on the nature of the precursors 33 ac can be produced via carbonization and activation techniques 34 35 carbonization involves exposing the carbonaceous substrate to high temperature in the presence of nitrogen gas whereby the activation of ac is achieved by two approaches which are physical activation using oxidative gases such as steam or carbon dioxide or by chemical activation using chemical reagents such as potassium hydroxide potassium carbonate sodium hydroxide zinc chloride phosphoric acid etc ac prepared via physical activation is still a challenge due to its inferior textural properties compared to ac prepared by chemical activated method which possesses high specific surface area and pore volume 36 in addition applying surface modification to ac can potentially enhance its adsorptive performance towards water pollutants surface modification includes surface charge modification in order to increase ac removal affinity towards targeted contaminants 37 acf are microporous materials with negligible mesoporosity which exhibit a well defined porous structure in fibrous form despite the fact that acf shows similar properties to ac such as porosity they exhibit several advantages over ac owing to their structure 38 acfs are produced from different precursors such as polyacrylonitrile pan 39 coal tar pitch 40 petroleum pitch 41 etc similar to ac acf can be produced via carbonization and activation techniques however prior to carbonization a pretreatment is required to improve the yield and the strength of the final product 42 in addition physical and chemical activation are applied to acf the main advantage in activation processes is the removal of disorganized carbon which consequently reflected on the pore distribution the possibility of applying mw irradiation to carbon based materials as a source of energy during the synthesis can potentially reduce the energy consumption synthesis time and can possibly enhance the structure as well as the physicochemical properties 2 2 clay minerals cms fall under the phyllosilicates family in which their structure consists of one or two silica tetrahedral sheets with alumina based octahedral sheets plate like structure 43 phyllosilicates are classified into 1 1 and 2 1 clay mineral based on the ratio of tetrahedral to octahedral sheets in a unit form fig 1 cms including kaolinite 1 1 montmorillonite 2 1 bentonite 2 1 as well as illite 2 1 are utilized in drug delivery hemorrhage inhabitation 44 oil and gas drilling fluids 45 and environmental remediation 46 the utilization of clay minerals in environmental remediation application is owing to its excellent properties including ion exchange capacity high surface area and charged surface and edges 47 these unique characteristics increase clay minerals affinity towards cationic and anionic water pollutants removal from aqueous solutions furthermore cms exhibit swelling characteristics in which their volume and structure increase during the adsorption process which enhances the adsorption process 48 2 3 silica adsorbents sas fall under mesoporous solid materials they possess a high specific surface area with a large internal surface area and attain a high porosity owing to their great characteristics silica materials are utilized in several applications such as gas sensors catalyst support battery electrodes and as adsorbents in water remediation application 50 silica materials in water remediation including silica gels and colloidal silica are used widely as adsorbents owing to their low production cost high specific surface area high chemical purity ease of production and high stability 51 53 in addition silica adsorbents can be modified by adding active groups to increase its affinity towards targeted water pollutants 54 56 2 4 polymeric adsorbents polymers and polymeric composites in water remediation are used as an alternative to many adsorbents such as ac owing to ease of re generation process functionalization and pore size enhancement 57 furthermore polymers offer a flexible geometry and high strength to weight ratio 58 there are several drawbacks of using conventional heating methods in polymeric adsorbents synthesis which leads to the utilization of mw technology instead 59 the major drawbacks of using conventional heating methods in polymeric adsorbents preparation are uncountable reaction rate long reaction time and the contamination of the final products with by products which affects the polymeric adsorbent performance 60 61 molecular imprinting technology mit is a process that has attracted a great deal of attention as it can produce polymers with high selectivity towards the template molecules or ions the process involves the combination of the monomer and template molecules or ions to produce a polymer with particular recognition sites that attracts the template molecules or ions 62 conventional and mw heating methods are applied in polymeric adsorbents and imprinted polymer synthesis in which the heating technique affects the structure as well as the adsorbent adsorptive performance significantly 62 63 3 microwave heating system mw is an electromagnetic radiation that has a wavelength ranging between 1 mm and 1 m and a frequency between 300 mhz to 300 ghz in industrial applications the most common used frequencies for heating purposes are 915 mhz 2 45 ghz 5 8 ghz and 22 125 ghz 64 mw technology has been used in material science and processing including powder synthesis and polymers synthesis 65 67 in particular mw technology as a heating source has been used in adsorbents synthesis instead of conventional heating due to i low energy consumption and processing time ii rapid and simple irradiation process iii uniform temperature throughout the material iv enhanced diffusion process 68 in addition mw energy reduces the risk of overheating that subsequently leads to the material combustion e g ac 69 a schematic diagram of the microwave heating system is shown in fig 2 in conventional heating technique the material surface is heated first followed by the transfer of heat inwards this occurs by heat transfer between objects by conduction convection and radiation whereas in mw heating the material couples with mw and absorbs the electromagnetic energy volumetrically then energy is transformed into heat within the material and then transfers outwards as shown in fig 3 70 as a result the morphology and the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent are enhanced significantly compared to adsorbents prepared by conventional heating techniques 70 72 the mw heating system consists of four basic components as shown in fig 4 which are power supply magnetron applicator and waveguide 64 in this system the material is placed in a metal applicator that varies according to the process specification and heated by mw energy that is directed by the waveguide during the heating process the material is moved through the oven by an insulated conveyor belt for better energy distribution 73 mw heating mechanism can be classified into ionic conduction and dielectric polarization the dielectric polarization heating mechanism is classified into dielectric interfacial electronic atomic and orientation polarization in electrotonic polarization a dipole moment occurs in response to the displacement of the nucleus in a neutral atom with respect to the electrons around it at the molecular level if the nuclei is displaced from different atoms in the molecule it is called atomic polarization interfacial polarization is a combination of conduction and dipolar effect 74 75 meanwhile orientation polarization occurs when the electrical field applied in the equilibrium state of an atom causes the dipoles to align with the electrical field resulting in polarization 76 a deep understanding of the materials dielectric properties is important for the theoretical analysis of the heating process 77 the ability of the material to absorb mw energy depends on the dissipation factor which is the ratio of loss factor to the dielectric constant of the material loss factor is the ability of the material to fritter away mw energy as heat whereas the dielectric constant is associated with the material ability to retain this energy therefore a material with a high loss factor is easily heated by mw energy a material with high conductivity is used as waveguide due to its ability to reflect the microwaves from the surface such as metals 64 78 mw radiation cannot penetrate the conductive materials and thus they are reflected on the other hand absorbing materials can absorb the mw radiation and subsequently they are heated up while the incident waves on insulation materials are partially transmitted materials that can absorb mw radiation are called dielectrics the complex dielectric constant is expressed by 19 1 ε έ j ε έ represents the dielectric constant j equal to 1 0 5 and ε refers to the loss factor the absorbed power by the dielectric materials p 79 2 p σ e r m s 2 where σ is the total effective conductivity and e r m s is the magnitude of the internal electric field the depth of microwave penetration d 79 is 3 d c 2 η f 2 x 1 tan 2 δ 1 0 5 where c is the speed of light and tan δ is the loss tangent that indicate the ability of the material to be heated and it is defined as follows 79 4 tan δ ε έ the quantity of thermal energy absorbed by dielectric material is expressed by 79 5 p d 2 π f ε 0 ε 0 e 0 2 p d is the volumetric energy absorption density f is the frequency e 0 is the magnitude of the electric field from the microwave ε 0 is the permittivity 4 microwave synthesis of adsorbents 4 1 carbon based adsorbents carbon based materials can effectively absorb mw irradiation resulting in adsorbents with excellent physicochemical properties and adsorption capability ac is known for its high adsorption capacity towards organic and inorganic contaminants 80 it has received great attention owing to its excellent properties such as large porous high specific surface area and good thermal stability 1 saucier et al 81 studied the removal of sodium diclofenac dcf and nimesulide nm by microwave assisted activated carbon derived from cocoa shells the study compared the adsorbent morphology and adsorptive behavior obtained from conventional heating method csc and from mw pyrolysis process mwcs it was found that mwcs attained a higher specific surface area for all various inorganic ratios and higher pore volume the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra revealed that the heating source has affected the surface functional groups the major functional groups on csc were oh alcohols phenols co alcohols si o silicates and c h aromatics aliphatic chains on the other hand mwcs attained the same functional groups except si o this indicates that using mw as energy source can significantly affect the surface functional groups which affect the adsorbent selective adsorption since functional groups are responsible for the adsorption process scanning electron microscope sem images showed that the granules of mwcs 1 0 were smaller than csc 1 0 with a spherical appearance as shown in fig 5 besides macro cavities were observed in both adsorbents but csc 1 0 had higher cavities than those of mwcs 1 0 furthermore mwcs was found to have a higher removal efficiency for dcf and nm for all various inorganic ratios mwcs 1 0 attained a removal percentage of 97 05 and 98 75 towards dcf and nm respectively while csc 1 0 attained a removal of 45 23 and 40 25 towards dcf and nm respectively yagmur et al 82 studied the performance of commercial activated carbon derived from coal cac and mw assisted preparation of activated carbon derived from waste tea wt ac and demineralised waste tea dwt ac for phenol and p nitrophenol removal the results revealed that both wt ac and dwt ac attained higher specific surface area and pore volume compared to cac the sem images indicated that similar large voidage were observed in dwt ac and cac unlike wt ac in addition dwt ac attained a higher specific surface area and micropore volume compared to wt ac which could be attributed to the demineralisation process that influenced the textural characteristics of the final wt product this indicates that the type of precursor and the pre treatment process have a vital role in the adsorbent morphology and performance the kinetics data showed that wt ac was capable of removing 99 of p nitrophenol compared to cac that removed around 77 under the same conditions however cac was able to remove a higher percentage of phenol compared to wt ac and dwt ac furthermore the effect of mw re gernetation process on ac specific surface area and pore volume was investigated the mw re generation process involved exposing the adsorbents to mw irradiation for 30 s the results showed that cac surface area increased in the first re gerneation cycle followed by continual decrease until the 5th re gerneration cycle in addition the removal efficiency of cac for phenol for all regerneation cycles was higher than the starting cac this indicates that the regeneration process via microwave technique can enhance ac adsorption ability despite the decrease in specific surface area similarly dwt ac specific surface area was decreased through the regeneration cycles along with an increase in the adsorbent removal capability for wt ac the specific surface area was reduced over the five regeneration cycles however the adsorbent removal capability was increased in the first regeneration cycle followed by a continual decrease until the 5th regeneration cycle in another work ge et al 83 studied the effect of mw irradiation on coal based activated carbon cac under mw power of 300 w mcac 300 500 w mcac 300 and 700 w mcac 300 the sem images indicated that cac exhibits an uneven and rough surface whereas mcac showed an even homogenous and porous structure however mcac 700 w showed a collapse in some porous due to carbon calcination at 700 w the mw irradiation affected the pore volume and specific area in which at 500 w the specific area and pore volume attained the highest values however for all modified activated carbon the specific area and pore volume were higher than cac furthermore the study indicated that mw irradiation had a significant effect on the surface functional group in which the oxygen functional group varied with microwave power as revealed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis the analysis showed that there was a decrease in co group and an increase in co group moreover the analysis of surface basicity and acidity suggested that mcacs experienced an increase in the surface basicity and a decrease in the amount of surface acidic functional groups this could be attributed to the decomposition of acidic groups to co and co2 due to the exposure to mw radiation mcacs showed higher removal efficiency of naphthalene compared to cac but mcac 500w exhibited the highest removal efficiency this indicates that the increase in specific surface area pore volume could be responsible for high removal efficiency similar observation was found by baytar et al 84 where exposing ac to mw irradiation caused the development of a homogenous and even porous structure table 1 summarizes the preparation parameters of mw synthesized acs and their adsorption behavior toward water pollutants acfs have attracted attention in water remediation application due to their lightweight high resistance to corrosion and high stiffness and strength 105 the effect of mw irradiation on the morphology and adsorptive behavior of acf was investigated by several authors foo and hameed 106 studied the morphology and adsorptive behavior of carbonized oil palm char and microwave activated carbon fiber opac the sem images showed that opac showed a more homogeneous even and highly porous structure than char as shown in fig 6 in addition the ftir spectra showed that mw irradiation affected the surface functional groups in which both samples showed the same functional groups except the no2 functional group which was eliminated in opac brunauer emmett teller bet analysis showed that opac attained a higher specific surface area and pore volume compared to char similar observations were reported by huang et al 107 where cavernous pores were clearly observed for mw heated activated carbon fiber macf as indicated by the sem images even though the macf attained a bet surface area less than acf the external surface area and mesopore volume were significantly increased this believed to be responsible for the enhancement in the adsorption capacity of macf compared to acf from 68 3 315 mg g and from 80 2 309 3 mg g towards tetracycline tc and oxytetracycline hydrochloride otc respectively it is possible to functionalize acfs with nanoparticles to enhance the surface morphology and the adsorptive performance for instance chen et al 108 and chen at al 109 studied the removal of as v by mw assisted synthesis of fe2o3 acf and mn3o4 acf respectively both studies confirmed the successful deposition of nanoparticles on acf surface as revealed by x ray powder diffraction xrd and xps analysis the sem images showed a homogeneous deposition of nanoparticles over the acf surface which caused the surface to become coarse the specific surface area and pore volume of both adsorbents were decreased compared to acf the maximum adsorption capacity for as v using fe2o3 acf and mn3o4 acf were 20 33 and 46 10 mg g at 25 respectively whereas acf attained a negligible adsorption capacity it can be observed that the increase in specific surface area did not cause an increase in the adsorption capacity as was observed in ac chen et al 108 reported regarding this matter that there is another surface property that controls the adsorption of arsenic other than the surface area generally the adsorbate chemical structure and its chemistry as well as the adsorbent s intrinsic characteristic are defining criteria for the established relation between the adsorption capacity and the specific surface area 110 table 2 summarizes the preparation parameters of mw synthesized acfs and their adsorption behavior toward water pollutants mw heating can also facilitate the synthesis of cas such as graphene carbon nanotube hydrochar etc several authors have reported the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide and its composites using mw assisted preparation method 112 114 wang et al 113 fabricated reduced graphene oxide titania nanocomposite via microwave assisted reduction mrgo tio2 and direct reduction rgo tio2 of reduced graphene the sem images show that rgo tio2 exhibited a larger and thicker structure compared to mrgo tio2 because of the aggregation of go sheets during the reduction process the aggregation of go sheets is attributed to van der waals and p p interaction between the go sheets for mrgo tio2 the reduction rate of go was accelerated due to the high energy of microwaves that prevented the overlap of rgo sheets furthermore the transmission electron microscopy tem images showed that tio2 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on mrgo surface with a diameter ranging from 10 to 30 nm the nanocomposites were employed for methylene blue removal from aqueous solution the experimental data reveal that mrgo tio2 had higher removal efficiency compared to rgo tio2 which could be attributed to the less aggregation of rgo sheets as a result of using mw heating however mrgo tio2 exhibited less removal efficiency compared to mrgo this is mainly because the spaces that are supposed to trap mb molecules were occupied by tio2 nanoparticles mw heating can facilitate the synthesis of spherical particles from the raw precursor for instance semercioz et al 115 fabricated activated hydrochar from grapefruit peel via mw implemented low temperature hydrothermal carbonization technique for copper ion cu 2 removal the sem revealed that the dried peel surface seemed as an unbroken plane whereas activated hydro char showed open slits and spherical shape bulge forms this structure results in an increase in the total surface area which could enhance the adsorption of cu 2 ions furthermore the maximum adsorption capacity of the hydro char attained a value of 53 06 mg g at 318 k microwave irradiation power and irradiation time are important parameters as they influence the pore size and subsequently affect the adsorbent s adsorption capacity 116 mubarak et al 117 studied the effect of the mw power and mw irritation time on mw assisted carbon nanotubes weight and purity the selection of the optimal conditions mw irradiation power and time was determined by the material high quality with the minimal impurity the results suggested that mw power and irradiation time play a vital role in the carbon nanotubes weight and purity however irradiation time does not control the formation of carbon nanotubes table 3 summarizes the preparation parameters of mw synthesized ca and their adsorption behavior toward water pollutants adsorption experiments usually involve investigating the equilibrium isotherms kinetics and thermodynamic as they are important to describe the interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate and optimizing the adsorption process 118 119 equilibrium isotherms experiments involve the variation of initial solution concentration at fixed time ph and adsorbate dosage initial solution concentration influences the adsorption capacity as it provides the driving force for the mass transfer between the aqueous solution and the adsorbent 120 usually increasing the adsorbate concentration increases the effective collision between the adsorbate and the adsorbent which accelerate the adsorption process for instance gupta et al 121 reported that increasing the initial concentration of cr vi ion from 100 to 500 mg 100 ml enhanced the removal percentage from 23 to 80 along with the adsorption capacity of microwave assisted porous carbon however increasing the cr vi initial concentration from 500 to 900 mg 100 ml did not cause any further increase in porous carbon adsorption capacity nor the removal percentage this is because the vacant sites became fully occupied with cr vi ions the adsorption kinetics are important as it reveals the rate at which the contaminants are removed from the aqueous solution by the adsorbents the adsorption kinetics can be carried out by varying the contact time between the adsorbent and the adsorbate at fixed parameters usually increasing the contact time between the adsorbent and the adsorbate enhances the removal rate of containment until equilibrium is reached adsorbent dosage is an important parameter to study as it determines the adsorbent efficiency and the cost of the adsorbent per unit produced water to be treated generally the removal percentage increases as the adsorbent dosage increases due to the availability of adsorption sites chen et al 109 studied the effect of adsorbent dosage on arsenic as v removal results revealed that the concentration of as v decreased steadily as the adsorbent dosage increased from 0 2 to 0 8 g l after that no remarkable change in as v concentration for any further increase in the dosage was observed generally high adsorbent concentration can reach equilibrium rapidly due to the availability of adsorption sites while low adsorbent concentration attained equilibrium in a longer time this indicates that the contact time has a great influence on the adsorption process the solution ph does not have a defined effect on the adsorption behavior of adsorbents this is because the solution ph regulates the adsorbent surface charge and the adsorbate ionization degree in an aqueous solution the adsorbent s surface charge is regulated by the association and dissociation of the adsorbent surface functional group this determines the affinity of surface charge for electrostatic interaction and the reactive sites for chemical interactions for instance gupta et al 122 where the removal capability of toxaphene using mw assisted mno2 cellulose fiber in ph ranging from 1 to 9 the results revealed that the removal percentage increased up to ph value of 3 then decreased as the ph was increased the ph corresponds to the point of zero net charge phpznc found to be 4 5 this implies that at a ph lower than 4 5 mno2 cellulose fiber becomes positively charged and at a ph higher than 4 5 it becomes negatively charged subsequently at ph lower than 3 toxaphene can be easily bound on its anionic form to mno2 cellulose fiber in another case the adsorption of methylene blue by mw assisted reduced graphene titania nanocomposite attained removal percentage of 98 at ph 11 compared to 75 at ph 4 113 therefore it is crucial to study the effect of solution ph on the adsorption performance for each type of adsorbate temperature could potentially be the controlling factor in the adsorption process as it enhances the diffusion rate of the adsorbate in the adsorbent internal pores and across the external boundary layer 123 furthermore the equilibrium capacity of the adsorbent is highly affected by the changes in the temperature as it influences the tendency of deaggregation 124 this fact is confirmed by several studies where changes in temperature resulted in different adsorption capacities 113 115 125 temperature effect on the equilibrium capacity is controlled by the thermodynamic behavior of the adsorption process with the elevation of temperature the adsorption capacity decreases for exothermic process while the adsorption capacity increases for endothermic process 126 127 thus there is the possibility of enhancing the pore structure and the morphology of the ac by mw radiation however in some cases a collapse in the pores could happen with the rise in the mw power leading to a decrease in the pore volume therefore it is important to observe the effect of mw power and irradiation time on ac internal pore structure furthermore some studies showed that mw irradiated ac showed the absence of some functional groups compared to ac prepared by conventional methods this indicates that the adsorption capacity is affected since functional groups are responsible for the adsorption process similar behaviors were observed on mw assisted preparation of acfs where the pore volume mesoporous structure and surface functional groups were highly affected by mw irradiation the use mw assisted preparation method can facilitate the uniform distribution of nanoparticles over a carbonaceous support surface in addition it can also reduce the aggregation of graphene sheets which could potentially enhance the adsorption capacity 4 2 polymer based adsorbents polymeric composites have an important role in industry due to their wide range of applications including water remediation application that utilizes polymeric materials as adsorbents the quality of polymeric structure is strongly affected by the process synthesis parameters such as temperature and curing time 137 the non uniform temperature distribution during polymer processing and the variation in curing method may result in defects in the polymer integrity which are introduced as contaminates or voids during the bonding process 137 consequently a rapid controllable curing process with a high depth of penetration is required to minimize the defects in the polymer integrity which can be achieved via mw heating technique instead of conventional heating techniques 138 owing to the high energy efficiency provision of high penetration depth and the reduction in the cure time mw heating process is widely used in polymeric adsorbents synthesis which could impose notable economic merits 139 several authors studied the use of mw irradiation as an alternative energy source for polymer based adsorbents synthesis masinga et al 140 compared the morphology and the adsorptive behavior of b cyclodextrin n doped carbon nanotube polyurethane nanocomposite n cnts b cd synthesized by conventional and microwave heating techniques it was found that the mw preparation of n cnts b cd reduced the synthesis time compared to conventional method from 24 h to 10 min a visual observation revealed that n cnts b cd synthesized using mw was soft and powdery whereas n cnts b cd composite prepared using conventional heating technique was in granular form and attained a coarse like structure in addition the mw synthesized composite was less densely packed and have high surface area compared to conventional prepared composite which allowed more pollutants to be trapped the adsorption experiment using both composite showed that mw synthesized composite had higher removal capability of nitrophenol even at ng l pollutant concentration thermogravimetric analysis tga revealed that mw synthesized n cnts b cd composite attained a slight shift in the decomposition however due to the use of low temperature in water purification it is not expected to be an issue furthermore the ftir analysis showed that both composites showed identical surface functional groups these results indicate that mw irradiation does not affect the polymer s surface functional group but it did affect the surface morphology and the adsorbent adsorptive capability a recent study by deng et al 141 confirmed that using mw irradiation for phosphorylated fiber panmw phos preparation reduced the reaction time from 6 to 1 h and increased the grafting ratio compared to conventional methods the sem images revealed that crackles were observed on the surface of panmw phos however the inner molecular chain of the pan fiber was not broken and the modification reaction was on the surface of pan matrix the adsorptive behavior of panmw phos was two times higher than pancv phos obtained from conventional heating techniques besides the adsorption capability of panmw phos remained constant for five cycles of reuse the sem images showed that there were no significant changes in the morphology after five regeneration cycles which proves the good stability of microwave synthesized pan phos yet some crackles were observed on the surface of the fiber fig 7 shows the sem edx images of pan panmw phos and panmw phos after u vi adsorption the figure clearly shows crackles that appeared on the surface of panmw phos yet the inner molecular chain of pan fiber was preserved fig 7b after one adsorption cycle of u vi no significant changes in the surface morphology of panmw phos were observed fig 7c however after five times of regeneration crackles appeared on the surface of panmw phos but its integrity was preserved the same fact was reflected in another study conducted by qu et al 142 where the functionalization of cellulose using mw heating technique was achieved in 6 5 min furthermore the adsorbent showed an adsorption capacity of 295 20 mg g 151 51 mg g and 72 89 mg g for pb ii cd ii and ni ii respectively in addition the composite was generated for 5 cycles with slight decline in the removal efficiency on the other hand the conventionally functionalized cellulose attained a removal capacity of 139 94 mg g 133 85 mg g and 49 75 mg g for pb ii cd ii and ni ii respectively this confirms that using mw heating in polymeric absorbent functionalization can enhance the adsorbent adsorption capacity significantly compared to conventional functionalization technique several authors addressed the number of re generation cycles of mw induced polymeric adsorbents for instance zhang et al 143 studied the removal of lead pb ii by mw assisted nano tio2 cellulose nanocomposite the results indicated that the composite attained a slightly constant removal percentage of 93 for 5 cycles this indicates that the composite is rich in active sites which enhances the removal of pb 2 from the aqueous solution table 4 summarizes the preparation parameters of mw synthesized pa and their adsorption behavior toward water pollutants thus using mw heating technique in polymers functionalized and processing promotes a rapid controllable curing process with high depth of penetration which enhances the adsorbent physiochemical properties and thus enhances its uptake capacity furthermore the use of mw irradiation in polymeric adsorbents synthesis could result in less densely packed structure thus increasing the polymeric adsorbent surface area one of the main drawbacks is that mw synthesized polymeric adsorbents can have lower thermal stability at high temperature compared to conventional ones however this is not expected to be a drawback since water remediation technologies do not involve high temperature systems finally the adsorption capacity and the number of re generation cycles can potentially increase for mw synthesized polymeric adsorbents compared to conventionally synthesized adsorbents as confirmed by several authors 4 3 mineral adsorbents 4 3 1 silica silica adsorbents have attracted a great deal of attention in water remediation application as they are rich with adsorption sites and attain a highly porous structure 154 several studies have demonstrated the enhancement in silica adsorbents morphology using mw heating instead of conventional heating techniques for example peres et al 155 compared the performance and the characteristics of silica nanoparticles produced from the conventional synthesis process n sio2 and mw process mw nsio2 for methylene blue dye removal the results revealed that nsio2 and mw sio2 attained the same xrd and ftir spectra which indicates that mw irradiation did not result in new chemical bonds formation or destruction even though nsio2 and mw nsio2 attained a mesoporous structure mw nsio2 had a higher pore volume surface area porosity and average pore diameter furthermore it was found that mw nsio2 had higher purity compared to nsio2 which suggests that mw heating technique can increase the adsorbent quality comparing the maximum adsorption capacity for both nanoparticles mw nsio2 attained a higher adsorption capacity this is mainly because of the higher surface area and pore volume that mw nsio2 attains compared to nsio2 kenawy et al 156 reported the synthesis of silica nanoparticles modified by thioglycolic acid mcm 41 tga using mw heating technique for cd ii and hg ii removal the study showed that silica was successfully functionalized under mw irradiation of 600 w for 5 min only and resulted in the formation of co and sh vibrating groups of the thioglycolic moiety in addition mcm 41 tga attained a lower surface area compared to mobil crystalline of material 41 mcm 41 due to the functionalization process despite that the adsorption experiment shows that mcm 41 tga had an excellent adsorption capacity towards cd ii and hg ii and an excellent desorption cycles as it can be utilized for at least 10 cycles without a decline in the adsorption efficiency 156 in another study mahmoud et al 157 utilized mw irradiation in nanosilica functionalization by salicylic acid n si sa and succinic acid n si su for heavy metals removal both materials were exposed to mw irradiation for 2 min under a power of 800 w the ftir spectra confirmed the formation of new bonds as a result of the functionalization process furthermore the sem images revealed that n si sa and n si su sorbents were brighter and smoother compared to n si sorbent n si su attained the higher surface area followed by n si and n si sa the removal of heavy metals cd ii hg ii and pb ii using the functionalized nanosilica were examined by carrying out the adsorption experiment using mw enforced sorption mes technique for 15 s at 800 w the results showed that the adsorption capacities for these metals using n si sa were higher than n si su even though n si sa had a lower surface area in addition comparing these results to the study carried by kenawy et al 156 for hg ii and cd ii removal using mcm 41 tga it is noticed that the adsorption capacities were higher for hg ii and cd ii removal using n si sa and n si su this could be due to the using of mes technique which implies that mw radiation can be used to accelerate and enhance the adsorption process table 5 summarizes the preparation parameters of mw synthesized sa and their adsorption behavior toward water pollutants thus mw irradiation can be used in silica nanoparticles synthesis and functionalization which can be achieved in a few minutes mw heating technique can potentially increase the adsorbent pore volume surface area porosity and average pore diameter compared to conventional heating techniques consequently it can enhance the adsorption of water pollutants adsorbents prepared by mw heating technique could have higher purity compared to conventional ones which enhances the adsorbent quality in addition silica nanoparticles were successfully functionalized under mw irradiation in few minutes the functionalized nanosilica had an excellent performance in removing heavy metals in aqueous solutions however the effect of using mw heating technique to functionalize nanosilica was not compared to the functionalization process using conventional heating techniques therefore it is difficult to state whether the adsorption capacity was enhanced due to functionalization or due to the effect of mw irradiation on the silica adsorbent morphology lastly the mes technique could potentially increase the removal of heavy metals compared to conventional adsorption method 4 3 2 clays mw assisted synthesis of clay adsorbents has been reported for the adsorption of dyes 159 162 heavy metals 163 164 pharmaceutical pollutants 165 inorganic pollutants 166 and organic pollutants 167 table 6 lists the preparation parameters of mw synthesized cm and their adsorption behavior toward water pollutants fabryanty et al 162 studied the removal of crystal violet dye using microwave assisted bentonite alginate composite with different bentonite to sodium alginate ratio the synthesis process involved stirring of the bentonite and sodium alginate mixture for 3 h followed by irradiating the mixture at 700 w for 90 s the ftir analysis confirmed the formation of bentonite alginate composite furthermore it was found that changing the alginate to bentonite ratio did not affect the surface functional group but it did affect the degree of crystallinity as was observed from the xrd patterns the sem images showed the formation of porous structure for 3b 5a and 2b 5a adsorbents in addition it was observed that decreasing the bentonite amount caused a reduction in the composite specific surface area and pore volume in another study barakanet al 163 compared between feal12 polyoxocations intercalated nano bentonite adsorbent prepared by conventional and one step ultrasonic mw irradiation methods for arsenic removal different ratios of bentonite to fe 3 and al 3 were investigated however the conventional preparation technique was performed to one composite that had 2 wt of bentonite pb1 whereas the ultrasonic mw irradiation method was applied for 60 wt of bentonite pb2 and to other composites under different precursor composition pb3 and pb4 the conventional synthesis process consumed around 24 h while ultrasonic mw irradiation method consumed a total of 29 min the ftir analysis revealed that both composites attain the same functional groups furthermore the mw irradiated composites showed higher surface area pore volume and high mesoporous structure with low blocked pores compared to pb1 the adsorption experiments revealed that pb2 attained the best adsorption performance for as v among the other adsorbents above all the synthesis time was effectively reduced from 24 h to only 29 min even under high bentonite concentration similar findings were addressed by laysandra et al 159 their study confirmed the formation of bentonite titanium dioxide nanocomposite btc by the effect of mw irradiation in 10 min under 700 w which is less than the time required to synthesis the same nanocomposite by conventional method that consumed 12 h 168 mw heating technique can also be used in bentonite silylation applications mw irradiation provides a rapid heating which is expected to enhance the silylation process 169 in a recent work silylation of bentonite using different polar and non polar solvents using mw heating was investigated 160 the results showed that bentonite silylation using mw irradiation was achieved in 5 min with a high degree of functionalization with non polar solvents the rapid heating rate that mw heating technique provides enhances the reaction rate and the degree of functionalization similar to bentonite several authors used mw heating technique to fabricate montmorillonite modification by surfactants and co polymers for water pollutants removal 161 164 167 it was found that mw heating reduced the synthesis time and resulted in montmorillonite based adsorbents with high adsorption capability in addition it is more likely that specific surface area and pore size distribution are more related to the type and the quantity of the modifiers and to the synthesis method thus mw heating technique can effectively reduce clay minerals adsorbents synthesis time from hours to few minutes the resulting adsorbents can potentially attain a higher surface area pore volume and a mesoporous structure compared to adsorbents prepared by conventional heating technique even at high precursor concentration mw is still effective and can successfully produce highly efficient adsorbents for most of the studies the adsorption was strongly ph dependent which suggests the contribution of the surface complexation mechanism table 7 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of using mw heating in absorbents preparation 5 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherm models describe the interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate at a constant temperature isotherms models also indicate the equilibrium stage of an adsorption process and evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity attained by an adsorbent at constant temperature 173 174 the isotherms models are fitted to the equilibrium data based on different assumptions langmuir and freundlich models are the most common isotherms that fit the equilibrium data langmuir model suggests that the adsorption occurs on a homogeneous surface on identical sites through monolayer adsorption without any interaction between the adsorbate molecules the model also assumes that the adsorption sites are energetically identical and each binding site adsorb only one molecule 175 the langmuir model is described by eq 6 6 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e where c e the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate mg l q e amount of adsorbate per unit mass of adsorbent at equilibrium mg g q m the monolayer adsorption capacity mg g k l l mg langmuir constant related amount of adsorption freundlich model assumes a multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous surface and active sites with different energies 176 the model is described by eq 7 7 q e k f c e 1 n where c e the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate mg l q e amount of adsorbate per unit mass of adsorbent mg g k f constant related to the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent mg g and n describes the intensity of the adsorption process in order to reduce the error between the experimental data and the predicted equilibrium data toth model was suggested as an empirical modification of langmuir model 177 temkin isotherm assumes a chemisorption process that involves an electrostatic interaction 178 further a combination of langmuir and freundlich isotherm model is represented by liu model 179 while neglecting the monolayer assumption stated by langmuir model and the finite adsorption assumption stated by freundlich liu model is described by eq 8 8 q e q m a x k g c e n l 1 k g c e n l where k g is a liu equilibrium constant l mg nl is a dimensionless exponent q m a x is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g sips model is a combination of the langmuir and freundlich model the model predicts the langmuir model at high adsorbate concentration while it predicts freundlich model at low adsorbate concentration 180 sips model is described by eq 9 9 q e k s c e b s 1 a s c e b s where b s is the sips exponent k s is the sips isotherm model constant l g a s sips isotherm model constant l g the adsorption equilibrium studies comply with the langmuir model around 69 23 which assumes a monolayer adsorption process xiao et al 181 reported that the removal of cr vi ion by poluacrylonitrille fiber loaded with carbon dots synthesized under mw irradiation is best described by langmuir model where the correlation factor r2 exhibits a value of 0 9989 meanwhile the freundlich model was used to fit the adsorption data but the correlation factor was lower than the fitting obtained from the langmuir model the freundlich model fitted around 23 08 of the adsorption equilibrium data zhang et al 143 studied the removal of pb ii by microwave synthesized nanotio2 cellulose the correlation factor r2 reveals that freundlich most is the best fit model that describes the adsorption process of pb ii compared to langmuir correlation factor r2 thereby the assumption that the adsorption takes place on a heterogeneous surface is valid liu model is the third that fits the adsorption data by 4 62 thue et al 88 investigated the removal of phenol using microwave assisted activated carbon the results reveal that the adsorption data best fit liu isotherme model with r2 0 9996 for all the four adsorbents sips model comes in the last place where it was applicable for only 3 08 of the adsorption cases for instance the adsorption of dbt on mw assisted carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofiber is well described by sips isotherm model 129 it wasobserved that the equilibrium adsorption model for conventional and microwaveassisted preparation of adsorbents for the same pollutant is described by thesame isotherm model for instance baytar et al 84 reported that the equilibrium data for mw assisted ac from sunflower seed husk for methylene blue removal was best described by langmuir isotherm model similar conclusion was suggest by salman et al 182 where langumir isotherm model best fitted activated carbon derived from sunflower seed husk equilibrium data for methylene blue removal similarly it was found that silica nanoparticles prepared by conventional and mw for methylene blue removal followed the same isotherm model sips model 155 also activated carbon fiber from cotton prepared by conventional and microwave methods best fitted langumir isotherm model 42 183 in addition the equilibrium data for montmorillonite prepared by conventional and microwave methods for triclosan removal followed the langmuir 167 184 consequently the interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate does not vary according to the heating method applied to the adsorbent yet the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent significantly changes however more research should be directed to address the difference between mw assisted and conventional adsorbents interaction with the same water pollutant under same chemical and physical conditions 6 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics are vital in determining the rate at which the contaminant is removed from a solution by the adsorbent at constant temperature in addition adsorption kinetic models e g intra particle diffusion model can identify the adsorption controlling step 29 the most commonly used kinetics models are pseudo first order pfo 185 pseudo second order pso 186 and intra particle diffusion model 187 among these models pso is the most common model that fitted the adsorption results by around 83 93 for water pollutant removal using mw synthesized adsorbents the model confirms a chemisorption process that involves covalent bonding or ion exchange for instance the removal of as v using fe2o3 activated carbon fibers and mn3o4 activated carbon fibers found to follow pso kinetics model 108 109 in another study the removal of as v by multiwall carbon nanotube followed pfo 125 pfo model is the second model that successfully fits the adsorption data by around 12 5 for mw assisted preparation of adsorbents the model assumes that the adsorption rate depends on the deviation of the instant adsorbent amount from the saturation value for instance the adsorption data of methylene blue by ac was better described by pfo kinetic model 84 in another study the adsorption of methylene blue onto reduced graphene oxide titania nanocomposite followed pso kinetic model 113 pfo 185 and pso 186 kinetic models can be described by eq 10 and 11 respectively 10 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 11 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q e the amount of adsorbed at equilibrium mg g q t the amount of adsorbed at time t mg g t time of contact min k 1 pseudo first order rate constant min 1 k 2 pseudo second order rate constant g mg min intra particles diffusion model 187 is an important model since it describes the multistep adsorption process involved in the adsorption process intra particles diffusion model can be described by eq 14 14 q t k i d t 0 5 c where t is the time k i d is the rate constant in mg g min0 5 and c is the boundary thickness intra particles diffusion model was used to describe the adsorption process for mw synthesis of adsorbents for instance khasri et al 188 used an intra particle diffusion model to describe the complex adsorption steps involved in methylene blue adsorption onto activated carbon the results revealed that the adsorption process involves three main steps rapid diffusion intra particle diffusion and final equilibrium the first stage involves the diffusion of methylene blue molecules to the external surface of activated carbon with a diffusion rate k1 the diffusion in this step is instantaneous due to the strong electrostatic interaction between the methylene blue molecules and the adsorbent outer surface the second stage is a gradual smooth transition from stage 1 to stage 2 in this step methylene blue molecules penetrate through the inner layers the final stage is the equilibrium diffusion stage in which diffusion through the interior layers start to occur slowly with a diffusion rate k2 the influence of the boundary layer is represented by c if c does not pass through the zero point the intra particles diffusion is not the only rate limiting step in addition the numerical value of c indicates the thickness of the boundary layer the greater value of c the more influence the boundary layer has on the diffusion process similar to isotherms models adsorbents prepared by conventional and mw assisted methods were best described by the same model for the same type of pollutant for instance pseudo n order and hsdm kinetics models were both adequate to describe the kinetics of methylene blue removal by conventional and mw assisted silica nanoparticles 155 similarly the kinetics of methylene blue by microwave assisted and conventional activated carbon fiber was best described by pso 42 183 this indicates that using mw as a heating source in adsorbents preparation did not change the adsorbent s nature but it enhanced its surface morphology and internal structure which might enhance the adsorption process however the data for direct comparison are still rare and more research should be directed towards that 7 conclusion and future remarks the unique features of mw heating render its applicability to replace or complement conventional heating for adsorbents synthesis unlike conventional heating mw heating occurs inside the material and moves outwards leading to faster temperature increase uniform heat distribution this affects the adsorbent internal structure and physicochemical properties which might lead to an enhancement in its adsorption capacity towards water pollutants in this regard the current review demonstrates the effect of applying mw heating technology on ac acf ca sa cm and pa surface morphology physicochemical properties and pore structure as well as their adsorption behavior towards water pollutants it is concluded that applying mw heating in adsorbent synthesis greatly enhances the adsorbent pore volume surface area porosity and pore structure compared to conventional heating techniques however mw power should be adjusted accordingly to avoid a collapse in the adsorbent pore structure applying mw heating might cause the absence of some surface functional groups for carbon based materials compared to conventionally synthesized adsorbents as demonstrated by several authors in addition mw heating reduces the aggregation of adsorbent sheets and reduces the cavities which allows more trapping of pollutant molecules the use of mw heating in polymers synthesis results in less densely packed structure but it might decrease its thermal stability at high temperature also microwave heating might increase silica adsorbent purity which enhances its quality and its adsorptive performance for all adsorbents reported in this review the synthesis time was effectively reduced for hours to minutes with a reduction in energy consumption which decreases the adsorbent production cost the adsorption capability of mw synthesized adsorbent might be two times larger than conventionally synthesized adsorbent adsorption capability which is mainly related to the enhancement in the adsorbent pore structure the isotherm data were well described by langmuir isotherm model suggesting a monolayer adsorption while the kinetics data fitted to pso model which suggest that chemisorption process for the same type of adsorbent prepared by conventional and mw heating technique for the removal of the same water pollutant the data were fitted to the same isotherm and kinetic model this suggests that the adsorbent chemistry was not affected yet the pore structure was greatly enhanced which allows more trapping of pollutant molecules however the research articles for direct comparison are still rare and more research should be conducted towards this point despite the fact that mw energy has proven to enhance the adsorbents characteristics including pore structure surface area and pore volume there are challenges in the process of scaling up which needs further research efforts furthermore there are several points that need more attention such as utilization of mw heating in biosynthesis of adsorbents comparison between mw and conventionally synthesized adsorbents in concentrated salt environment and real wastewater investigation on the re generation of mw adsorbents especially for clay adsorbents since it is rarely investigated and address the adsorption mechanism of mw synthesized adsorbents finally more

13525,the use of conventional heating techniques in adsorbents preparation involves long synthesis time high energy consumption high cost and material fast firing recently microwave heating technique has been used to replace or complement the conventional heating in adsorbents preparation as it provides rapid selective and uniform heating consequently the adsorbent microscopic structure and adsorption performance are affected significantly the current review critically investigates the effect of using microwave heating technique on carbon based minerals and polymeric adsorbents morphology surface chemistry and pore structure in addition the adsorption performance of water pollutants using microwave synthesized adsorbents adsorption kinetics and isotherms were included a competitive comparison in terms of adsorbent morphology pore structure and adsorptive behavior between adsorbent prepared by microwave and convention heating technique were discussed finally challenging and promising routes are suggested for future development of microwave prepared adsorbents for water pollutants removal on the basis of this review using microwave technology in adsorbents preparation is promising however further development and investigation are substantially still required abbreviations mw microwave ac activated carbon acf activated carbon fiber ca carbonaceous

order pso pseudo second order keywords microwave heating adsorption activated carbon kinetics isotherm 1 introduction the continued dramatic increase in water pollution levels has become a worldwide concern and a major challenge for governments and industrial sectors the continuation of revealing new industrial technologies with the production of new products and wastes can threaten public health and environment if not managed properly 1 the situation is becoming worse as industrial score continue to discharge toxic and hazardous water pollutants into water bodies without proper treatment 2 to regulate the uncontrollable discharge of wastewater several technologies have been adopted such as membrane 3 biological 4 and electrochemical treatment 5 even though these technologies have proven to be efficient their high operating cost due to high energy consumption limit their application in wastewater treatment 6 another limitation is the membrane s tendency to fouling which reduces its performance in addition membrane cleaning process due to fouling requires a complete process shutdown and involves strong chemicals that may damage the membrane 7 other treatment technologies such as ion exchange chemical precipitation and chemical oxidation are used in wastewater treatment however these technologies are expensive to be implemented on a large scale as well as ineffective for heavy metals removal when the concentration ranges between 1 and 100 mg l 8 9 on the other hand adsorption technology is widely used in wastewater treatment due to its eco friendly nature simple operating mode and high efficiency 10 11 despite the fact that adsorption has a relatively high cost of insulation and maintenance system the cost can be reduced by using low cost adsorbents 12 for this purpose many adsorbents have been proposed and utilized in wastewater treatment processes such as activated carbon 13 carbon fibers 14 clay minerals 15 silica 16 etc solvothermal and sono chemical are well known synthesis methods for adsorbents preparation however they are associated with high energy consumption 17 the selection of the type of energy sources along with the preparation method are important factors as they influence the adsorbents morphology stability physicochemical properties and adsorption capacity 18 the use of conventional heating techniques such as furnace in adsorbents preparation consumes time and energy requires large equipment size and causes improper heating rate which adversely affect the adsorbent stability and morphology 1 this promoted the utilization of microwave mw technology in adsorbents synthesis several review articles have been published focusing on mw concept and heating mechanism 19 the influence of mw heating mode on porous carbon structure and properties 20 and mw industrial application 21 23 the last decade has witnessed an increasing number of research articles regarding mw assisted preparation of adsorbents and their adsorptive behavior towards water pollutants most of the recent articles focus on carbon based minerals and polymeric adsorbents preparation using mw heating technology a detailed investigation on the effect of mw power irradiation time on the activated carbon physical characteristic along with the effect of mw induced method on carbon yield was reviewed 24 the characteristics of mw assisted preparation of activated carbons from biomass sources along with their methylene blue adsorptive capability has been emphasized 25 also the adsorptive capacity and behavior of mw assisted activated carbon derived from biomass wastes towards real industrial wastewater 26 and basic dyes 27 were addressed however the adsorption of water pollutants onto mw assisted activated carbon fibers acf carbonaceous ca silica sa clay minerals cm and polymeric adsorbents pa are also reported in the literature therefore the current review aims to update the literature with the recent development in mw assisted preparation of acs and their adsorptive behavior towards various water pollutants in addition this review includes the adsorption performance of water pollutants by mw assisted synthesis of acf ca sa cm and pa the articles explore the effect of mw irradiation on the adsorbent morphology physicochemical properties and surface characteristics a comparison between mw assisted and conventional adsorbents has been carried out in terms of adsorbent morphology physicochemical characteristics and adsorption capability towards water pollutants finally the article addresses the adsorption isotherms and kinetics models applied to mw adsorbents and they were compared to the applicable models for the same adsorbent prepared by conventional heating towards the same water pollutant 2 adsorption process adsorption is the adhesion of a substrate in a gas or a liquid phase to the adsorbent surface s functional group 28 29 adsorption is a promising technology as it is a sludge free process with a high process efficiency and economical approach 28 29 the applied adsorbents for water pollutants removal include a wide range of carbon based adsorbent cm sa and pa materials an overview of the published articles in the last decade on water pollutants removal using mw synthesized adsorbents show that carbon based adsorbents are the most used followed by polymeric and mineral adsorbents 2 1 carbon based adsorbents carbon based adsorbents including ac acf and ca are widely used for water remediation application carbon based adsorbents vary in their adsorption performance due to their variation in surface area porosity and surface functional groups ac is widely used as an adsorbent in water treatment applications due to its high surface area good mechanical strength reactive surface and high stability 30 32 it is produced from several precursors that results in adsorbents with different properties and adsorption efficiency depending on the nature of the precursors 33 ac can be produced via carbonization and activation techniques 34 35 carbonization involves exposing the carbonaceous substrate to high temperature in the presence of nitrogen gas whereby the activation of ac is achieved by two approaches which are physical activation using oxidative gases such as steam or carbon dioxide or by chemical activation using chemical reagents such as potassium hydroxide potassium carbonate sodium hydroxide zinc chloride phosphoric acid etc ac prepared via physical activation is still a challenge due to its inferior textural properties compared to ac prepared by chemical activated method which possesses high specific surface area and pore volume 36 in addition applying surface modification to ac can potentially enhance its adsorptive performance towards water pollutants surface modification includes surface charge modification in order to increase ac removal affinity towards targeted contaminants 37 acf are microporous materials with negligible mesoporosity which exhibit a well defined porous structure in fibrous form despite the fact that acf shows similar properties to ac such as porosity they exhibit several advantages over ac owing to their structure 38 acfs are produced from different precursors such as polyacrylonitrile pan 39 coal tar pitch 40 petroleum pitch 41 etc similar to ac acf can be produced via carbonization and activation techniques however prior to carbonization a pretreatment is required to improve the yield and the strength of the final product 42 in addition physical and chemical activation are applied to acf the main advantage in activation processes is the removal of disorganized carbon which consequently reflected on the pore distribution the possibility of applying mw irradiation to carbon based materials as a source of energy during the synthesis can potentially reduce the energy consumption synthesis time and can possibly enhance the structure as well as the physicochemical properties 2 2 clay minerals cms fall under the phyllosilicates family in which their structure consists of one or two silica tetrahedral sheets with alumina based octahedral sheets plate like structure 43 phyllosilicates are classified into 1 1 and 2 1 clay mineral based on the ratio of tetrahedral to octahedral sheets in a unit form fig 1 cms including kaolinite 1 1 montmorillonite 2 1 bentonite 2 1 as well as illite 2 1 are utilized in drug delivery hemorrhage inhabitation 44 oil and gas drilling fluids 45 and environmental remediation 46 the utilization of clay minerals in environmental remediation application is owing to its excellent properties including ion exchange capacity high surface area and charged surface and edges 47 these unique characteristics increase clay minerals affinity towards cationic and anionic water pollutants removal from aqueous solutions furthermore cms exhibit swelling characteristics in which their volume and structure increase during the adsorption process which enhances the adsorption process 48 2 3 silica adsorbents sas fall under mesoporous solid materials they possess a high specific surface area with a large internal surface area and attain a high porosity owing to their great characteristics silica materials are utilized in several applications such as gas sensors catalyst support battery electrodes and as adsorbents in water remediation application 50 silica materials in water remediation including silica gels and colloidal silica are used widely as adsorbents owing to their low production cost high specific surface area high chemical purity ease of production and high stability 51 53 in addition silica adsorbents can be modified by adding active groups to increase its affinity towards targeted water pollutants 54 56 2 4 polymeric adsorbents polymers and polymeric composites in water remediation are used as an alternative to many adsorbents such as ac owing to ease of re generation process functionalization and pore size enhancement 57 furthermore polymers offer a flexible geometry and high strength to weight ratio 58 there are several drawbacks of using conventional heating methods in polymeric adsorbents synthesis which leads to the utilization of mw technology instead 59 the major drawbacks of using conventional heating methods in polymeric adsorbents preparation are uncountable reaction rate long reaction time and the contamination of the final products with by products which affects the polymeric adsorbent performance 60 61 molecular imprinting technology mit is a process that has attracted a great deal of attention as it can produce polymers with high selectivity towards the template molecules or ions the process involves the combination of the monomer and template molecules or ions to produce a polymer with particular recognition sites that attracts the template molecules or ions 62 conventional and mw heating methods are applied in polymeric adsorbents and imprinted polymer synthesis in which the heating technique affects the structure as well as the adsorbent adsorptive performance significantly 62 63 3 microwave heating system mw is an electromagnetic radiation that has a wavelength ranging between 1 mm and 1 m and a frequency between 300 mhz to 300 ghz in industrial applications the most common used frequencies for heating purposes are 915 mhz 2 45 ghz 5 8 ghz and 22 125 ghz 64 mw technology has been used in material science and processing including powder synthesis and polymers synthesis 65 67 in particular mw technology as a heating source has been used in adsorbents synthesis instead of conventional heating due to i low energy consumption and processing time ii rapid and simple irradiation process iii uniform temperature throughout the material iv enhanced diffusion process 68 in addition mw energy reduces the risk of overheating that subsequently leads to the material combustion e g ac 69 a schematic diagram of the microwave heating system is shown in fig 2 in conventional heating technique the material surface is heated first followed by the transfer of heat inwards this occurs by heat transfer between objects by conduction convection and radiation whereas in mw heating the material couples with mw and absorbs the electromagnetic energy volumetrically then energy is transformed into heat within the material and then transfers outwards as shown in fig 3 70 as a result the morphology and the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent are enhanced significantly compared to adsorbents prepared by conventional heating techniques 70 72 the mw heating system consists of four basic components as shown in fig 4 which are power supply magnetron applicator and waveguide 64 in this system the material is placed in a metal applicator that varies according to the process specification and heated by mw energy that is directed by the waveguide during the heating process the material is moved through the oven by an insulated conveyor belt for better energy distribution 73 mw heating mechanism can be classified into ionic conduction and dielectric polarization the dielectric polarization heating mechanism is classified into dielectric interfacial electronic atomic and orientation polarization in electrotonic polarization a dipole moment occurs in response to the displacement of the nucleus in a neutral atom with respect to the electrons around it at the molecular level if the nuclei is displaced from different atoms in the molecule it is called atomic polarization interfacial polarization is a combination of conduction and dipolar effect 74 75 meanwhile orientation polarization occurs when the electrical field applied in the equilibrium state of an atom causes the dipoles to align with the electrical field resulting in polarization 76 a deep understanding of the materials dielectric properties is important for the theoretical analysis of the heating process 77 the ability of the material to absorb mw energy depends on the dissipation factor which is the ratio of loss factor to the dielectric constant of the material loss factor is the ability of the material to fritter away mw energy as heat whereas the dielectric constant is associated with the material ability to retain this energy therefore a material with a high loss factor is easily heated by mw energy a material with high conductivity is used as waveguide due to its ability to reflect the microwaves from the surface such as metals 64 78 mw radiation cannot penetrate the conductive materials and thus they are reflected on the other hand absorbing materials can absorb the mw radiation and subsequently they are heated up while the incident waves on insulation materials are partially transmitted materials that can absorb mw radiation are called dielectrics the complex dielectric constant is expressed by 19 1 ε έ j ε έ represents the dielectric constant j equal to 1 0 5 and ε refers to the loss factor the absorbed power by the dielectric materials p 79 2 p σ e r m s 2 where σ is the total effective conductivity and e r m s is the magnitude of the internal electric field the depth of microwave penetration d 79 is 3 d c 2 η f 2 x 1 tan 2 δ 1 0 5 where c is the speed of light and tan δ is the loss tangent that indicate the ability of the material to be heated and it is defined as follows 79 4 tan δ ε έ the quantity of thermal energy absorbed by dielectric material is expressed by 79 5 p d 2 π f ε 0 ε 0 e 0 2 p d is the volumetric energy absorption density f is the frequency e 0 is the magnitude of the electric field from the microwave ε 0 is the permittivity 4 microwave synthesis of adsorbents 4 1 carbon based adsorbents carbon based materials can effectively absorb mw irradiation resulting in adsorbents with excellent physicochemical properties and adsorption capability ac is known for its high adsorption capacity towards organic and inorganic contaminants 80 it has received great attention owing to its excellent properties such as large porous high specific surface area and good thermal stability 1 saucier et al 81 studied the removal of sodium diclofenac dcf and nimesulide nm by microwave assisted activated carbon derived from cocoa shells the study compared the adsorbent morphology and adsorptive behavior obtained from conventional heating method csc and from mw pyrolysis process mwcs it was found that mwcs attained a higher specific surface area for all various inorganic ratios and higher pore volume the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra revealed that the heating source has affected the surface functional groups the major functional groups on csc were oh alcohols phenols co alcohols si o silicates and c h aromatics aliphatic chains on the other hand mwcs attained the same functional groups except si o this indicates that using mw as energy source can significantly affect the surface functional groups which affect the adsorbent selective adsorption since functional groups are responsible for the adsorption process scanning electron microscope sem images showed that the granules of mwcs 1 0 were smaller than csc 1 0 with a spherical appearance as shown in fig 5 besides macro cavities were observed in both adsorbents but csc 1 0 had higher cavities than those of mwcs 1 0 furthermore mwcs was found to have a higher removal efficiency for dcf and nm for all various inorganic ratios mwcs 1 0 attained a removal percentage of 97 05 and 98 75 towards dcf and nm respectively while csc 1 0 attained a removal of 45 23 and 40 25 towards dcf and nm respectively yagmur et al 82 studied the performance of commercial activated carbon derived from coal cac and mw assisted preparation of activated carbon derived from waste tea wt ac and demineralised waste tea dwt ac for phenol and p nitrophenol removal the results revealed that both wt ac and dwt ac attained higher specific surface area and pore volume compared to cac the sem images indicated that similar large voidage were observed in dwt ac and cac unlike wt ac in addition dwt ac attained a higher specific surface area and micropore volume compared to wt ac which could be attributed to the demineralisation process that influenced the textural characteristics of the final wt product this indicates that the type of precursor and the pre treatment process have a vital role in the adsorbent morphology and performance the kinetics data showed that wt ac was capable of removing 99 of p nitrophenol compared to cac that removed around 77 under the same conditions however cac was able to remove a higher percentage of phenol compared to wt ac and dwt ac furthermore the effect of mw re gernetation process on ac specific surface area and pore volume was investigated the mw re generation process involved exposing the adsorbents to mw irradiation for 30 s the results showed that cac surface area increased in the first re gerneation cycle followed by continual decrease until the 5th re gerneration cycle in addition the removal efficiency of cac for phenol for all regerneation cycles was higher than the starting cac this indicates that the regeneration process via microwave technique can enhance ac adsorption ability despite the decrease in specific surface area similarly dwt ac specific surface area was decreased through the regeneration cycles along with an increase in the adsorbent removal capability for wt ac the specific surface area was reduced over the five regeneration cycles however the adsorbent removal capability was increased in the first regeneration cycle followed by a continual decrease until the 5th regeneration cycle in another work ge et al 83 studied the effect of mw irradiation on coal based activated carbon cac under mw power of 300 w mcac 300 500 w mcac 300 and 700 w mcac 300 the sem images indicated that cac exhibits an uneven and rough surface whereas mcac showed an even homogenous and porous structure however mcac 700 w showed a collapse in some porous due to carbon calcination at 700 w the mw irradiation affected the pore volume and specific area in which at 500 w the specific area and pore volume attained the highest values however for all modified activated carbon the specific area and pore volume were higher than cac furthermore the study indicated that mw irradiation had a significant effect on the surface functional group in which the oxygen functional group varied with microwave power as revealed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis the analysis showed that there was a decrease in co group and an increase in co group moreover the analysis of surface basicity and acidity suggested that mcacs experienced an increase in the surface basicity and a decrease in the amount of surface acidic functional groups this could be attributed to the decomposition of acidic groups to co and co2 due to the exposure to mw radiation mcacs showed higher removal efficiency of naphthalene compared to cac but mcac 500w exhibited the highest removal efficiency this indicates that the increase in specific surface area pore volume could be responsible for high removal efficiency similar observation was found by baytar et al 84 where exposing ac to mw irradiation caused the development of a homogenous and even porous structure table 1 summarizes the preparation parameters of mw synthesized acs and their adsorption behavior toward water pollutants acfs have attracted attention in water remediation application due to their lightweight high resistance to corrosion and high stiffness and strength 105 the effect of mw irradiation on the morphology and adsorptive behavior of acf was investigated by several authors foo and hameed 106 studied the morphology and adsorptive behavior of carbonized oil palm char and microwave activated carbon fiber opac the sem images showed that opac showed a more homogeneous even and highly porous structure than char as shown in fig 6 in addition the ftir spectra showed that mw irradiation affected the surface functional groups in which both samples showed the same functional groups except the no2 functional group which was eliminated in opac brunauer emmett teller bet analysis showed that opac attained a higher specific surface area and pore volume compared to char similar observations were reported by huang et al 107 where cavernous pores were clearly observed for mw heated activated carbon fiber macf as indicated by the sem images even though the macf attained a bet surface area less than acf the external surface area and mesopore volume were significantly increased this believed to be responsible for the enhancement in the adsorption capacity of macf compared to acf from 68 3 315 mg g and from 80 2 309 3 mg g towards tetracycline tc and oxytetracycline hydrochloride otc respectively it is possible to functionalize acfs with nanoparticles to enhance the surface morphology and the adsorptive performance for instance chen et al 108 and chen at al 109 studied the removal of as v by mw assisted synthesis of fe2o3 acf and mn3o4 acf respectively both studies confirmed the successful deposition of nanoparticles on acf surface as revealed by x ray powder diffraction xrd and xps analysis the sem images showed a homogeneous deposition of nanoparticles over the acf surface which caused the surface to become coarse the specific surface area and pore volume of both adsorbents were decreased compared to acf the maximum adsorption capacity for as v using fe2o3 acf and mn3o4 acf were 20 33 and 46 10 mg g at 25 respectively whereas acf attained a negligible adsorption capacity it can be observed that the increase in specific surface area did not cause an increase in the adsorption capacity as was observed in ac chen et al 108 reported regarding this matter that there is another surface property that controls the adsorption of arsenic other than the surface area generally the adsorbate chemical structure and its chemistry as well as the adsorbent s intrinsic characteristic are defining criteria for the established relation between the adsorption capacity and the specific surface area 110 table 2 summarizes the preparation parameters of mw synthesized acfs and their adsorption behavior toward water pollutants mw heating can also facilitate the synthesis of cas such as graphene carbon nanotube hydrochar etc several authors have reported the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide and its composites using mw assisted preparation method 112 114 wang et al 113 fabricated reduced graphene oxide titania nanocomposite via microwave assisted reduction mrgo tio2 and direct reduction rgo tio2 of reduced graphene the sem images show that rgo tio2 exhibited a larger and thicker structure compared to mrgo tio2 because of the aggregation of go sheets during the reduction process the aggregation of go sheets is attributed to van der waals and p p interaction between the go sheets for mrgo tio2 the reduction rate of go was accelerated due to the high energy of microwaves that prevented the overlap of rgo sheets furthermore the transmission electron microscopy tem images showed that tio2 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on mrgo surface with a diameter ranging from 10 to 30 nm the nanocomposites were employed for methylene blue removal from aqueous solution the experimental data reveal that mrgo tio2 had higher removal efficiency compared to rgo tio2 which could be attributed to the less aggregation of rgo sheets as a result of using mw heating however mrgo tio2 exhibited less removal efficiency compared to mrgo this is mainly because the spaces that are supposed to trap mb molecules were occupied by tio2 nanoparticles mw heating can facilitate the synthesis of spherical particles from the raw precursor for instance semercioz et al 115 fabricated activated hydrochar from grapefruit peel via mw implemented low temperature hydrothermal carbonization technique for copper ion cu 2 removal the sem revealed that the dried peel surface seemed as an unbroken plane whereas activated hydro char showed open slits and spherical shape bulge forms this structure results in an increase in the total surface area which could enhance the adsorption of cu 2 ions furthermore the maximum adsorption capacity of the hydro char attained a value of 53 06 mg g at 318 k microwave irradiation power and irradiation time are important parameters as they influence the pore size and subsequently affect the adsorbent s adsorption capacity 116 mubarak et al 117 studied the effect of the mw power and mw irritation time on mw assisted carbon nanotubes weight and purity the selection of the optimal conditions mw irradiation power and time was determined by the material high quality with the minimal impurity the results suggested that mw power and irradiation time play a vital role in the carbon nanotubes weight and purity however irradiation time does not control the formation of carbon nanotubes table 3 summarizes the preparation parameters of mw synthesized ca and their adsorption behavior toward water pollutants adsorption experiments usually involve investigating the equilibrium isotherms kinetics and thermodynamic as they are important to describe the interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate and optimizing the adsorption process 118 119 equilibrium isotherms experiments involve the variation of initial solution concentration at fixed time ph and adsorbate dosage initial solution concentration influences the adsorption capacity as it provides the driving force for the mass transfer between the aqueous solution and the adsorbent 120 usually increasing the adsorbate concentration increases the effective collision between the adsorbate and the adsorbent which accelerate the adsorption process for instance gupta et al 121 reported that increasing the initial concentration of cr vi ion from 100 to 500 mg 100 ml enhanced the removal percentage from 23 to 80 along with the adsorption capacity of microwave assisted porous carbon however increasing the cr vi initial concentration from 500 to 900 mg 100 ml did not cause any further increase in porous carbon adsorption capacity nor the removal percentage this is because the vacant sites became fully occupied with cr vi ions the adsorption kinetics are important as it reveals the rate at which the contaminants are removed from the aqueous solution by the adsorbents the adsorption kinetics can be carried out by varying the contact time between the adsorbent and the adsorbate at fixed parameters usually increasing the contact time between the adsorbent and the adsorbate enhances the removal rate of containment until equilibrium is reached adsorbent dosage is an important parameter to study as it determines the adsorbent efficiency and the cost of the adsorbent per unit produced water to be treated generally the removal percentage increases as the adsorbent dosage increases due to the availability of adsorption sites chen et al 109 studied the effect of adsorbent dosage on arsenic as v removal results revealed that the concentration of as v decreased steadily as the adsorbent dosage increased from 0 2 to 0 8 g l after that no remarkable change in as v concentration for any further increase in the dosage was observed generally high adsorbent concentration can reach equilibrium rapidly due to the availability of adsorption sites while low adsorbent concentration attained equilibrium in a longer time this indicates that the contact time has a great influence on the adsorption process the solution ph does not have a defined effect on the adsorption behavior of adsorbents this is because the solution ph regulates the adsorbent surface charge and the adsorbate ionization degree in an aqueous solution the adsorbent s surface charge is regulated by the association and dissociation of the adsorbent surface functional group this determines the affinity of surface charge for electrostatic interaction and the reactive sites for chemical interactions for instance gupta et al 122 where the removal capability of toxaphene using mw assisted mno2 cellulose fiber in ph ranging from 1 to 9 the results revealed that the removal percentage increased up to ph value of 3 then decreased as the ph was increased the ph corresponds to the point of zero net charge phpznc found to be 4 5 this implies that at a ph lower than 4 5 mno2 cellulose fiber becomes positively charged and at a ph higher than 4 5 it becomes negatively charged subsequently at ph lower than 3 toxaphene can be easily bound on its anionic form to mno2 cellulose fiber in another case the adsorption of methylene blue by mw assisted reduced graphene titania nanocomposite attained removal percentage of 98 at ph 11 compared to 75 at ph 4 113 therefore it is crucial to study the effect of solution ph on the adsorption performance for each type of adsorbate temperature could potentially be the controlling factor in the adsorption process as it enhances the diffusion rate of the adsorbate in the adsorbent internal pores and across the external boundary layer 123 furthermore the equilibrium capacity of the adsorbent is highly affected by the changes in the temperature as it influences the tendency of deaggregation 124 this fact is confirmed by several studies where changes in temperature resulted in different adsorption capacities 113 115 125 temperature effect on the equilibrium capacity is controlled by the thermodynamic behavior of the adsorption process with the elevation of temperature the adsorption capacity decreases for exothermic process while the adsorption capacity increases for endothermic process 126 127 thus there is the possibility of enhancing the pore structure and the morphology of the ac by mw radiation however in some cases a collapse in the pores could happen with the rise in the mw power leading to a decrease in the pore volume therefore it is important to observe the effect of mw power and irradiation time on ac internal pore structure furthermore some studies showed that mw irradiated ac showed the absence of some functional groups compared to ac prepared by conventional methods this indicates that the adsorption capacity is affected since functional groups are responsible for the adsorption process similar behaviors were observed on mw assisted preparation of acfs where the pore volume mesoporous structure and surface functional groups were highly affected by mw irradiation the use mw assisted preparation method can facilitate the uniform distribution of nanoparticles over a carbonaceous support surface in addition it can also reduce the aggregation of graphene sheets which could potentially enhance the adsorption capacity 4 2 polymer based adsorbents polymeric composites have an important role in industry due to their wide range of applications including water remediation application that utilizes polymeric materials as adsorbents the quality of polymeric structure is strongly affected by the process synthesis parameters such as temperature and curing time 137 the non uniform temperature distribution during polymer processing and the variation in curing method may result in defects in the polymer integrity which are introduced as contaminates or voids during the bonding process 137 consequently a rapid controllable curing process with a high depth of penetration is required to minimize the defects in the polymer integrity which can be achieved via mw heating technique instead of conventional heating techniques 138 owing to the high energy efficiency provision of high penetration depth and the reduction in the cure time mw heating process is widely used in polymeric adsorbents synthesis which could impose notable economic merits 139 several authors studied the use of mw irradiation as an alternative energy source for polymer based adsorbents synthesis masinga et al 140 compared the morphology and the adsorptive behavior of b cyclodextrin n doped carbon nanotube polyurethane nanocomposite n cnts b cd synthesized by conventional and microwave heating techniques it was found that the mw preparation of n cnts b cd reduced the synthesis time compared to conventional method from 24 h to 10 min a visual observation revealed that n cnts b cd synthesized using mw was soft and powdery whereas n cnts b cd composite prepared using conventional heating technique was in granular form and attained a coarse like structure in addition the mw synthesized composite was less densely packed and have high surface area compared to conventional prepared composite which allowed more pollutants to be trapped the adsorption experiment using both composite showed that mw synthesized composite had higher removal capability of nitrophenol even at ng l pollutant concentration thermogravimetric analysis tga revealed that mw synthesized n cnts b cd composite attained a slight shift in the decomposition however due to the use of low temperature in water purification it is not expected to be an issue furthermore the ftir analysis showed that both composites showed identical surface functional groups these results indicate that mw irradiation does not affect the polymer s surface functional group but it did affect the surface morphology and the adsorbent adsorptive capability a recent study by deng et al 141 confirmed that using mw irradiation for phosphorylated fiber panmw phos preparation reduced the reaction time from 6 to 1 h and increased the grafting ratio compared to conventional methods the sem images revealed that crackles were observed on the surface of panmw phos however the inner molecular chain of the pan fiber was not broken and the modification reaction was on the surface of pan matrix the adsorptive behavior of panmw phos was two times higher than pancv phos obtained from conventional heating techniques besides the adsorption capability of panmw phos remained constant for five cycles of reuse the sem images showed that there were no significant changes in the morphology after five regeneration cycles which proves the good stability of microwave synthesized pan phos yet some crackles were observed on the surface of the fiber fig 7 shows the sem edx images of pan panmw phos and panmw phos after u vi adsorption the figure clearly shows crackles that appeared on the surface of panmw phos yet the inner molecular chain of pan fiber was preserved fig 7b after one adsorption cycle of u vi no significant changes in the surface morphology of panmw phos were observed fig 7c however after five times of regeneration crackles appeared on the surface of panmw phos but its integrity was preserved the same fact was reflected in another study conducted by qu et al 142 where the functionalization of cellulose using mw heating technique was achieved in 6 5 min furthermore the adsorbent showed an adsorption capacity of 295 20 mg g 151 51 mg g and 72 89 mg g for pb ii cd ii and ni ii respectively in addition the composite was generated for 5 cycles with slight decline in the removal efficiency on the other hand the conventionally functionalized cellulose attained a removal capacity of 139 94 mg g 133 85 mg g and 49 75 mg g for pb ii cd ii and ni ii respectively this confirms that using mw heating in polymeric absorbent functionalization can enhance the adsorbent adsorption capacity significantly compared to conventional functionalization technique several authors addressed the number of re generation cycles of mw induced polymeric adsorbents for instance zhang et al 143 studied the removal of lead pb ii by mw assisted nano tio2 cellulose nanocomposite the results indicated that the composite attained a slightly constant removal percentage of 93 for 5 cycles this indicates that the composite is rich in active sites which enhances the removal of pb 2 from the aqueous solution table 4 summarizes the preparation parameters of mw synthesized pa and their adsorption behavior toward water pollutants thus using mw heating technique in polymers functionalized and processing promotes a rapid controllable curing process with high depth of penetration which enhances the adsorbent physiochemical properties and thus enhances its uptake capacity furthermore the use of mw irradiation in polymeric adsorbents synthesis could result in less densely packed structure thus increasing the polymeric adsorbent surface area one of the main drawbacks is that mw synthesized polymeric adsorbents can have lower thermal stability at high temperature compared to conventional ones however this is not expected to be a drawback since water remediation technologies do not involve high temperature systems finally the adsorption capacity and the number of re generation cycles can potentially increase for mw synthesized polymeric adsorbents compared to conventionally synthesized adsorbents as confirmed by several authors 4 3 mineral adsorbents 4 3 1 silica silica adsorbents have attracted a great deal of attention in water remediation application as they are rich with adsorption sites and attain a highly porous structure 154 several studies have demonstrated the enhancement in silica adsorbents morphology using mw heating instead of conventional heating techniques for example peres et al 155 compared the performance and the characteristics of silica nanoparticles produced from the conventional synthesis process n sio2 and mw process mw nsio2 for methylene blue dye removal the results revealed that nsio2 and mw sio2 attained the same xrd and ftir spectra which indicates that mw irradiation did not result in new chemical bonds formation or destruction even though nsio2 and mw nsio2 attained a mesoporous structure mw nsio2 had a higher pore volume surface area porosity and average pore diameter furthermore it was found that mw nsio2 had higher purity compared to nsio2 which suggests that mw heating technique can increase the adsorbent quality comparing the maximum adsorption capacity for both nanoparticles mw nsio2 attained a higher adsorption capacity this is mainly because of the higher surface area and pore volume that mw nsio2 attains compared to nsio2 kenawy et al 156 reported the synthesis of silica nanoparticles modified by thioglycolic acid mcm 41 tga using mw heating technique for cd ii and hg ii removal the study showed that silica was successfully functionalized under mw irradiation of 600 w for 5 min only and resulted in the formation of co and sh vibrating groups of the thioglycolic moiety in addition mcm 41 tga attained a lower surface area compared to mobil crystalline of material 41 mcm 41 due to the functionalization process despite that the adsorption experiment shows that mcm 41 tga had an excellent adsorption capacity towards cd ii and hg ii and an excellent desorption cycles as it can be utilized for at least 10 cycles without a decline in the adsorption efficiency 156 in another study mahmoud et al 157 utilized mw irradiation in nanosilica functionalization by salicylic acid n si sa and succinic acid n si su for heavy metals removal both materials were exposed to mw irradiation for 2 min under a power of 800 w the ftir spectra confirmed the formation of new bonds as a result of the functionalization process furthermore the sem images revealed that n si sa and n si su sorbents were brighter and smoother compared to n si sorbent n si su attained the higher surface area followed by n si and n si sa the removal of heavy metals cd ii hg ii and pb ii using the functionalized nanosilica were examined by carrying out the adsorption experiment using mw enforced sorption mes technique for 15 s at 800 w the results showed that the adsorption capacities for these metals using n si sa were higher than n si su even though n si sa had a lower surface area in addition comparing these results to the study carried by kenawy et al 156 for hg ii and cd ii removal using mcm 41 tga it is noticed that the adsorption capacities were higher for hg ii and cd ii removal using n si sa and n si su this could be due to the using of mes technique which implies that mw radiation can be used to accelerate and enhance the adsorption process table 5 summarizes the preparation parameters of mw synthesized sa and their adsorption behavior toward water pollutants thus mw irradiation can be used in silica nanoparticles synthesis and functionalization which can be achieved in a few minutes mw heating technique can potentially increase the adsorbent pore volume surface area porosity and average pore diameter compared to conventional heating techniques consequently it can enhance the adsorption of water pollutants adsorbents prepared by mw heating technique could have higher purity compared to conventional ones which enhances the adsorbent quality in addition silica nanoparticles were successfully functionalized under mw irradiation in few minutes the functionalized nanosilica had an excellent performance in removing heavy metals in aqueous solutions however the effect of using mw heating technique to functionalize nanosilica was not compared to the functionalization process using conventional heating techniques therefore it is difficult to state whether the adsorption capacity was enhanced due to functionalization or due to the effect of mw irradiation on the silica adsorbent morphology lastly the mes technique could potentially increase the removal of heavy metals compared to conventional adsorption method 4 3 2 clays mw assisted synthesis of clay adsorbents has been reported for the adsorption of dyes 159 162 heavy metals 163 164 pharmaceutical pollutants 165 inorganic pollutants 166 and organic pollutants 167 table 6 lists the preparation parameters of mw synthesized cm and their adsorption behavior toward water pollutants fabryanty et al 162 studied the removal of crystal violet dye using microwave assisted bentonite alginate composite with different bentonite to sodium alginate ratio the synthesis process involved stirring of the bentonite and sodium alginate mixture for 3 h followed by irradiating the mixture at 700 w for 90 s the ftir analysis confirmed the formation of bentonite alginate composite furthermore it was found that changing the alginate to bentonite ratio did not affect the surface functional group but it did affect the degree of crystallinity as was observed from the xrd patterns the sem images showed the formation of porous structure for 3b 5a and 2b 5a adsorbents in addition it was observed that decreasing the bentonite amount caused a reduction in the composite specific surface area and pore volume in another study barakanet al 163 compared between feal12 polyoxocations intercalated nano bentonite adsorbent prepared by conventional and one step ultrasonic mw irradiation methods for arsenic removal different ratios of bentonite to fe 3 and al 3 were investigated however the conventional preparation technique was performed to one composite that had 2 wt of bentonite pb1 whereas the ultrasonic mw irradiation method was applied for 60 wt of bentonite pb2 and to other composites under different precursor composition pb3 and pb4 the conventional synthesis process consumed around 24 h while ultrasonic mw irradiation method consumed a total of 29 min the ftir analysis revealed that both composites attain the same functional groups furthermore the mw irradiated composites showed higher surface area pore volume and high mesoporous structure with low blocked pores compared to pb1 the adsorption experiments revealed that pb2 attained the best adsorption performance for as v among the other adsorbents above all the synthesis time was effectively reduced from 24 h to only 29 min even under high bentonite concentration similar findings were addressed by laysandra et al 159 their study confirmed the formation of bentonite titanium dioxide nanocomposite btc by the effect of mw irradiation in 10 min under 700 w which is less than the time required to synthesis the same nanocomposite by conventional method that consumed 12 h 168 mw heating technique can also be used in bentonite silylation applications mw irradiation provides a rapid heating which is expected to enhance the silylation process 169 in a recent work silylation of bentonite using different polar and non polar solvents using mw heating was investigated 160 the results showed that bentonite silylation using mw irradiation was achieved in 5 min with a high degree of functionalization with non polar solvents the rapid heating rate that mw heating technique provides enhances the reaction rate and the degree of functionalization similar to bentonite several authors used mw heating technique to fabricate montmorillonite modification by surfactants and co polymers for water pollutants removal 161 164 167 it was found that mw heating reduced the synthesis time and resulted in montmorillonite based adsorbents with high adsorption capability in addition it is more likely that specific surface area and pore size distribution are more related to the type and the quantity of the modifiers and to the synthesis method thus mw heating technique can effectively reduce clay minerals adsorbents synthesis time from hours to few minutes the resulting adsorbents can potentially attain a higher surface area pore volume and a mesoporous structure compared to adsorbents prepared by conventional heating technique even at high precursor concentration mw is still effective and can successfully produce highly efficient adsorbents for most of the studies the adsorption was strongly ph dependent which suggests the contribution of the surface complexation mechanism table 7 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of using mw heating in absorbents preparation 5 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherm models describe the interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate at a constant temperature isotherms models also indicate the equilibrium stage of an adsorption process and evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity attained by an adsorbent at constant temperature 173 174 the isotherms models are fitted to the equilibrium data based on different assumptions langmuir and freundlich models are the most common isotherms that fit the equilibrium data langmuir model suggests that the adsorption occurs on a homogeneous surface on identical sites through monolayer adsorption without any interaction between the adsorbate molecules the model also assumes that the adsorption sites are energetically identical and each binding site adsorb only one molecule 175 the langmuir model is described by eq 6 6 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e where c e the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate mg l q e amount of adsorbate per unit mass of adsorbent at equilibrium mg g q m the monolayer adsorption capacity mg g k l l mg langmuir constant related amount of adsorption freundlich model assumes a multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous surface and active sites with different energies 176 the model is described by eq 7 7 q e k f c e 1 n where c e the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate mg l q e amount of adsorbate per unit mass of adsorbent mg g k f constant related to the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent mg g and n describes the intensity of the adsorption process in order to reduce the error between the experimental data and the predicted equilibrium data toth model was suggested as an empirical modification of langmuir model 177 temkin isotherm assumes a chemisorption process that involves an electrostatic interaction 178 further a combination of langmuir and freundlich isotherm model is represented by liu model 179 while neglecting the monolayer assumption stated by langmuir model and the finite adsorption assumption stated by freundlich liu model is described by eq 8 8 q e q m a x k g c e n l 1 k g c e n l where k g is a liu equilibrium constant l mg nl is a dimensionless exponent q m a x is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g sips model is a combination of the langmuir and freundlich model the model predicts the langmuir model at high adsorbate concentration while it predicts freundlich model at low adsorbate concentration 180 sips model is described by eq 9 9 q e k s c e b s 1 a s c e b s where b s is the sips exponent k s is the sips isotherm model constant l g a s sips isotherm model constant l g the adsorption equilibrium studies comply with the langmuir model around 69 23 which assumes a monolayer adsorption process xiao et al 181 reported that the removal of cr vi ion by poluacrylonitrille fiber loaded with carbon dots synthesized under mw irradiation is best described by langmuir model where the correlation factor r2 exhibits a value of 0 9989 meanwhile the freundlich model was used to fit the adsorption data but the correlation factor was lower than the fitting obtained from the langmuir model the freundlich model fitted around 23 08 of the adsorption equilibrium data zhang et al 143 studied the removal of pb ii by microwave synthesized nanotio2 cellulose the correlation factor r2 reveals that freundlich most is the best fit model that describes the adsorption process of pb ii compared to langmuir correlation factor r2 thereby the assumption that the adsorption takes place on a heterogeneous surface is valid liu model is the third that fits the adsorption data by 4 62 thue et al 88 investigated the removal of phenol using microwave assisted activated carbon the results reveal that the adsorption data best fit liu isotherme model with r2 0 9996 for all the four adsorbents sips model comes in the last place where it was applicable for only 3 08 of the adsorption cases for instance the adsorption of dbt on mw assisted carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofiber is well described by sips isotherm model 129 it wasobserved that the equilibrium adsorption model for conventional and microwaveassisted preparation of adsorbents for the same pollutant is described by thesame isotherm model for instance baytar et al 84 reported that the equilibrium data for mw assisted ac from sunflower seed husk for methylene blue removal was best described by langmuir isotherm model similar conclusion was suggest by salman et al 182 where langumir isotherm model best fitted activated carbon derived from sunflower seed husk equilibrium data for methylene blue removal similarly it was found that silica nanoparticles prepared by conventional and mw for methylene blue removal followed the same isotherm model sips model 155 also activated carbon fiber from cotton prepared by conventional and microwave methods best fitted langumir isotherm model 42 183 in addition the equilibrium data for montmorillonite prepared by conventional and microwave methods for triclosan removal followed the langmuir 167 184 consequently the interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate does not vary according to the heating method applied to the adsorbent yet the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent significantly changes however more research should be directed to address the difference between mw assisted and conventional adsorbents interaction with the same water pollutant under same chemical and physical conditions 6 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics are vital in determining the rate at which the contaminant is removed from a solution by the adsorbent at constant temperature in addition adsorption kinetic models e g intra particle diffusion model can identify the adsorption controlling step 29 the most commonly used kinetics models are pseudo first order pfo 185 pseudo second order pso 186 and intra particle diffusion model 187 among these models pso is the most common model that fitted the adsorption results by around 83 93 for water pollutant removal using mw synthesized adsorbents the model confirms a chemisorption process that involves covalent bonding or ion exchange for instance the removal of as v using fe2o3 activated carbon fibers and mn3o4 activated carbon fibers found to follow pso kinetics model 108 109 in another study the removal of as v by multiwall carbon nanotube followed pfo 125 pfo model is the second model that successfully fits the adsorption data by around 12 5 for mw assisted preparation of adsorbents the model assumes that the adsorption rate depends on the deviation of the instant adsorbent amount from the saturation value for instance the adsorption data of methylene blue by ac was better described by pfo kinetic model 84 in another study the adsorption of methylene blue onto reduced graphene oxide titania nanocomposite followed pso kinetic model 113 pfo 185 and pso 186 kinetic models can be described by eq 10 and 11 respectively 10 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 11 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q e the amount of adsorbed at equilibrium mg g q t the amount of adsorbed at time t mg g t time of contact min k 1 pseudo first order rate constant min 1 k 2 pseudo second order rate constant g mg min intra particles diffusion model 187 is an important model since it describes the multistep adsorption process involved in the adsorption process intra particles diffusion model can be described by eq 14 14 q t k i d t 0 5 c where t is the time k i d is the rate constant in mg g min0 5 and c is the boundary thickness intra particles diffusion model was used to describe the adsorption process for mw synthesis of adsorbents for instance khasri et al 188 used an intra particle diffusion model to describe the complex adsorption steps involved in methylene blue adsorption onto activated carbon the results revealed that the adsorption process involves three main steps rapid diffusion intra particle diffusion and final equilibrium the first stage involves the diffusion of methylene blue molecules to the external surface of activated carbon with a diffusion rate k1 the diffusion in this step is instantaneous due to the strong electrostatic interaction between the methylene blue molecules and the adsorbent outer surface the second stage is a gradual smooth transition from stage 1 to stage 2 in this step methylene blue molecules penetrate through the inner layers the final stage is the equilibrium diffusion stage in which diffusion through the interior layers start to occur slowly with a diffusion rate k2 the influence of the boundary layer is represented by c if c does not pass through the zero point the intra particles diffusion is not the only rate limiting step in addition the numerical value of c indicates the thickness of the boundary layer the greater value of c the more influence the boundary layer has on the diffusion process similar to isotherms models adsorbents prepared by conventional and mw assisted methods were best described by the same model for the same type of pollutant for instance pseudo n order and hsdm kinetics models were both adequate to describe the kinetics of methylene blue removal by conventional and mw assisted silica nanoparticles 155 similarly the kinetics of methylene blue by microwave assisted and conventional activated carbon fiber was best described by pso 42 183 this indicates that using mw as a heating source in adsorbents preparation did not change the adsorbent s nature but it enhanced its surface morphology and internal structure which might enhance the adsorption process however the data for direct comparison are still rare and more research should be directed towards that 7 conclusion and future remarks the unique features of mw heating render its applicability to replace or complement conventional heating for adsorbents synthesis unlike conventional heating mw heating occurs inside the material and moves outwards leading to faster temperature increase uniform heat distribution this affects the adsorbent internal structure and physicochemical properties which might lead to an enhancement in its adsorption capacity towards water pollutants in this regard the current review demonstrates the effect of applying mw heating technology on ac acf ca sa cm and pa surface morphology physicochemical properties and pore structure as well as their adsorption behavior towards water pollutants it is concluded that applying mw heating in adsorbent synthesis greatly enhances the adsorbent pore volume surface area porosity and pore structure compared to conventional heating techniques however mw power should be adjusted accordingly to avoid a collapse in the adsorbent pore structure applying mw heating might cause the absence of some surface functional groups for carbon based materials compared to conventionally synthesized adsorbents as demonstrated by several authors in addition mw heating reduces the aggregation of adsorbent sheets and reduces the cavities which allows more trapping of pollutant molecules the use of mw heating in polymers synthesis results in less densely packed structure but it might decrease its thermal stability at high temperature also microwave heating might increase silica adsorbent purity which enhances its quality and its adsorptive performance for all adsorbents reported in this review the synthesis time was effectively reduced for hours to minutes with a reduction in energy consumption which decreases the adsorbent production cost the adsorption capability of mw synthesized adsorbent might be two times larger than conventionally synthesized adsorbent adsorption capability which is mainly related to the enhancement in the adsorbent pore structure the isotherm data were well described by langmuir isotherm model suggesting a monolayer adsorption while the kinetics data fitted to pso model which suggest that chemisorption process for the same type of adsorbent prepared by conventional and mw heating technique for the removal of the same water pollutant the data were fitted to the same isotherm and kinetic model this suggests that the adsorbent chemistry was not affected yet the pore structure was greatly enhanced which allows more trapping of pollutant molecules however the research articles for direct comparison are still rare and more research should be conducted towards this point despite the fact that mw energy has proven to enhance the adsorbents characteristics including pore structure surface area and pore volume there are challenges in the process of scaling up which needs further research efforts furthermore there are several points that need more attention such as utilization of mw heating in biosynthesis of adsorbents comparison between mw and conventionally synthesized adsorbents in concentrated salt environment and real wastewater investigation on the re generation of mw adsorbents especially for clay adsorbents since it is rarely investigated and address the adsorption mechanism of mw synthesized adsorbents finally more studies should be carried out to understand the microscopic effect of mw on molecular systems to develop and or enhance the separation technologies declaration of competing interest the authors

13526,water pollution from the discharge of wastewater containing toxic heavy metals such as cadmium cd to the natural water bodies is one of the biggest problem affecting humanity different technologies such as sorption membrane filtration etc have been used to remove heavy metal from the polluted water in this work the effects of operational parameters on the ability of the submerged membrane adsorption hybrid system smahs to remove cd2 from synthetic wastewater using dried aphanothece sp a15 as a suspended biosorbent was evaluated this biomass originates from a cyanobacterium was cultivated in a photobioreactor system enriched with 15 of co2 the operational parameters investigated were filtration flux biomass dosage frequency of replacing biosorbent and initial metal concentration of the various parameters the filtration flux and the initial concentration of cd were the most influential parameters concerning biosorption efficiency in this study more than 95 removal of cd was achieved with initial cd concentration of 4 89 mg l at a filtration flux of 20 l m2 h the highest biosorption capacity 112 89 mg g was obtained with a flux of 60 l m2 h the biosorbent became saturated after 20 h of operation without biosorbent replacement this suggests that the dried biomass of aphanothece sp a15 has the potential to be implemented in the industrial wastewater treatment plant using smahs processes integrated within the co2 bio sequestration unit therefore cadmium removal from wastewater can be coupled with the reduction of co2 emissions from flue gas keywords heavy metal cyanobacterium membrane adsorption system integrated wastewater treatment 1 introduction aquatic pollution due to the presence of heavy metals is serious environmental problems cadmium cd lead pb and mercury hg are widely used for industrial processes 1 when toxic metals enter the natural aquatic food chain it has the potential to become unsafe for human consumption consequently these toxic elements have directly been consumed by diverse aquatic species furthermore cadmium toxicity has numerous detrimental effects on human health for example cancer teratogenic disease rheumatoid arthritis etc therefore implementing effective and advanced treatment processes are required to prevent cd discharge into the aquatic environments 2 6 although many anthropogenic activities e g municipalities industries communities produced wastewater containing cd strict regulations have been implemented all over the world to protect the aquatic environment from cd toxicity the concentration of cd in discharged water before entering open water source is 0 05 mg l 7 conversely the concentration of cd in the wastewater produced from different industries such as plating plant mining plastic paint ceramics etc ranging from 10 to 100 mg l 8 9 hence a suitable cost effective treatment process is required to reduce the cadmium concentration below 0 05 mg l 10 12 the existing technologies such as filtration sorption complexation precipitation coagulation ion exchange etc could effectively remove toxic metals but have several drawbacks such as generate toxic sludge chemical intensive and have unpredictable removal performance 8 13 14 in this regard the biosorption method using dried biosorbent derived from microalgae biomass for removing cd from wastewater became prefer process because its effectiveness and simplicity this method is also considered as a cost effective technology macroalgae such as the seaweed ulva lactuta red seaweed jania rubens red seaweed pterocladia capillacea resulted biosorption capacity of 28 32 mg g 15 16 moreover biosorbent produced from cyanobacteria macrocystis pyrifera anabaena sphaerica and aphanothece sp showed sorption capacities of 60 100 mg g 2 17 18 the results mentioned above indicated that the sorption capacity of biosorbent produced from microalgae is higher than that of biosorbent derived from hazelnut shells 5 42 mg g peat 22 5 mg g and aquatic moss 28 mg g 19 21 the higher biosorption capacity of microalgae based biosorbent is originated from the functional moieties which adhere to the biosorbent surface and in turn act as active sites for adsorption biosorption using dried biosorbent made from microalgae also offers easier metal recovery through simple technologies such as using acid sorbents and concentrated by electrolysis or precipitation 1 22 23 usually the biosorption or sorption is done using a filtration column and the effluent from the column need to be treated further using membrane based tertiary technology for reuse this means to produced potable water from contaminated water two separate processes are used however the implementation of a submerged membrane adsorption hybrid system smahs offers in combining filtration and membrane separation process in a single operation the main disadvantage of smahs is high cost for installation and fouling of the membrane however these can be further reduced by using a low cost biosorbent with high biosorption capacity 24 25 from the literature it is found that hybrid proceed showed good performance in the removing of organic and inorganic contaminants from water and wastewater for example vigneswaran et al 26 reported 83 89 removal of organic carbon using a hybrid system of powdered carbon active pac and polyethylene hydrophilic membrane they also reported that pre adsorption of organics onto the pac reduced membrane fouling and maintained stable permeate flux furthermore johir et al 27 28 reported 85 removal of phosphate using the membrane adsorption hybrid system mahs using ion exchange resin and zirconium iv hydroxide in another study kalaruban et al studied nitrate removal from synthetic wastewater using smahs combined with biosorbent of amine grafted corn cob they reported a maximum adsorption capacity of 49 9 mg n g and 75 3 mg n g when using ion exchange resin of dowex fe 26 30 the main objective of this study is to assess the performance of smahs in removing cd using biosorbent derived from aphanothece sp a cyanobacterium and denoted as aphanothecea15 the performance of smahs was evaluated by varying filtration flux cd concentrations and the frequency of the replacement for biosorbent these results presented in this study can help us to understand and design continuous membrane absorption systems for the removal of cd effectively from wastewater 2 experimental procedure and materials 2 1 biosorbent biosorbent was made from dried biomass of aphanothece sp a wild strain isolate collection of the bioprocess engineering microbiology laboratory bandung institute of technology aphanothece sp was previously cultivated in a photobioreactor pbr system for 14 days under a cool white fluorescent light of 5700 6000 lux in bg 11 medium see detail in electronic annex the pbr system was fed with air flow rate of 3 l min enriched with co2 15 the use of a co2 enriched air helped to increase the binding ability of the dried biosorbent with cd2 ion after dewatering the harvested biomass was dried using an oven at 60 c for 7 days the dry biomass was sieved using no 45 354 μm and no 200 74 μm sieves to obtain the desired particle size of the biosorbent finally the obtained biosorbent aphanothece a 15 was stored in a desiccator for further experiment the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area of the obtained dried biomass of aphanothece sp was 1 735 m2 g and the micro and mesopore size was 0 3 and 27 2 nm the ftir analysis revealed that the surface of the biosorbent contains carboxyl hydroxyls sulfhydryl amides and amines functional groups which serve as active binding sites the surface precipitation of cd 2 on the biosorbent and ionic exchange mechanism revealed from scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray edx was presented in the previous study 18 2 2 experimental set up the set up of the smahs process used in this study is presented in fig 1 the reactor made of acrylic having the dimension of 12 cm 10 cm 40 cm and had a working volume of 3 5 l a hollow fiber polyvinylidene pvdf membrane manufactured by dow chemicals pte ltd usa consisting of 19 fibers in a bundle 20 cm length inner diameter of 0 7 mm outer diameter of 1 2 mm the pore size of 0 08 μm and surface area of 0 01443 m2 was used the membrane module was submerged into the reactor filled with 3 5 l of synthetic wastewater followed by the addition of biosorbent of aphanothece sp pumps were used to feed the influent into the reactor and to withdrawal effluent from the reactor at a constant flux of 20 40 and 60 l m2 h the transmembrane pressure tmp was measured continuously using a pressure transducer wiebrock germany to determine the effect of biosorbent replacement frequency and percentage mass replacement of biosorbent initially 0 1 g l 0 35 g of biosorbent was added into the reactor the biosorbent replacement frequency experiment was done one time biosorbent withdrawal at 180 min and two times biosorbent withdrawal at 120 and 240 min during the operation period of 360 min meanwhile the percentage mass replacement of biosorbent was conducted for 180 min after operation by removing 10 20 and 30 of the initial biosorbent mass this was then replaced with new biosorbent mass and equal withdrawal volume of water the initial concentration of cd varied at 0 71 2 49 and 4 89 mg l whilst cd concentration of 8 6 mg l was used for the saturation study of the biosorbent cleaning of the membrane was conducted for 2 h using 0 4 naocl solution before placing the membrane in the reactor chamber system stabilization letting demineralized water flow circulated in the whole system was conducted for 30 min before commencing the experiment following the rinsing process using demineralized water testing on cd removal using smahs both without and added dried biosorbent were conducted for convincing the effectiveness of dried biosorbent in the process it was found that cd removal efficiency increased two times higher when biosorbent aphanothece sp a15 was added compared to cd removal efficiency when only implement submerged membrane solely electronic annex 2 3 feed solution the synthetic wastewater containing cd for feed solution was prepared by diluting the stock solution of cdcl22 5h2o 100 mg l with demineralized water to produce working concentrations of 0 71 2 49 4 89 and 8 6 mg l the cadmium salt was obtained from m b chemical the ph of the feed solutions was adjusted at 8 using 1 m kh2po4 and 1 m naoh solution purchased from merck germany hitachi z 2700 graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer japan was used for analyzing the cd concentration in the feed and effluent the detection limit was 0 01 μg l and the coefficient of variance for ten identical samples was within 2 5 significance of changes in the smahs performance during the varied operating conditions was assessed by conducting independent t test statistical significance was set at p 0 05 using sigmaplot10 systat software inc usa 2 4 calculation the amount of total cd in feeding solution cd input as

sp a cyanobacterium was used as the adsorbent in smahs usually cyanobacterium contains more numerous functional groups amides amines carboxyl hydroxyls sulfhydryl on their surface which make them more capable of binding heavy metal cations compare to other phyla of microalgae cyanobacteria is suitable for growing in a photobioreactor system coupled with the wastewater treatment for obtaining biomass 31 32 the photobioreactor system containing cyanobacteria can also be used as the tool for carbon dioxide co2 bio fixer combined with the production of biosorbent obtained biosorbent from the photobioreactor was converted into dried biosorbent the advantage of using a smahs includes requirements for a small amount of biosorbent requirement which result in a smaller footprint while allowing maximum removal of cd from wastewater 3 1 effect of filtration flux on smahs performances the influence of filtration flux was studied by varying the filtration flux in the range of 20 60 l m2 h the filtration flux had little effect on the removal efficiency of cd2 but more impact on sorption capacity fig 2 and electronic annex as filtration flux increased three times 20 60 l m2 h the sorption capacity increased by1 6 times from 69 83 112 89 mg g therefore biosorption capacity of cd2 ions using aphanothece sp using this smahs configuration correlated with the permeate flux although higher filtration flux of 60 l m2 h provided the highest sorption capacity of 112 89 mg g but resulted in higher membrane fouling transmembrane pressure increased from 2 17 to 8 47 kpa at 20 l m2 h to 4 24 16 93 kpa at 40 l m2 h and 8 47 50 79 kpa at 60 l m2 h the higher membrane fouling at higher flux is due to the higher suction pressure requirement for the extraction of water the higher suction pressure resulted in the rapid deposition of foulant on the membrane surface as well as produced well build cake layer on the membrane surface consequently it may not be sustainable to use higher filtration flux in a real wastewater plant hence all the further experiments were conducted using filtrate flux of 20 l m2 h to avoid severe membrane fouling problem the results obtained in this study was comparable with the nano filtration technique using a polyamide membrane solely for treating synthetic wastewater initially containing 500 mg cd2 l which gave a removal efficiency of 82 97 33 it is suggested that the removal of cd2 using smahs combined with aphanothece sp dried biosorbent aphanothece a15 is prospective for being implemented in wastewater treatment as a lowcost sorbent than polyamide membrane as reported by qdais and moussa 33 3 2 effect of biosorbent replacement on smahs performances the replacement of biosorbent was conducted to regenerate biosorbent and to maintain stable biosorption capacity 29 a higher amount of biosorbent replacement resulted in higher cadmium adsorption since it provides more new available binding sites for cd2 ions to be adsorbed onto biosorbent fig 3 a 20 replacement of the bisorbent resulted in three times higher removal efficiency than 10 replacement of the bisorbent removal efficiency of cd ranging from 84 to 95 47 whereas it is 10 to 30 with 10 replacement conversely the biosorption capacity reduced from 24 02 18 84 mg g electronic annex it suggests that added fresh biosorbent did not immediately bind cadmium from the solution further longer time is required for the saturation of all the existing binding sites of biosorbent with cd2 ions or in this study it is more than 180 min in addition the rate of cd removal slightly increased of 11 with the higher replacement of biosorbent mass it indicated that by adding fresh biosorbent provided more new binding sites for cd sorption fig 4 3 3 effect of regeneration frequency on smahs performances the frequency of biosorbent replacement in the smahs is commonly conducted for testing practicability of adsorption processes and to maintaining adequate adsorption capacity of the biosorbent 29 more frequent replacement of biosorbent led to a decline in biosorption capacity from 59 34 to 18 84 mg g while biosorption efficiency increased by 18 electronic annex however new biosorbent addition did not immediately enhance cd uptake this could be due to insufficient contact time for the binding of cd2 onto the biosorbent surface 3 4 effect of initial cd concentration on smahs performances the initial cd concentration in feeding solution is a determining factor for the adsorption system 35 increase of the initial cd concentration 6 89 magnitudes led to an increase in the total input and adsorption of cd electronic annex consequently biosorption capacity increased from 11 98 to 34 05 mg g however in terms of biosorption efficiency it only increased by 0 17 magnitude from 84 83 99 39 the removal efficiency at the filtration flux of 40 l m2 h was 99 39 which is slightly higher than a filtration flux of 20 l m2 h 95 54 although the removal efficiency was slightly better only less than 4 with the flux of 40 l m2 h but the stable performance in terms of membrane fouling and operational time of smahs was with the filtration flux of 20 l m2 h the effect of the initial concentration of cd on biosorption capacity was slightly lower than the flux effect it demonstrates that lower initial concentration led to a lower driving force for cd2 ion being adsorbed on the surficial binding sites of the biosorbent mass transfer of metal cation from bulk solution is driven using various concentrations of cd2 between the surface of the biosorbent and surrounding liquid phase of biosorbent 36 38 this suggested that higher concentrations gave more driving force to proceed to more rapid transfers fig 5 illustrates that cd biosorption efficiency of the smahs reactor corresponds to the initial concentration the indonesian environmental regulation for cd concentration in the aquatic system is limited to 0 05 mg l therefore the range of initial concentration in this experiment was 0 71 4 89 mg l unfortunately in this study the amount of cd in effluent solution lower than 0 05 mg l only achieved on the first 12 min of the operation 3 5 saturation test saturation test was conducted for ensuring the endurance of the biosorbent used in smahs the biosorption capacity of 583 38 mg g was found in the saturation while biosorption efficiency was 70 86 electronic annex this was the lowest level of biosorption efficiency observed in this study this implies that the operation time lasting five times longer than hydraulic retention time can achieve the highest biosorption capacity however it is prone to more low biosorption efficiency initial cd concentration of 8 6 mg l was used to obtained full saturation which was chosen based on the results explained in section 3 4 the lower initial concentration of cd resulted in slower biosorption of cd this indicated that the driving force could not overcome mass transfer resistance when the lower initial concentration of cd was applied the biosorbent saturation occurred over 26 h of operation and followed a non linear regression sigmoid curve having three parameters fig 6 the biosorbent in the smahs reactor began to saturate after 20 h of continuous operation without any biosorbent replacements this finding confirms that dried biosorption aphanothece sp applied in the smahs reactor has much potential for long term utilization in the biosorption system in summary the biosorbent produced from aphanothece a15 has shown better performance in removing cd from wastewater this is because the biosorbent has more active binding sites as a consequence of 15 better co2 enrichment treatment during their growth in the photobioreactor 18 binding sites on cyanobacterium biomass consisted of various functional groups such as carboxyls amines amides sulfhydrils that known pose high affinity to cd2 in aqueous solution the binding mechanism of cd2 onto biosorbent surface involves the cation exchange phenomenon between surface functional groups and cd2 ions the cation exchange mechanism proceeds when mass transfer resistance can be overcome 1 2 4 the sorption of cd2 using aphanothece biomass was chemisorption revealed in the previous batch biosorption study 18 it was evidenced from dubinin radushkevich isotherm qmax 9 12 10 3 mol g and means free energy e 11 18 kj mol and sem edx results 18 further in this study the addition of hollow fiber polyvinylidene pvdf membrane on the biosorption reactor improved the reactor performances and enhanced the operation time of the smah system electronic annex this also infers it is potentially low cost process due to the application of aphanothece biomass product may capture co2 from flue gas as reported by other researchers it has been proven that the cyanobacteria having the capability of co2 biosequestration 32 moreover the absorbed cadmium in spent biosorbent can be recovered using conventional methods such as using acid sorbents and then concentrated by electrolysis precipitation etc as reported elsewhere 1 23 34 however regarding real applications in wastewater treatment further studies are required to optimize the ratio of capital expenditure to operational expenditure mainly in terms of overcoming the problem of membrane fouling furthermore the effect of other ions on the removal of cd need to be addressed in the future 4 conclusion the suitable filtration flux and initial cd concentration in feeding solution without replacement of biosorbent were 20 l m2 h and 4 89 mg l with an efficiency of 95 54 also the experimental operational time of 6 h did not reach the saturated condition requirements however the saturation state was achieved over 20 h of continuous operation which in turn reduced the biosorption efficiency by determining the best concentration of cd and flux of filtration the biosorption using the smahs has significant prospects for long term implementation in wastewater treatment furthermore this study can be used as a basis for a better developed cleaner production method and promote more sustainability credit authorship contribution

sp a cyanobacterium was used as the adsorbent in smahs usually cyanobacterium contains more numerous functional groups amides amines carboxyl hydroxyls sulfhydryl on their surface which make them more capable of binding heavy metal cations compare to other phyla of microalgae cyanobacteria is suitable for growing in a photobioreactor system coupled with the wastewater treatment for obtaining biomass 31 32 the photobioreactor system containing cyanobacteria can also be used as the tool for carbon dioxide co2 bio fixer combined with the production of biosorbent obtained biosorbent from the photobioreactor was converted into dried biosorbent the advantage of using a smahs includes requirements for a small amount of biosorbent requirement which result in a smaller footprint while allowing maximum removal of cd from wastewater 3 1 effect of filtration flux on smahs performances the influence of filtration flux was studied by varying the filtration flux in the range of 20 60 l m2 h the filtration flux had little effect on the removal efficiency of cd2 but more impact on sorption capacity fig 2 and electronic annex as filtration flux increased three times 20 60 l m2 h the sorption capacity increased by1 6 times from 69 83 112 89 mg g therefore biosorption capacity of cd2 ions using aphanothece sp using this smahs configuration correlated with the permeate flux although higher filtration flux of 60 l m2 h provided the highest sorption capacity of 112 89 mg g but resulted in higher membrane fouling transmembrane pressure increased from 2 17 to 8 47 kpa at 20 l m2 h to 4 24 16 93 kpa at 40 l m2 h and 8 47 50 79 kpa at 60 l m2 h the higher membrane fouling at higher flux is due to the higher suction pressure requirement for the extraction of water the higher suction pressure resulted in the rapid deposition of foulant on the membrane surface as well as produced well build cake layer on the membrane surface consequently it may not be sustainable to use higher filtration flux in a real wastewater plant hence all the further experiments were conducted using filtrate flux of 20 l m2 h to avoid severe membrane fouling problem the results obtained in this study was comparable with the nano filtration technique using a polyamide membrane solely for treating synthetic wastewater initially containing 500 mg cd2 l which gave a removal efficiency of 82 97 33 it is suggested that the removal of cd2 using smahs combined with aphanothece sp dried biosorbent aphanothece a15 is prospective for being implemented in wastewater treatment as a lowcost sorbent than polyamide membrane as reported by qdais and moussa 33 3 2 effect of biosorbent replacement on smahs performances the replacement of biosorbent was conducted to regenerate biosorbent and to maintain stable biosorption capacity 29 a higher amount of biosorbent replacement resulted in higher cadmium adsorption since it provides more new available binding sites for cd2 ions to be adsorbed onto biosorbent fig 3 a 20 replacement of the bisorbent resulted in three times higher removal efficiency than 10 replacement of the bisorbent removal efficiency of cd ranging from 84 to 95 47 whereas it is 10 to 30 with 10 replacement conversely the biosorption capacity reduced from 24 02 18 84 mg g electronic annex it suggests that added fresh biosorbent did not immediately bind cadmium from the solution further longer time is required for the saturation of all the existing binding sites of biosorbent with cd2 ions or in this study it is more than 180 min in addition the rate of cd removal slightly increased of 11 with the higher replacement of biosorbent mass it indicated that by adding fresh biosorbent provided more new binding sites for cd sorption fig 4 3 3 effect of regeneration frequency on smahs performances the frequency of biosorbent replacement in the smahs is commonly conducted for testing practicability of adsorption processes and to maintaining adequate adsorption capacity of the biosorbent 29 more frequent replacement of biosorbent led to a decline in biosorption capacity from 59 34 to 18 84 mg g while biosorption efficiency increased by 18 electronic annex however new biosorbent addition did not immediately enhance cd uptake this could be due to insufficient contact time for the binding of cd2 onto the biosorbent surface 3 4 effect of initial cd concentration on smahs performances the initial cd concentration in feeding solution is a determining factor for the adsorption system 35 increase of the initial cd concentration 6 89 magnitudes led to an increase in the total input and adsorption of cd electronic annex consequently biosorption capacity increased from 11 98 to 34 05 mg g however in terms of biosorption efficiency it only increased by 0 17 magnitude from 84 83 99 39 the removal efficiency at the filtration flux of 40 l m2 h was 99 39 which is slightly higher than a filtration flux of 20 l m2 h 95 54 although the removal efficiency was slightly better only less than 4 with the flux of 40 l m2 h but the stable performance in terms of membrane fouling and operational time of smahs was with the filtration flux of 20 l m2 h the effect of the initial concentration of cd on biosorption capacity was slightly lower than the flux effect it demonstrates that lower initial concentration led to a lower driving force for cd2 ion being adsorbed on the surficial binding sites of the biosorbent mass transfer of metal cation from bulk solution is driven using various concentrations of cd2 between the surface of the biosorbent and surrounding liquid phase of biosorbent 36 38 this suggested that higher concentrations gave more driving force to proceed to more rapid transfers fig 5 illustrates that cd biosorption efficiency of the smahs reactor corresponds to the initial concentration the indonesian environmental regulation for cd concentration in the aquatic system is limited to 0 05 mg l therefore the range of initial concentration in this experiment was 0 71 4 89 mg l unfortunately in this study the amount of cd in effluent solution lower than 0 05 mg l only achieved on the first 12 min of the operation 3 5 saturation test saturation test was conducted for ensuring the endurance of the biosorbent used in smahs the biosorption capacity of 583 38 mg g was found in the saturation while biosorption efficiency was 70 86 electronic annex this was the lowest level of biosorption efficiency observed in this study this implies that the operation time lasting five times longer than hydraulic retention time can achieve the highest biosorption capacity however it is prone to more low biosorption efficiency initial cd concentration of 8 6 mg l was used to obtained full saturation which was chosen based on the results explained in section 3 4 the lower initial concentration of cd resulted in slower biosorption of cd this indicated that the driving force could not overcome mass transfer resistance when the lower initial concentration of cd was applied the biosorbent saturation occurred over 26 h of operation and followed a non linear regression sigmoid curve having three parameters fig 6 the biosorbent in the smahs reactor began to saturate after 20 h of continuous operation without any biosorbent replacements this finding confirms that dried biosorption aphanothece sp applied in the smahs reactor has much potential for long term utilization in the biosorption system in summary the biosorbent produced from aphanothece a15 has shown better performance in removing cd from wastewater this is because the biosorbent has more active binding sites as a consequence of 15 better co2 enrichment treatment during their growth in the photobioreactor 18 binding sites on cyanobacterium biomass consisted of various functional groups such as carboxyls amines amides sulfhydrils that known pose high affinity to cd2 in aqueous solution the binding mechanism of cd2 onto biosorbent surface involves the cation exchange phenomenon between surface functional groups and cd2 ions the cation exchange mechanism proceeds when mass transfer resistance can be overcome 1 2 4 the sorption of cd2 using aphanothece biomass was chemisorption revealed in the previous batch biosorption study 18 it was evidenced from dubinin radushkevich isotherm qmax 9 12 10 3 mol g and means free energy e 11 18 kj mol and sem edx results 18 further in this study the addition of hollow fiber polyvinylidene pvdf membrane on the biosorption reactor improved the reactor performances and enhanced the operation time of the smah system electronic annex this also infers it is potentially low cost process due to the application of aphanothece biomass product may capture co2 from flue gas as reported by other researchers it has been proven that the cyanobacteria having the capability of co2 biosequestration 32 moreover the absorbed cadmium in spent biosorbent can be recovered using conventional methods such as using acid sorbents and then concentrated by electrolysis precipitation etc as reported elsewhere 1 23 34 however regarding real applications in wastewater treatment further studies are required to optimize the ratio of capital expenditure to operational expenditure mainly in terms of overcoming the problem of membrane fouling furthermore the effect of other ions on the removal of cd need to be addressed in the future 4 conclusion the suitable filtration flux and initial cd concentration in feeding solution without replacement of biosorbent were 20 l m2 h and 4 89 mg l with an efficiency of 95 54 also the experimental operational time of 6 h did not reach the saturated condition requirements however the saturation state was achieved over 20 h of continuous operation which in turn reduced the biosorption efficiency by determining the best concentration of cd and flux of filtration the biosorption using the smahs has significant prospects for long term implementation in wastewater treatment furthermore this study can be used as a basis for a better developed cleaner production method and promote more sustainability credit authorship contribution

13527,rapid granulation was realized in a continuous flow reactor with a two zone sedimentation tank cfr tst and a novel strategy involving the continuous addition of dewatered sludge during the start up phase to treat the actual domestic sewage with low concentration the selection pressure produced by the two zone sedimentation tank can discharge light flocs with poor settleability and retain the fine particles in the reactor the continuous addition of dewatered sludge in the start up phase can increase the small particles in the aeration tank by acting as nuclei to accelerate granulation the experimental results indicated that aerobic granular sludge ags was formed successfully on day 25 the sludge volume index at 5 min svi5 was 37 7 ml g the mean particle size was 0 42 mm and the average settling velocity was 35 2 m h after operated continuously for 45 days the sedimentation capacity and biomass concentration were further enhanced svi5 and the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were stable in the range of 25 8 31 3 ml g and 4200 4600 mg l respectively although the dewatered sludge with low biological activity had a slight negative impact on pollutants degradation in the start up phase the biological activity of the sludge was enormously upgraded compared with those of the inoculated dewatered sludge the sour and dehydrogenase activity of the mature ags increased 3 72 times and 5 01 times on day 84 respectively and microbes that promote the secretion of eps and facilitate the degradation of pollutants were enriched during the whole process of granulation moreover the approach developed in this case was simple and eco friendly for potential full scale implementation keywords continuous flow reactor with two zone sedimentation tank cfr tst aerobic granulation dewatered sludge actual domestic sewage with low concentration 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags technology is a new and promising biological treatment for wastewater to date there are more than 40 full scale ags plants already in operation or under construction worldwide and almost all the plants have been performed in sequential batch reactors sbrs 1 3 with the great success of aerobic granulation in sbrs attention is beginning to turn to continuous flow applications this is a necessary step given the advantages of continuous flow treatment processes and the fact that the most current large scale wastewater operations are using continuous flow systems with aeration tank and sedimentation tank according to a literature review the main problems constraining the development of ags technique in cfrs are focused on two aspects on the one hand it is difficult to achieve the ideal environment for ags formation in cfrs with low hydraulic shear forces weak mass transfer and poor sludge selection mechanisms furthermore conventional sludge reflux pumps easily destroy any ags formed in cfrs on the other hand most studies have shown that it takes 20 40 days to form ags in sbrs 4 5 the granulation process of ags cultured in cfrs requires a longer time 6 7 it is thus necessary to develop an efficient and reliable strategy to realize rapid granulation in cfrs especially for wastewater treatment plants wwtps process operation based on numerous studies of sbrs ags can be cultivated rapidly by gradually shortening the settling time 8 9 however it is difficult to use this selection pressure to retain aerobic sludge with good sedimentation performance in cfrs hydrocyclones based on particle size have been used in full scale continuous flow studies to date at least three full scale facilities have examined the possibility of using hydrocyclones to apply a vortex selection pressure to screen dense and light sludge 3 two facilities required the introduction of anammox granules periodically from a sidestream demon sbr 10 11 while the third facility that did not adopt this strategy and granule formation was not promoted within one year of operation 12 another concern for the use of hydrocyclones is that the loss of volatile solids and the accumulation of inorganic material may lead to a reduction in treatment efficiency therefore it is desirable to introduce a selection pressure into cfrs based on settling velocity in a simple and effective way 3 although there are few studies on rapid cultivation of ags more and more scholars have started to focus on this field and have realized rapid granulation through individual methods based on the crystal nucleus hypothesis the most used method to realize rapid granulation involves the addition of ca2 mg2 and other metal ions into the influent however this kind of excessive and continuous addition mode would lead to not only a reduction in biological activity in sludge but also an increase in economic costs to reduce processing costs li et al 13 and zou et al 14 promoted the formation of ags in sbr and cfr by adding sludge micropowder but there was a lack of in depth study on how to promote the formation of ags and the preparation of sludge micropowder was truly complex and time consuming because granulation is greatly affected by inoculated sludge many studies have been promoted ags formation by inoculating sludge with different characteristics hu et al 15 and muda et al 16 accelerated the process of granulation by inoculating anaerobic granular sludge and the results showed that the supplemented granules broke down into different granular sizes long et al 17 and pijuan et al 18 inoculated partial mature ags and disintegrated ags in the reactor respectively and the granulation was realized in a relatively short time therefore inoculation of anaerobic granular sludge did not accelerate the aerobic granulation process while inoculation of partially mature or broken ags can greatly reduce the formation time of ags however both methods need ags precultivation and it is difficult to obtain enough particles in the start up phase of the wwtps in actual operation in view of these existing rapid cultivation modes of ags there are some problems such as increasing economic cost complicated operation process or the need for ags cultivation in advance however the above problems can be better solved by continuously adding dewatered sludge as an induction core for a certain period coupling of sludge screening in the reactor based on the selection pressure of settling velocity is undoubtedly a new strategy to realize the rapid granulation nevertheless whether the cultivation effect of this method and the low biological activity of dewatered sludge can affect the removal of pollutants how the physical and biological characteristics of the added dewatered sludge change due to long term storage and how this mode can promote the rapid formation of ags are still unknown in addition the organic loading rate olr has been reported to be one of the decisive factors during granulation 19 researchers have claimed that a high olr can promote the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps which further impact ags stability 20 21 however the development and application of ags technology with low strength wastewater could not be ignored completely to date domestic sewage and low strength municipal wastewater have gradually become the treatment object to cultivate ags in cfrs 14 22 26 therefore this study attempted to achieve rapid granulation by adding dewatered sludge continuously during the start up phase coupling with a two zone sedimentation tank to treat real low strength wastewater the effectiveness of this process was evaluated by the effect of characteristics bioactivity microbial community of sludge and contaminants removal to provide technical methods and data support for the speedy formation of ags in the traditional continuous flow process 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and seed sludge the influent wastewater used in this case was actual domestic sewage which was taken from an underground sewage inspection well in a residential area in hangzhou china the characteristics of water quality fluctuate greatly and the main parameters were as follows chemical oxygen demand codcr 200 400 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 10 25 mg l total nitrogen tn 20 45 mg l total phosphorus tp 2 5 mg l and ph 6 8 7 5 dewatered sludge with a water content of approximately 80 and mlvss mlss of 47 65 obtained from belt filter dehydrator of a wwtp situated in hangzhou china the plant used polyacrylamide pam as flocculant and added at a dosage of 2 ppm was used as inoculation sludge after passing through a 100 mesh sieve to remove filamentous and large particles the inoculated sludge was poured into the reactor the seeding sludge had a sludge volume index at 5 min svi5 of 25 6 ml g a mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of 3129 mg l and a mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss of 1491 mg l this sludge was stored in the natural environment of the laboratory for continuously adding during the start up phase of the reactor 2 2 reactor and operation a continuous flow reactor with two zone sedimentation tank cfr tst was used to cultivate ags with a working volume of roughly 26 8 l as shown in fig 1 the reactor was primarily contained an aeration tank 40 cm 15 cm 49 cm a sludge return area 7 5 cm 4 cm 49 cm and a sedimentation tank consisted of two identical zones denoted st 1 and st 2 respectively of the same size 15 cm 15 cm 39 cm each with an area of 225 cm2 and a settling time of around 1 8 h st 2 discharged excess sludge daily air was provided to the aeration tank via microporous aerated sand heads which were uniformly placed at the bottom of the reactor airflow rate of 0 4 m3 h to eliminate the decomposition of ags by traditional return sludge pumps an airlift system was created to return sludge from st 1 to aeration zone in this study airflow rate of 0 1 m3 h a fixing baffle and a movable baffle were connected between the two identical zones in the sedimentation tank the height of the movable baffle can be adjusted to generate different selection pressure on account of the sedimentation velocity the selection pressure was weakened by reducing the height of the baffle relative to the liquid level the baffle was inserted 20 cm below the liquid level at the start of the reactor operation 0 d to create a relatively high selection pressure a peristaltic pump was used to feed wastewater into the aeration zone flow rate 1650 ml h and the hydraulic retention time was about 16 h the olr was 0 30 0 60 kg m3 d and the temperature scope was 25 5 c during the whole experiment to accelerate the aerobic granulation in cfr tst dewatered sludge 100 5 g was continuously added to the aeration tank every day from day 4 to day 17 sludge samples were collected in the aeration tank before and 4 h after dosing a siphon was used to collect equal volume of sludge samples from the surface middle and bottom layer of the aeration tank and then they were sufficiently mixed as the representative samples water samples of the inlet and outlet were collected from influent and effluent pipes respectively 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 analysis of the sludge properties and water quality the morphological changes of the aerobic granules were observed under an optical microscope cx31 olympus japan and the particle size distribution psd of granules was determined by image pro plus analysis 6 0 olympus soft imaging solution the mlss mlvss svi5 suspended solids ss codcr nh4 n tn and tp were analyzed according to the standard methods 27 2 3 2 eps extraction and analysis eps were extracted by the formaldehyde sodium hydroxide method 28 and the sum of the protein pn and polysaccharide ps contents constituted the total amount of eps in this study the pn content of eps was detected by uv spectrophotometer at 595 nm with bovine serum protein bsa as a standard 29 the ps content of eps was measured via the phenol sulfuric acid method using glucose solution as a standard 30 2 3 3 analysis of the sludge biological activity the specific oxygen uptake rate sour and dehydrogenase activity of the sludge were measured by wang et al 31 and the triphenyl tetrazolium chloride ttc method 32 respectively 2 3 4 analysis of the sludge microbial community to explore the change in the microbial community during the whole experimental period with the continuous addition of dewatered sludge high throughput illumina miseq sequencing was performed at zhejiang tianke technology co ltd hangzhou china on the following samples sludge samples from the aeration tank rs0 rs14 ads rs14 rs25 rs40 rs55 and rs75 digital indicates the operation days of the reactor ads is the abbreviation of added dewatered sludge which was sampled 4 h after adding dewatered sludge and dewatered sludge samples placed in the natural environment of the laboratory on different days ds0 ds5 ds10 ds20 and ds30 the microbial dna in the sludge samples were extracted using fast dna spin kits for soil mobio usa according to manufacturer s instructions dna samples were quantified by nanodrop2000 fluorospectrometer thermo scientific usa and dna quality was examined on 1 w w agarose gel afterwards the v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16s rdna sequences were amplified using the 341 f 5 cctacgnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvggtatctaatcc 3 primers 33 the pcr amplification conditions and the thermal programme were referred to our previous research 22 effective tags were obtained by filtering splicing and removing chimeras from the original data by using flash and qiime software and the operational taxonomic units otus with an identity of 98 were separated using uparse the silva database and rdp classifier version 11 4 method were used to annotate the specific otus species and the diversity and community composition of taxonomic information was analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in the morphology of the sludge during the initial period of the reactor 0 3 days the inoculated sludge dewatered sludge was broken into irregular small particles and flocs which were loose in structure with rough edges fig 2 a a at this moment the sludge in the aeration tank had good sedimentation performance with an average sedimentation velocity of 32 5 m h and the sludge discharged from st 2 was mainly flocs fig 2b a from day 4 to day 17 a certain amount of dewatered sludge was added daily to the aeration tank and the variations in sludge morphology before and after sludge addition on day 14 are shown in fig 2a b and a c compared with the initial sludge the sludge on day 14 in the aeration tank was smooth dense and compact which was mainly due to the action of hydraulic shear force after adding dewatered sludge a large number of particle aggregates and flocs with different particle sizes appeared and the average sedimentation velocity decreased to 22 6 m h on day 25 of operation the number of flocs in the aeration tank was greatly reduced and ags with relatively regular shape complete morphology and dense structure appeared fig 2a d the settleability was restored with an average sedimentation velocity of 35 4 m h and the mean particle size was 0 42 mm at this point according to the judgment of previous studies the granulation realized was requiring more than half of the particles had sizes greater than 0 34 mm 34 35 at this point a small number of micro granules fig 2b b also appeared in st 2 as the experiment continued more rounded and denser granular sludge emerged in the aeration tank fig 2a e and a f and the particle size also steadily increased the mean particle size and average sedimentation velocity of the granules were 0 58 mm and 45 1 m h during 84 days of operation and many micro granules appeared in st 2 at this moment fig 2b c 3 2 variations in the sludge physical characteristics mlss mlvss and svi5 are important indicators to characterize sludge performance 36 and the changes in each indicator are shown in fig 3 a and b the granulation process in the aeration tank could be roughly divided into four stages the first stage was the activation phase 0 3 days the inoculated sludge dewatered sludge was broken into numerous particles and flocs because a two zone sedimentation tank was set up in this study well settled granules were always retained in the reactor and a large amount of poorly settled flocs washed away the mlss dropped sharply from 3129 mg l to 2270 mg l and the svi5 increased rapidly from 25 6 ml g to 56 6 ml g during this period microorganisms began to adapt and grow during this stage which was indicated by the increase of mlvss mlss ratio from 47 65 to 62 38 the second stage was the start up phase 4 17 days the dewatered sludge was added daily to the aeration tank which was conducive to the increase in mlss and the decrease in svi5 for example on day 7 mlss increased from 2564 mg l before addition to 3918 mg l after addition and svi5 decreased from 59 6 ml g before addition to 29 2 ml g after addition the ratio of mlvss mlss decreased the values before and after addition were 65 76 and 59 93 respectively mainly due to the relatively low mlvss mlss ratio of the dewatered sludge over time as dual zone selection pressure can retain broken particles with good sedimentation performance this strategy was conducive to maintaining the sludge concentration and improving the sludge settleability in the reactor the values of mlss and svi5 changed from 2270 mg l and 56 6 ml g on day 4 3601 mg l and 45 8 ml g on day 17 respectively all values were obtained before addition the third stage was the granulation phase 18 45 days mlss slowly increased after decreasing to 3718 mg l on day 21 and achieved 4360 mg l on day 45 the increase of mlvss mlss ratio from 53 32 59 93 during this period suggesting that the broken particles with good settling performance can serve as core for the microorganisms that gently accumulated and grow on their surfaces thus accelerating granulation this is compliance with the findings of verawaty et al 8 and pijuan et al 18 who added mature ags to accelerate granulation in the initial stage svi5 rose to 37 7 ml g on day 21 and then slowly fluctuated and decreased the svi5 was 31 3 ml g on day 45 suggesting that the broken particles could maintain good settleability in the process of granulation to avoid excessive sludge loss the fourth stage was the stabilization phase 46 84 days the mlss and svi5 tended to be stable and remained in the range of 4200 4600 mg l and 25 8 31 3 ml g respectively the ratio of mlvss mlss was stable at approximately 60 the ags in the reactor had good settling performance and had many similarities with the initial inoculated dewatered sludge in terms of physical properties 3 3 variations in the sludge biological activity sour and dehydrogenase activity are important indexes to reveal the metabolic activity of sludge 37 the trend of the sour and dehydrogenase activity during the whole experiment is shown in fig 3c the biological activity of dewatered sludge inoculated initially was poor with sour and dehydrogenase activities of only 8 5 mg o2 g mlvss h and 3 09 mg g mlvss respectively there was an increasing trend during the first stage activation phase indicating that the bioactivity of sludge was gradually restored during the second stage start up phase due to the continuous addition of dewatered sludge the growth rate of dehydrogenase activity slowed down and the sour even decreased this result indicated that the sludge in the aeration tank was mainly crushed particles and the biological activity was at a low level which also led to low cod removal efficiency the significant increase in the sour and dehydrogenase activity was fundamentally also observed during the third stage granulation phase the sour and dehydrogenase activity values raised from 17 6 mg o2 g mlvss h and 8 64 mg g mlvss on day 21 30 1 mg o2 g mlvss h and 13 78 mg g mlvss on day 42 respectively the recovery of biological activity of sludge showed that the crushed particles from the dewatered sludge in the start up phase not only acted as nuclei but also underwent a conversion from physical particles to mature ags with huge biological activity differences between them the sour and dehydrogenase activity changed slightly during the fourth stage stabilization phase and were stable in the range of 26 0 30 6 mg o2 g mlvss h and 14 35 16 07 mg g mlvss respectively this means that ags maintained a high biological activity after it was formed and effectively improved the impact resistance and pollutants removal capacity 3 4 variations of the eps component it is known that eps can promote the aggregation of microbial cells and maintain the stability of cell structure thus accelerating the granulation of aerobic sludge 38 which is mainly composed of ps and pn 39 the changes in the eps content and the pn ps ratio of the sludge during the whole experiment are shown in fig 3d during the first and second stage activation and start up phase the eps increased slowly from the initial value of 65 44 mg g mlvss to 88 56 mg g mlvss on day 14 and the pn increased from 33 88 mg g mlvss to 52 59 mg g mlvss while ps rarely increased or even decreased the values were 36 04 mg g mlvss and 35 97 mg g mlvss on day 7 and on day 14 respectively on the one hand the results showed that the initial sludge in the really low olr conditions microorganisms may consume eps as a kind of carbon source due to nutrients deficiency while ps was mainly consumed 37 on the other hand some studies have shown that pn has an optimistic impact on the sedimentation capacity and hydrophobicity of cells and the enhancement in pn in eps was conducive to the formation and steadiness of granules 40 therefore it can be inferred that the crushed particles from dewatered sludge with great settling properties retained in the reactor had a trend of transformation from the initial to mature ags during the third and fourth stages granulation and stabilization phases the eps increased sharply and achieved the peak value of 148 04 mg g mlvss on day 28 and then decreased gradually to 113 98 mg g mlvss on day 42 the value remained at a high level during this period afterwards the eps showed an overall decreasing trend by undulations and eventually dropped to 63 60 mg g mlvss on day 84 this is consistent with the conclusion that eps raised remarkably during granulation but dropped slightly when ags matured 41 42 pn and ps are corresponded to hydrophobic and hydrophilic respectively the increase of pn ps ratio is conducive to granulation 40 the pn ps ratio in this case increased from the beginning and rapidly increased from 1 46 on day 14 to 3 60 on day 28 indicating that the sludge in the reactor was granulated from the beginning and that the mode of continuous addition of dewatered sludge can accelerate the granulation process in addition compared with ps pn played a leading position in granulation which showed no difference with the findings of mcswain et al 41 during the ags stabilization phase pn decreased gradually from 46 69 mg g mlvss to 20 12 mg g mlvss during day 49 to day 84 and pn ps showed a downward trend indicating that ps acted an important part in maintaining the stability of ags 3 5 pollutant removal performance the ss and cod of the effluent were high during the first 17 days fig 4 a with values of 92 118 mg l and 54 2 78 3 mg l respectively the biological activity of sludge was in the first and second stages was poor activation and start up phase and the microorganisms gradually adapted to the new environment resulting in low cod removal efficiency fig 3c illustrates this point as well after that the ss of the effluent sharply decreased to 28 mg l on day 45 and then stabilized at 19 1 4 9 mg l indicating that the reactor was increasingly stable in the process of aerobic granulation the effluent cod was mainly stable under 50 mg l and the removal efficiency fluctuated between 83 23 and 93 84 after 17 days indicating that the third and fourth stages granulation and stabilization phases were conducive to the removal of organic pollutants which is conform to the consequence of xu et al 22 and zhang et al 39 the olr greatly influenced the stabilization and physiological qualities of ags 43 in this study the olr was 0 30 0 60 kg m3 d which was lower than that in normal ags culture conditions within the scope of 1 5 15 kg m3 d 44 and it was even lower than that detected by ni et al 45 who cultivated ags in municipal wastewater with low concentration 0 6 1 0 kg m3 d this showed that the formation of granular sludge in the aerobic system is not directly related to the olr the raise of olr may increase the particle size by accelerating the growth rate of bacteria 46 liu et al 44 raised the size of granules by 0 3 mm through continuously increasing the olr from 3 kg m3 d to 9 kg m3 d the olr conditions in this study was really low and led to the slow growth of microorganisms resulting in the formation of ags with small particle sizes finally nh4 n removal was 86 03 100 during the whole experiment and the effluent nh4 n was lower than 3 mg l except it reached 3 261 mg l on day 12 as shown in fig 4b this is consistent with the observation that more than 90 nh4 n removal efficiency could be achieved when realizing aerobic granulation in cfrs 47 48 in some studies it can even reach 100 49 50 the removal efficiency of tn and tp depends on the operating conditions this study was only carried out in a single aeration tank which had the oxidation of organic matter and ammonia but lacked the capability of denitrification and phosphorus removal which was the primary cause of the low removal rate of tn and tp the microbial growth could have consumed some of the nitrogen and phosphorus for their metabolic activities specifically the average tn removal efficiency was 16 3 1 7 during the first 17 days and then it increased to 27 1 3 4 with a great quantity of no3 n spotted in the effluent fig 4c the enhancement of simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd in the aeration tank promoted the tn removal efficiency to a certain extent as revealed by precious studies 51 52 the efficiency of snd depended to a large extent on the formation of anoxic regions in the granules in this study the small granules the mean particle size was 0 58 mm on day 84 made it easy for do to penetrate into the interior of the granules thus blocking the oxygen deficient core formed by the growth of denitrifying bacteria however there were still a small number of large size granules in the reactor the particle size distribution at 0 5 1 0 mm and 1 0 1 5 mm was 34 2 and 9 1 respectively as shown in fig 4d the removal efficiency of tp fluctuated from 20 83 to 41 60 during the first 17 days which was related to the start up mode of continuous dosing of dewatered sludge every day after that except for a few days most of the tp removal efficiency values fell within the range of 45 65 about 1 2 mg l reduction in tp indicating that the formation and stability of ags was conducive to tp removal 3 6 characterization of the microbial community during different periods of reactor operation high throughput sequencing achieved good quality and valid reads all with 97 coverage including 46081 rs14 45661 ads rs14 46481 rs25 46534 rs40 46608 rs55 and 46785 rs75 this indicated that the real distribution of sludge microorganisms could be well reflected by the gathered gene sequences the diversity of microbial community can be described by the shannon index which was 8 08 for rs0 8 30 for rs14 8 33 for rs25 8 37 for rs40 8 45 for rs55 and 8 56 for rs75 this result implied that the microbial diversity increased during the process of granulation and such results are consistent with those reported by he et al 53 it is noteworthy that the microbial diversity of dewatered sludge added in the start up phase was relatively low which can be reflected from the reduction in the shannon index from 8 30 rs14 to 8 24 ads rs14 indicating that this approach did not affect the microbial diversity during the process of granulation the number of coexisting otus in rs14 rs25 rs40 rs55 and rs75 with rs0 was 1188 1121 1068 948 and 869 respectively besides the results of the otus level cluster dendrogram exhibited that rs75 and rs0 were the farthest fig 5 a illustrating that in the course of granulation the microbial community transformed remarkable which was identical with previous researches 22 52 the phylogenetic classifications of microbial communities in all samples were summarized at the phylum level as shown in fig 5a proteobacteria was the dominant phylum with a relative abundance of 30 74 rs0 29 81 rs14 32 68 ads rs14 33 12 rs25 36 85 rs40 37 80 rs55 and 39 82 rs75 the continuous addition of dewatered sludge during the start up phase was conducive to the enrichment of proteobacteria and with the increase in particle size during granulation the higher abundance of proteobacteria also exhibited proteobacteria play a significant role in carbon cycle 54 which indirectly indicated that the treatment capacity of pollutants was improved during the granulation process bacteroidetes commonly exist in feces and are generally found in domestic sewage treatment plants 3 bacteroidetes was the second dominant phylum in this study the relative abundance of bacteroidetes was 36 05 rs0 25 74 rs14 26 78 ads rs14 21 27 rs25 24 91 rs40 23 92 rs55 and 21 86 rs75 these results are identical with previous studies where proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most dominant phyla in activated sludge or ags 22 52 other phyla with lower relative abundances including acidobacteria 6 24 13 32 chloroflexi 5 20 9 93 planctomycete 0 86 5 73 verrucomicrobia 1 27 2 77 and firmicutes 0 57 2 32 were discovered in previous researches as well 14 52 it is noteworthy that the relative abundance of actinobacteria increased first from 3 77 rs0 to 4 42 rs14 and then decreased to 1 84 rs75 while the addition of dewatered sludge helped reduce the relative abundance of actinobacteria the relative abundance of actinobacteria in rs14 and ads rs14 was 4 42 and 3 97 respectively actinobacteria was related to the sludge filamentation bulking 55 implying that the continuous addition of dewatered sludge in the start up phase can inhibit the sludge filamentous while the selection pressure created by the sedimentation tank with two zone continues to ensure this inhibition thus accelerating the formation and stabilization of ags as shown in fig 5b the top 10 species with the highest relative abundances of each sample were selected at the genus level to generate a cumulative cylindrical map zoogloea is frequently detected in ags treatment systems which can promote eps secretion and combines cells together 56 57 the relative abundance of zoogloea increased from 4 22 rs0 to 6 55 rs75 during the continuous operation of the reactor it is speculated that the selection pressure produced by the sedimentation tank with two zone can screen out more microbes consist with eps secretion thus promoting the speedy granulation the relative abundances of rhodobacter were 2 39 rs0 1 38 rs14 1 70 ads rs14 2 15 rs25 3 14 rs40 4 46 rs55 and 4 37 rs75 indicating that the continuous addition of dewatered sludge in the start up phase was conducive to the enrichment of rhodobacter the rapid growth of which occurred after the formation of ags this result is accord with the conclusion of zhang et al 58 indicating that in ags system rhodobacter is a kind of principal microorganism which can play as a stabilizing role flavobacterium is also an extensive reported genus that can improve the stability of ags and is used to describe the ags maturity 59 60 with a relative abundance of 1 46 in rs0 while raised to 2 45 in rs75 which also effectively guaranteed the ags stability in this case thiothrix is reported to be a conventional filamentous bacterium 61 the relative abundance of thiothrix was only 0 02 in rs0 and increased to 0 23 in rs14 while the addition of dewatered sludge reduced it to 0 09 in ads rs14 afterwards the relative abundance of thiothrix increased steadily to 1 09 in rs75 from this result it can be inferred that thiothrix may act a significant part in the granulation process which have also been pointed in previous researches 22 57 some ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos including ferruginibacter ottowia and flavobacterium showed an upward trend during granulation which are able to effectively decompose organic substances for n removal nitrosomonas and nitrospira are the typical representatives of ammoniac oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob which were the most commonly detected in cfrs 62 63 the relative abundances of nitrosomonas and nitrospira were 1 37 and 2 22 rs0 1 49 and 2 51 rs14 1 22 and 2 31 ads rs14 1 46 and 2 61 rs25 1 64 and 2 95 rs40 1 73 and 3 02 rs55 and 1 82 and 3 11 rs75 respectively it can be seen that continuous addition of dewatered sludge did not help the enrichment of these two genera while the abundance of these two genera increased to a certain extent during the process of granulation promoting nitrification the reason may be owing to the selection pressure produced by the sedimentation tank with two zone which retains the granules with well settleability can settle in st 1 allowing them to stay in the reactor for a long time thus providing opportunities for the growth of nitrobacteria this is consistent with the conclusion that both nitrosomonas and nitrospira are chemoautotrophic bacteria and need long sludge residence times to enrich 64 zoogloea thiothrix and haliangium were the main denitrobacteria in this study 65 and the relative abundance of zoogloea and thiothrix raised from 4 22 and 0 02 in rs0 to 6 55 and 1 09 in rs75 respectively however the abundance of haliangium was significantly reduced from 1 29 in rs0 to 0 28 in rs75 these findings demonstrated that snd was effectively promoted during the process of granulation thus improving the capacity of n removal in the reactor in addition candidatus accumulsifier a phosphate accumulating organism pao increased from 0 87 rs0 to 2 45 rs75 during the process of granulation which indirectly indicated that the formation and stability of ags was conducive to the removal of tp principal component analysis pca was carried out to further illustrate the change in the microbial community in granular sludge the distance between points based on pca can reflect the degree of sample difference as shown in fig 5c pc1 and pc2 revealed the two most notable differences with contribution rates of 21 74 and 11 14 respectively owing to the selection pressure created by the sedimentation tank with two zone the distance between rs0 and rs14 were relatively far which allowed the sludge with good settling property to stay flocculated and coagulated microbial communities in the sludge were retained and continued to reproduce and flocs with poor sedimentation is discharged as excess sludge in addition dewatered sludge was added every day from day 4 to day 17 and the microbial community of the dewatered sludge stored in the natural environment also varied over time in conclusion under the continuous promotion of both factors the microbial abundance and community changed significantly the gaps between other sample points gradually narrowed with the formation of ags such as those between rs25 and rs40 or rs40 and rs55 which showed no difference with the cluster dendrogram in fig 5a demonstrating that compared with the formation process of ags with the increase of particle size the composition of bacterial community changed slightly it is remarkable that rs0 was the farthest from rs75 which proves ones again that the microbial community transformed tremendously during the entire granulation 3 7 variations in dewatered sludge characteristics in this study dewatered sludge was continuously added every day during the start up phase of the reactor from day 4 to day 17 the properties and microbial flora variations of dewatered sludge stored in the natural environment of the laboratory over time would have a certain impact on the results mlvss mlss can indirectly reflect the quantity of microorganisms in sludge as shown in fig 6 a the value was only 50 03 on day 0 decreased to 43 02 on day 15 and then reached a stable state 42 01 on day 30 the results showed that some microbes could not adapt to the poor nutrition environment and consumed themselves under the effect of endogenous respiration while others with low dependence on nutrients could survive in these unfavorable conditions the svi5 of dewatered sludge was very low and was reduced from 27 2 ml g on day 0 10 1 ml g on day 15 and then the svi5 was stable 7 1 ml g on day 30 therefore adding dewatered sludge continuously during the start up phase combined with the selection mechanism of the two zone sedimentation tank the broken particles from dewatered sludge with good settleability would stay in the aeration tank improving the sludge concentration and acting as nuclei which provided the possibility for rapid granulation as indicated in fig 6b the biological activity of dewatered sludge decreased continuously during the natural drying process the dehydrogenase activity and sour decreased slowly from 5 44 mg g mlvss and 12 7 mg o2 g mlvss h on day 0 3 79 mg g mlvss and 7 5 mgo2 g mlvss h on day 15 and then dropped rapidly to 2 13 mg g mlvss and 2 6 mgo2 g mlvss h on day 20 respectively continuous addition of dewatered sludge will reduce the overall biological activity of sludge in the reactor and affect the removal efficiency of pollutants from this point of view the number of days of continuous addition should not exceed 15 days the variations in eps content and pn ps of dewatered sludge during natural drying are shown in fig 6c eps increased from 67 23 mg g mlvss to 70 75 mg g mlvss during the first five days pn increased by 6 51 mg g mlvss while ps declined by 2 98 mg g mlvss liu et al 66 discussed the variations of eps in sludge at 72 h during the natural drying conditioning process and the eps increased from the initial value of 109 4 mg g mlvss to 158 6 mg g mlvss sheng et al 38 also noted that the secretion of eps increased under unfavorable conditions such as dehydration or in a nutrient limiting environment the content of eps was also increased in our case implying that the microorganisms in the sludge could resist the severe environment natural drying and low nutrient environment by releasing eps the content of eps dropped from 70 75 mg g mlvss to 50 17 mg g mlvss during day 5 to day 15 while the ps diminished from 31 73 mg g mlvss to 18 91 mg g mlvss during this period indicating that eps might be used by microorganisms as source of carbon and the ps was mainly consumed the eps content decreased significantly from 50 17 mg g mlvss to 34 37 mg g mlvss during day 15 to day 20 and then tending to be stabilized to 23 41 mg g mlvss on day 30 it is known that eps can accelerate the mutual aggregation of cells thus promoting granulation 67 the pn ps ratio is a significant variable concerning granule stability as granules having higher pn ps ratios are more hydrophobic and more favorable for granulation 7 in this case the pn ps ratio raised continually from 0 94 on day 0 1 65 on day 15 and then decreased to 1 30 on day 30 therefore from the perspective of eps and pn ps the days of continuously adding dewatered sludge should not exceed 15 days with the continuous natural drying process of dewatered sludge the diversity of the microbial community first increased and then decreased the diversity of the microbial community as evaluated by the shannon index was 8 39 for ds0 8 44 for ds5 8 37 for ds10 8 23 for ds20 and 8 20 for ds30 in the nutrient limiting environment microbial diversity did not decrease in the first five days as the lack of nutrition stimulated the growth of some microorganisms increasing the diversity of microorganisms to a certain extent after that the microbial community was impacted some genera gradually became stable after the adjustment while others were unable to adapt to the unfavorable conditions and were finally eliminated which led to the continuous decrease in the shannon index the microbial communities of sludge exhibited an obvious difference at the phylum level during the natural drying process as indicated in fig 6d the first and second dominant phyla in each sample were the proteobacteria and bacteroidetes respectively but they experienced opposite trends during the continuous natural drying process the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased from 35 38 ds0 to 47 35 ds30 while the relative abundance of bacteroidetes decreased from 27 32 ds0 to 12 11 ds30 the phylum proteobacteria as the most important bacterial phylum in activated sludge systems contains a great quantity of important functional bacteria which can remove organic substance 68 and the increase in its relative abundance helped to improve the removal efficiency of pollutants the relative abundance of actinobacteria decreased continually from 7 09 ds0 to 4 31 ds30 based on seviour et al 55 the filamentous bulking of sludge can occur easily and extending the natural drying time of dewatered sludge and then reverting the sludge to the reactor was beneficial to avoid filamentous bulking the relative abundance of firmicutes raised continually from 1 16 ds0 to 4 11 ds30 which may be related to the ability of bacillus and clostridium members of the phylum firmicutes to hydrolyze proteins tang et al 69 conducted microbial studies in a reactor with bovine serum protein as the only carbon source and energy source and found that the proportion of firmicutes accounted for 43 which may be the reason for the continuous digestion of pn in eps in this case other phyla with lower relative abundance fluctuated slightly during the natural drying process including acidobacteria 7 27 9 34 chloroflexi 4 81 7 33 verrucomicrobia 0 85 2 38 and planctomycete 0 61 1 96 which may be caused by the dynamic adjustment of microorganisms in each phylum to fit the new environment 3 8 mechanism and prospect analysis of the effect of continuously adding dewatered sludge to promote rapid granulation in cfr tst although the mechanism involved in ags formation has not yet been confirmed it is generally believed that the formation process mainly constitutes four steps random movement and collision of cells initial attachment to form aggregates through cell surface hydrophobicity increase irreversible polymerization and growth of aggregates within the connection of eps matured granule formation by shear force 3 earlier works confirmed that the random cell to cell contact and initial attachment to form aggregates would lead to a long startup time 66 70 in this study the rapid granulation was mainly attributed to the unique structural design of cfr tst and the perfect combination of continuous dosing of dewatered sludge as nuclei in the start up phase the specific path is shown in fig 7 on the one hand a simple and effective two zone sedimentation tank based on settling velocity was introduced into cfrs during the operation of the reactor the granules with good settleability can be effectively settled in st 1 and it would return to the aeration tank through the airlift system to allow microorganisms that gently congregated and grew on their surfaces to impede the decomposition of ags by traditional reflux sludge pumps while the flocs with poor settling properties would be selected in st 2 and finally discharged from the reactor on the other hand under the action of water shear stress the dewatered sludge that was not dense or compact enough was decomposed into small particles and light flocs the small particles precipitating in st 1 that remained in the reactor can serve as cores 17 71 72 and continuous addition of dewatered sludge in the start up phase would guarantee a sufficient number of nuclei to accelerate the formation of ags under the internal and external factor of water shear stress cell hydrophobicity and eps adsorption bridging the particle morphology inclined to be more regular and denser eventually formulating steady and mature ags 18 73 furthermore it should be noted that enough small granules would produce much more effective collisions the distance between granules would be greatly shortened the information exchange and material transfer process between microorganisms may also be greatly enhanced and the directional aggregation mechanism of particles particles may occur under the action of hydrophobic action van der waals force and bridging adhesion of eps 19 74 75 this artificial strengthening strategy would be an effective way to promote rapid granulation and needs further study at present most of the treatment processes used in wwtps are continuous flow the key point to popularize the practical application of ags technology is how to use simple and effective methods to transform the existing treatment processes and renovate the structures in this study part of the excess sludge was simply naturally dried and returned continuously to the biological reaction tank to promote rapid granulation in addition the selection pressure based on sedimentation velocity was introduced into the slurry separation two zone sedimentation tank was set which can screen out sludge with good settling performance and retain it in the reaction tank meanwhile the problem of breaking the formed particles by conventional reflux sludge pumps was also avoided the two complementary phases will provide a feasible approach for the practical application of ags technology in the traditional continuous flow process as shown in fig 8 4 conclusions the speedy granulation was successfully realized in cfr tst by using the strategy of continuous adding dewatered sludge during the start up phase coupling with two zone sedimentation tank to treat actual domestic sewage with low concentrations the selection pressure produced by the two zone sedimentation tank can discharge light flocs with weak settleability as excess sludge and retain the well setting granules in the reactor the continuous addition of dewatered sludge in the start up phase can make more small particles appear in the aeration tank by acting as nucleus to accelerate the granulation although the dewatered sludge with low biological activity had a slight negative impact on the pollutants degradation in the start up phase the bioactivity of the sludge was enormously upgraded the microbial community and eps altered greatly during the whole process of granulation microbes that promote the secretion of eps and facilitate the degradation of pollutants were enriched the granulation was beneficial to improve the treatment ability of pollutants and the approach developed in this case was simple and eco friendly for a potential large scale application declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this research was financially

13527,rapid granulation was realized in a continuous flow reactor with a two zone sedimentation tank cfr tst and a novel strategy involving the continuous addition of dewatered sludge during the start up phase to treat the actual domestic sewage with low concentration the selection pressure produced by the two zone sedimentation tank can discharge light flocs with poor settleability and retain the fine particles in the reactor the continuous addition of dewatered sludge in the start up phase can increase the small particles in the aeration tank by acting as nuclei to accelerate granulation the experimental results indicated that aerobic granular sludge ags was formed successfully on day 25 the sludge volume index at 5 min svi5 was 37 7 ml g the mean particle size was 0 42 mm and the average settling velocity was 35 2 m h after operated continuously for 45 days the sedimentation capacity and biomass concentration were further enhanced svi5 and the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were stable in the range of 25 8 31 3 ml g and 4200 4600 mg l respectively although the dewatered sludge with low biological activity had a slight negative impact on pollutants degradation in the start up phase the biological activity of the sludge was enormously upgraded compared with those of the inoculated dewatered sludge the sour and dehydrogenase activity of the mature ags increased 3 72 times and 5 01 times on day 84 respectively and microbes that promote the secretion of eps and facilitate the degradation of pollutants were enriched during the whole process of granulation moreover the approach developed in this case was simple and eco friendly for potential full scale implementation keywords continuous flow reactor with two zone sedimentation tank cfr tst aerobic granulation dewatered sludge actual domestic sewage with low concentration 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags technology is a new and promising biological treatment for wastewater to date there are more than 40 full scale ags plants already in operation or under construction worldwide and almost all the plants have been performed in sequential batch reactors sbrs 1 3 with the great success of aerobic granulation in sbrs attention is beginning to turn to continuous flow applications this is a necessary step given the advantages of continuous flow treatment processes and the fact that the most current large scale wastewater operations are using continuous flow systems with aeration tank and sedimentation tank according to a literature review the main problems constraining the development of ags technique in cfrs are focused on two aspects on the one hand it is difficult to achieve the ideal environment for ags formation in cfrs with low hydraulic shear forces weak mass transfer and poor sludge selection mechanisms furthermore conventional sludge reflux pumps easily destroy any ags formed in cfrs on the other hand most studies have shown that it takes 20 40 days to form ags in sbrs 4 5 the granulation process of ags cultured in cfrs requires a longer time 6 7 it is thus necessary to develop an efficient and reliable strategy to realize rapid granulation in cfrs especially for wastewater treatment plants wwtps process operation based on numerous studies of sbrs ags can be cultivated rapidly by gradually shortening the settling time 8 9 however it is difficult to use this selection pressure to retain aerobic sludge with good sedimentation performance in cfrs hydrocyclones based on particle size have been used in full scale continuous flow studies to date at least three full scale facilities have examined the possibility of using hydrocyclones to apply a vortex selection pressure to screen dense and light sludge 3 two facilities required the introduction of anammox granules periodically from a sidestream demon sbr 10 11 while the third facility that did not adopt this strategy and granule formation was not promoted within one year of operation 12 another concern for the use of hydrocyclones is that the loss of volatile solids and the accumulation of inorganic material may lead to a reduction in treatment efficiency therefore it is desirable to introduce a selection pressure into cfrs based on settling velocity in a simple and effective way 3 although there are few studies on rapid cultivation of ags more and more scholars have started to focus on this field and have realized rapid granulation through individual methods based on the crystal nucleus hypothesis the most used method to realize rapid granulation involves the addition of ca2 mg2 and other metal ions into the influent however this kind of excessive and continuous addition mode would lead to not only a reduction in biological activity in sludge but also an increase in economic costs to reduce processing costs li et al 13 and zou et al 14 promoted the formation of ags in sbr and cfr by adding sludge micropowder but there was a lack of in depth study on how to promote the formation of ags and the preparation of sludge micropowder was truly complex and time consuming because granulation is greatly affected by inoculated sludge many studies have been promoted ags formation by inoculating sludge with different characteristics hu et al 15 and muda et al 16 accelerated the process of granulation by inoculating anaerobic granular sludge and the results showed that the supplemented granules broke down into different granular sizes long et al 17 and pijuan et al 18 inoculated partial mature ags and disintegrated ags in the reactor respectively and the granulation was realized in a relatively short time therefore inoculation of anaerobic granular sludge did not accelerate the aerobic granulation process while inoculation of partially mature or broken ags can greatly reduce the formation time of ags however both methods need ags precultivation and it is difficult to obtain enough particles in the start up phase of the wwtps in actual operation in view of these existing rapid cultivation modes of ags there are some problems such as increasing economic cost complicated operation process or the need for ags cultivation in advance however the above problems can be better solved by continuously adding dewatered sludge as an induction core for a certain period coupling of sludge screening in the reactor based on the selection pressure of settling velocity is undoubtedly a new strategy to realize the rapid granulation nevertheless whether the cultivation effect of this method and the low biological activity of dewatered sludge can affect the removal of pollutants how the physical and biological characteristics of the added dewatered sludge change due to long term storage and how this mode can promote the rapid formation of ags are still unknown in addition the organic loading rate olr has been reported to be one of the decisive factors during granulation 19 researchers have claimed that a high olr can promote the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps which further impact ags stability 20 21 however the development and application of ags technology with low strength wastewater could not be ignored completely to date domestic sewage and low strength municipal wastewater have gradually become the treatment object to cultivate ags in cfrs 14 22 26 therefore this study attempted to achieve rapid granulation by adding dewatered sludge continuously during the start up phase coupling with a two zone sedimentation tank to treat real low strength wastewater the effectiveness of this process was evaluated by the effect of characteristics bioactivity microbial community of sludge and contaminants removal to provide technical methods and data support for the speedy formation of ags in the traditional continuous flow process 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and seed sludge the influent wastewater used in this case was actual domestic sewage which was taken from an underground sewage inspection well in a residential area in hangzhou china the characteristics of water quality fluctuate greatly and the main parameters were as follows chemical oxygen demand codcr 200 400 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 10 25 mg l total nitrogen tn 20 45 mg l total phosphorus tp 2 5 mg l and ph 6 8 7 5 dewatered sludge with a water content of approximately 80 and mlvss mlss of 47 65 obtained from belt filter dehydrator of a wwtp situated in hangzhou china the plant used polyacrylamide pam as flocculant and added at a dosage of 2 ppm was used as inoculation sludge after passing through a 100 mesh sieve to remove filamentous and large particles the inoculated sludge was poured into the reactor the seeding sludge had a sludge volume index at 5 min svi5 of 25 6 ml g a mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of 3129 mg l and a mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss of 1491 mg l this sludge was stored in the natural environment of the laboratory for continuously adding during the start up phase of the reactor 2 2 reactor and operation a continuous flow reactor with two zone sedimentation tank cfr tst was used to cultivate ags with a working volume of roughly 26 8 l as shown in fig 1 the reactor was primarily contained an aeration tank 40 cm 15 cm 49 cm a sludge return area 7 5 cm 4 cm 49 cm and a sedimentation tank consisted of two identical zones denoted st 1 and st 2 respectively of the same size 15 cm 15 cm 39 cm each with an area of 225 cm2 and a settling time of around 1 8 h st 2 discharged excess sludge daily air was provided to the aeration tank via microporous aerated sand heads which were uniformly placed at the bottom of the reactor airflow rate of 0 4 m3 h to eliminate the decomposition of ags by traditional return sludge pumps an airlift system was created to return sludge from st 1 to aeration zone in this study airflow rate of 0 1 m3 h a fixing baffle and a movable baffle were connected between the two identical zones in the sedimentation tank the height of the movable baffle can be adjusted to generate different selection pressure on account of the sedimentation velocity the selection pressure was weakened by reducing the height of the baffle relative to the liquid level the baffle was inserted 20 cm below the liquid level at the start of the reactor operation 0 d to create a relatively high selection pressure a peristaltic pump was used to feed wastewater into the aeration zone flow rate 1650 ml h and the hydraulic retention time was about 16 h the olr was 0 30 0 60 kg m3 d and the temperature scope was 25 5 c during the whole experiment to accelerate the aerobic granulation in cfr tst dewatered sludge 100 5 g was continuously added to the aeration tank every day from day 4 to day 17 sludge samples were collected in the aeration tank before and 4 h after dosing a siphon was used to collect equal volume of sludge samples from the surface middle and bottom layer of the aeration tank and then they were sufficiently mixed as the representative samples water samples of the inlet and outlet were collected from influent and effluent pipes respectively 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 analysis of the sludge properties and water quality the morphological changes of the aerobic granules were observed under an optical microscope cx31 olympus japan and the particle size distribution psd of granules was determined by image pro plus analysis 6 0 olympus soft imaging solution the mlss mlvss svi5 suspended solids ss codcr nh4 n tn and tp were analyzed according to the standard methods 27 2 3 2 eps extraction and analysis eps were extracted by the formaldehyde sodium hydroxide method 28 and the sum of the protein pn and polysaccharide ps contents constituted the total amount of eps in this study the pn content of eps was detected by uv spectrophotometer at 595 nm with bovine serum protein bsa as a standard 29 the ps content of eps was measured via the phenol sulfuric acid method using glucose solution as a standard 30 2 3 3 analysis of the sludge biological activity the specific oxygen uptake rate sour and dehydrogenase activity of the sludge were measured by wang et al 31 and the triphenyl tetrazolium chloride ttc method 32 respectively 2 3 4 analysis of the sludge microbial community to explore the change in the microbial community during the whole experimental period with the continuous addition of dewatered sludge high throughput illumina miseq sequencing was performed at zhejiang tianke technology co ltd hangzhou china on the following samples sludge samples from the aeration tank rs0 rs14 ads rs14 rs25 rs40 rs55 and rs75 digital indicates the operation days of the reactor ads is the abbreviation of added dewatered sludge which was sampled 4 h after adding dewatered sludge and dewatered sludge samples placed in the natural environment of the laboratory on different days ds0 ds5 ds10 ds20 and ds30 the microbial dna in the sludge samples were extracted using fast dna spin kits for soil mobio usa according to manufacturer s instructions dna samples were quantified by nanodrop2000 fluorospectrometer thermo scientific usa and dna quality was examined on 1 w w agarose gel afterwards the v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16s rdna sequences were amplified using the 341 f 5 cctacgnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvggtatctaatcc 3 primers 33 the pcr amplification conditions and the thermal programme were referred to our previous research 22 effective tags were obtained by filtering splicing and removing chimeras from the original data by using flash and qiime software and the operational taxonomic units otus with an identity of 98 were separated using uparse the silva database and rdp classifier version 11 4 method were used to annotate the specific otus species and the diversity and community composition of taxonomic information was analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in the morphology of the sludge during the initial period of the reactor 0 3 days the inoculated sludge dewatered sludge was broken into irregular small particles and flocs which were loose in structure with rough edges fig 2 a a at this moment the sludge in the aeration tank had good sedimentation performance with an average sedimentation velocity of 32 5 m h and the sludge discharged from st 2 was mainly flocs fig 2b a from day 4 to day 17 a certain amount of dewatered sludge was added daily to the aeration tank and the variations in sludge morphology before and after sludge addition on day 14 are shown in fig 2a b and a c compared with the initial sludge the sludge on day 14 in the aeration tank was smooth dense and compact which was mainly due to the action of hydraulic shear force after adding dewatered sludge a large number of particle aggregates and flocs with different particle sizes appeared and the average sedimentation velocity decreased to 22 6 m h on day 25 of operation the number of flocs in the aeration tank was greatly reduced and ags with relatively regular shape complete morphology and dense structure appeared fig 2a d the settleability was restored with an average sedimentation velocity of 35 4 m h and the mean particle size was 0 42 mm at this point according to the judgment of previous studies the granulation realized was requiring more than half of the particles had sizes greater than 0 34 mm 34 35 at this point a small number of micro granules fig 2b b also appeared in st 2 as the experiment continued more rounded and denser granular sludge emerged in the aeration tank fig 2a e and a f and the particle size also steadily increased the mean particle size and average sedimentation velocity of the granules were 0 58 mm and 45 1 m h during 84 days of operation and many micro granules appeared in st 2 at this moment fig 2b c 3 2 variations in the sludge physical characteristics mlss mlvss and svi5 are important indicators to characterize sludge performance 36 and the changes in each indicator are shown in fig 3 a and b the granulation process in the aeration tank could be roughly divided into four stages the first stage was the activation phase 0 3 days the inoculated sludge dewatered sludge was broken into numerous particles and flocs because a two zone sedimentation tank was set up in this study well settled granules were always retained in the reactor and a large amount of poorly settled flocs washed away the mlss dropped sharply from 3129 mg l to 2270 mg l and the svi5 increased rapidly from 25 6 ml g to 56 6 ml g during this period microorganisms began to adapt and grow during this stage which was indicated by the increase of mlvss mlss ratio from 47 65 to 62 38 the second stage was the start up phase 4 17 days the dewatered sludge was added daily to the aeration tank which was conducive to the increase in mlss and the decrease in svi5 for example on day 7 mlss increased from 2564 mg l before addition to 3918 mg l after addition and svi5 decreased from 59 6 ml g before addition to 29 2 ml g after addition the ratio of mlvss mlss decreased the values before and after addition were 65 76 and 59 93 respectively mainly due to the relatively low mlvss mlss ratio of the dewatered sludge over time as dual zone selection pressure can retain broken particles with good sedimentation performance this strategy was conducive to maintaining the sludge concentration and improving the sludge settleability in the reactor the values of mlss and svi5 changed from 2270 mg l and 56 6 ml g on day 4 3601 mg l and 45 8 ml g on day 17 respectively all values were obtained before addition the third stage was the granulation phase 18 45 days mlss slowly increased after decreasing to 3718 mg l on day 21 and achieved 4360 mg l on day 45 the increase of mlvss mlss ratio from 53 32 59 93 during this period suggesting that the broken particles with good settling performance can serve as core for the microorganisms that gently accumulated and grow on their surfaces thus accelerating granulation this is compliance with the findings of verawaty et al 8 and pijuan et al 18 who added mature ags to accelerate granulation in the initial stage svi5 rose to 37 7 ml g on day 21 and then slowly fluctuated and decreased the svi5 was 31 3 ml g on day 45 suggesting that the broken particles could maintain good settleability in the process of granulation to avoid excessive sludge loss the fourth stage was the stabilization phase 46 84 days the mlss and svi5 tended to be stable and remained in the range of 4200 4600 mg l and 25 8 31 3 ml g respectively the ratio of mlvss mlss was stable at approximately 60 the ags in the reactor had good settling performance and had many similarities with the initial inoculated dewatered sludge in terms of physical properties 3 3 variations in the sludge biological activity sour and dehydrogenase activity are important indexes to reveal the metabolic activity of sludge 37 the trend of the sour and dehydrogenase activity during the whole experiment is shown in fig 3c the biological activity of dewatered sludge inoculated initially was poor with sour and dehydrogenase activities of only 8 5 mg o2 g mlvss h and 3 09 mg g mlvss respectively there was an increasing trend during the first stage activation phase indicating that the bioactivity of sludge was gradually restored during the second stage start up phase due to the continuous addition of dewatered sludge the growth rate of dehydrogenase activity slowed down and the sour even decreased this result indicated that the sludge in the aeration tank was mainly crushed particles and the biological activity was at a low level which also led to low cod removal efficiency the significant increase in the sour and dehydrogenase activity was fundamentally also observed during the third stage granulation phase the sour and dehydrogenase activity values raised from 17 6 mg o2 g mlvss h and 8 64 mg g mlvss on day 21 30 1 mg o2 g mlvss h and 13 78 mg g mlvss on day 42 respectively the recovery of biological activity of sludge showed that the crushed particles from the dewatered sludge in the start up phase not only acted as nuclei but also underwent a conversion from physical particles to mature ags with huge biological activity differences between them the sour and dehydrogenase activity changed slightly during the fourth stage stabilization phase and were stable in the range of 26 0 30 6 mg o2 g mlvss h and 14 35 16 07 mg g mlvss respectively this means that ags maintained a high biological activity after it was formed and effectively improved the impact resistance and pollutants removal capacity 3 4 variations of the eps component it is known that eps can promote the aggregation of microbial cells and maintain the stability of cell structure thus accelerating the granulation of aerobic sludge 38 which is mainly composed of ps and pn 39 the changes in the eps content and the pn ps ratio of the sludge during the whole experiment are shown in fig 3d during the first and second stage activation and start up phase the eps increased slowly from the initial value of 65 44 mg g mlvss to 88 56 mg g mlvss on day 14 and the pn increased from 33 88 mg g mlvss to 52 59 mg g mlvss while ps rarely increased or even decreased the values were 36 04 mg g mlvss and 35 97 mg g mlvss on day 7 and on day 14 respectively on the one hand the results showed that the initial sludge in the really low olr conditions microorganisms may consume eps as a kind of carbon source due to nutrients deficiency while ps was mainly consumed 37 on the other hand some studies have shown that pn has an optimistic impact on the sedimentation capacity and hydrophobicity of cells and the enhancement in pn in eps was conducive to the formation and steadiness of granules 40 therefore it can be inferred that the crushed particles from dewatered sludge with great settling properties retained in the reactor had a trend of transformation from the initial to mature ags during the third and fourth stages granulation and stabilization phases the eps increased sharply and achieved the peak value of 148 04 mg g mlvss on day 28 and then decreased gradually to 113 98 mg g mlvss on day 42 the value remained at a high level during this period afterwards the eps showed an overall decreasing trend by undulations and eventually dropped to 63 60 mg g mlvss on day 84 this is consistent with the conclusion that eps raised remarkably during granulation but dropped slightly when ags matured 41 42 pn and ps are corresponded to hydrophobic and hydrophilic respectively the increase of pn ps ratio is conducive to granulation 40 the pn ps ratio in this case increased from the beginning and rapidly increased from 1 46 on day 14 to 3 60 on day 28 indicating that the sludge in the reactor was granulated from the beginning and that the mode of continuous addition of dewatered sludge can accelerate the granulation process in addition compared with ps pn played a leading position in granulation which showed no difference with the findings of mcswain et al 41 during the ags stabilization phase pn decreased gradually from 46 69 mg g mlvss to 20 12 mg g mlvss during day 49 to day 84 and pn ps showed a downward trend indicating that ps acted an important part in maintaining the stability of ags 3 5 pollutant removal performance the ss and cod of the effluent were high during the first 17 days fig 4 a with values of 92 118 mg l and 54 2 78 3 mg l respectively the biological activity of sludge was in the first and second stages was poor activation and start up phase and the microorganisms gradually adapted to the new environment resulting in low cod removal efficiency fig 3c illustrates this point as well after that the ss of the effluent sharply decreased to 28 mg l on day 45 and then stabilized at 19 1 4 9 mg l indicating that the reactor was increasingly stable in the process of aerobic granulation the effluent cod was mainly stable under 50 mg l and the removal efficiency fluctuated between 83 23 and 93 84 after 17 days indicating that the third and fourth stages granulation and stabilization phases were conducive to the removal of organic pollutants which is conform to the consequence of xu et al 22 and zhang et al 39 the olr greatly influenced the stabilization and physiological qualities of ags 43 in this study the olr was 0 30 0 60 kg m3 d which was lower than that in normal ags culture conditions within the scope of 1 5 15 kg m3 d 44 and it was even lower than that detected by ni et al 45 who cultivated ags in municipal wastewater with low concentration 0 6 1 0 kg m3 d this showed that the formation of granular sludge in the aerobic system is not directly related to the olr the raise of olr may increase the particle size by accelerating the growth rate of bacteria 46 liu et al 44 raised the size of granules by 0 3 mm through continuously increasing the olr from 3 kg m3 d to 9 kg m3 d the olr conditions in this study was really low and led to the slow growth of microorganisms resulting in the formation of ags with small particle sizes finally nh4 n removal was 86 03 100 during the whole experiment and the effluent nh4 n was lower than 3 mg l except it reached 3 261 mg l on day 12 as shown in fig 4b this is consistent with the observation that more than 90 nh4 n removal efficiency could be achieved when realizing aerobic granulation in cfrs 47 48 in some studies it can even reach 100 49 50 the removal efficiency of tn and tp depends on the operating conditions this study was only carried out in a single aeration tank which had the oxidation of organic matter and ammonia but lacked the capability of denitrification and phosphorus removal which was the primary cause of the low removal rate of tn and tp the microbial growth could have consumed some of the nitrogen and phosphorus for their metabolic activities specifically the average tn removal efficiency was 16 3 1 7 during the first 17 days and then it increased to 27 1 3 4 with a great quantity of no3 n spotted in the effluent fig 4c the enhancement of simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd in the aeration tank promoted the tn removal efficiency to a certain extent as revealed by precious studies 51 52 the efficiency of snd depended to a large extent on the formation of anoxic regions in the granules in this study the small granules the mean particle size was 0 58 mm on day 84 made it easy for do to penetrate into the interior of the granules thus blocking the oxygen deficient core formed by the growth of denitrifying bacteria however there were still a small number of large size granules in the reactor the particle size distribution at 0 5 1 0 mm and 1 0 1 5 mm was 34 2 and 9 1 respectively as shown in fig 4d the removal efficiency of tp fluctuated from 20 83 to 41 60 during the first 17 days which was related to the start up mode of continuous dosing of dewatered sludge every day after that except for a few days most of the tp removal efficiency values fell within the range of 45 65 about 1 2 mg l reduction in tp indicating that the formation and stability of ags was conducive to tp removal 3 6 characterization of the microbial community during different periods of reactor operation high throughput sequencing achieved good quality and valid reads all with 97 coverage including 46081 rs14 45661 ads rs14 46481 rs25 46534 rs40 46608 rs55 and 46785 rs75 this indicated that the real distribution of sludge microorganisms could be well reflected by the gathered gene sequences the diversity of microbial community can be described by the shannon index which was 8 08 for rs0 8 30 for rs14 8 33 for rs25 8 37 for rs40 8 45 for rs55 and 8 56 for rs75 this result implied that the microbial diversity increased during the process of granulation and such results are consistent with those reported by he et al 53 it is noteworthy that the microbial diversity of dewatered sludge added in the start up phase was relatively low which can be reflected from the reduction in the shannon index from 8 30 rs14 to 8 24 ads rs14 indicating that this approach did not affect the microbial diversity during the process of granulation the number of coexisting otus in rs14 rs25 rs40 rs55 and rs75 with rs0 was 1188 1121 1068 948 and 869 respectively besides the results of the otus level cluster dendrogram exhibited that rs75 and rs0 were the farthest fig 5 a illustrating that in the course of granulation the microbial community transformed remarkable which was identical with previous researches 22 52 the phylogenetic classifications of microbial communities in all samples were summarized at the phylum level as shown in fig 5a proteobacteria was the dominant phylum with a relative abundance of 30 74 rs0 29 81 rs14 32 68 ads rs14 33 12 rs25 36 85 rs40 37 80 rs55 and 39 82 rs75 the continuous addition of dewatered sludge during the start up phase was conducive to the enrichment of proteobacteria and with the increase in particle size during granulation the higher abundance of proteobacteria also exhibited proteobacteria play a significant role in carbon cycle 54 which indirectly indicated that the treatment capacity of pollutants was improved during the granulation process bacteroidetes commonly exist in feces and are generally found in domestic sewage treatment plants 3 bacteroidetes was the second dominant phylum in this study the relative abundance of bacteroidetes was 36 05 rs0 25 74 rs14 26 78 ads rs14 21 27 rs25 24 91 rs40 23 92 rs55 and 21 86 rs75 these results are identical with previous studies where proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most dominant phyla in activated sludge or ags 22 52 other phyla with lower relative abundances including acidobacteria 6 24 13 32 chloroflexi 5 20 9 93 planctomycete 0 86 5 73 verrucomicrobia 1 27 2 77 and firmicutes 0 57 2 32 were discovered in previous researches as well 14 52 it is noteworthy that the relative abundance of actinobacteria increased first from 3 77 rs0 to 4 42 rs14 and then decreased to 1 84 rs75 while the addition of dewatered sludge helped reduce the relative abundance of actinobacteria the relative abundance of actinobacteria in rs14 and ads rs14 was 4 42 and 3 97 respectively actinobacteria was related to the sludge filamentation bulking 55 implying that the continuous addition of dewatered sludge in the start up phase can inhibit the sludge filamentous while the selection pressure created by the sedimentation tank with two zone continues to ensure this inhibition thus accelerating the formation and stabilization of ags as shown in fig 5b the top 10 species with the highest relative abundances of each sample were selected at the genus level to generate a cumulative cylindrical map zoogloea is frequently detected in ags treatment systems which can promote eps secretion and combines cells together 56 57 the relative abundance of zoogloea increased from 4 22 rs0 to 6 55 rs75 during the continuous operation of the reactor it is speculated that the selection pressure produced by the sedimentation tank with two zone can screen out more microbes consist with eps secretion thus promoting the speedy granulation the relative abundances of rhodobacter were 2 39 rs0 1 38 rs14 1 70 ads rs14 2 15 rs25 3 14 rs40 4 46 rs55 and 4 37 rs75 indicating that the continuous addition of dewatered sludge in the start up phase was conducive to the enrichment of rhodobacter the rapid growth of which occurred after the formation of ags this result is accord with the conclusion of zhang et al 58 indicating that in ags system rhodobacter is a kind of principal microorganism which can play as a stabilizing role flavobacterium is also an extensive reported genus that can improve the stability of ags and is used to describe the ags maturity 59 60 with a relative abundance of 1 46 in rs0 while raised to 2 45 in rs75 which also effectively guaranteed the ags stability in this case thiothrix is reported to be a conventional filamentous bacterium 61 the relative abundance of thiothrix was only 0 02 in rs0 and increased to 0 23 in rs14 while the addition of dewatered sludge reduced it to 0 09 in ads rs14 afterwards the relative abundance of thiothrix increased steadily to 1 09 in rs75 from this result it can be inferred that thiothrix may act a significant part in the granulation process which have also been pointed in previous researches 22 57 some ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos including ferruginibacter ottowia and flavobacterium showed an upward trend during granulation which are able to effectively decompose organic substances for n removal nitrosomonas and nitrospira are the typical representatives of ammoniac oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob which were the most commonly detected in cfrs 62 63 the relative abundances of nitrosomonas and nitrospira were 1 37 and 2 22 rs0 1 49 and 2 51 rs14 1 22 and 2 31 ads rs14 1 46 and 2 61 rs25 1 64 and 2 95 rs40 1 73 and 3 02 rs55 and 1 82 and 3 11 rs75 respectively it can be seen that continuous addition of dewatered sludge did not help the enrichment of these two genera while the abundance of these two genera increased to a certain extent during the process of granulation promoting nitrification the reason may be owing to the selection pressure produced by the sedimentation tank with two zone which retains the granules with well settleability can settle in st 1 allowing them to stay in the reactor for a long time thus providing opportunities for the growth of nitrobacteria this is consistent with the conclusion that both nitrosomonas and nitrospira are chemoautotrophic bacteria and need long sludge residence times to enrich 64 zoogloea thiothrix and haliangium were the main denitrobacteria in this study 65 and the relative abundance of zoogloea and thiothrix raised from 4 22 and 0 02 in rs0 to 6 55 and 1 09 in rs75 respectively however the abundance of haliangium was significantly reduced from 1 29 in rs0 to 0 28 in rs75 these findings demonstrated that snd was effectively promoted during the process of granulation thus improving the capacity of n removal in the reactor in addition candidatus accumulsifier a phosphate accumulating organism pao increased from 0 87 rs0 to 2 45 rs75 during the process of granulation which indirectly indicated that the formation and stability of ags was conducive to the removal of tp principal component analysis pca was carried out to further illustrate the change in the microbial community in granular sludge the distance between points based on pca can reflect the degree of sample difference as shown in fig 5c pc1 and pc2 revealed the two most notable differences with contribution rates of 21 74 and 11 14 respectively owing to the selection pressure created by the sedimentation tank with two zone the distance between rs0 and rs14 were relatively far which allowed the sludge with good settling property to stay flocculated and coagulated microbial communities in the sludge were retained and continued to reproduce and flocs with poor sedimentation is discharged as excess sludge in addition dewatered sludge was added every day from day 4 to day 17 and the microbial community of the dewatered sludge stored in the natural environment also varied over time in conclusion under the continuous promotion of both factors the microbial abundance and community changed significantly the gaps between other sample points gradually narrowed with the formation of ags such as those between rs25 and rs40 or rs40 and rs55 which showed no difference with the cluster dendrogram in fig 5a demonstrating that compared with the formation process of ags with the increase of particle size the composition of bacterial community changed slightly it is remarkable that rs0 was the farthest from rs75 which proves ones again that the microbial community transformed tremendously during the entire granulation 3 7 variations in dewatered sludge characteristics in this study dewatered sludge was continuously added every day during the start up phase of the reactor from day 4 to day 17 the properties and microbial flora variations of dewatered sludge stored in the natural environment of the laboratory over time would have a certain impact on the results mlvss mlss can indirectly reflect the quantity of microorganisms in sludge as shown in fig 6 a the value was only 50 03 on day 0 decreased to 43 02 on day 15 and then reached a stable state 42 01 on day 30 the results showed that some microbes could not adapt to the poor nutrition environment and consumed themselves under the effect of endogenous respiration while others with low dependence on nutrients could survive in these unfavorable conditions the svi5 of dewatered sludge was very low and was reduced from 27 2 ml g on day 0 10 1 ml g on day 15 and then the svi5 was stable 7 1 ml g on day 30 therefore adding dewatered sludge continuously during the start up phase combined with the selection mechanism of the two zone sedimentation tank the broken particles from dewatered sludge with good settleability would stay in the aeration tank improving the sludge concentration and acting as nuclei which provided the possibility for rapid granulation as indicated in fig 6b the biological activity of dewatered sludge decreased continuously during the natural drying process the dehydrogenase activity and sour decreased slowly from 5 44 mg g mlvss and 12 7 mg o2 g mlvss h on day 0 3 79 mg g mlvss and 7 5 mgo2 g mlvss h on day 15 and then dropped rapidly to 2 13 mg g mlvss and 2 6 mgo2 g mlvss h on day 20 respectively continuous addition of dewatered sludge will reduce the overall biological activity of sludge in the reactor and affect the removal efficiency of pollutants from this point of view the number of days of continuous addition should not exceed 15 days the variations in eps content and pn ps of dewatered sludge during natural drying are shown in fig 6c eps increased from 67 23 mg g mlvss to 70 75 mg g mlvss during the first five days pn increased by 6 51 mg g mlvss while ps declined by 2 98 mg g mlvss liu et al 66 discussed the variations of eps in sludge at 72 h during the natural drying conditioning process and the eps increased from the initial value of 109 4 mg g mlvss to 158 6 mg g mlvss sheng et al 38 also noted that the secretion of eps increased under unfavorable conditions such as dehydration or in a nutrient limiting environment the content of eps was also increased in our case implying that the microorganisms in the sludge could resist the severe environment natural drying and low nutrient environment by releasing eps the content of eps dropped from 70 75 mg g mlvss to 50 17 mg g mlvss during day 5 to day 15 while the ps diminished from 31 73 mg g mlvss to 18 91 mg g mlvss during this period indicating that eps might be used by microorganisms as source of carbon and the ps was mainly consumed the eps content decreased significantly from 50 17 mg g mlvss to 34 37 mg g mlvss during day 15 to day 20 and then tending to be stabilized to 23 41 mg g mlvss on day 30 it is known that eps can accelerate the mutual aggregation of cells thus promoting granulation 67 the pn ps ratio is a significant variable concerning granule stability as granules having higher pn ps ratios are more hydrophobic and more favorable for granulation 7 in this case the pn ps ratio raised continually from 0 94 on day 0 1 65 on day 15 and then decreased to 1 30 on day 30 therefore from the perspective of eps and pn ps the days of continuously adding dewatered sludge should not exceed 15 days with the continuous natural drying process of dewatered sludge the diversity of the microbial community first increased and then decreased the diversity of the microbial community as evaluated by the shannon index was 8 39 for ds0 8 44 for ds5 8 37 for ds10 8 23 for ds20 and 8 20 for ds30 in the nutrient limiting environment microbial diversity did not decrease in the first five days as the lack of nutrition stimulated the growth of some microorganisms increasing the diversity of microorganisms to a certain extent after that the microbial community was impacted some genera gradually became stable after the adjustment while others were unable to adapt to the unfavorable conditions and were finally eliminated which led to the continuous decrease in the shannon index the microbial communities of sludge exhibited an obvious difference at the phylum level during the natural drying process as indicated in fig 6d the first and second dominant phyla in each sample were the proteobacteria and bacteroidetes respectively but they experienced opposite trends during the continuous natural drying process the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased from 35 38 ds0 to 47 35 ds30 while the relative abundance of bacteroidetes decreased from 27 32 ds0 to 12 11 ds30 the phylum proteobacteria as the most important bacterial phylum in activated sludge systems contains a great quantity of important functional bacteria which can remove organic substance 68 and the increase in its relative abundance helped to improve the removal efficiency of pollutants the relative abundance of actinobacteria decreased continually from 7 09 ds0 to 4 31 ds30 based on seviour et al 55 the filamentous bulking of sludge can occur easily and extending the natural drying time of dewatered sludge and then reverting the sludge to the reactor was beneficial to avoid filamentous bulking the relative abundance of firmicutes raised continually from 1 16 ds0 to 4 11 ds30 which may be related to the ability of bacillus and clostridium members of the phylum firmicutes to hydrolyze proteins tang et al 69 conducted microbial studies in a reactor with bovine serum protein as the only carbon source and energy source and found that the proportion of firmicutes accounted for 43 which may be the reason for the continuous digestion of pn in eps in this case other phyla with lower relative abundance fluctuated slightly during the natural drying process including acidobacteria 7 27 9 34 chloroflexi 4 81 7 33 verrucomicrobia 0 85 2 38 and planctomycete 0 61 1 96 which may be caused by the dynamic adjustment of microorganisms in each phylum to fit the new environment 3 8 mechanism and prospect analysis of the effect of continuously adding dewatered sludge to promote rapid granulation in cfr tst although the mechanism involved in ags formation has not yet been confirmed it is generally believed that the formation process mainly constitutes four steps random movement and collision of cells initial attachment to form aggregates through cell surface hydrophobicity increase irreversible polymerization and growth of aggregates within the connection of eps matured granule formation by shear force 3 earlier works confirmed that the random cell to cell contact and initial attachment to form aggregates would lead to a long startup time 66 70 in this study the rapid granulation was mainly attributed to the unique structural design of cfr tst and the perfect combination of continuous dosing of dewatered sludge as nuclei in the start up phase the specific path is shown in fig 7 on the one hand a simple and effective two zone sedimentation tank based on settling velocity was introduced into cfrs during the operation of the reactor the granules with good settleability can be effectively settled in st 1 and it would return to the aeration tank through the airlift system to allow microorganisms that gently congregated and grew on their surfaces to impede the decomposition of ags by traditional reflux sludge pumps while the flocs with poor settling properties would be selected in st 2 and finally discharged from the reactor on the other hand under the action of water shear stress the dewatered sludge that was not dense or compact enough was decomposed into small particles and light flocs the small particles precipitating in st 1 that remained in the reactor can serve as cores 17 71 72 and continuous addition of dewatered sludge in the start up phase would guarantee a sufficient number of nuclei to accelerate the formation of ags under the internal and external factor of water shear stress cell hydrophobicity and eps adsorption bridging the particle morphology inclined to be more regular and denser eventually formulating steady and mature ags 18 73 furthermore it should be noted that enough small granules would produce much more effective collisions the distance between granules would be greatly shortened the information exchange and material transfer process between microorganisms may also be greatly enhanced and the directional aggregation mechanism of particles particles may occur under the action of hydrophobic action van der waals force and bridging adhesion of eps 19 74 75 this artificial strengthening strategy would be an effective way to promote rapid granulation and needs further study at present most of the treatment processes used in wwtps are continuous flow the key point to popularize the practical application of ags technology is how to use simple and effective methods to transform the existing treatment processes and renovate the structures in this study part of the excess sludge was simply naturally dried and returned continuously to the biological reaction tank to promote rapid granulation in addition the selection pressure based on sedimentation velocity was introduced into the slurry separation two zone sedimentation tank was set which can screen out sludge with good settling performance and retain it in the reaction tank meanwhile the problem of breaking the formed particles by conventional reflux sludge pumps was also avoided the two complementary phases will provide a feasible approach for the practical application of ags technology in the traditional continuous flow process as shown in fig 8 4 conclusions the speedy granulation was successfully realized in cfr tst by using the strategy of continuous adding dewatered sludge during the start up phase coupling with two zone sedimentation tank to treat actual domestic sewage with low concentrations the selection pressure produced by the two zone sedimentation tank can discharge light flocs with weak settleability as excess sludge and retain the well setting granules in the reactor the continuous addition of dewatered sludge in the start up phase can make more small particles appear in the aeration tank by acting as nucleus to accelerate the granulation although the dewatered sludge with low biological activity had a slight negative impact on the pollutants

13528,this work aims to prepare a robust yet low cost dual layer hollow fibre ceramic membrane composite membrane dlzk fabricated by co extrusion phase inversion co sintering technique to be used in wastewater treatment the dope suspensions were extruded simultaneously where the outer layer consists of zirconia while the inner layer consists of a mixture of kaolin and zirconia to enhance membrane performance in terms of mechanical strength and wastewater treatment capability the effects of co sintering temperature from 1200 to 1500 c on the membrane s mechanical strength porosity pore size water permeability and dissolubility in high alkaline ph condition were investigated the membrane performance was evaluated by real wastewater treatment test using two different types of industrial wastewaters which are palm oil mill effluent and textile industry wastewater the findings show that the proposed method of producing the dlzk membranes could provide good interfacial adhesion and well dispersed zirconia in the outer layer and the use of kaolin as an alternative natural material for ceramic membrane fabrication the dlzk co sintered at 1200 c had the mechanical strength of 65 mpa only 3 5 loss of the original shape in high alkaline solution and removed almost 95 for all parameters of cod toc tn nh3 n and tss in the both wastewaters suitable for microfiltration purpose keywords dual layer hollow fibre ceramic membrane kaolin zirconia co sintering wastewater treatment 1 introduction the research on the hollow fibre membrane configurations has been extensively investigated due to its high surface area and compact design nevertheless the enhancement on commercial membrane by various types of modifications has been one of the interests in order to reduce the fabrication cost as such by using alternative low cost materials diversifying fabrication techniques to improve the separation porosity pore size and enhancing the morphology properties and performance of the membrane however modification on the membrane surface such as hydrothermal treatment 1 and sol gel coating 2 is time consuming the difficulty to control the hydrolysis parameter and condensation rate of the reactive precursor to match the chemical reactivity of two alkoxides during the gelation process 3 is another drawback of membrane modifications thus dual layer hollow fibre membrane fabricated using co extrusion and co sintering technique is the best solution to encounter aforementioned obstacles meanwhile ceramic dual layer hollow fibre membrane fabricated using co extrusion technique is commonly applied for fuel cell 4 7 plus for water separation application this technique was commonly fabricated from polymeric materials 8 10 meanwhile feng et al 11 and zhu et al 12 stated that co sintering is one of the methods to fabricate multilayer ceramic membrane which reduces the cost of production and enhances the interlayer adhesion between the ceramic layers the common conflict of co sintering is the thermal mismatch between each layer due to different types of ceramic powders compositions and particle sizes of each layer contributing to different behaviours in this study co sintering was applied to fabricate the membrane the effect of co sintering on the adhesion or bonding strength between the dual layers was investigated researchers have tremendously explored the application of ceramic membranes for wastewater treatment from different sources such as industries households and restaurants due to their excellent characteristics such as high mechanical strength high chemical and thermal stability easy maintenance and highly resistance to membrane s fouling recently ceramic materials derived from natural occurring aluminosilicate minerals such as pozzolan 13 kaolinite 14 bentonite 15 bauxite 16 ball clay 17 and industrial agricultural wastes like fly ash 18 aluminium dross 19 hydroxyapatite 20 and rice husk ash 21 have emerged as alternative materials for ceramic membrane fabrication not only the cost of these materials is lower but they also possess similar characteristics to materials commonly used in fabricating ceramic membranes which are alumina al2o3 silica sio2 zirconia zro2 and titania tio2 as well as polymeric membranes kaolin al₂si₂o₅ oh ₄ or kaolinite is one of the promising alternative materials for ceramic membrane fabrication it is made up of aluminosilicate al2sio5 which has similar properties to commercial alumina and silica and has been used for various membrane applications 22 26 despite the advantages such as high plasticity low sintering temperature and high mechanical strength the ceramic membrane prepared from kaolin possesses drawbacks in low chemical stability its tendency to dissolve in a high concentration of alkali hinders the use of the membrane in highly alkaline environments such as membrane contactor 27 or membrane filtration on the other hand zirconium dioxide zro2 also known as zirconia is one of the commonly used materials for ceramic membrane fabrication due to its high melting point 2700 c it exhibits excellent heat resistance high toughness abrasion resistance and chemical resistance leading to its wide utilisation as a ceramic material 28 nishiyama et al 29 30 modified silica based membrane by adding zirconia to improve the dissolution of the silica based membrane in alkaline condition kumar et al 26 altered the surface of kaolin based membrane by adding zirconia based materials to be used in alkaline condition the interaction of zirconia and silica in kaolin was exploited as the composition of silica in kaolin exceeds 60 of its total composition and because of that high content of silica which make kaolin prone to be dissolved in alkaline condition as explained detail by niibori et al 31 previous studies that used alternative materials for ceramic membrane fabrication have proven the ability of these membranes to be used in membrane separation especially in oily wastewater treatment 19 32 34 in membrane separation for removal of oily wastewater ceramic membrane was chosen due to its hydrophilic behaviour due to the presence of the surface hydroxyl oh groups 35 36 which allows only water to pass through the membrane wall and leaves the oil behind these remarkable properties allow these membranes to be used for further improvement kaolin and zirconia are hydrophilic due to the presence of oh therefore these two materials were chosen in this work previous studies on the effect of hydrophilicity of kaolin 37 38 and zirconia 39 42 have shown that the membrane support coated with zirconia showed higher flux compared to uncoated and pristine membranes the mixture of zirconia silica has more advantages as ceramic glasses due to the formation of siozr heterolinkages which attributes to tetragonal stabilisation 3 determining the content of sio2 is crucial as high sio2 content contributes to slower crystal growth and unstable tetragonal reaction hence leading to slower diffusion surrounding the matrix meanwhile low sio2 content creates a large amount of siozr this oxide is a chemical impurity that stabilises the tetragonal phase normally sol gel or dip coating is the most common method used to create this linkage where the crystal is allowed to grow on the membrane surface kim and lin 43 and wu and cheng 44 used this technique where zr was deposited on a support typically made up from alumina or silica park et al 45 used the same method but the zrsi was synthesised separately before deposited on a support meanwhile hove et al 46 and song et al 47 used hydrothermal techniques to deposit zr on si membrane according to toba 48 the deposition of zirconia on the surface of silica based membrane by sol gel method has shown great zrosi bond which is alkali resistant meanwhile rodríguez avendaño et al 49 reported that mesoporous si zr prepared using sol gel influenced the textural properties of the membranes hence the use of zr si has gained interest in membrane fabrication due to its mesoporous property which is suitable for membrane filtration as well high resistance to alkali which is suitable for high ph wastewater such as wastewater containing ammonia therefore these two materials were chosen in this work the motivation of this study is to develop asymmetrical dual layer hydrophilic microfiltration membrane using zirconia and kaolin which have good water flux and rejection for the removal of contaminants in the industrial wastewater to the best of our knowledge this membrane has received a little attention in this work a novel dual layer hollow fibre membrane derived from kaolin and zirconia dlzk was fabricated by using phase inversion based co extrusion co sintering technique the dlzk was co sintered at different sintering temperatures to study the effect of the sintering temperatures on the morphology and physical characteristics of the membranes and subsequently the membrane performance water and ammonia flux the aim of using this co extrusion method is to reduce the time and cost for the fabrication of the membrane and introduce an alternative technique to deposit zirconia on top of the membrane support plus the membrane can improve the dissolution of the silica based ceramic membrane in high alkaline solution the performance of the membrane for oily wastewater filtration rejection was tested to study membrane fouling the best membrane configuration from this study can potentially be used in many applications such as membrane contactor or membrane distillation where the membrane needs to withstand high temperature and possess high chemical resistance and mechanical strength 2 materials and experimental 2 1 materials kaolin powder was purchased from bg oil chem sdn bhd malaysia as the inner layer and zirconia powder zirconium iv oxide zro2 from across for the outer layer as the ceramic material n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp was purchased from merck and used as a solvent polyethersulfone pesf as a binder was provided by amoco chemicals and arlacel 135 croda was used as a dispersant to hold the dope suspension in a homogenous suspension the raw kaolin powder and pesf were heated to 100 c in an oven to remove any adsorbed moisture and were used without any purification process then tap water was used as a non solvent coagulant bath ammonium hydroxide nh4 oh used for an alkaline solution was purchased from merck u s a industrial wastewaters used in this study were taken from two different sources palm oil mill effluent pome was taken from an effluent pond aeration pond in felda kulai palm oil mill 1 44 21 9 n 103 38 52 5 e and textile industry ti wastewater was taken from a textile factory in parit raja johor 1 51 36 9 n 103 05 41 4 e the pome wastewater sample was collected at the aeration pond due to the content of oil in this pond considered low if to be compared to the raw pome pond as this study aim to produce a microfiltration range membrane it is advisable to avoid the use of raw pome so that the membrane is not prone to fouling easily based on the toc and cod value for the pome it was proven the pome still considered oily the wastewater samples were filtered using whatman grade 1 qualitative filter paper 25 mm to remove any suspended solids prior to filtration using dlzk the wastewater samples were stored at 4 c and restored to ambient temperature 25 c before experiments table 1 depicts the characterisation of the oily wastewater used in this work the characteristics tested were chemical oxygen demand cod according to hach method 8000 dr5000 hach spectrophotometer usa ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n according to hach salicylate method method 10031 total nitrogen tn by persulfate digestion method method 10072 total suspended solid tss according to american public health association apha total organic carbon toc dc 190 and ph milwaukee mw101 pro ph meter 2 2 fabrication of kaolin zirconia dual layer hollow fibre the procedure for the membrane fabrication was adapted from othman et al 45 where the zirconia kaolin composite membrane was prepared through phase inversion based co extrusion co sintering technique the fabrication parameters were adapted from hubadillah et al 46 two dope suspensions were used as the inner and outer layers as shown in table 2 the kaolin zirconia mixture was used as the inner layer or membrane support and zirconia only was used as the outer layer the suspension extrusion rate for the inner layer was kept at 10 ml min and 8 ml min for the outer layer the bore fluid water extrusion rate was kept at 10 ml min using a tube in triple orifice spinneret the air gap between the water surface to the end of the spinneret was 5 cm in this study tap water was used as the internal and external coagulant before the spinning process the suspensions were degassed at room temperature to remove any trapped air the schematic diagram of the membrane fabrication is shown in fig 1 where the tap water acted as bore fluid flows from the top of the spinneret along with a separate dope suspension of mixed kaolin and zirconia as the inner layer and zirconia only as the outer layer to create the bore for the hollow fibre configuration fig 2 shows the dimension of the triple orifice spinneret where the diameters of the bore fluid void inner layer and outer layer are 0 8 2 6 and 3 5 mm respectively the diameter of the bore fluid determines the diameter of the inner diameter of the hollow fibre membrane whereas the outer layer thickness is determined by the viscosity and ceramic loading of the dope suspension the dual layer precursor hollow fibres were then co sintered in a tubular furnace at 1200 1300 1400 and 1500 c co sintering means that the membrane was sintered simultaneously with each layer adhering together during the sintering process the co sintering rate was abruptly increased before reaching the targeted temperature to minimise the sintering behaviour mismatch between the dual layers as well as to achieve an optimum co sintering profile with desired sintering temperature and microstructure of the membranes the precursor was co sintered at four different temperatures to investigate the effect of co sintering temperature on the morphology and performance of the membrane there were two different ramping rates of co sintering process used i e 5 and 10 c min 1 and the sintering profile is shown in fig 3 where t is the time for holding time while r is the ramping rate co sintering method for ceramic membrane preparation conventionally a multilayer ceramic membrane can be obtained by repeating the coating procedure but the complicated time and energy consuming production process which generally comprises several sequential steps induces high price obviously reducing or combining steps is expected to cut production time and costs and thereby ceramic membrane price as a method for fabrication of multilayer structures the co sintering process has attracted increasing attention due to simple preparation process and low production cost including ceramic membranes 12 50 the fabricated dual layer hollow fibre membrane dlzk was expected to be composed of zirconium dioxide zirconia zro2 green at the outer layer and mixed kaolin yellow and zro2 at the inner layer as illustrated in fig 4 2 3 characterisations of dual layer hollow fibres dlzk before the spinning process the viscosity of the dope suspension was measured using a brooklyn rheometer a scanning electron microscope sem jeol jsm 6360 was used to examine the morphology and cross section of the dlzk energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx was used to determine the presence of zirconia on top of the membrane atomic force microscopy afm model s ii nanotechnology spa 300 hv hitachi high technologies u s a was used to measure the surface roughness of the membrane imagej software was used to provide detailed descriptions of the membrane to estimate the pore size distribution and overall porosity of the membrane through this software the pore size distribution and porosity of the dlzk were identified by the representation of black and white areas from sem images through modification of the threshold the black region represents the pores while the white region represents the particles then the porosity was determined by calculating the percentage of the black regions while the average pore diameter was determined by assuming cylindrical porous texture of the membrane while the colour intensity of the wastewater colour was measured using dr5000 spectrophotometer usa method 10048 where the sample transmittance is measured from 400 to 700 nm scale used by the american dye manufacturers institute admi for colour value from the apha the colour was measured for every 10 min of 100 min of test duration 2 4 mechanical strength of dlzk the mechanical strength of hollow fibres was examined by three point bending test using a tensile tester instron 5544 provided with a load cell of 1 kn dlzk was fixed on the sample holder with a 30 mm distance the bending strength σf was calculated using eq 1 1 σ f 8 f l d o π d o 4 d i 4 where f is the measured load at which fracture occurred n and l do and di are the length m the outer diameter m and the inner diameter of the hollow fibre m respectively 2 5 dissolution stability test of dlzk in harsh condition dissolution or stability test was run to investigate dlzk performance in harsh condition which is a high alkaline condition the membranes were dipped in 20 g l or 10 m ph 13 of ammonium hydroxide nh4oh solution for 72 h and agitated on a digital orbital shaker intertek heathrow scientific llc usa at 250 rpm as shown in fig 5 the initial and final concentrations of nh4oh and the initial and final weights of the membranes were recorded the rate of membrane dissolution was determined by calculating the percentage of weight loss at the end of the test the ability of the membrane to sustain its original weight indicates its ability to perform well in a harsh condition the ammonia concentration was measured using dr5000 hach spectrophotometer usa with hach ammonia nh3 n reagent set hach salicylate method method 10031 and apha method ammonia was chosen as it is considered as one of the most dangerous pollutants which need to be removed from wastewater and the ph of water is high alkali when the concentration of ammonia is high three membranes were used for each co sintering temperature and the average value was calculated and recorded 2 6 measurement of permeation flux of dlzk and evaluation on real wastewater rejection test water permeation test was used to determine the effect of co sintering temperature on the membrane s ability to be used in microfiltration process in a cross flow filtration system water was flowed through the membrane walls or pores and the flux j l m2 h was calculated using eq 2 2 j v a t the test was conducted using distilled water as the feed towards the pores of the membrane around 5 cm of the membrane was potted on an adapter and plucked to a 20 cm stainless steel module connected by a tube to a tank and a pressure gauge passing through a diaphragm pump the pressure of the system was kept at 1 bar for all runs the permeate or flux was measured every 10 min for 100 min for each run the test was carried out using the same cross flow microfiltration system for the wastewater permeation test two sources of wastewaters were used which are pome wastewater representing oily wastewater and ti wastewater representing dye wastewater the rationale for choosing pome in this study is to determine the ability of fabricated dlzk in removing oily wastewater as pome is known to have high content of oil residual textile wastewater was selected as another wastewater sample in order to prove the ability of the dlzk in removing colorant material or dye the chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n contents in the wastewater samples were measured before and after the dlzk filtration the percentage of wastewater rejection coefficient r and concentrations of the feed cf and the permeate cp were calculated according to eq 3 3 r c f c p c f 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology of dlzk after the co sintering process the image of co sintered dlzk was pictured as in fig 6 the morphology of the dlzk was characterised using sem and the images as can be seen in fig 7 the sem images were divided into different cross sectional magnifications of 60 200 and 3000 the formation of micro voids and the melting of the kaolin particles are obvious in the dlzk co sintered at 1500 c the melting sign started to show in the dlzk co sintered at 1300 c can be seen at 3000 magnification and became more obvious when the co sintering temperature was increased in the dlzk co sintered at 1400 c the kaolin particles showed more signs of melting less zirconia white particles was observed in the dlzk co sintered at 1500 c compared to other co sintered dlzk because the kaolin particles had melted which caused the zirconia particles to be embedded in the melted kaolin particles when the co sintering temperature was increased the thickness of the dlzk decreased as shown in table 3 the formation of micro voids structure enhances membrane permeation of the membrane while for the inner layer of the dlzk sintered at 1500 c showed the obvious formation of micro voids structure the micro voids at the outer layer was covered with melted kaolin particles according to jamaludin et al 51 as sintering temperature increased the formation of dense structure for ceramic membrane became obvious due to the melting of the particles the adhesion between the bilayers appeared to be excellent due to the different melting points of each layer in addition jong et al 52 showed that the presence of pesf as a polymer binder in the ceramic composition helped the adhesion process between the layers wu et al 53 also stated that the co extrusion by phase inversion method for dual layer fabrication enhanced the adhesion between each layer in this study the adhesion is supported by the presence of zirconia which acted as the nuclei to attract the surrounding atoms to bond with silica si4 and oh ions to form a strong bond with each other indirectly this increases the mechanical strength of the membrane as can be seen in the sem images with 60 and 200 magnification fig 7 in addition the different melting points of zirconia and kaolin lead to different membrane behaviours at different sintering temperatures zirconia possesses a higher melting point than kaolin hence it does not show any melting on the other hand based on our preliminary experiment the adhesion between the membrane interlayer was more visible if the same material is present in each layer therefore this study used a mixture of zirconia and kaolin in the inner layer to improve the adhesion process sem edx images for dlzk are shown in fig 8 where the zr particles are present on the membrane top as indicated by the green colour however for dlzk co sintered at 1500 c the edx cannot detect the presence of zr since it was embedded in kaolin image not shown fig 8 shows that when the co sintering temperature was increased the amount of zr deposited on the outer layer decreased due to the melting of kaolin which caused the zr particles to become more packed and hence embedded into the kaolin layer fig 9 present three dimensional afm images of dlzk at co sintering temperatures the surface roughness of the membranes was analysed using afm scans in 10 μm 10 μm spots as stated by hubadillah et al 54 the bright area articulates the higher point or the height of the particles on the surface of the membrane while the dark area presents valleys or membranes pores based on the 3d images the value of ra nm was decreasing as the co sintering temperature increasing this value of ra or sa in some literatures indicated that as the value is decreasing so does the surface roughness in decreasing 55 they added from the 3d images also can be used to describe the pore size of the membranes however the result may be different from other method as in porosity test due to the area where the images were captured nevertheless from fig 9 it can be concluded that as co sintering temperature increased the value of ra decreased or the height of the particles becoming smaller hence producing a smoother surface due to melting of the membrane which will be described detail in surface porosity and pore size distribution section of the membrane in order to enlighten the schematic mechanism of the interaction of zirconia and kaolin aluminosilicate cormier et al 56 and ficheux et al 57 have explained in details in their study according to them zr has various beneficial in ceramics as such improving the chemical durability or mechanical resistance of the ceramics as well as increasing viscosity and decreasing thermal expansion when added to kaolin or aluminosilicate this zr will adopt to any variable environments depending on its content or network polymerization as a matter of fact zr has been observed as the dominant species in various alumino silicate glasses and these high coordinated species could trigger the nucleation of zro2 to connect to other linkage to sio4 or alo4 in kaolin from their study also the addition of zro2 would therefore lead to the transformation of silicon linked with three network forming units sio4 or alo4 and one non bridging oxygen nbo to a silicon linked with four network forming units considering zr as a network former nucleation as more zro2 was added more cations are required to balance the charge of zr sites producing fewer non bridging oxygen species and a network repolymerization is expected the schematic diagram of the kaolin aluminosilicate and zirconia is shown in fig 10 3 2 mechanical strength of dlzk the effect of co sintering temperature on the mechanical strength of the membrane was investigated prior to its performance as shown in fig 11 dlzk co sintered at 1500 c had the highest mpa of 177 mpa indicating that the membrane is the strongest the dlzk membrane co sintered at 1200 c showed the lowest mechanical strength of only 65 mpa while the dlzk co sintered at 1300 and 1400 c had the mechanical strengths of 119 and 141 mpa respectively even though the mpa values obtained in this study are lower compared to those from the study by wu et al 58 which used zirconia they are still higher than those from the study by hubadillah et al 24 which used kaolin hollow fibre membrane in aforementioned study the highest mechanical strength was 65 mpa from the membrane sintered at 1500 c while this study recorded a value of 177 mpa were both studies used alternative material on the other hand according to study by abdullah et al 59 of using commercial alumina and paiman et al 60 of using commercial yittria stablized zirconia ysz the value of mechanical strength for both study considered high due to these materials which already commercialised to produce high mechanical strength ceramic membrane according to hubadillah et al 32 the melting of the ceramic in the membrane affects its mechanical strength dlzk which started to co sintered at 1300 c appears to be agreed with the statement based on our explanation earlier it was assumed that the kaolin started to show some melting at temperatures higher than 1300 c which contributed to the high mechanical strength jamaluddin et al 51 stated that diffusion occurred during the co sintering operation which contributed to the melting of the kaolin particles that started at 1300 until 1500 c increasing the mechanical strength of the membrane this co sintering mechanism was also validated by the shrinkage melting or the presence of worm like structure caused by the diffusion process between the ceramic particles which can be seen in dlzk co sintered at 1300 and 1400 c fig 7 3000 magnification 3 3 surface porosity and pore size distribution of dlzk imagej software was used to characterise the porosity and pore size distribution of dlzk from the sem images of the particles at the surface and cross section of the membrane 19 as sintering temperature is one of the vital factors that influence the pore size and the pore distributions in ceramic membrane it is important to study the temperature effect on the porosity which influences the permeability of the membrane increasing the temperature reduces pore size and increases the densification of the membrane and eventually reduces the porosity as can be seen from sem images in fig 7 the void between particles can be seen for the cross section and on the membrane surface based on the images the pore size distributions of the membranes were calculated table 4 summarises the average pore sizes of dlzk co sintered at 1200 1500 c at the cross section mixed kaolin and zirconia inner layer and the surface zirconia only outer layer of the membrane sintering temperature impacts the fabrication of ceramic membrane especially at temperatures higher than 1000 c 51 hence the average pore size and porosity of the dlzk as a function of co sintering temperature were investigated table 4 and fig 12 show a significant difference in the trend for the cross section and surface of dlzk when the co sintered temperature was increased the average pore size for the cross section of dlzk decreased and the average pore size for the surface increased this may be due to different particle sizes of the dlzk where the membranes are made from different types of ceramic particles in which zirconia is only present on the outer layer surface meanwhile a mixture of zirconia and kaolin makes up the inner layer where kaolin mostly contributed to the pore size of the cross section the sem images for the cross section in fig 7 depicts the pore size black holes as well as the formation of finger like structure the number of pores decreased as the sintering temperature was increased the decreasing number of holes at the cross section corresponds to the decreasing porosity of the membrane as shown in fig 12 caused by the densification mechanism that resulted from the higher sintering temperature on the outer layer or the surface part only zirconia particles were present the particle structures of zirconia and kaolin are quite different as the zirconia particles are slightly smaller the distance between each particle is relatively packed compared to the kaolin particles which is bigger and has a platelet like shape when the sintering temperature was increased the void or pore between the zirconia particles also increased which subsequently affected the pore size according to jamaluddin et al 47 pore size distribution affects membrane porosity as bigger pore size increases the porosity percentage of the membrane from the imagej analysis of the images in fig 8 the porosity percentages of dlzk co sintered at 1200 c are 39 113 and 33 831 for surface and cross section respectively followed by 31 416 and 20 258 for 1300 c 27 277 and 16 872 for 1400 c and 17 8496 and 12 3663 for 1500 c in summary when the temperature was increased the pore size became smaller decreasing the porosity percentage of dlzk at the cross section the dlzk co sintered at 1300 c started to show the formation of worm like structures in the cross sectional part fig 7 this formation does not have a huge impact on the porosity and the average membrane pore size however in terms of pore size distribution dlzk co sintered at 1300 c shows the highest percentage of pores less than 0 1 μm at the membrane s surface which is 38 while 27 for 1200 c 29 for 1400 c and 26 for 1500 c as shown in fig 13 the percentage was calculated based on the assumption that the pore was sphere by taking area of pore size provided by the imagej software the value of area was put into sphere formula to get the value of radius of the pore the total count of the pores then accumulated and then converted to percentage of how much the number pores according to accumulated radius so it is assumed that this high number of small pores induced the melting of kaolin in the inner layer the percentage of pores below 0 1 μm does not influence the porosity of the dlzk however the melting of kaolin particles in the inner layer is useful it caused the zirconia particles to be embedded in the molten kaolin which reduced the pore percentage after co sintering at 1300 c even though the kaolin also melted in the dlzk co sintered at 1400 and 1500 c the number of melted parts was higher than that co sintered at 1300 c thus the software cannot detect the smaller pores which resulted in less pore percentage for those membranes compared that co sintered at 1300 c based on the finding of the pore size distribution of dlzk it can be considered the membrane belongs to microfiltration due average pore size of the membrane is in micro size μm range 3 4 water flux permeation water flux permeation test was done to investigate the porosity or water permeability of the membrane in this test the dlzk co sintered at 1500 c possessed the lowest water flux compared to other membranes the porosity and pore size distribution are the major factors that determine the water permeability of ceramic membranes the membranes showed hydrophilic behaviour based on the contact angle test done previously the membranes tend to absorb water droplet immediately after the water reaches the membrane surface due to the presence of oh on the materials which eases the water flow fig 14 depicts the water permeability of dlzk where dlzk co sintered at 1200 c showed the highest permeability of 477 l m2h meanwhile dlzk co sintered at 1500 c showed the lowest permeability of 33 l m2h the increasing co sintering temperature reduced the water permeability of the dlzk this result corresponds to the porosity fig 12 and average pore size table 4 of dlzk at the cross section this permeability test depicts that the packing of particles or densifying process occurred by the increasing co sintering temperature which reduced the pore size between the particles hence hindering the water flow through the membrane and slowing the permeation rate 3 5 dlzk stability in high alkali dissolution the dlzk membranes were subjected to a dissolution test where they were dipped in solution with a high concentration of ammonia hydroxide nh4oh the dissolution of the membranes was investigated by calculating the percentage of weight loss of the membranes after the test the weight of the membrane after the test was important to determine the membranes capability to work in harsh conditions such as high ph wastewater fig 15 shows that dlzk co sintered at 1200 c had the least percentage of weight loss of 3 5 from an initial weight of 3 g for all dlzk indicating that the membrane was the most stable to be used in high alkaline condition meanwhile the dlzk co sintered at 1500 c showed the highest weight loss of 5 8 when the co sintering temperature was increased the weight loss increased because zirconia on the outer layer started to be embedded in the melted kaolin in the inner layer this allows the kaolin particles in the inner layer to be exposed to the surrounding condition with high ammonia concentration 3 6 wastewater treatment efficiency by dlzk prepared at different co sintering temperatures dlzk performance was evaluated using real wastewater rejection test based on the removal of toc cod tn nh3 n and tss the tests were conducted for 100 min at a constant pressure of 1 bar for two different sources of wastewaters which are palm oil mill effluent pome oily wastewater and textile industry ti wastewater from a textile factory effluent dye wastewater as illustrated in fig 16 the wastewater flux decreased for the membranes prepared at higher co sintering temperature because the pore size of the membrane decreased when the co sintering temperature was increased the values of the parameters of cod and toc for ti wastewater were lower compared to those of pome due to the nature of the wastewater itself pome normally contains high cod and toc due to the presence of organic compounds from the production of palm oil it has also undergone biological processes such as anaerobic and anaerobic treatments producing more organic chemicals and nitrogen based effluents such as ammonia 54 in comparison the textile industry wastewater mainly consists of dye from the factory no anaerobic process has occurred after the waste discharge contributing to a lower value of nitrogen based parameters such as total nitrogen and ammonia 55 the presence of many large size carbon based chemicals in pome such as lignin and cellulose from the palm oil production process makes the wastewater thicker and oilier reducing the permeability of the wastewater especially for the membranes co sintered at high temperature in comparison ti wastewater mainly consists of small dye particles increasing the membrane s permeability nonetheless the presence of many chemical constituents in both wastewaters made the wastewater flux lower than that of pure water fig 14 lower than 100 l m2h for dlzk co sintered at 1200 c in comparison pure water flux using the same membrane yielded up to 400 l m2h even the pure water flux for the dlzk co sintered at 1500 c was higher compared to the wastewater flux values of 5 and 10 l m2h for pome and textile industry wastewater respectively fig 17 depicts the removal of toc cod tn nh3 n and tss using dlzk the removal increased in the membranes co sintered at high temperature all membranes showed removals of more than 95 for all the parameters tested toc rejection was 100 for both wastewaters the cod removal percentage for both wastewaters is 93 98 for pome wastewater for dlzk co sintered at 1200 1500 c respectively while 96 98 for ti wastewater the removal percentage of cod is lower for pome due to the higher initial cod value if the experiment was carried out longer the removal percentage might increase the presence of oily elements such as cellulose and lignin in the pome reduces the removal percentage compared to ti which only consists of small dye particles dlzk co sintered at 1500 c possessed the highest removal percentages of toc for both wastewaters which are 98 for pome and 97 for ti followed by membranes co sintered at other temperatures this corresponds to the initial content of toc in pome which is higher than that in ti wastewater which makes the toc removal in pome higher the percentage of removal of nh3 n and tn for pome were slightly higher compared to those for ti wastewater when the membranes co sintered at high temperature were used this can be attributed to the densification of the dlzk pore size with the increasing of co sintering temperature which increased the resistance of the permeation flow same goes to nh3 n the initial content of nh3 n in ti is much lower compared to pome which induced the higher removal of nh3 n in ti compared to pome plus due to the presence of silica on kaolin at inner layer of the membrane it was assumed there is some adsorption process was occurred to the nature of silica which can act as adsorbent hubadillah et al 61 observed a similar increasing percentage of oil removal in pome with decreased pore size while working with kaolin microfiltration membrane a similar filtration trend was observed for the dlzk for those two types of wastewaters even though the source of the wastewaters in this study is different there was no significant difference to the study by them as by using dlzk the percentage removal is still up to more than 95 making dlzk still applicable to treat oily and dye wastewater in order to verify the colour intensity of the wastewater treatment the intensity colour of the wastewater was validated by admi colour unit measured by using dr5000 spectrophotometer as shown in fig 18 where the reduction of colour intensity for the wastewater of pome and ti after duration of 100 min of test the colour intensity was reduced up to 80 and 200 for ti and pome wastewater respectively in the figure only dlzk co sintered at 1200 c was chosen to be shown due to only dlzk co sintered at this co sintering temperature showed the best in term of colour intensity due to the fact as previously mentioned above as the co sintering temperature increased the porosity of the membrane was decreased hence started at dlzk co sintered at 1300 c the colour started to change to the lowest admi which are 80 for ti and 200 for pome at min started 15 min 10 min for dlzk co sintered at 1400 c and less than 5 min for dlzk co sintered at 1500 c due to lowest flux as co sintering temperature increased the volume of wastewater flux collected was also low eventually produced flux with the least colour intensity the wastewater colour changed after the wastewater treatment test is shown in fig 19 for pome wastewater due to the presence of natural pigments which is hardly to be degraded the dark yellowish colour of pome was only degraded to light yellowish colour 62 meanwhile for ti wastewater the colour of the wastewater turned from a dark purplish black to clear indicating the removal of pigment in the wastewater this occurred for samples treated using all co sintered dlzk membranes the mechanism of wastewater treatment is illustrated in fig 20 it was assumed that the bigger molecules in the wastewater could not pass through the membrane s wall hence producing clean water the molecules inside the wastewater could vary with timing condition weather and wastewater location hence in this study only some parameters were chosen to evaluate the membrane performance for some criteria such as high ph alkaline condition indicated by the presence of nh3 n the removal percentage of nh3 n can be considered high due to the presence of kaolin which allowed adsorption to occur as mentioned by hubadillah et al where it enhanced the removal of nh3 n and oily particle from the wastewater 63 plus the value of nh3 n was considered low which helped the removal of nh3 n after the rejection test high cod in wastewater is concerning as it reduces dissolved oxygen levels which leads to anaerobic conditions and induces algal gloom which is deleterious to higher aquatic life forms 64 even though pome wastewater demonstrated lower cod removal compared to ti wastewater it was assumed that the value would increase if the experiment were prolonged however to standardise all the parameters within the same duration in this study the same duration was set for all runs as a summary it can be concluded that a ceramic dual layer hollow fibre membrane was successfully fabricated via co extrusion phase inversion co sintering technique from kaolin and zirconia this technique was chosen as an alternative method to deposit zirconia on the membrane surface which took less time and cost compared to the conventional method such as hydrothermal technique the membrane also used alternative material kaolin natural clay that is cheaper than conventional materials in ceramic membrane fabrication such as alumina also the zirconia used was in powder form whereas conventional zirconia is normally in liquid form where the price is higher based on the study when the co sintering temperature was increased from 1200 1300 1400 1500 c the morphology of the membrane changed although the dlzk co sintered at 1500 c showed the highest mechanical strength and could withstand high alkalinity its porosity and permeability were the lowest compared to other co sintered dlzk in contrast the lowest co sintering temperature of 1200 c produced a membrane with the least mechanical strength but high porosity larger pore size and higher water flux than the membrane co sintered at 1500 c permeability is one of the most important characterisations required for a membrane to function well hence 1200 c was chosen as the best co sintering temperature for dlzk because the membrane s mechanical strength is not considered too weak which is 65 mpa if to be compared to kaolin hollow fibre membrane by hubadillah et al 61 where from their study the highest mechanical strength is 61 mpa the permeability is quite high it is not too porous and the pore size of the membrane is still considered not too small and large for microfiltration it was proven by the oily and dye wastewater rejection test where the membrane still possessed similar criteria to dlzk membranes co sintered at temperatures higher than 1200 c and suitable to be used as microfiltration purpose 4 conclusion dual layer ceramic hollow fibre membrane from kaolin and zirconia dlzk was successfully fabricated as a promising alternative method to deposit zirconia on the membrane surface using simultaneous co extrusion via phase inversion co sintering technique the deposition aimed to enhance its performance in terms of separation permeability and mechanical stability especially in high alkaline condition i e high concentration of ammonia the effects of co sintering temperatures of 1200 1300 1400 and 1500 c were evaluated in terms of membrane morphology pore size porosity and mechanical strength based on the results as the co sintering temperature of dlzk was increased the mechanical strength and percentage of weight loss in high alkaline solution also increased whereas the membrane thickness water permeability porosity and pore size decreased when the membrane was used for real wastewater rejection test the membrane removed more than 95 for cod toc tn nh3 n and tss within 100 min for oily and dye wastewaters based on the results obtained the dlzk co sintered at 1200 c was suitable to be used in microfiltration purpose with the mechanical strength of 65 mpa retained 95 of the original shape in high alkaline solution and removed almost 95 of parameters of cod toc tn nh3

13528,this work aims to prepare a robust yet low cost dual layer hollow fibre ceramic membrane composite membrane dlzk fabricated by co extrusion phase inversion co sintering technique to be used in wastewater treatment the dope suspensions were extruded simultaneously where the outer layer consists of zirconia while the inner layer consists of a mixture of kaolin and zirconia to enhance membrane performance in terms of mechanical strength and wastewater treatment capability the effects of co sintering temperature from 1200 to 1500 c on the membrane s mechanical strength porosity pore size water permeability and dissolubility in high alkaline ph condition were investigated the membrane performance was evaluated by real wastewater treatment test using two different types of industrial wastewaters which are palm oil mill effluent and textile industry wastewater the findings show that the proposed method of producing the dlzk membranes could provide good interfacial adhesion and well dispersed zirconia in the outer layer and the use of kaolin as an alternative natural material for ceramic membrane fabrication the dlzk co sintered at 1200 c had the mechanical strength of 65 mpa only 3 5 loss of the original shape in high alkaline solution and removed almost 95 for all parameters of cod toc tn nh3 n and tss in the both wastewaters suitable for microfiltration purpose keywords dual layer hollow fibre ceramic membrane kaolin zirconia co sintering wastewater treatment 1 introduction the research on the hollow fibre membrane configurations has been extensively investigated due to its high surface area and compact design nevertheless the enhancement on commercial membrane by various types of modifications has been one of the interests in order to reduce the fabrication cost as such by using alternative low cost materials diversifying fabrication techniques to improve the separation porosity pore size and enhancing the morphology properties and performance of the membrane however modification on the membrane surface such as hydrothermal treatment 1 and sol gel coating 2 is time consuming the difficulty to control the hydrolysis parameter and condensation rate of the reactive precursor to match the chemical reactivity of two alkoxides during the gelation process 3 is another drawback of membrane modifications thus dual layer hollow fibre membrane fabricated using co extrusion and co sintering technique is the best solution to encounter aforementioned obstacles meanwhile ceramic dual layer hollow fibre membrane fabricated using co extrusion technique is commonly applied for fuel cell 4 7 plus for water separation application this technique was commonly fabricated from polymeric materials 8 10 meanwhile feng et al 11 and zhu et al 12 stated that co sintering is one of the methods to fabricate multilayer ceramic membrane which reduces the cost of production and enhances the interlayer adhesion between the ceramic layers the common conflict of co sintering is the thermal mismatch between each layer due to different types of ceramic powders compositions and particle sizes of each layer contributing to different behaviours in this study co sintering was applied to fabricate the membrane the effect of co sintering on the adhesion or bonding strength between the dual layers was investigated researchers have tremendously explored the application of ceramic membranes for wastewater treatment from different sources such as industries households and restaurants due to their excellent characteristics such as high mechanical strength high chemical and thermal stability easy maintenance and highly resistance to membrane s fouling recently ceramic materials derived from natural occurring aluminosilicate minerals such as pozzolan 13 kaolinite 14 bentonite 15 bauxite 16 ball clay 17 and industrial agricultural wastes like fly ash 18 aluminium dross 19 hydroxyapatite 20 and rice husk ash 21 have emerged as alternative materials for ceramic membrane fabrication not only the cost of these materials is lower but they also possess similar characteristics to materials commonly used in fabricating ceramic membranes which are alumina al2o3 silica sio2 zirconia zro2 and titania tio2 as well as polymeric membranes kaolin al₂si₂o₅ oh ₄ or kaolinite is one of the promising alternative materials for ceramic membrane fabrication it is made up of aluminosilicate al2sio5 which has similar properties to commercial alumina and silica and has been used for various membrane applications 22 26 despite the advantages such as high plasticity low sintering temperature and high mechanical strength the ceramic membrane prepared from kaolin possesses drawbacks in low chemical stability its tendency to dissolve in a high concentration of alkali hinders the use of the membrane in highly alkaline environments such as membrane contactor 27 or membrane filtration on the other hand zirconium dioxide zro2 also known as zirconia is one of the commonly used materials for ceramic membrane fabrication due to its high melting point 2700 c it exhibits excellent heat resistance high toughness abrasion resistance and chemical resistance leading to its wide utilisation as a ceramic material 28 nishiyama et al 29 30 modified silica based membrane by adding zirconia to improve the dissolution of the silica based membrane in alkaline condition kumar et al 26 altered the surface of kaolin based membrane by adding zirconia based materials to be used in alkaline condition the interaction of zirconia and silica in kaolin was exploited as the composition of silica in kaolin exceeds 60 of its total composition and because of that high content of silica which make kaolin prone to be dissolved in alkaline condition as explained detail by niibori et al 31 previous studies that used alternative materials for ceramic membrane fabrication have proven the ability of these membranes to be used in membrane separation especially in oily wastewater treatment 19 32 34 in membrane separation for removal of oily wastewater ceramic membrane was chosen due to its hydrophilic behaviour due to the presence of the surface hydroxyl oh groups 35 36 which allows only water to pass through the membrane wall and leaves the oil behind these remarkable properties allow these membranes to be used for further improvement kaolin and zirconia are hydrophilic due to the presence of oh therefore these two materials were chosen in this work previous studies on the effect of hydrophilicity of kaolin 37 38 and zirconia 39 42 have shown that the membrane support coated with zirconia showed higher flux compared to uncoated and pristine membranes the mixture of zirconia silica has more advantages as ceramic glasses due to the formation of siozr heterolinkages which attributes to tetragonal stabilisation 3 determining the content of sio2 is crucial as high sio2 content contributes to slower crystal growth and unstable tetragonal reaction hence leading to slower diffusion surrounding the matrix meanwhile low sio2 content creates a large amount of siozr this oxide is a chemical impurity that stabilises the tetragonal phase normally sol gel or dip coating is the most common method used to create this linkage where the crystal is allowed to grow on the membrane surface kim and lin 43 and wu and cheng 44 used this technique where zr was deposited on a support typically made up from alumina or silica park et al 45 used the same method but the zrsi was synthesised separately before deposited on a support meanwhile hove et al 46 and song et al 47 used hydrothermal techniques to deposit zr on si membrane according to toba 48 the deposition of zirconia on the surface of silica based membrane by sol gel method has shown great zrosi bond which is alkali resistant meanwhile rodríguez avendaño et al 49 reported that mesoporous si zr prepared using sol gel influenced the textural properties of the membranes hence the use of zr si has gained interest in membrane fabrication due to its mesoporous property which is suitable for membrane filtration as well high resistance to alkali which is suitable for high ph wastewater such as wastewater containing ammonia therefore these two materials were chosen in this work the motivation of this study is to develop asymmetrical dual layer hydrophilic microfiltration membrane using zirconia and kaolin which have good water flux and rejection for the removal of contaminants in the industrial wastewater to the best of our knowledge this membrane has received a little attention in this work a novel dual layer hollow fibre membrane derived from kaolin and zirconia dlzk was fabricated by using phase inversion based co extrusion co sintering technique the dlzk was co sintered at different sintering temperatures to study the effect of the sintering temperatures on the morphology and physical characteristics of the membranes and subsequently the membrane performance water and ammonia flux the aim of using this co extrusion method is to reduce the time and cost for the fabrication of the membrane and introduce an alternative technique to deposit zirconia on top of the membrane support plus the membrane can improve the dissolution of the silica based ceramic membrane in high alkaline solution the performance of the membrane for oily wastewater filtration rejection was tested to study membrane fouling the best membrane configuration from this study can potentially be used in many applications such as membrane contactor or membrane distillation where the membrane needs to withstand high temperature and possess high chemical resistance and mechanical strength 2 materials and experimental 2 1 materials kaolin powder was purchased from bg oil chem sdn bhd malaysia as the inner layer and zirconia powder zirconium iv oxide zro2 from across for the outer layer as the ceramic material n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp was purchased from merck and used as a solvent polyethersulfone pesf as a binder was provided by amoco chemicals and arlacel 135 croda was used as a dispersant to hold the dope suspension in a homogenous suspension the raw kaolin powder and pesf were heated to 100 c in an oven to remove any adsorbed moisture and were used without any purification process then tap water was used as a non solvent coagulant bath ammonium hydroxide nh4 oh used for an alkaline solution was purchased from merck u s a industrial wastewaters used in this study were taken from two different sources palm oil mill effluent pome was taken from an effluent pond aeration pond in felda kulai palm oil mill 1 44 21 9 n 103 38 52 5 e and textile industry ti wastewater was taken from a textile factory in parit raja johor 1 51 36 9 n 103 05 41 4 e the pome wastewater sample was collected at the aeration pond due to the content of oil in this pond considered low if to be compared to the raw pome pond as this study aim to produce a microfiltration range membrane it is advisable to avoid the use of raw pome so that the membrane is not prone to fouling easily based on the toc and cod value for the pome it was proven the pome still considered oily the wastewater samples were filtered using whatman grade 1 qualitative filter paper 25 mm to remove any suspended solids prior to filtration using dlzk the wastewater samples were stored at 4 c and restored to ambient temperature 25 c before experiments table 1 depicts the characterisation of the oily wastewater used in this work the characteristics tested were chemical oxygen demand cod according to hach method 8000 dr5000 hach spectrophotometer usa ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n according to hach salicylate method method 10031 total nitrogen tn by persulfate digestion method method 10072 total suspended solid tss according to american public health association apha total organic carbon toc dc 190 and ph milwaukee mw101 pro ph meter 2 2 fabrication of kaolin zirconia dual layer hollow fibre the procedure for the membrane fabrication was adapted from othman et al 45 where the zirconia kaolin composite membrane was prepared through phase inversion based co extrusion co sintering technique the fabrication parameters were adapted from hubadillah et al 46 two dope suspensions were used as the inner and outer layers as shown in table 2 the kaolin zirconia mixture was used as the inner layer or membrane support and zirconia only was used as the outer layer the suspension extrusion rate for the inner layer was kept at 10 ml min and 8 ml min for the outer layer the bore fluid water extrusion rate was kept at 10 ml min using a tube in triple orifice spinneret the air gap between the water surface to the end of the spinneret was 5 cm in this study tap water was used as the internal and external coagulant before the spinning process the suspensions were degassed at room temperature to remove any trapped air the schematic diagram of the membrane fabrication is shown in fig 1 where the tap water acted as bore fluid flows from the top of the spinneret along with a separate dope suspension of mixed kaolin and zirconia as the inner layer and zirconia only as the outer layer to create the bore for the hollow fibre configuration fig 2 shows the dimension of the triple orifice spinneret where the diameters of the bore fluid void inner layer and outer layer are 0 8 2 6 and 3 5 mm respectively the diameter of the bore fluid determines the diameter of the inner diameter of the hollow fibre membrane whereas the outer layer thickness is determined by the viscosity and ceramic loading of the dope suspension the dual layer precursor hollow fibres were then co sintered in a tubular furnace at 1200 1300 1400 and 1500 c co sintering means that the membrane was sintered simultaneously with each layer adhering together during the sintering process the co sintering rate was abruptly increased before reaching the targeted temperature to minimise the sintering behaviour mismatch between the dual layers as well as to achieve an optimum co sintering profile with desired sintering temperature and microstructure of the membranes the precursor was co sintered at four different temperatures to investigate the effect of co sintering temperature on the morphology and performance of the membrane there were two different ramping rates of co sintering process used i e 5 and 10 c min 1 and the sintering profile is shown in fig 3 where t is the time for holding time while r is the ramping rate co sintering method for ceramic membrane preparation conventionally a multilayer ceramic membrane can be obtained by repeating the coating procedure but the complicated time and energy consuming production process which generally comprises several sequential steps induces high price obviously reducing or combining steps is expected to cut production time and costs and thereby ceramic membrane price as a method for fabrication of multilayer structures the co sintering process has attracted increasing attention due to simple preparation process and low production cost including ceramic membranes 12 50 the fabricated dual layer hollow fibre membrane dlzk was expected to be composed of zirconium dioxide zirconia zro2 green at the outer layer and mixed kaolin yellow and zro2 at the inner layer as illustrated in fig 4 2 3 characterisations of dual layer hollow fibres dlzk before the spinning process the viscosity of the dope suspension was measured using a brooklyn rheometer a scanning electron microscope sem jeol jsm 6360 was used to examine the morphology and cross section of the dlzk energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx was used to determine the presence of zirconia on top of the membrane atomic force microscopy afm model s ii nanotechnology spa 300 hv hitachi high technologies u s a was used to measure the surface roughness of the membrane imagej software was used to provide detailed descriptions of the membrane to estimate the pore size distribution and overall porosity of the membrane through this software the pore size distribution and porosity of the dlzk were identified by the representation of black and white areas from sem images through modification of the threshold the black region represents the pores while the white region represents the particles then the porosity was determined by calculating the percentage of the black regions while the average pore diameter was determined by assuming cylindrical porous texture of the membrane while the colour intensity of the wastewater colour was measured using dr5000 spectrophotometer usa method 10048 where the sample transmittance is measured from 400 to 700 nm scale used by the american dye manufacturers institute admi for colour value from the apha the colour was measured for every 10 min of 100 min of test duration 2 4 mechanical strength of dlzk the mechanical strength of hollow fibres was examined by three point bending test using a tensile tester instron 5544 provided with a load cell of 1 kn dlzk was fixed on the sample holder with a 30 mm distance the bending strength σf was calculated using eq 1 1 σ f 8 f l d o π d o 4 d i 4 where f is the measured load at which fracture occurred n and l do and di are the length m the outer diameter m and the inner diameter of the hollow fibre m respectively 2 5 dissolution stability test of dlzk in harsh condition dissolution or stability test was run to investigate dlzk performance in harsh condition which is a high alkaline condition the membranes were dipped in 20 g l or 10 m ph 13 of ammonium hydroxide nh4oh solution for 72 h and agitated on a digital orbital shaker intertek heathrow scientific llc usa at 250 rpm as shown in fig 5 the initial and final concentrations of nh4oh and the initial and final weights of the membranes were recorded the rate of membrane dissolution was determined by calculating the percentage of weight loss at the end of the test the ability of the membrane to sustain its original weight indicates its ability to perform well in a harsh condition the ammonia concentration was measured using dr5000 hach spectrophotometer usa with hach ammonia nh3 n reagent set hach salicylate method method 10031 and apha method ammonia was chosen as it is considered as one of the most dangerous pollutants which need to be removed from wastewater and the ph of water is high alkali when the concentration of ammonia is high three membranes were used for each co sintering temperature and the average value was calculated and recorded 2 6 measurement of permeation flux of dlzk and evaluation on real wastewater rejection test water permeation test was used to determine the effect of co sintering temperature on the membrane s ability to be used in microfiltration process in a cross flow filtration system water was flowed through the membrane walls or pores and the flux j l m2 h was calculated using eq 2 2 j v a t the test was conducted using distilled water as the feed towards the pores of the membrane around 5 cm of the membrane was potted on an adapter and plucked to a 20 cm stainless steel module connected by a tube to a tank and a pressure gauge passing through a diaphragm pump the pressure of the system was kept at 1 bar for all runs the permeate or flux was measured every 10 min for 100 min for each run the test was carried out using the same cross flow microfiltration system for the wastewater permeation test two sources of wastewaters were used which are pome wastewater representing oily wastewater and ti wastewater representing dye wastewater the rationale for choosing pome in this study is to determine the ability of fabricated dlzk in removing oily wastewater as pome is known to have high content of oil residual textile wastewater was selected as another wastewater sample in order to prove the ability of the dlzk in removing colorant material or dye the chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n contents in the wastewater samples were measured before and after the dlzk filtration the percentage of wastewater rejection coefficient r and concentrations of the feed cf and the permeate cp were calculated according to eq 3 3 r c f c p c f 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology of dlzk after the co sintering process the image of co sintered dlzk was pictured as in fig 6 the morphology of the dlzk was characterised using sem and the images as can be seen in fig 7 the sem images were divided into different cross sectional magnifications of 60 200 and 3000 the formation of micro voids and the melting of the kaolin particles are obvious in the dlzk co sintered at 1500 c the melting sign started to show in the dlzk co sintered at 1300 c can be seen at 3000 magnification and became more obvious when the co sintering temperature was increased in the dlzk co sintered at 1400 c the kaolin particles showed more signs of melting less zirconia white particles was observed in the dlzk co sintered at 1500 c compared to other co sintered dlzk because the kaolin particles had melted which caused the zirconia particles to be embedded in the melted kaolin particles when the co sintering temperature was increased the thickness of the dlzk decreased as shown in table 3 the formation of micro voids structure enhances membrane permeation of the membrane while for the inner layer of the dlzk sintered at 1500 c showed the obvious formation of micro voids structure the micro voids at the outer layer was covered with melted kaolin particles according to jamaludin et al 51 as sintering temperature increased the formation of dense structure for ceramic membrane became obvious due to the melting of the particles the adhesion between the bilayers appeared to be excellent due to the different melting points of each layer in addition jong et al 52 showed that the presence of pesf as a polymer binder in the ceramic composition helped the adhesion process between the layers wu et al 53 also stated that the co extrusion by phase inversion method for dual layer fabrication enhanced the adhesion between each layer in this study the adhesion is supported by the presence of zirconia which acted as the nuclei to attract the surrounding atoms to bond with silica si4 and oh ions to form a strong bond with each other indirectly this increases the mechanical strength of the membrane as can be seen in the sem images with 60 and 200 magnification fig 7 in addition the different melting points of zirconia and kaolin lead to different membrane behaviours at different sintering temperatures zirconia possesses a higher melting point than kaolin hence it does not show any melting on the other hand based on our preliminary experiment the adhesion between the membrane interlayer was more visible if the same material is present in each layer therefore this study used a mixture of zirconia and kaolin in the inner layer to improve the adhesion process sem edx images for dlzk are shown in fig 8 where the zr particles are present on the membrane top as indicated by the green colour however for dlzk co sintered at 1500 c the edx cannot detect the presence of zr since it was embedded in kaolin image not shown fig 8 shows that when the co sintering temperature was increased the amount of zr deposited on the outer layer decreased due to the melting of kaolin which caused the zr particles to become more packed and hence embedded into the kaolin layer fig 9 present three dimensional afm images of dlzk at co sintering temperatures the surface roughness of the membranes was analysed using afm scans in 10 μm 10 μm spots as stated by hubadillah et al 54 the bright area articulates the higher point or the height of the particles on the surface of the membrane while the dark area presents valleys or membranes pores based on the 3d images the value of ra nm was decreasing as the co sintering temperature increasing this value of ra or sa in some literatures indicated that as the value is decreasing so does the surface roughness in decreasing 55 they added from the 3d images also can be used to describe the pore size of the membranes however the result may be different from other method as in porosity test due to the area where the images were captured nevertheless from fig 9 it can be concluded that as co sintering temperature increased the value of ra decreased or the height of the particles becoming smaller hence producing a smoother surface due to melting of the membrane which will be described detail in surface porosity and pore size distribution section of the membrane in order to enlighten the schematic mechanism of the interaction of zirconia and kaolin aluminosilicate cormier et al 56 and ficheux et al 57 have explained in details in their study according to them zr has various beneficial in ceramics as such improving the chemical durability or mechanical resistance of the ceramics as well as increasing viscosity and decreasing thermal expansion when added to kaolin or aluminosilicate this zr will adopt to any variable environments depending on its content or network polymerization as a matter of fact zr has been observed as the dominant species in various alumino silicate glasses and these high coordinated species could trigger the nucleation of zro2 to connect to other linkage to sio4 or alo4 in kaolin from their study also the addition of zro2 would therefore lead to the transformation of silicon linked with three network forming units sio4 or alo4 and one non bridging oxygen nbo to a silicon linked with four network forming units considering zr as a network former nucleation as more zro2 was added more cations are required to balance the charge of zr sites producing fewer non bridging oxygen species and a network repolymerization is expected the schematic diagram of the kaolin aluminosilicate and zirconia is shown in fig 10 3 2 mechanical strength of dlzk the effect of co sintering temperature on the mechanical strength of the membrane was investigated prior to its performance as shown in fig 11 dlzk co sintered at 1500 c had the highest mpa of 177 mpa indicating that the membrane is the strongest the dlzk membrane co sintered at 1200 c showed the lowest mechanical strength of only 65 mpa while the dlzk co sintered at 1300 and 1400 c had the mechanical strengths of 119 and 141 mpa respectively even though the mpa values obtained in this study are lower compared to those from the study by wu et al 58 which used zirconia they are still higher than those from the study by hubadillah et al 24 which used kaolin hollow fibre membrane in aforementioned study the highest mechanical strength was 65 mpa from the membrane sintered at 1500 c while this study recorded a value of 177 mpa were both studies used alternative material on the other hand according to study by abdullah et al 59 of using commercial alumina and paiman et al 60 of using commercial yittria stablized zirconia ysz the value of mechanical strength for both study considered high due to these materials which already commercialised to produce high mechanical strength ceramic membrane according to hubadillah et al 32 the melting of the ceramic in the membrane affects its mechanical strength dlzk which started to co sintered at 1300 c appears to be agreed with the statement based on our explanation earlier it was assumed that the kaolin started to show some melting at temperatures higher than 1300 c which contributed to the high mechanical strength jamaluddin et al 51 stated that diffusion occurred during the co sintering operation which contributed to the melting of the kaolin particles that started at 1300 until 1500 c increasing the mechanical strength of the membrane this co sintering mechanism was also validated by the shrinkage melting or the presence of worm like structure caused by the diffusion process between the ceramic particles which can be seen in dlzk co sintered at 1300 and 1400 c fig 7 3000 magnification 3 3 surface porosity and pore size distribution of dlzk imagej software was used to characterise the porosity and pore size distribution of dlzk from the sem images of the particles at the surface and cross section of the membrane 19 as sintering temperature is one of the vital factors that influence the pore size and the pore distributions in ceramic membrane it is important to study the temperature effect on the porosity which influences the permeability of the membrane increasing the temperature reduces pore size and increases the densification of the membrane and eventually reduces the porosity as can be seen from sem images in fig 7 the void between particles can be seen for the cross section and on the membrane surface based on the images the pore size distributions of the membranes were calculated table 4 summarises the average pore sizes of dlzk co sintered at 1200 1500 c at the cross section mixed kaolin and zirconia inner layer and the surface zirconia only outer layer of the membrane sintering temperature impacts the fabrication of ceramic membrane especially at temperatures higher than 1000 c 51 hence the average pore size and porosity of the dlzk as a function of co sintering temperature were investigated table 4 and fig 12 show a significant difference in the trend for the cross section and surface of dlzk when the co sintered temperature was increased the average pore size for the cross section of dlzk decreased and the average pore size for the surface increased this may be due to different particle sizes of the dlzk where the membranes are made from different types of ceramic particles in which zirconia is only present on the outer layer surface meanwhile a mixture of zirconia and kaolin makes up the inner layer where kaolin mostly contributed to the pore size of the cross section the sem images for the cross section in fig 7 depicts the pore size black holes as well as the formation of finger like structure the number of pores decreased as the sintering temperature was increased the decreasing number of holes at the cross section corresponds to the decreasing porosity of the membrane as shown in fig 12 caused by the densification mechanism that resulted from the higher sintering temperature on the outer layer or the surface part only zirconia particles were present the particle structures of zirconia and kaolin are quite different as the zirconia particles are slightly smaller the distance between each particle is relatively packed compared to the kaolin particles which is bigger and has a platelet like shape when the sintering temperature was increased the void or pore between the zirconia particles also increased which subsequently affected the pore size according to jamaluddin et al 47 pore size distribution affects membrane porosity as bigger pore size increases the porosity percentage of the membrane from the imagej analysis of the images in fig 8 the porosity percentages of dlzk co sintered at 1200 c are 39 113 and 33 831 for surface and cross section respectively followed by 31 416 and 20 258 for 1300 c 27 277 and 16 872 for 1400 c and 17 8496 and 12 3663 for 1500 c in summary when the temperature was increased the pore size became smaller decreasing the porosity percentage of dlzk at the cross section the dlzk co sintered at 1300 c started to show the formation of worm like structures in the cross sectional part fig 7 this formation does not have a huge impact on the porosity and the average membrane pore size however in terms of pore size distribution dlzk co sintered at 1300 c shows the highest percentage of pores less than 0 1 μm at the membrane s surface which is 38 while 27 for 1200 c 29 for 1400 c and 26 for 1500 c as shown in fig 13 the percentage was calculated based on the assumption that the pore was sphere by taking area of pore size provided by the imagej software the value of area was put into sphere formula to get the value of radius of the pore the total count of the pores then accumulated and then converted to percentage of how much the number pores according to accumulated radius so it is assumed that this high number of small pores induced the melting of kaolin in the inner layer the percentage of pores below 0 1 μm does not influence the porosity of the dlzk however the melting of kaolin particles in the inner layer is useful it caused the zirconia particles to be embedded in the molten kaolin which reduced the pore percentage after co sintering at 1300 c even though the kaolin also melted in the dlzk co sintered at 1400 and 1500 c the number of melted parts was higher than that co sintered at 1300 c thus the software cannot detect the smaller pores which resulted in less pore percentage for those membranes compared that co sintered at 1300 c based on the finding of the pore size distribution of dlzk it can be considered the membrane belongs to microfiltration due average pore size of the membrane is in micro size μm range 3 4 water flux permeation water flux permeation test was done to investigate the porosity or water permeability of the membrane in this test the dlzk co sintered at 1500 c possessed the lowest water flux compared to other membranes the porosity and pore size distribution are the major factors that determine the water permeability of ceramic membranes the membranes showed hydrophilic behaviour based on the contact angle test done previously the membranes tend to absorb water droplet immediately after the water reaches the membrane surface due to the presence of oh on the materials which eases the water flow fig 14 depicts the water permeability of dlzk where dlzk co sintered at 1200 c showed the highest permeability of 477 l m2h meanwhile dlzk co sintered at 1500 c showed the lowest permeability of 33 l m2h the increasing co sintering temperature reduced the water permeability of the dlzk this result corresponds to the porosity fig 12 and average pore size table 4 of dlzk at the cross section this permeability test depicts that the packing of particles or densifying process occurred by the increasing co sintering temperature which reduced the pore size between the particles hence hindering the water flow through the membrane and slowing the permeation rate 3 5 dlzk stability in high alkali dissolution the dlzk membranes were subjected to a dissolution test where they were dipped in solution with a high concentration of ammonia hydroxide nh4oh the dissolution of the membranes was investigated by calculating the percentage of weight loss of the membranes after the test the weight of the membrane after the test was important to determine the membranes capability to work in harsh conditions such as high ph wastewater fig 15 shows that dlzk co sintered at 1200 c had the least percentage of weight loss of 3 5 from an initial weight of 3 g for all dlzk indicating that the membrane was the most stable to be used in high alkaline condition meanwhile the dlzk co sintered at 1500 c showed the highest weight loss of 5 8 when the co sintering temperature was increased the weight loss increased because zirconia on the outer layer started to be embedded in the melted kaolin in the inner layer this allows the kaolin particles in the inner layer to be exposed to the surrounding condition with high ammonia concentration 3 6 wastewater treatment efficiency by dlzk prepared at different co sintering temperatures dlzk performance was evaluated using real wastewater rejection test based on the removal of toc cod tn nh3 n and tss the tests were conducted for 100 min at a constant pressure of 1 bar for two different sources of wastewaters which are palm oil mill effluent pome oily wastewater and textile industry ti wastewater from a textile factory effluent dye wastewater as illustrated in fig 16 the wastewater flux decreased for the membranes prepared at higher co sintering temperature because the pore size of the membrane decreased when the co sintering temperature was increased the values of the parameters of cod and toc for ti wastewater were lower compared to those of pome due to the nature of the wastewater itself pome normally contains high cod and toc due to the presence of organic compounds from the production of palm oil it has also undergone biological processes such as anaerobic and anaerobic treatments producing more organic chemicals and nitrogen based effluents such as ammonia 54 in comparison the textile industry wastewater mainly consists of dye from the factory no anaerobic process has occurred after the waste discharge contributing to a lower value of nitrogen based parameters such as total nitrogen and ammonia 55 the presence of many large size carbon based chemicals in pome such as lignin and cellulose from the palm oil production process makes the wastewater thicker and oilier reducing the permeability of the wastewater especially for the membranes co sintered at high temperature in comparison ti wastewater mainly consists of small dye particles increasing the membrane s permeability nonetheless the presence of many chemical constituents in both wastewaters made the wastewater flux lower than that of pure water fig 14 lower than 100 l m2h for dlzk co sintered at 1200 c in comparison pure water flux using the same membrane yielded up to 400 l m2h even the pure water flux for the dlzk co sintered at 1500 c was higher compared to the wastewater flux values of 5 and 10 l m2h for pome and textile industry wastewater respectively fig 17 depicts the removal of toc cod tn nh3 n and tss using dlzk the removal increased in the membranes co sintered at high temperature all membranes showed removals of more than 95 for all the parameters tested toc rejection was 100 for both wastewaters the cod removal percentage for both wastewaters is 93 98 for pome wastewater for dlzk co sintered at 1200 1500 c respectively while 96 98 for ti wastewater the removal percentage of cod is lower for pome due to the higher initial cod value if the experiment was carried out longer the removal percentage might increase the presence of oily elements such as cellulose and lignin in the pome reduces the removal percentage compared to ti which only consists of small dye particles dlzk co sintered at 1500 c possessed the highest removal percentages of toc for both wastewaters which are 98 for pome and 97 for ti followed by membranes co sintered at other temperatures this corresponds to the initial content of toc in pome which is higher than that in ti wastewater which makes the toc removal in pome higher the percentage of removal of nh3 n and tn for pome were slightly higher compared to those for ti wastewater when the membranes co sintered at high temperature were used this can be attributed to the densification of the dlzk pore size with the increasing of co sintering temperature which increased the resistance of the permeation flow same goes to nh3 n the initial content of nh3 n in ti is much lower compared to pome which induced the higher removal of nh3 n in ti compared to pome plus due to the presence of silica on kaolin at inner layer of the membrane it was assumed there is some adsorption process was occurred to the nature of silica which can act as adsorbent hubadillah et al 61 observed a similar increasing percentage of oil removal in pome with decreased pore size while working with kaolin microfiltration membrane a similar filtration trend was observed for the dlzk for those two types of wastewaters even though the source of the wastewaters in this study is different there was no significant difference to the study by them as by using dlzk the percentage removal is still up to more than 95 making dlzk still applicable to treat oily and dye wastewater in order to verify the colour intensity of the wastewater treatment the intensity colour of the wastewater was validated by admi colour unit measured by using dr5000 spectrophotometer as shown in fig 18 where the reduction of colour intensity for the wastewater of pome and ti after duration of 100 min of test the colour intensity was reduced up to 80 and 200 for ti and pome wastewater respectively in the figure only dlzk co sintered at 1200 c was chosen to be shown due to only dlzk co sintered at this co sintering temperature showed the best in term of colour intensity due to the fact as previously mentioned above as the co sintering temperature increased the porosity of the membrane was decreased hence started at dlzk co sintered at 1300 c the colour started to change to the lowest admi which are 80 for ti and 200 for pome at min started 15 min 10 min for dlzk co sintered at 1400 c and less than 5 min for dlzk co sintered at 1500 c due to lowest flux as co sintering temperature increased the volume of wastewater flux collected was also low eventually produced flux with the least colour intensity the wastewater colour changed after the wastewater treatment test is shown in fig 19 for pome wastewater due to the presence of natural pigments which is hardly to be degraded the dark yellowish colour of pome was only degraded to light yellowish colour 62 meanwhile for ti wastewater the colour of the wastewater turned from a dark purplish black to clear indicating the removal of pigment in the wastewater this occurred for samples treated using all co sintered dlzk membranes the mechanism of wastewater treatment is illustrated in fig 20 it was assumed that the bigger molecules in the wastewater could not pass through the membrane s wall hence producing clean water the molecules inside the wastewater could vary with timing condition weather and wastewater location hence in this study only some parameters were chosen to evaluate the membrane performance for some criteria such as high ph alkaline condition indicated by the presence of nh3 n the removal percentage of nh3 n can be considered high due to the presence of kaolin which allowed adsorption to occur as mentioned by hubadillah et al where it enhanced the removal of nh3 n and oily particle from the wastewater 63 plus the value of nh3 n was considered low which helped the removal of nh3 n after the rejection test high cod in wastewater is concerning as it reduces dissolved oxygen levels which leads to anaerobic conditions and induces algal gloom which is deleterious to higher aquatic life forms 64 even though pome wastewater demonstrated lower cod removal compared to ti wastewater it was assumed that the value would increase if the experiment were prolonged however to standardise all the parameters within the same duration in this study the same duration was set for all runs as a summary it can be concluded that a ceramic dual layer hollow fibre membrane was successfully fabricated via co extrusion phase inversion co sintering technique from kaolin and zirconia this technique was chosen as an alternative method to deposit zirconia on the membrane surface which took less time and cost compared to the conventional method such as hydrothermal technique the membrane also used alternative material kaolin natural clay that is cheaper than conventional materials in ceramic membrane fabrication such as alumina also the zirconia used was in powder form whereas conventional zirconia is normally in liquid form where the price is higher based on the study when the co sintering temperature was increased from 1200 1300 1400 1500 c the morphology of the membrane changed although the dlzk co sintered at 1500 c showed the highest mechanical strength and could withstand high alkalinity its porosity and permeability were the lowest compared to other co sintered dlzk in contrast the lowest co sintering temperature of 1200 c produced a membrane with the least mechanical strength but high porosity larger pore size and higher water flux than the membrane co sintered at 1500 c permeability is one of the most important characterisations required for a membrane to function well hence 1200 c was chosen as the best co sintering temperature for dlzk because the membrane s mechanical strength is not considered too weak which is 65 mpa if to be compared to kaolin hollow fibre membrane by hubadillah et al 61 where from their study the highest mechanical strength is 61 mpa the permeability is quite high it is not too porous and the pore size of the membrane is still considered not too small and large for microfiltration it was proven by the oily and dye wastewater rejection test where the membrane still possessed similar criteria to dlzk membranes co sintered at temperatures higher than 1200 c and suitable to be used as microfiltration purpose 4 conclusion dual layer ceramic hollow fibre membrane from kaolin and zirconia dlzk was successfully fabricated as a promising alternative method to deposit zirconia on the membrane surface using simultaneous co extrusion via phase inversion co sintering technique the deposition aimed to enhance its performance in terms of separation permeability and mechanical stability especially in high alkaline condition i e high concentration of ammonia the effects of co sintering temperatures of 1200 1300 1400 and 1500 c were evaluated in terms of membrane morphology pore size porosity and mechanical strength based on the results as the co sintering temperature of dlzk was increased the mechanical strength and percentage of weight loss in high alkaline solution also increased whereas the membrane thickness water permeability porosity and pore size decreased when the membrane was used for real wastewater rejection test the membrane removed more than 95 for cod toc tn nh3 n and tss within 100 min for oily and dye wastewaters based on the results obtained the dlzk co sintered at 1200 c was suitable to be used in microfiltration purpose with the mechanical strength of 65 mpa retained 95 of the original shape in high alkaline solution and removed almost 95 of parameters of cod toc tn nh3

13529,the fouling formation on the membrane s surface has limited the membrane based separation in industrial activities such as wastewater reclamation and seawater desalination the nanomaterials incorporation has been developed to enhance membrane performance in this study the combination of graphene oxide go and zinc oxide zno nanoparticles to psf membrane to improve the membrane performances to treat the petroleum refinery wastewater prw was performed the sem edx result shows the presence of both go and zno nanoparticles on the membrane s surface they also produced the porosity of 83 00 1 18 for psf go zno which was higher than the neat psf with 52 20 0 28 the ftir and xrd result has confirmed the presence of go and zno in the membrane that caused the increment in hydrophilicity and mechanical strength the addition of go and zno nanoparticles has reduced the water contact angle from 80 to 52 and increased water uptake ability from 16 to 75 compared to the neat psf it has also resulted in the highest permeate flux and pollutant removal compared to the other membranes with a maximum permeate flux of 35 03 l m 2 h 1 and a rejection value 70 21 2 33 for total dissolved solids tds and 74 68 0 88 for chemical oxygen demand cod the fouling resistance evaluation showed the addition of go and zno nanoparticles successfully reduced the resistance during filtration indicating a reduction in fouling tendency on the membrane s surface these phenomena are proven by the antifouling potential analysis at the addition of go and zno nanoparticles was exhibited the highest flux recovery ratio up to 90 44 1 22 keywords graphene oxide zinc oxide low fouling membrane hydrophilic membrane wastewater treatment 1 introduction petroleum refinery wastewater prw is the wastewater which was generated by the petroleum refinery industry this industry generated up to 30 50 cubic meters of prw per ton of crude oil 1 that massive amount of wastewater has not met the effective handling and immediate disposal to the environment that made worse impacts some works have been conducted to discover an affordable and effective technique to reduce the contaminants from prw and become accessible to be more usable water prw contains high quantities of pollutant such as chemical oxygen demand cod of 300 600 ppm biochemical oxygen demand bod of 150 250 ppm oil and grease content of 100 400 ppm phenol content of 10 200 ppm benzene content of 1 100 mg l pb content up to 10 ppm cr content of about 150 ppm and many others 2 prw can be utilized to another application of water after being through the proper treatment there are several methods have been applied to utilize this wastewater physical biochemical electrochemical chemical treatment and membrane filtration have been used to treat prw the physical treatment has shown the superior performance and widely used in many plants by using a series of screening coagulation flocculation and so on but this treatment cannot operate as stand alone unit thus need the secondary process which lack in efficiency 3 the biochemical method by using activated sludge to degrade the contaminants in prw has been shown that the processing condition should intensively maintain in certain strict conditions thus made a tremendous complex operation maintenance 4 the electrocoagulation technique has been appeared as the promising method to treat prw in diverse pollutant contents electrocoagulation has a simple design low sludge generation good removal efficiency in terms of heavy metal 5 contrary electrocoagulation process needs the highly electrical voltage and current to perform best performance thus made this method is risky and need advance safety system to be operated among of those techniques membrane filtration becomes as a sophisticated option due to its numerous benefits including efficient separation compact unit operation high productivity low energy and relatively acceptable maintenance costs 2 among various well developed procedures for reduction of prw contaminant parameters such as tds cod ammonia content phenolic compound turbidity etc 2 membrane technology especially the ultrafiltration uf process has achieved consideration for possessing numerous benefits for the prw treatment process some striking advantages for using the uf process such as no proper phase changes increase energy efficiency as well as easy conducted operation 6 polysulfone psf has been a well known and popularly used polymer in the fabricating of uf membranes for its superiority in mechanical chemical properties thermal features low cost and desirable flux performance 7 nevertheless the psf hydrophobic property makes it vulnerable to the fouling caused by its high tendency to adsorb organic components 8 the accumulation of organic components on the membrane s surface brings about the severe effect of pore blockage as the undesirable effect of fouling reduced permeate flux and shorter durability of the membrane besides due to the fouling s complex cleaning processes the generated cost would not be affordable 1 some techniques to eschew the disadvantages of membrane fouling have been reported polymer blending has been prepared to reduce the hydrophobicity of the psf membrane through the nonsolvent induced phase inversion process 9 the addition of polymeric membrane with numerous type of nanoparticles such as zinc oxide zno 10 titanium oxide tio2 11 silicon oxide sio2 12 13 zirconium oxide zro2 14 aluminum oxide al2o3 6 iron oxide fe3o4 14 carbon nanotube graphene oxide go 15 reduced graphene oxide rgo 16 has been published to improve the polymeric membrane characteristics not only the hydrophilicity but also antifouling potential flux and pollutant rejections and the mechanical strength of the psf membrane as a member of hydrophilic materials zno nanoparticle has been prepared to produce zno modified polyether sulfone pes using polyethylene glycol peg as the pore generating agent 17 kusworo and coworkers reported that incorporation of zno in membrane microstructure led to improved water uptake and hydrophilicity permeate flux and rejection porosity increment flux recovery ratio and antifouling potential of the membrane a study conducted by nasrollahi and coworkers have recently observed the effect of zno on pes membranes as well and found about increasing up to 200 in permeate flux and found an excellent reduction of irreversible resistance of the pes membranes as well 18 xu and coworkers reported that zno nanoparticles addition to the pvdf membranes maintained steady fluxes 100 flux recovery 19 even though zno nanoparticles result in excellent properties in various types of polymeric membranes modification there are weaknesses and limitations the common issue for the addition of zno nanoparticles is that the nano size particle tends to agglomerate leading to non uniform distribution during the membrane fabrication 20 therefore graphene oxide go nano layers have been observed as an excellent platform to produce a better dispersion of nanoparticles and become a superb innovative additive in membrane fabrication 15 this mechanism has been provided by the interaction effect between the nanoparticles and the go hydrophilic layer the functional groups of go carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are essential to form the hybrid micro structure with some nanoparticles such as sio2 21 tio2 and ag 22 go has attained a versatile application particularly in wastewater processing due to the highly hydrophilic group content 23 the incorporation of go nanoparticles would be improved the antifouling potentials of the membrane caused by the low friction of the membrane surface and water molecules 15 additionally the permeate flux increases as the effect of the more facile pass of the stream of water molecules between the go nano layers 23 prw has a very high pollutant content and requires a separation method that is reliable inexpensive durable and easy to operate the use of nanohybrid membrane technology for treating various kinds of wastewater has been proved to show outstanding performance however studies on the addition of a combination of go and zno nanoparticles to psf membranes for prw processing are still minimal therefore in this study prw processing was carried out using psf membranes with the addition of go and zno to improve membrane properties and performance the membrane properties and performance were characterized by several analyzes and approaches finally the ultimate goal was for the psf go zno membrane to perform the less fouling tendency to treat the prw into more usable water effectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polysulfone psf as the membrane polymer was obtained from solvay am usa n methyl pyrrolidone nmp as a solvent to the produced dope solution was supplied from merck germany zinc oxide zno nanoparticle powder 35 nm was gained

reported by our previous study 17 the variation of membrane composition is reported in table 1 firstly the psf pellet dissolved in nmp with constant stirring cimarec a china at 300 400 rpm for four hours then the nanoparticle was added with constant stirring for four hours the dope solution was degassed by ultrasound chamber for 60 min the membrane solution was then cast on a clean glass plate surface using a conventional casting knife with a thickness of 0 15 mm the casted membrane was then immersed in the deionized water to release the solvent away from the film the wet membrane was then moved to another chamber filled with di water for 24 h to separate the solvent finally the membrane was dried in ambient conditions for 24 h 2 4 initial characterization of prw initial characterization of prw was done to determine the characteristics of this wastewater as shown in table 2 several parameters were measured such as physical appearance and total dissolved solid tds

filtration module with a flat sheet membrane with a diameter of 4 cm and the operating pressure was constant at 5 bar the schematic illustration of membrane filtration apparatus is shown in fig 1 2 8

and energy dispersive x ray sem edx were applied to study the morphological image and chemical composition of zno and go nanoparticles sem edx is a type of electron microscope used to capture the picture of a sample using the combination of high energy of electron and x ray wave this energy beam produced the interaction between the beam and constituent of the sample and give reaction signals reveals essential data such as composition surface image and other properties 26 fig 2 a depicts the sem edx result of zno this image confirms the initial formation of zno nanoparticles and the chemical composition as well this result shows the spherical shape of the zno nanoparticles at some points the agglomeration is formed into larger particles with undefined morphology this agglomerated structure is caused by the high tendency of nanoparticles to stick one to the others 27 the composition of zno powders consists of 85 wt of zinc and 14 55 wt of oxygen fig 2 b shows the sem edx of go nanoparticles this image exhibits the evidence that go has been established as a rectangular shape and consisted of layers this go thin layer promotes charge carriers that could enhance the hydrophilicity 28 these go thin layers also increase its efficiency of surface area the go powders composition consisted of 37 86 wt of carbon c and 62 14 wt of oxygen o ftir spectrum of zno and go were used to determine the chemical functional group exhibit in the nanoparticles fig 2 c represents the ftir spectrum of zno nanoparticles the broad stretch peak at around 3440 cm 1 indicated the appearance of the oh stretch the peak around 1300 cm 1 shows the asymmetric stretching vibration it marks the presence of nitrate no3 29 the sharp peak at around 600 400 cm 1 is showed zn o groups 30 this analysis indicates that all of the functional groups exhibit in zno nanoparticles are in hydrophilic properties fig 2 d displays the ftir spectrum of go nanoparticles we can observe a broad peak around 2000 3800 cm 1 it can be indicated to oh stretching groups and can be due to water adsorbed in go nanoparticles the appearance of more than a single oh stretch corresponds that go has oh groups in different types oh maybe appear in the form of alcohol phenol enolic and carboxylic 31 32 the peak at 1700 cm 1 indicates the presence of co stretching of cooh and the peak at about 1600 cm 1 has been identified to epoxide linkage and fore bending vibration of the water molecule 3 2 characterization of fabricated membrane 3 2 1 study of surface morphology and chemical composition of fabricated membranes to evaluate the effect of zno and go nanoparticles on the membrane surface morphology and its chemical compositions the sem edx analysis was applied fig 3 shows the surface image and chemical composition of a neat psf b psf zno c psf go and d psf go zno images fig 3 a represents the smooth surface without any pores captured the absence of polymer clumps on the membrane surface indicated that the polymer mixing process and nips were successful the surface chemical composition shows that this membrane is composed of three elements carbon oxygen and sulfur with 83 45 wt 11 09 wt and 5 46 wt respectively without modification this polymer is hydrophobic due to the absence of water attracting groups fig 3 b displays a surface image and chemical composition of the psf zno membrane when viewed carefully on the surface of the psf zno membrane several white dots indicate the presence of zno nanoparticles these dots are visible very few suggesting that most of the zno nanoparticles are present in the membrane sublayer agreed with edx data there are indeed elementals of zno in this membrane with elements detected are carbon oxygen sulfur and zinc with a composition of 80 76 wt 11 70 wt 4 73 wt and 2 81 wt respectively the increase in oxygen composition and zinc presence indicates that the addition of zno nanoparticles to this membrane was successful fig 3 c shows an image of the surface and chemical composition of the psf go membrane in the picture it can be seen a different structure on the surface of this membrane this kind of clot possibly affects the formation of polymer clots due to the inhomogeneity of the dope solution recorded chemical compositions are carbon oxygen and sulfur with 79 76 wt 16 95 wt and 3 29 wt respectively compared to neat psf the psf go membrane has a lower carbon and sulfur composition and a higher oxygen content this condition is due to the fact that go nanoparticles have an oxygen content of 62 14 wt so that after being added to the membrane the oxygen composition increases fig 3 d displays a surface image and chemical composition of the psf zno go membrane it can be seen that there are dots that are spread almost evenly across the membrane s surface the distribution of these points is more massive than the psf zno and psf go membranes this is possible because the number of nanoparticles added to the psf go zno membrane is greater than that of psf go and psf zno however the nanoparticles were spread relatively evenly not to cause an agglomerate on the membrane which could adversely affect the membrane s performance by decreasing the pollutant removal ability the recorded membrane composition contained several elements carbon oxygen sulfur and zinc with 77 54 wt 17 21 wt 2 97 wt and 2 28 wt respectively compared with the neat psf membrane it can be seen that there is a decrease in the composition of carbon and sulfur and an increase in the elemental oxygen and zinc the decrease in carbon and sulfur composition occurred due to the addition of zno and go nanoparticles zno and go nanoparticles have an oxygen content of 14 55 wt and 62 14 wt respectively they contribute to oxygen composition and thus increase the psf go zno membrane based on the increase in oxygen and the recorded elemental of zinc therefore the addition of go and zno nanoparticles to the psf membrane was successfully carried out 3 2 2 pore properties of fabricated membranes the membrane porosity and average pore radius were carried out using eqs 1 and 2 respectively the thickness porosity and average pore radius analysis of the fabricated membrane are presented in table 3 the study of membrane thickness shows that with the addition of nanoparticles there is an increase in membrane thickness the membrane thicknesses measured 53 00 0 58 55 00 0 10 54 70 0 33 and 58 00 0 58 μm for neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively this increase in thickness occurs due to the polymer s swelling effect due to the addition of nanoparticles the thickest one happened in the psf go zno membrane which was the highest nanoparticle addition among the four membranes the increase in membrane thickness will increase the resistance of transport through the membrane 33 34 however the increase in thickness that occurs in the fabricated membrane is not significant so that the effect of increasing resistance due to thickness is not significant as well in the results of the porosity analysis of fabricated membranes it can be seen that a significant increase in porosity due to the addition of nanoparticles the membrane porosity measured was 52 20 0 28 66 70 0 83 73 00 1 42 83 00 1 18 for neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively the amount of porosity shows the level of availability of void space in the membrane a membrane with a lower porosity indicates that the membrane is denser on the other hand a membrane with higher porosity means a high void space in the membrane the porosity analysis results showed that the addition of nanoparticles contributed to an increase in the porosity of the fabricated membrane this can occur because of the formation of gaps between the inside of the polymer in the manufacture of the dope solution so that when the phase inversion process is carried out some free spaces are formed in the membrane 35 with more gaps in the polymer more voids are created and result in increased porosity membranes with high porosity will provide high permeate flux as well calculation of the average pore radius on fabricated membranes is done using the guerout elford ferry equation the average pore radii measured were 38 20 1 01 42 30 0 45 41 80 0 27 and 41 40 0 11 nm respectively the pore size results indicate that all fabricated membranes are included in the ultrafiltration membrane criteria namely membranes with pore sizes of 10 100 nm neat psf denotes the membrane with the smallest average pore radius the addition of nanoparticles to the membrane increased the average pore radius of the membrane this increase results from the appearance of gaps in the polymer matrix due to the addition of nanoparticles the larger average pore radius resulted in a decrease in membrane selectivity and the permeate product may not meet the desired quality targets however the average pore radius increase is not too significant and still acceptable as the uf membranes 3 2 3 study of the functional group of fabricated membranes the functional group characteristics of fabricated membranes were investigated using ftir to show the success of adding go and zno nanoparticles to the membrane polymer matrix fig 4 shows the results of ftir analysis for the fabricated membrane and nanoparticles used neat psf of the membrane was recorded with two identical peaks at 1120 1220 cm 1 which indicated the presence of asymmetric stretching of the oso group 36 37 at wavenumbers 1354 cm 1 and 1678 cm 1 a peak was recorded indicating the symmetric stretching of the cc and vibration of the co stretching respectively 36 new peaks were recorded on the psf go membrane at 3500 3600 cm 1 and 1400 1500 cm 1 which were confirmed to be vibrations of the oh stretching and oh bonding groups 37 the recorded two peaks of oxygen containing groups resulted from the addition of go nanoparticles to the membrane on the psf zno membrane a new peak appears at the wavenumber 500 600 cm 1 which is confirmed to be a zno bonding similar to the peaks that appear on the pristine zno 30 on the psf go zno membrane several new peaks appeared at 3500 3600 cm 1 1400 1500 cm 1 and 500 600 cm 1 which were confirmed to be oh stretching oh bonding and vibration of zno groups respectively these new functional groups appear to indicate the successful incorporation of go and zno nanoparticles into the membrane these functional groups are hydrophilic thereby increasing the hydrophilicity of the psf go zno membrane 3 2 4 study of x ray diffraction xrd results of psf go zno membrane to strengthen the evidence of the success of go and zno blending in membranes xrd analysis has been carried out this analysis was also carried out to ensure no leach out from the nanoparticles when the phase inversion process was carried out fig 5 shows the xrd analysis results for neat psf psf go zno pristine zno and pristine go on the neat psf membrane diffractogram we can see broad peaks at 2 theta around 20 which is characteristic of psf no sharp peaks are seen here which indicates that psf exhibits an amorphous structure on the pristine zno diffractogram several sharp peaks were recorded at 2 thetas 31 35 and 38 some small peaks also appear at 2 thetas 48 57 65 and 69 the appearance of these peaks indicates pristine zno is in the crystalline phase the pristine go diffractogram shows a sharp peak at 2 theta 11 which is the characteristic peak of go 38 two peaks appear at 2theta 39 and 69 the diffractogram of the psf go zno membrane shows a similarity to neat psf with the appearance of the same broad peak as neat psf it indicates that this membrane is psf supported the appearance of a peak at 11 indicates the presence of go on this membrane 35 moreover several small peaks that are similar to the zno pristine appear the appearance of go and zno peaks indicates a complete dispersion on the membrane surface therefore the addition of go and zno to the psf membrane was successfully carried out without leached out and nothing dissolved 3 2 5 study of mechanical strength of fabricated membranes mechanical strength analysis is critical to evaluate because it provides information about the strength of the membrane to external pressure during the filtration process the incorporation of go and zno nanoparticles has been proven based on the previously discussed analysis results the addition of these nanoparticles indeed results in changes to the membrane structure the physical structure of the membrane acts as the most important role in terms of mechanical strength mechanical strength analysis has been carried out by testing tensile strength and elongation at break fig 6 a displays the tensile strength analysis results the maximum tensile value that the membrane can sustain before the damage the measured tensile strengths were approximately 3 8 5 5 4 2 and 5 1 mpa for the neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno membranes respectively fig 6 b describes the results of the elongation break analysis of the fabricated membrane elongation at break is the ratio of the increase in the maximum length of the membrane to the initial length after breakage elongation at breaks was measured at around 4 1 15 8 13 9 and 14 1 for the neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno judging from the results of this analysis with the addition of nanoparticles there was an increase in tensile strength and elongation at break in the fabricated membrane the possible explanation is that adding nanoparticles to the membrane helps absorb the energy and forces exerted on the membrane which was in agreement with the previous study 39 this synergetic effect makes the modified membrane does not cause breakage easily when a greater force is applied moreover according to the xrd result the modified membrane shows the formation of crystalline peaks that correspond to the crystalline structure s formation this provides the higher mechanical strength of the modified membrane compared to the pristine membrane nevertheless the addition of go and zno to the membrane in response to tensile strength and elongation at break decreased slightly when compared to psf zno this similar case can also be seen in the psf zno having a higher mechanical strength than psf go it indicates the incorporation of go nanoparticles in the psf go zno membrane slightly decrease the mechanical strength of the fabricated membrane as compared to psf zno membrane this phenomenon is possible because the addition of too much nanoparticles causes a high empty space in the membrane which causes the membrane to become more brittle however the decrement of tensile strength and elongation at break are not significant the role of zno nanoparticles in strengthening mechanical properties is still able to maintain the mechanical strength value of the psf go zno membrane 3 2 6 study of hydrophilicity of fabricated membranes the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface can be determined by measuring the water contact angle water contact angle measurement is done by measuring the angle formed between the water drop surface and the membrane surface fig 6 c shows the results of measuring the water contact angle on fabricated membranes contact angles measured around 80 58 55 and 52 for neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively the smaller the contact angle the more hydrophilic the membrane surface is an increasing tendency to attract water the addition of nanoparticles decreased the contact angle due to the formation of hydrophilic dispersion sites confirmed by ftir spectra which are hydrophilic groups such as oh and or zn o a decrease in contact angle with the addition of nanoparticles has also been reported in several studies 40 42 the incorporation of nanoparticles into the membrane reduces the contact angle due to the induced dipole and dipole dipole interactions between the water and the membrane surface 43 moreover hydrophilicity is an essential factor for enhancing the antifouling potential of the membrane the other method to explain the hydrophilicity of the membrane is water uptake ability the water uptake of membranes strongly depends on the number of hydrophilic sites existing on the membrane surface the other one is the existence of macro voids in the polymer sublayer 44 it can be seen from the water uptake results in fig 6 d that the water uptake increases with the addition of nanoparticles in the membranes water uptakes measured around 18 58 60 and 72 for neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively the water uptake measurement results are in line with the membrane porosity measurement results the addition of go and zno to the membrane was increased membrane porosity increased porosity of the membrane strongly indicates an increase in water uptake ability which means that there is an increase in hydrophilic properties in the membrane matrix and the membrane surface another thing that can be studied in this context is the membrane affinity towards water using theoretical models such as the flory huggins fh model 45 this model can simply explain the phenomenon of the sorption behavior of water in a membrane matrix table 4 shows the results of the calculation of volume fraction and fh interaction parameter the resulting volume fraction calculations are 0 21 2 35 3 04 and 7 01 for neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively on the other hand the fh interaction parameter is a function of the volume fraction was measured 1 24 0 27 0 22 and 0 11 for neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively the fh parameter qualitatively shows the membrane affinity for water the smaller the fh interaction parameter s value the higher the affinity of the membrane towards the water and resulted in an increased water absorption ability 25 the psf go zno membrane showed the smallest fh interaction parameter which indicated that the ability of membrane towards water increased affinity due to go and zno doping the best explanation is that go and zno contribute hydrophilic groups to the membrane so that the membrane s ability to absorb water can increase 3 3 performance evaluation of fabricated membranes 3 3 1 study of flux performance permeate flux is one of the essential methods for observing membrane performance during the filtration process fig 7 a shows the pure water flux pwf of fabricated membranes pwf data were obtained by conducting filtration experiments with di water as feed water based on fig 7 a measured pwfs of approximately 23 31 33 and 38 lm 2 h 1 for the neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively the addition of go and zno nanoparticles was proven to increase the pwf value significantly the addition of nanoparticles into the membrane produces higher availability of hydrophilic sites which expedites the sorption ability of water this pwf test was also used in observing the fouling and the antifouling ability of fabricated membranes observation of the permeate flux performance of fabricated membranes in the prw filtration process has been carried out the filtration process is carried out in the form of cross flow filtration with the aim of preventing the formation of fouling on the membrane surface filtration was operated for 2 5 h and data were collected every 0 5 h fig 7 b shows the permeate flux of membranes with prw as feed water in the filtration experiment at the beginning of the filtration experiment the flux were recorded of 11 14 22 48 31 85 and 35 03 lm 2 h 1 for the neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively however after 2 5 h of filtration the permeate flux were measured of 1 59 15 92 25 41 and 28 66 lm 2 h 1 for the neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively based on this profile the neat psf membrane provides the smallest flux value and poorest stability contrary with the addition of nanoparticles there was an increase in flux performance psf go zno membranes provide the best flux performance and relative flux stability among the four membranes fig 7 c is normalized flux to show the magnitude of the flux decrease during the filtration operation it can be seen from the figure that the neat psf membrane has a very drastic reduction in flux leaving only about 20 of the initial flux value this can be caused because naturally the neat psf membrane surface is hydrophobic so it has a high tendency to attract foulants so that they stick to the membrane surface 46 47 it could be also explain based on less porosity of the neat psf membrane compared to others the embedded membranes with zno and go nanoparticles show significant changes that maintained flux performance by 65 85 and 88 for psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively the hydrophilic nature of zno and go incorporation has a major effect in maintaining the membrane s flux value during filtration the addition of go to the fabricated membranes results in better flux performance in comparison to zno however when these two components were combined in the psf go zno membrane it gave better results than psf go and psf zno this indicates that the incorporation of go and zno in the psf membrane produces a synergistic effect that results in a high antifouling property to stabilize the permeate flux very well the flux stability that can be maintained by the psf go zno membrane is a result of the ability of the membrane surface to maintain a hydrophilic active area which can attract water molecules stronger and reject the foulant resulting in relatively stable flux performance compared to other membranes 42 the profile and magnitude of the permeate flux of the psf go zno membrane are quite comparable with previous nanohybrid membrane studies 35 46 48 3 3 2 study of pollutant rejection of fabricated membranes pollutant rejection is another parameter to evaluate membrane performance in this project the pollutant parameter measured to be removed by the membrane is total dissolved solids tds chemical oxygen demand cod and ph tds and cod are the two primary pollutants with very high concentrations present in prw hence it is exciting to know the ability of the membrane to reject these pollutants the pollutant rejection performances of the fabricated membrane are shown in fig 8 a based on fig 8 a the performance of pollutant rejection of the membrane increases with the addition nanoparticle increased the neat psf rejection performance was found 16 for tds and 6 cod psf zno membrane was rejected 53 27 1 88 for tds and 50 14 1 53 for cod and psf go membrane was rejected 65 92 1 24 for tds and 58 97 1 21 for cod the superior rejection performance was achieved by the psf go zno membrane with 70 21 2 33 for tds and 74 68 0 88 for cod the surface hydrophilicity plays a critical action in this phenomenon the zno and go nanoparticles contribute to the positive electrostatic force to create the positively charged surface 25 besides the increase in surface hydrophilicity water uptake ability volume fraction and membrane porosity obtained from the addition of go and zno nanoparticles also affect the membrane s rejection ability with a more hydrophilic surface hydrophilic sites in hydroxyl carbonyl carboxyl and zinc oxide functional groups will attract water stronger because they have the same polarity and reject pollutants with opposite polarity properties 49 therefore the addition of zno and go nanoparticles to the membrane tends to have higher rejection performance however the uncontrolled addition of nanoparticles would harm the membrane it is due to the agglomeration created by excessive nanoparticles and caused severe damage to membrane pores it will reduce the membrane rejection performance 17 the psf go zno membranes produced in this study have comparable tds and cod rejection capabilities and are still in a good range of performance when compared to research on nanohybrid membranes in other wastewater treatment 39 50 fig 8 b represents the ph of the permeate product of the membranes ph of original prw was 8 83 0 09 this basic condition is due to the existence of ammonium ion nh4 2 ph of the permeate product by filtration using a neat psf membrane was 8 42 0 02 it was the highest permeate ph among the others ph of permeate from filtration by psf zno membrane was 7 52 0 02 and by psf go was 7 48 0 02 the psf go zno membrane shows an excellent permeate ph of 7 12 0 01 it was the closest value of ph to the pure water the incorporation of zno and go nanoparticles would be reduced the measured ph of permeate similar to the previous argument that nanoparticle doping to the membrane tends to have higher rejection performance another finding that the reduced value of ph is caused by the declined value of the electrical conductivity fig 8 c shows the electrical conductivity of the permeate product of the membranes electrical conductivity is indicated the ionic substance contents in the water the more ionic substances the higher the electrical conductivity measured the reduction of electrical conductivity by incorporating zno and go nanoparticles in the membrane occurs by the membrane s positively charged surface to repel the basic type ion in prw which was the ammonium ion the phenomenon of pollutant rejection by the membrane surface is based on surface charge based on the donnan exclusion theory 51 a membrane with a positive surface charge will reject foulant with a positive charge and vice versa a membrane with a negative surface charge will reject foulant with a negative charge based on the literature membranes with the addition of go tend to produce a positively charged surface to reject positively charged pollutants 52 54 therefore the measured ph and electrical conductivity when processed through the membrane show a decrease 3 4 evaluation of antifouling potential and fouling resistance of fabricated membranes the evaluation of antifouling potential was examined to obtain the total fouling ratios rt eq 8 reversible fouling ratios rr eq 9 irreversible fouling ratios rir eq 10 and flux recovery ratios frr eq 11 of fabricated membranes the result of the calculation can be seen in fig 9 the neat psf membrane has the largest rt rr and rir values of the four membranes rt values account for approximately 58 45 18 and 17 for the neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno membranes respectively this fouling ratio shows how much fouling occurs on the membrane surface the greater the fouling ratio value indicating the more generous the fouling that appears on the surface of the membrane this fouling ratio causes the flux performance for the neat psf membrane to be the worst the other membranes that were incorporated with go and zno showed a significant reduction in fouling ratios the decrease in fouling ratios increases the frr value which indicates the ability of the membrane to maintain flux better than the neat psf the higher the fouling ratio value indicates the tendency for fouling on the membrane surface which reduces the membrane s permeability the fouling ratio that the cleaning process can overcome is called the reversible fouling ratio with the characteristics of the adsorptive foulant that sticks to the membrane surface and the fouling ratio that remains even after the cleaning process is called the irreversible fouling ratio with the deposition foulant characteristic which causes pore blockage 55 56 the combination between the two is called the total fouling ratio the addition of go and zno nanoparticles to the membrane increased the antifouling ability of the membrane which was indicated by a decrease in the fouling ratios value and an increase in the frr value the frr value is 50 80 90 86 for neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively to determine the resistance during filtration in the flow of water a resistance in series model was used this model includes the contribution of every kind of membrane fouling resistance such as intrinsic resistance rm deposition fouling rd adsorptive fouling ra and concentration polarization rcp which calculated from eqs 12 15 respectively during the filtration process the membrane is subjected to various types of resistance table 5 shows the calculation of resistance that occurs during the filtration experiment carried out on fabricated membranes intrinsic resistance is caused by the membrane material s resistance and adsorptive fouling resistance indicates the adsorptive mechanism occurred via restriction mechanism 9 the deposition fouling known as pore plugging is caused by the deposition of particle in the membrane s pores this is also known as irreversible fouling and determined the most significant effect of flux recovery ratio 57 concentration polarization shows the accumulation of a mixture of pollutants and water on the membrane surface which provides resistance to obtain a permeate product it can be seen that the neat psf membrane has the highest average resistance value among the four membranes some literature shows that the incorporation of nanoparticles has an effect on reducing fouling resistance due to an increase in surface hydrophilicity and water uptake ability which can reduce fouling resistance on membranes 58 59 49 therefore it can be concluded that the addition of zno and go nanoparticles has a significant reduction effect on the amount of fouling resistances due to increased hydrophilic sites and water uptake ability on the membrane membrane characteristics such as thickness porosity and average pore radius between before and after use for the filtration process were compared from table 6 it can be seen that there was an increase in the thickness of the neat psf membrane from 53 00 0 58 μm to 59 54 0 16 μm this indicates the occurrence of swelling in the neat psf membrane matrix the swelling increased membrane thickness due to the enlargement of the interlayer membrane it also will be decreased the permeate flux of the membrane 60 61 the psf go zno membrane experienced a slight increase in thickness which was 58 00 0 58 μm to 58 54 0 23 μm after being used for the filtration process compared with neat psf the psf go zno membrane has better swelling resistance producing a larger flux recovery value and was relatively more stable it is also interesting that the changes in porosity were recorded before and after the filtration process on the neat psf membrane the porosity was reduced dramatically from 52 20 0 28 μm to 32 20 0 31 μm after being used in the filtration process meanwhile the measured porosity of psf go zno membrane slightly decreased from 83 00 1 18 μm to 78 32 0 43 μm after use the most common issue of the reduction in membrane porosity is caused by pore blockage which is the blockage of membrane pores by pollutants that has been measured as deposition fouling resistance and irreversible fouling ratio 57 these two parameters can be seen that neat psf has value of 1 67 0 09 1014 m 1 for deposition fouling resistance and 50 80 2 94 for the irreversible fouling ratio this value is higher than the psf go zno membrane which is 0 55 0 01 1014 m 1 for deposition fouling resistance and 9 55 1 22 for the irreversible fouling ratio this results in a very dramatic decrease in the flux value of the neat psf and the extraordinary flux stability maintained by the psf go zno membrane as shown in fig 10 fig 10 depicts the result of membrane flux by measuring pwf flux with prw and pwf after the hydraulic flushing process it was carried out for two cycles to closely observe the flux changing and fouling behavior on the neat psf and psf go zno membranes from this figure it can be seen that at the beginning of the filtration using di water the pwf measured for the two membranes has relatively the same stability after filtration using prw the permeate flux decreased gradually for both membranes the neat psf membrane experienced a very dramatic decrease in flux than the psf go zno membrane which experienced a slight decline after 240 min the hydraulic flushing process was carried out on the membrane and then the pwf measurement experiment was conducted for the second time similar to the previous measurement results the two membranes have stable permeability to di water however in this second pwf measurement on the neat psf membrane the measured pwf decreased by 58 32 from the previous pwf while the psf go zno membrane decreased 7 89 from the initial pwf the decrease in flux after this cleaning process is due to deposition fouling which causes permanent blockage of the membrane pores this phenomenon is consistent with the measurement results of the decrease in membrane porosity after the filtration process measurement of prw permeability in cycle 2 shows a flux reduction profile similar to cycle 1 on both membranes from the flux performance after cleaning it can be seen that the psf go zno membrane can maintain a better flux value than the neat psf membrane this is possible because the psf go zno membrane has better antifouling capabilities than the neat psf membrane based on the results of resistance measurements during filtration and flux recovery ability 4 conclusion the use of nanohybrid membrane technology for treating various kinds of wastewater has been proved to show outstanding performance however studies on the addition of a combination of go and zno nanoparticles to psf membranes for prw processing are still minimal in this work hydrophilic and low fouling membranes have been prepared using the nips technique by incorporating go and zno nanoparticles into the psf membrane the addition of a single go or zno component improves several properties of the membrane such as chemical composition porosity average pore radius hydrophilicity and permeability however incorporating both nanoparticles together resulted better performance of membrane rather than by single use of them this research confirmed that the addition of go and zno into the psf membrane causes a significant impact on surface morphology porosity chemical structure and mechanical strength with the addition of 2 zno and 2 go psf go zno the membrane produced the most significant performance in terms of hydrophilicity and antifouling ability the psf go zno membrane had maximum permeate flux of 35 03 lm 2 h 1 tds rejection of 70 21 2 33 and cod rejection of 74 68 0 88 moreover the psf go zno membrane s antifouling performance showed excellent results with a total fouling ratio of only 14 33 1 16 and a flux recovery ratio of up to 90 44 1 22 this membrane has tremendous potential for treating prw into clean water finally this research can contribute to the field of synthesis and membrane applications for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

13529,the fouling formation on the membrane s surface has limited the membrane based separation in industrial activities such as wastewater reclamation and seawater desalination the nanomaterials incorporation has been developed to enhance membrane performance in this study the combination of graphene oxide go and zinc oxide zno nanoparticles to psf membrane to improve the membrane performances to treat the petroleum refinery wastewater prw was performed the sem edx result shows the presence of both go and zno nanoparticles on the membrane s surface they also produced the porosity of 83 00 1 18 for psf go zno which was higher than the neat psf with 52 20 0 28 the ftir and xrd result has confirmed the presence of go and zno in the membrane that caused the increment in hydrophilicity and mechanical strength the addition of go and zno nanoparticles has reduced the water contact angle from 80 to 52 and increased water uptake ability from 16 to 75 compared to the neat psf it has also resulted in the highest permeate flux and pollutant removal compared to the other membranes with a maximum permeate flux of 35 03 l m 2 h 1 and a rejection value 70 21 2 33 for total dissolved solids tds and 74 68 0 88 for chemical oxygen demand cod the fouling resistance evaluation showed the addition of go and zno nanoparticles successfully reduced the resistance during filtration indicating a reduction in fouling tendency on the membrane s surface these phenomena are proven by the antifouling potential analysis at the addition of go and zno nanoparticles was exhibited the highest flux recovery ratio up to 90 44 1 22 keywords graphene oxide zinc oxide low fouling membrane hydrophilic membrane wastewater treatment 1 introduction petroleum refinery wastewater prw is the wastewater which was generated by the petroleum refinery industry this industry generated up to 30 50 cubic meters of prw per ton of crude oil 1 that massive amount of wastewater has not met the effective handling and immediate disposal to the environment that made worse impacts some works have been conducted to discover an affordable and effective technique to reduce the contaminants from prw and become accessible to be more usable water prw contains high quantities of pollutant such as chemical oxygen demand cod of 300 600 ppm biochemical oxygen demand bod of 150 250 ppm oil and grease content of 100 400 ppm phenol content of 10 200 ppm benzene content of 1 100 mg l pb content up to 10 ppm cr content of about 150 ppm and many others 2 prw can be utilized to another application of water after being through the proper treatment there are several methods have been applied to utilize this wastewater physical biochemical electrochemical chemical treatment and membrane filtration have been used to treat prw the physical treatment has shown the superior performance and widely used in many plants by using a series of screening coagulation flocculation and so on but this treatment cannot operate as stand alone unit thus need the secondary process which lack in efficiency 3 the biochemical method by using activated sludge to degrade the contaminants in prw has been shown that the processing condition should intensively maintain in certain strict conditions thus made a tremendous complex operation maintenance 4 the electrocoagulation technique has been appeared as the promising method to treat prw in diverse pollutant contents electrocoagulation has a simple design low sludge generation good removal efficiency in terms of heavy metal 5 contrary electrocoagulation process needs the highly electrical voltage and current to perform best performance thus made this method is risky and need advance safety system to be operated among of those techniques membrane filtration becomes as a sophisticated option due to its numerous benefits including efficient separation compact unit operation high productivity low energy and relatively acceptable maintenance costs 2 among various well developed procedures for reduction of prw contaminant parameters such as tds cod ammonia content phenolic compound turbidity etc 2 membrane technology especially the ultrafiltration uf process has achieved consideration for possessing numerous benefits for the prw treatment process some striking advantages for using the uf process such as no proper phase changes increase energy efficiency as well as easy conducted operation 6 polysulfone psf has been a well known and popularly used polymer in the fabricating of uf membranes for its superiority in mechanical chemical properties thermal features low cost and desirable flux performance 7 nevertheless the psf hydrophobic property makes it vulnerable to the fouling caused by its high tendency to adsorb organic components 8 the accumulation of organic components on the membrane s surface brings about the severe effect of pore blockage as the undesirable effect of fouling reduced permeate flux and shorter durability of the membrane besides due to the fouling s complex cleaning processes the generated cost would not be affordable 1 some techniques to eschew the disadvantages of membrane fouling have been reported polymer blending has been prepared to reduce the hydrophobicity of the psf membrane through the nonsolvent induced phase inversion process 9 the addition of polymeric membrane with numerous type of nanoparticles such as zinc oxide zno 10 titanium oxide tio2 11 silicon oxide sio2 12 13 zirconium oxide zro2 14 aluminum oxide al2o3 6 iron oxide fe3o4 14 carbon nanotube graphene oxide go 15 reduced graphene oxide rgo 16 has been published to improve the polymeric membrane characteristics not only the hydrophilicity but also antifouling potential flux and pollutant rejections and the mechanical strength of the psf membrane as a member of hydrophilic materials zno nanoparticle has been prepared to produce zno modified polyether sulfone pes using polyethylene glycol peg as the pore generating agent 17 kusworo and coworkers reported that incorporation of zno in membrane microstructure led to improved water uptake and hydrophilicity permeate flux and rejection porosity increment flux recovery ratio and antifouling potential of the membrane a study conducted by nasrollahi and coworkers have recently observed the effect of zno on pes membranes as well and found about increasing up to 200 in permeate flux and found an excellent reduction of irreversible resistance of the pes membranes as well 18 xu and coworkers reported that zno nanoparticles addition to the pvdf membranes maintained steady fluxes 100 flux recovery 19 even though zno nanoparticles result in excellent properties in various types of polymeric membranes modification there are weaknesses and limitations the common issue for the addition of zno nanoparticles is that the nano size particle tends to agglomerate leading to non uniform distribution during the membrane fabrication 20 therefore graphene oxide go nano layers have been observed as an excellent platform to produce a better dispersion of nanoparticles and become a superb innovative additive in membrane fabrication 15 this mechanism has been provided by the interaction effect between the nanoparticles and the go hydrophilic layer the functional groups of go carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are essential to form the hybrid micro structure with some nanoparticles such as sio2 21 tio2 and ag 22 go has attained a versatile application particularly in wastewater processing due to the highly hydrophilic group content 23 the incorporation of go nanoparticles would be improved the antifouling potentials of the membrane caused by the low friction of the membrane surface and water molecules 15 additionally the permeate flux increases as the effect of the more facile pass of the stream of water molecules between the go nano layers 23 prw has a very high pollutant content and requires a separation method that is reliable inexpensive durable and easy to operate the use of nanohybrid membrane technology for treating various kinds of wastewater has been proved to show outstanding performance however studies on the addition of a combination of go and zno nanoparticles to psf membranes for prw processing are still minimal therefore in this study prw processing was carried out using psf membranes with the addition of go and zno to improve membrane properties and performance the membrane properties and performance were characterized by several analyzes and approaches finally the ultimate goal was for the psf go zno membrane to perform the less fouling tendency to treat the prw into more usable water effectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polysulfone psf as the

moved to another chamber filled with di water for 24 h to separate the solvent finally the membrane was dried in ambient conditions for 24 h 2 4 initial characterization of prw initial characterization of prw was done to determine the characteristics of this wastewater as shown in table 2 several parameters were measured such as physical appearance and total dissolved solid tds

using a digital micrometer micrometer mitutoyo 293 japan the porosity of the membrane was investigated using water adsorption and gravimetric approximation firstly the membrane was soaked in di water for 24 h and weighing the film after mopping the water on the surface using filter paper it was then placed in an oven at 60 c for 24 h and then put in a desiccator before measuring the weight of the dry membrane the porosity of the membrane was calculated using eq 1 24 1 ε w f w i ρ w a δ 100 where ε is the membrane porosity wf and wi are the mass of the wet and dry membranes gram respectively

densities of solvent and the membrane respectively 2 8 performance study of fabricated composite psf go zno membrane the separation performance of the membrane was evaluated using a cross flow filtration module with a flat sheet membrane with a diameter of 4 cm and the operating pressure was constant at 5 bar the schematic illustration of membrane filtration apparatus is shown in fig 1 2 8 1 permeate flux permeate flux is the amount of water across through the membrane per unit of area per unit of time the pure water flux and prw flux were observed to understand the permeability performance of the membrane the permeate flux was calculated using eq 6 6 j v a t where j is the permeate flux meanwhile v a t are the volume of permeate l effective membrane contact area m2 and

and energy dispersive x ray sem edx were applied to study the morphological image and chemical composition of zno and go nanoparticles sem edx is a type of electron microscope used to capture the picture of a sample using the combination of high energy of electron and x ray wave this energy beam produced the interaction between the beam and constituent of the sample and give reaction signals reveals essential data such as composition surface image and other properties 26 fig 2 a depicts the sem edx result of zno this image confirms the initial formation of zno nanoparticles and the chemical composition as well this result shows the spherical shape of the zno nanoparticles at some points the agglomeration is formed into larger particles with undefined morphology this agglomerated structure is caused by the high tendency of nanoparticles to stick one to the others 27 the composition of zno powders consists of 85 wt of zinc and 14 55 wt of oxygen fig 2 b shows the sem edx of go nanoparticles this image exhibits the evidence that go has been established as a rectangular shape and consisted of layers this go thin layer promotes charge carriers that could enhance the hydrophilicity 28 these go thin layers also increase its efficiency of surface area the go powders composition consisted of 37 86 wt of carbon c and 62 14 wt of oxygen o ftir spectrum of zno and go were used to determine the chemical functional group exhibit in the nanoparticles fig 2 c represents the ftir spectrum of zno nanoparticles the broad stretch peak at around 3440 cm 1 indicated the appearance of the oh stretch the peak around 1300 cm 1 shows the asymmetric stretching vibration it marks the presence of nitrate no3 29 the sharp peak at around 600 400 cm 1 is showed zn o groups 30 this analysis indicates that all of the functional groups exhibit in zno nanoparticles are in hydrophilic properties fig 2 d displays the ftir spectrum of go nanoparticles we can observe a broad peak around 2000 3800 cm 1 it can be indicated to oh stretching groups and can be due to water adsorbed in go nanoparticles the appearance of more than a single oh stretch corresponds that go has oh groups in different types oh maybe appear in the form of alcohol phenol enolic and carboxylic 31 32 the peak at 1700 cm 1 indicates the presence of co stretching of cooh and the peak at about 1600 cm 1 has been identified to epoxide linkage and fore bending vibration of the water molecule 3 2 characterization of fabricated membrane 3 2 1 study of surface morphology and chemical composition of fabricated membranes to evaluate the effect of zno and go nanoparticles on the membrane surface morphology and its chemical compositions the sem edx analysis was applied fig 3 shows the surface image and chemical composition of a neat psf b psf zno c psf go and d psf go zno images fig 3 a represents the smooth surface without any pores captured the absence of polymer clumps on the membrane surface indicated that the polymer mixing process and nips were successful the surface chemical composition shows that this membrane is composed of three elements carbon oxygen and sulfur with 83 45 wt 11 09 wt and 5 46 wt respectively without modification this polymer is hydrophobic due to the absence of water attracting groups fig 3 b displays a surface image and chemical composition of the psf zno membrane when viewed carefully on the surface of the psf zno membrane several white dots indicate the presence of zno nanoparticles these dots are visible very few suggesting that most of the zno nanoparticles are present in the membrane sublayer agreed with edx data there are indeed elementals of zno in this membrane with elements detected are carbon oxygen sulfur and zinc with a composition of 80 76 wt 11 70 wt 4 73 wt and 2 81 wt respectively the increase in oxygen composition and zinc presence indicates that the addition of zno nanoparticles to this membrane was successful fig 3 c shows an image of the surface and chemical composition of the psf go membrane in the picture it can be seen a different structure on the surface of this membrane this kind of clot possibly affects the formation of polymer clots due to the inhomogeneity of the dope solution recorded chemical compositions are carbon oxygen and sulfur with 79 76 wt 16 95 wt and 3 29 wt respectively compared to neat psf the psf go membrane has a lower carbon and sulfur composition and a higher oxygen content this condition is due to the fact that go nanoparticles have an oxygen content of 62 14 wt so that after being added to the membrane the oxygen composition increases fig 3 d displays a surface image and chemical composition of the psf zno go membrane it can be seen that there are dots that are spread almost evenly across the membrane s surface the distribution of these points is more massive than the psf zno and psf go membranes this is possible because the number of nanoparticles added to the psf go zno membrane is greater than that of psf go and psf zno however the nanoparticles were spread relatively evenly not to cause an agglomerate on the membrane which could adversely affect the membrane s performance by decreasing the pollutant removal ability the recorded membrane composition contained several elements carbon oxygen sulfur and zinc with 77 54 wt 17 21 wt 2 97 wt and 2 28 wt respectively compared with the neat psf membrane it can be seen that there is a decrease in the composition of carbon and sulfur and an increase in the elemental oxygen and zinc the decrease in carbon and sulfur composition occurred due to the addition of zno and go nanoparticles zno and go nanoparticles have an oxygen content of 14 55 wt and 62 14 wt respectively they contribute to oxygen composition and thus increase the psf go zno membrane based on the increase in oxygen and the recorded elemental of zinc therefore the addition of go and zno nanoparticles to the psf membrane was successfully carried out 3 2 2 pore properties of fabricated membranes the membrane porosity and average pore radius were carried out using eqs 1 and 2 respectively the thickness porosity and average pore radius analysis of the fabricated membrane are presented in table 3 the study of membrane thickness shows that with the addition of nanoparticles there is an increase in membrane thickness the membrane thicknesses measured 53 00 0 58 55 00 0 10 54 70 0 33 and 58 00 0 58 μm for neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively this increase in thickness occurs due to the polymer s swelling effect due to the addition of nanoparticles the thickest one happened in the psf go zno membrane which was the highest nanoparticle addition among the four membranes the increase in membrane thickness will increase the resistance of transport through the membrane 33 34 however the increase in thickness that occurs in the fabricated membrane is not significant so that the effect of increasing resistance due to thickness is not significant as well in the results of the porosity analysis of fabricated membranes it can be seen that a significant increase in porosity due to the addition of nanoparticles the membrane porosity measured was 52 20 0 28 66 70 0 83 73 00 1 42 83 00 1 18 for neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively the amount of porosity shows the level of availability of void space in the membrane a membrane with a lower porosity indicates that the membrane is denser on the other hand a membrane with higher porosity means a high void space in the membrane the porosity analysis results showed that the addition of nanoparticles contributed to an increase in the porosity of the fabricated membrane this can occur because of the formation of gaps between the inside of the polymer in the manufacture of the dope solution so that when the phase inversion process is carried out some free spaces are formed in the membrane 35 with more gaps in the polymer more voids are created and result in increased porosity membranes with high porosity will provide high permeate flux as well calculation of the average pore radius on fabricated membranes is done using the guerout elford ferry equation the average pore radii measured were 38 20 1 01 42 30 0 45 41 80 0 27 and 41 40 0 11 nm respectively the pore size results indicate that all fabricated membranes are included in the ultrafiltration membrane criteria namely membranes with pore sizes of 10 100 nm neat psf denotes the membrane with the smallest average pore radius the addition of nanoparticles to the membrane increased the average pore radius of the membrane this increase results from the appearance of gaps in the polymer matrix due to the addition of nanoparticles the larger average pore radius resulted in a decrease in membrane selectivity and the permeate product may not meet the desired quality targets however the average pore radius increase is not too significant and still acceptable as the uf membranes 3 2 3 study of the functional group of fabricated membranes the functional group characteristics of fabricated membranes were investigated using ftir to show the success of adding go and zno nanoparticles to the membrane polymer matrix fig 4 shows the results of ftir analysis for the fabricated membrane and nanoparticles used neat psf of the membrane was recorded with two identical peaks at 1120 1220 cm 1 which indicated the presence of asymmetric stretching of the oso group 36 37 at wavenumbers 1354 cm 1 and 1678 cm 1 a peak was recorded indicating the symmetric stretching of the cc and vibration of the co stretching respectively 36 new peaks were recorded on the psf go membrane at 3500 3600 cm 1 and 1400 1500 cm 1 which were confirmed to be vibrations of the oh stretching and oh bonding groups 37 the recorded two peaks of oxygen containing groups resulted from the addition of go nanoparticles to the membrane on the psf zno membrane a new peak appears at the wavenumber 500 600 cm 1 which is confirmed to be a zno bonding similar to the peaks that appear on the pristine zno 30 on the psf go zno membrane several new peaks appeared at 3500 3600 cm 1 1400 1500 cm 1 and 500 600 cm 1 which were confirmed to be oh stretching oh bonding and vibration of zno groups respectively these new functional groups appear to indicate the successful incorporation of go and zno nanoparticles into the membrane these functional groups are hydrophilic thereby increasing the hydrophilicity of the psf go zno membrane 3 2 4 study of x ray diffraction xrd results of psf go zno membrane to strengthen the evidence of the success of go and zno blending in membranes xrd analysis has been carried out this analysis was also carried out to ensure no leach out from the nanoparticles when the phase inversion process was carried out fig 5 shows the xrd analysis results for neat psf psf go zno pristine zno and pristine go on the neat psf membrane diffractogram we can see broad peaks at 2 theta around 20 which is characteristic of psf no sharp peaks are seen here which indicates that psf exhibits an amorphous structure on the pristine zno diffractogram several sharp peaks were recorded at 2 thetas 31 35 and 38 some small peaks also appear at 2 thetas 48 57 65 and 69 the appearance of these peaks indicates pristine zno is in the crystalline phase the pristine go diffractogram shows a sharp peak at 2 theta 11 which is the characteristic peak of go 38 two peaks appear at 2theta 39 and 69 the diffractogram of the psf go zno membrane shows a similarity to neat psf with the appearance of the same broad peak as neat psf it indicates that this membrane is psf supported the appearance of a peak at 11 indicates the presence of go on this membrane 35 moreover several small peaks that are similar to the zno pristine appear the appearance of go and zno peaks indicates a complete dispersion on the membrane surface therefore the addition of go and zno to the psf membrane was successfully carried out without leached out and nothing dissolved 3 2 5 study of mechanical strength of fabricated membranes mechanical strength analysis is critical to evaluate because it provides information about the strength of the membrane to external pressure during the filtration process the incorporation of go and zno nanoparticles has been proven based on the previously discussed analysis results the addition of these nanoparticles indeed results in changes to the membrane structure the physical structure of the membrane acts as the most important role in terms of mechanical strength mechanical strength analysis has been carried out by testing tensile strength and elongation at break fig 6 a displays the tensile strength analysis results the maximum tensile value that the membrane can sustain before the damage the measured tensile strengths were approximately 3 8 5 5 4 2 and 5 1 mpa for the neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno membranes respectively fig 6 b describes the results of the elongation break analysis of the fabricated membrane elongation at break is the ratio of the increase in the maximum length of the membrane to the initial length after breakage elongation at breaks was measured at around 4 1 15 8 13 9 and 14 1 for the neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno judging from the results of this analysis with the addition of nanoparticles there was an increase in tensile strength and elongation at break in the fabricated membrane the possible explanation is that adding nanoparticles to the membrane helps absorb the energy and forces exerted on the membrane which was in agreement with the previous study 39 this synergetic effect makes the modified membrane does not cause breakage easily when a greater force is applied moreover according to the xrd result the modified membrane shows the formation of crystalline peaks that correspond to the crystalline structure s formation this provides the higher mechanical strength of the modified membrane compared to the pristine membrane nevertheless the addition of go and zno to the membrane in response to tensile strength and elongation at break decreased slightly when compared to psf zno this similar case can also be seen in the psf zno having a higher mechanical strength than psf go it indicates the incorporation of go nanoparticles in the psf go zno membrane slightly decrease the mechanical strength of the fabricated membrane as compared to psf zno membrane this phenomenon is possible because the addition of too much nanoparticles causes a high empty space in the membrane which causes the membrane to become more brittle however the decrement of tensile strength and elongation at break are not significant the role of zno nanoparticles in strengthening mechanical properties is still able to maintain the mechanical strength value of the psf go zno membrane 3 2 6 study of hydrophilicity of fabricated membranes the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface can be determined by measuring the water contact angle water contact angle measurement is done by measuring the angle formed between the water drop surface and the membrane surface fig 6 c shows the results of measuring the water contact angle on fabricated membranes contact angles measured around 80 58 55 and 52 for neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively the smaller the contact angle the more hydrophilic the membrane surface is an increasing tendency to attract water the addition of nanoparticles decreased the contact angle due to the formation of hydrophilic dispersion sites confirmed by ftir spectra which are hydrophilic groups such as oh and or zn o a decrease in contact angle with the addition of nanoparticles has also been reported in several studies 40 42 the incorporation of nanoparticles into the membrane reduces the contact angle due to the induced dipole and dipole dipole interactions between the water and the membrane surface 43 moreover hydrophilicity is an essential factor for enhancing the antifouling potential of the membrane the other method to explain the hydrophilicity of the membrane is water uptake ability the water uptake of membranes strongly depends on the number of hydrophilic sites existing on the membrane surface the other one is the existence of macro voids in the polymer sublayer 44 it can be seen from the water uptake results in fig 6 d that the water uptake increases with the addition of nanoparticles in the membranes water uptakes measured around 18 58 60 and 72 for neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively the water uptake measurement results are in line with the membrane porosity measurement results the addition of go and zno to the membrane was increased membrane porosity increased porosity of the membrane strongly indicates an increase in water uptake ability which means that there is an increase in hydrophilic properties in the membrane matrix and the membrane surface another thing that can be studied in this context is the membrane affinity towards water using theoretical models such as the flory huggins fh model 45 this model can simply explain the phenomenon of the sorption behavior of water in a membrane matrix table 4 shows the results of the calculation of volume fraction and fh interaction parameter the resulting volume fraction calculations are 0 21 2 35 3 04 and 7 01 for neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively on the other hand the fh interaction parameter is a function of the volume fraction was measured 1 24 0 27 0 22 and 0 11 for neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively the fh parameter qualitatively shows the membrane affinity for water the smaller the fh interaction parameter s value the higher the affinity of the membrane towards the water and resulted in an increased water absorption ability 25 the psf go zno membrane showed the smallest fh interaction parameter which indicated that the ability of membrane towards water increased affinity due to go and zno doping the best explanation is that go and zno contribute hydrophilic groups to the membrane so that the membrane s ability to absorb water can increase 3 3 performance evaluation of fabricated membranes 3 3 1 study of flux performance permeate flux is one of the essential methods for observing membrane performance during the filtration process fig 7 a shows the pure water flux pwf of fabricated membranes pwf data were obtained by conducting filtration experiments with di water as feed water based on fig 7 a measured pwfs of approximately 23 31 33 and 38 lm 2 h 1 for the neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively the addition of go and zno nanoparticles was proven to increase the pwf value significantly the addition of nanoparticles into the membrane produces higher availability of hydrophilic sites which expedites the sorption ability of water this pwf test was also used in observing the fouling and the antifouling ability of fabricated membranes observation of the permeate flux performance of fabricated membranes in the prw filtration process has been carried out the filtration process is carried out in the form of cross flow filtration with the aim of preventing the formation of fouling on the membrane surface filtration was operated for 2 5 h and data were collected every 0 5 h fig 7 b shows the permeate flux of membranes with prw as feed water in the filtration experiment at the beginning of the filtration experiment the flux were recorded of 11 14 22 48 31 85 and 35 03 lm 2 h 1 for the neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively however after 2 5 h of filtration the permeate flux were measured of 1 59 15 92 25 41 and 28 66 lm 2 h 1 for the neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively based on this profile the neat psf membrane provides the smallest flux value and poorest stability contrary with the addition of nanoparticles there was an increase in flux performance psf go zno membranes provide the best flux performance and relative flux stability among the four membranes fig 7 c is normalized flux to show the magnitude of the flux decrease during the filtration operation it can be seen from the figure that the neat psf membrane has a very drastic reduction in flux leaving only about 20 of the initial flux value this can be caused because naturally the neat psf membrane surface is hydrophobic so it has a high tendency to attract foulants so that they stick to the membrane surface 46 47 it could be also explain based on less porosity of the neat psf membrane compared to others the embedded membranes with zno and go nanoparticles show significant changes that maintained flux performance by 65 85 and 88 for psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively the hydrophilic nature of zno and go incorporation has a major effect in maintaining the membrane s flux value during filtration the addition of go to the fabricated membranes results in better flux performance in comparison to zno however when these two components were combined in the psf go zno membrane it gave better results than psf go and psf zno this indicates that the incorporation of go and zno in the psf membrane produces a synergistic effect that results in a high antifouling property to stabilize the permeate flux very well the flux stability that can be maintained by the psf go zno membrane is a result of the ability of the membrane surface to maintain a hydrophilic active area which can attract water molecules stronger and reject the foulant resulting in relatively stable flux performance compared to other membranes 42 the profile and magnitude of the permeate flux of the psf go zno membrane are quite comparable with previous nanohybrid membrane studies 35 46 48 3 3 2 study of pollutant rejection of fabricated membranes pollutant rejection is another parameter to evaluate membrane performance in this project the pollutant parameter measured to be removed by the membrane is total dissolved solids tds chemical oxygen demand cod and ph tds and cod are the two primary pollutants with very high concentrations present in prw hence it is exciting to know the ability of the membrane to reject these pollutants the pollutant rejection performances of the fabricated membrane are shown in fig 8 a based on fig 8 a the performance of pollutant rejection of the membrane increases with the addition nanoparticle increased the neat psf rejection performance was found 16 for tds and 6 cod psf zno membrane was rejected 53 27 1 88 for tds and 50 14 1 53 for cod and psf go membrane was rejected 65 92 1 24 for tds and 58 97 1 21 for cod the superior rejection performance was achieved by the psf go zno membrane with 70 21 2 33 for tds and 74 68 0 88 for cod the surface hydrophilicity plays a critical action in this phenomenon the zno and go nanoparticles contribute to the positive electrostatic force to create the positively charged surface 25 besides the increase in surface hydrophilicity water uptake ability volume fraction and membrane porosity obtained from the addition of go and zno nanoparticles also affect the membrane s rejection ability with a more hydrophilic surface hydrophilic sites in hydroxyl carbonyl carboxyl and zinc oxide functional groups will attract water stronger because they have the same polarity and reject pollutants with opposite polarity properties 49 therefore the addition of zno and go nanoparticles to the membrane tends to have higher rejection performance however the uncontrolled addition of nanoparticles would harm the membrane it is due to the agglomeration created by excessive nanoparticles and caused severe damage to membrane pores it will reduce the membrane rejection performance 17 the psf go zno membranes produced in this study have comparable tds and cod rejection capabilities and are still in a good range of performance when compared to research on nanohybrid membranes in other wastewater treatment 39 50 fig 8 b represents the ph of the permeate product of the membranes ph of original prw was 8 83 0 09 this basic condition is due to the existence of ammonium ion nh4 2 ph of the permeate product by filtration using a neat psf membrane was 8 42 0 02 it was the highest permeate ph among the others ph of permeate from filtration by psf zno membrane was 7 52 0 02 and by psf go was 7 48 0 02 the psf go zno membrane shows an excellent permeate ph of 7 12 0 01 it was the closest value of ph to the pure water the incorporation of zno and go nanoparticles would be reduced the measured ph of permeate similar to the previous argument that nanoparticle doping to the membrane tends to have higher rejection performance another finding that the reduced value of ph is caused by the declined value of the electrical conductivity fig 8 c shows the electrical conductivity of the permeate product of the membranes electrical conductivity is indicated the ionic substance contents in the water the more ionic substances the higher the electrical conductivity measured the reduction of electrical conductivity by incorporating zno and go nanoparticles in the membrane occurs by the membrane s positively charged surface to repel the basic type ion in prw which was the ammonium ion the phenomenon of pollutant rejection by the membrane surface is based on surface charge based on the donnan exclusion theory 51 a membrane with a positive surface charge will reject foulant with a positive charge and vice versa a membrane with a negative surface charge will reject foulant with a negative charge based on the literature membranes with the addition of go tend to produce a positively charged surface to reject positively charged pollutants 52 54 therefore the measured ph and electrical conductivity when processed through the membrane show a decrease 3 4 evaluation of antifouling potential and fouling resistance of fabricated membranes the evaluation of antifouling potential was examined to obtain the total fouling ratios rt eq 8 reversible fouling ratios rr eq 9 irreversible fouling ratios rir eq 10 and flux recovery ratios frr eq 11 of fabricated membranes the result of the calculation can be seen in fig 9 the neat psf membrane has the largest rt rr and rir values of the four membranes rt values account for approximately 58 45 18 and 17 for the neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno membranes respectively this fouling ratio shows how much fouling occurs on the membrane surface the greater the fouling ratio value indicating the more generous the fouling that appears on the surface of the membrane this fouling ratio causes the flux performance for the neat psf membrane to be the worst the other membranes that were incorporated with go and zno showed a significant reduction in fouling ratios the decrease in fouling ratios increases the frr value which indicates the ability of the membrane to maintain flux better than the neat psf the higher the fouling ratio value indicates the tendency for fouling on the membrane surface which reduces the membrane s permeability the fouling ratio that the cleaning process can overcome is called the reversible fouling ratio with the characteristics of the adsorptive foulant that sticks to the membrane surface and the fouling ratio that remains even after the cleaning process is called the irreversible fouling ratio with the deposition foulant characteristic which causes pore blockage 55 56 the combination between the two is called the total fouling ratio the addition of go and zno nanoparticles to the membrane increased the antifouling ability of the membrane which was indicated by a decrease in the fouling ratios value and an increase in the frr value the frr value is 50 80 90 86 for neat psf psf zno psf go and psf go zno respectively to determine the resistance during filtration in the flow of water a resistance in series model was used this model includes the contribution of every kind of membrane fouling resistance such as intrinsic resistance rm deposition fouling rd adsorptive fouling ra and concentration polarization rcp which calculated from eqs 12 15 respectively during the filtration process the membrane is subjected to various types of resistance table 5 shows the calculation of resistance that occurs during the filtration experiment carried out on fabricated membranes intrinsic resistance is caused by the membrane material s resistance and adsorptive fouling resistance indicates the adsorptive mechanism occurred via restriction mechanism 9 the deposition fouling known as pore plugging is caused by the deposition of particle in the membrane s pores this is also known as irreversible fouling and determined the most significant effect of flux recovery ratio 57 concentration polarization shows the accumulation of a mixture of pollutants and water on the membrane surface which provides resistance to obtain a permeate product it can be seen that the neat psf membrane has the highest average resistance value among the four membranes some literature shows that the incorporation of nanoparticles has an effect on reducing fouling resistance due to an increase in surface hydrophilicity and water uptake ability which can reduce fouling resistance on membranes 58 59 49 therefore it can be concluded that the addition of zno and go nanoparticles has a significant reduction effect on the amount of fouling resistances due to increased hydrophilic sites and water uptake ability on the membrane membrane characteristics such as thickness porosity and average pore radius between before and after use for the filtration process were compared from table 6 it can be seen that there was an increase in the thickness of the neat psf membrane from 53 00 0 58 μm to 59 54 0 16 μm this indicates the occurrence of swelling in the neat psf membrane matrix the swelling increased membrane thickness due to the enlargement of the interlayer membrane it also will be decreased the permeate flux of the membrane 60 61 the psf go zno membrane experienced a slight increase in thickness which was 58 00 0 58 μm to 58 54 0 23 μm after being used for the filtration process compared with neat psf the psf go zno membrane has better swelling resistance producing a larger flux recovery value and was relatively more stable it is also interesting that the changes in porosity were recorded before and after the filtration process on the neat psf membrane the porosity was reduced dramatically from 52 20 0 28 μm to 32 20 0 31 μm after being used in the filtration process meanwhile the measured porosity of psf go zno membrane slightly decreased from 83 00 1 18 μm to 78 32 0 43 μm after use the most common issue of the reduction in membrane porosity is caused by pore blockage which is the blockage of membrane pores by pollutants that has been measured as deposition fouling resistance and irreversible fouling ratio 57 these two parameters can be seen that neat psf has value of 1 67 0 09 1014 m 1 for deposition fouling resistance and 50 80 2 94 for the irreversible fouling ratio this value is higher than the psf go zno membrane which is 0 55 0 01 1014 m 1 for deposition fouling resistance and 9 55 1 22 for the irreversible fouling ratio this results in a very dramatic decrease in the flux value of the neat psf and the extraordinary flux stability maintained by the psf go zno membrane as shown in fig 10 fig 10 depicts the result of membrane flux by measuring pwf flux with prw and pwf after the hydraulic flushing process it was carried out for two cycles to closely observe the flux changing and fouling behavior on the neat psf and psf go zno membranes from this figure it can be seen that at the beginning of the filtration using di water the pwf measured for the two membranes has relatively the same stability after filtration using prw the permeate flux decreased gradually for both membranes the neat psf membrane experienced a very dramatic decrease in flux than the psf go zno membrane which experienced a slight decline after 240 min the hydraulic flushing process was carried out on the membrane and then the pwf measurement experiment was conducted for the second time similar to the previous measurement results the two membranes have stable permeability to di water however in this second pwf measurement on the neat psf membrane the measured pwf decreased by 58 32 from the previous pwf while the psf go zno membrane decreased 7 89 from the initial pwf the decrease in flux after this cleaning process is due to deposition fouling which causes permanent blockage of the membrane pores this phenomenon is consistent with the measurement results of the decrease in membrane porosity after the filtration process measurement of prw permeability in cycle 2 shows a flux reduction profile similar to cycle 1 on both membranes from the flux performance after cleaning it can be seen that the psf go zno membrane can maintain a better flux value than the neat psf membrane this is possible because the psf go zno membrane has better antifouling capabilities than the neat psf membrane based on the results of resistance measurements during filtration and flux recovery ability 4 conclusion the use of nanohybrid membrane technology for treating various kinds of wastewater has been proved to show outstanding performance however studies on the addition of a combination of go and zno nanoparticles to psf membranes for prw processing are still minimal in this work hydrophilic and low fouling membranes have been prepared using the nips technique by incorporating go and zno nanoparticles into the psf membrane the addition of a single go or zno component improves several properties of the membrane such as chemical composition porosity average pore radius hydrophilicity and permeability however incorporating both nanoparticles together resulted better performance of membrane rather than by single use of them this research confirmed that the addition of go and zno into the psf membrane causes a significant impact on surface morphology porosity chemical structure and mechanical strength with the addition of 2 zno and 2 go psf go zno the membrane produced the most significant performance in terms of hydrophilicity and antifouling ability the psf go zno membrane had maximum permeate flux of 35 03 lm 2 h 1 tds rejection of 70 21 2 33 and cod rejection of 74 68 0 88 moreover the psf go zno membrane s antifouling performance showed excellent results with a total fouling ratio of only 14 33 1 16 and a flux recovery ratio of up to 90 44 1 22 this membrane has tremendous potential for treating prw into clean water finally this research can contribute to the field of synthesis and membrane applications for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest
