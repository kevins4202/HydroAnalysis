7995,study region middle niger river basin mnrb ansongo to niamey sahel west africa study focus although mnrb hydrology and the red flood phenomena have been addressed in the past literature water quality parameters and suspended particulate matter spm dynamics remain poorly known spm impacts dam silting exacerbating flooding and microbial water quality this study couples in situ spm measurements to radiometric measurements by in situ and satellite sensors to analyse the temporal and spatial evolution of spm in the mnrb and assess the contribution of the local flood red flood to spm in niamey new hydrological insights for the region spm is composed of very fine kaolinites with a major mode around 200 300 nanometers which results in high reflectance in the visible and infrared bands radiometric measurements by both radiometer and sentinel 2 msi sensors are well correlated to in situ spm allowing efficient spatio temporal monitoring of spm concentration spm increases very rapidly at the beginning of the rainy season reaching a peak characterized by very high spm values about one month before the red flood satellite data highlight the significant contribution of the right bank tributaries to spm in the mnrb during this period spm then decreases and remains low despite the second runoff increase black flood arriving in niamey after the end of the rainy season from the upper basin graphical abstract ga1 keywords middle niger river suspended particulate matter optical remote sensing discharge kaolinite sentinel 2 msi data 1 introduction the niger river basin plays a major cultural historical and socio economical role in west africa autorité du bassin du fleuve niger abfn 2018 it is home to more than 130 million people throughout nine countries niger basin nexus profile 2018 the river is an essential resource for drinking water fishing irrigation hydroelectric power generation and navigation transportation dieye et al 2020 droy and morand 2013 paturel et al 2020 moreover many large cities are located on the banks of the niger river such as bamako 2 71 million people in 2020 in mali and niamey 1 3 million people in 2020 in niger worldpopulationreview 2022 the niger river originates in the humid guinean zone which receives more than 2000 mm of rain per year and the basin is divided into four units fig 1 the upper niger the inner delta the middle niger and the lower niger amogu 2009 in its middle part the river runs more than 1000 km through the sahelian region and shows distinct flow regime at different locations at ansongo located in mali about 350 km upstream of niamey the annual hydrograph displays one discharge peak typically occurring between october and march olivry 2002 this flood black flood has its origins in water contributions from the upper basin and arrives at ansongo well after the end of the rainy season because of a two to three months residence time in the inner niger delta two different discharge peaks are observed in niamey fig 2 in addition to the previous flood a large second flood the red flood occurs during the local rainy season typically between june and september amani and nguetora 2002 this flood is the result of rainfall and water inputs from tributaries located downstream of ansongo in the middle part of the niger river basin the low water period in niamey extends between april and may the sahelian part of the niger river watershed is very sensitive to climatic variations and anthropogenic constraints nicholson et al 1998 since the 1960 s this region has experienced rainfall deficits beginning in the late 1960 s to 1990 s of 20 40 and a retreat of isohyets 1970 1989 over 200 km to the south hulme et al 2001 lebel and ali 2009 severe droughts in the early 1970 s and the early mid 1980 s led to a decrease in vegetation cover and an increase of erosion processes descroix et al 2012 descroix et al 2015 descroix et al 2018 janicot et al 1996 in 1985 the niger river even stopped flowing in niamey billon 1985 after the drought period the vegetation globally recovered following the return of precipitations dardel et al 2014a dardel et al 2014b however some small areas show a persistent decrease in vegetation cover and consequently an increase in surface runoff descroix et al 2018 gal et al 2017 in addition the mnrb is a highly populated area strong demographic growth 3 8 per year in niger over the last seven decades world bank 2017 has led to an extension of cultived areas and an intensification of natural resource exploitation forest savannah rangeland leblanc et al 2008 tidjani 2008 the deforestation in these areas has increased the amount of bare surfaces and weakened the sahelian soils that undergo erosive actions of wind and rain abdourhamane touré et al 2010 overall changes in land cover due to climatic variations and or anthropogenic factors have led to a general increase in runoff and have caused endorheism breaks in the middle niger river watershed amogu et al 2010 descroix et al 2018 favreau et al 2009 mahé et al 2013 an example of this situation is the intensification of the red flood phenomenon that was observed in niamey after the 90 s and the recurrent floodings occurring in niamey causing severe damage in the river plain cassé et al 2016 mahamadou et al 2018 the greatest flood ever registered in niamey was recorded in 2020 lebel et al 2020 tiepolo et al 2021 fig 2 past ongoing and future changes in the niger river hydrology are supposed to deeply affect water resources but also water quality parameters in particular increased erosion and or increase in precipitation amount and intensity panthou et al 2018 taylor et al 2017 would lead to an increase of sediment transport and of suspended particulate matter spm in surface waters this would impact in turn water flow and dam silting with further consequences on floods in addition spm plays also an important role on aquatic ecosystems i e hauer et al 2018 pennock and sharp 1994 and human health by facilitating the transport and the development of pathogens robert et al 2021 rochelle newall et al 2015 zheng and digiacomo 2017 if the niger river hydrology and the red flood phenomena have been widely addressed in the literature from a quantitative point of view water quality and spm monitoring has received much less attention measurements of spm in the niger river basin are generally sparse and limited in time in the middle part of the niger watershed the earliest spm measurements were carried out between 1976 and 1982 for the feasibility study of a dam at kandadji gallaire 1995 more recently amogu 2009 reported spm concentrations in the middle niger and alhou et al 2016 recorded two years fortnightly sampling from april 2011 to march 2013 of spm measurements at niamey however a detailed assessment of the spatio temporal dynamics of spm at a fine temporal scale has yet to be done this study fills this information gap by providing spm at a daily scale and during several hydrological cycles remote sensing techniques have been developed for inland water studies in the last 20 years to provide estimates of spm variability in space and time data from optical radiometers detect near surface sediments but this information has been successfully used to assess total suspended solid and sediment transport in various rivers martinez et al 2009 nechad et al 2010 petus et al 2010 pinet et al 2017 most of the studies addressing spm dynamics in rivers use data from medium resolution sensors such as the medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis because a high temporal frequency is necessary to correctly sample the rapid dynamics of rivers however their coarse spatial resolution ranging from 250 m in the visible and the near infrared nir to 1 km in the short wave infrared swir bands for modis is not sufficient to accurately monitor the niger river particularly during low water periods when river reaches are narrower only recently have high resolution satellite data been available at the temporal frequency necessary to monitor spm over smaller dynamics rivers in particular the multispectral instrument msi sensor on board the sentinel 2 provides data every 5 days at a 10 m spatial resolution in the visible and near infrared bands and 20 m in the swir bands such data have proved efficient to monitor spm dynamics in different water bodies i e caballero et al 2018 liu et al 2017 pahlevan et al 2017 several algorithms have been developed to retrieve spm from radiometric measurements from satellite over turbid waters using theoretical nechad et al 2010 semi empirical shen et al 2010 and empirical approaches mostly site specifics doxaran et al 2002 robert et al 2017 caballero et al 2018 li et al 2019 renosh et al 2020 employing wavelengths in the nir domain in combination with those in the visible range li et al 2019 or alone robert et al 2017 has been shown useful to avoid saturation for high spm values switching algorithms shen et al 2010 han et al 2016 novoa et al 2017 caballero et al 2018 renosh et al 2020 have been proved efficient to address a wide range of spm values until now few studies have focused on the sahelian region as it is quite challenging for optical remote sensing this is because on the one hand the very high atmospheric aerosol loading mineral dust and biomass burning and the highly variable water vapor content make atmospheric corrections difficult and on the other hand the very high values of reflectance of west african waters challenge inversion algorithms classically used in other regions some encouraging result have been obtained on a few lakes using data from landsat kaba et al 2014 robert et al 2016 robert et al 2017 and sentinel 2 msi robert et al 2021 but further validation especially for rivers is needed the main objective of this work was to analyse the spatio temporal dynamics of spm in the middle niger river together with the hydrological variability and water discharge at niamey and in the upstream part of the basin to do this we first assess the potential of radiometric measurements by both an in situ skye radiometer and sentinel 2 msi to monitor spm in this area skye data are then employed to complete the temporal series of spm sampled in situ to get daily time series over three years finally sentinel 2 msi data are used to explore the spatial variability of spm in the middle niger river and to assess the overall contribution of the red flood to spm arriving at niamey 2 material and methods 2 1 study site in situ measurements were carried out in niamey located downstream of the confluences of some major middle niger river tributaries like the sirba the dargol and the gorouol fig 1 the area is characterized by a semi arid tropical climate with well marked contrasting seasons a rainy season may september and a dry season october april the average rainfall between 1970 and 2017 in niamey was equal to 527 36 mm per year hamadou younoussa et al 2020 the potential evapotranspiration etp is around 3000 mm per year allies et al 2020 in niamey two drinking water treatment plants ensure the supply of the potable water 72 of which is provided by the goudel station our sampling site with remaining water provided by the yantala station both plants are located on the left bank of the niger river discharge data were obtained from the niger basin authority nba the flow rate is measured daily at 00 00 with an automatic hydrometer seba ps light 2gsm the data used in this study cover three hydrological cycles between 2018 and 2021 fig 2 during this period maximum discharge was 2136 m3 s 1 2620 m3 s 1 and 3998 m3 s 1 for the red floods of 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the record value in 2020 is the highest discharge peak ever measured since the station was built in 1929 largely exceeding the previous 2492 m3 s 1 record of 2012 lebel et al 2020 the maximum discharge recorded for the black flood during this study was the 22th of january 2019 with 2238 m3 s 1 the low water period occurring between april and may with very low discharges 60 m3 s 1 in april 2020 2 2 suspended particulate matter spm measurements spm measurements were conducted between july 17 2018 and august 16 2020 river water samples were collected between 10 a m and 1 p m from the top 20 cm of the water column in 500 ml bottles the sampling point lat 13 520313 north lon 2 066145 east is located on the left bank and is approximately 7 m from the shoreline fig 1 the river water was collected at different time steps to follow the hydrological variability during the red flood the sampling time step was daily from july 1 to august 15 2019 and every 2nd day from july 1 to august 15 2020 outside the red flood period the sampling time step varied from one week until the end of the rainy season to one month during the remaining of the hydrological cycle the sampled water was homogenized and then 50 ml were collected and filtered through a whatman fiberglass filter with a porosity of 0 7 µm the filters were previously heated to 105 c and weighed the sediment deposited on the filter was heated again at 105 c for 1h30 and then re weighed the spm concentration was calculated for each sampling date from the spm mass and the volume of filtered water eq 1 1 spm mfs mf vw where mfs is the filter mass with sediment mf is the original filter mass vw is the filtered water volume two or three replicates were made for each water sample and averaged to reduce noise and check consistency the particle size distribution and mineralogy of sediments were assessed over few water samples collected during the black flood 2017 10 06 and 2017 10 24 and the red flood 2018 07 03 2018 07 08 2018 07 09 and 2019 08 06 the particle size distribution was measured with a partica la 950v2 laser granulometer partica la950 v2 horiba 2022 the particles were also observed with a jeol jem 2100 f transmission electron microscope tem with an operating voltage of 200 kv and a resolution of 2 3 å cmos gatan rio 16is 4 k camera the mineralogy was determined using edxs analysis ultim max tem 80 mm2 windowless oxford instruments for tem imaging and microanalysis the sample was resuspended under ultrasonication a drop of suspension was deposited on a formvar coated copper grid and excess water was blotted with filter paper 2 3 niger river water reflectance the niger river water reflectance was measured in situ with a skye radiometer installed at the water sampling point location since july 2018 the radiometer is composed of two sensors skr1840d i two channel sensor skye instruments ltd wales uk measuring the incoming radiation in the red and infrared bands at the same wavelengths as the sentinel 2 msi sensor centred at 665 4 nm and 829 0 nm data were recorded every 30 min with a datahog2 skye one sensor steered to the southwest looks at the water surface at a 45 angle fig 3 to measure the total radiance ifov 25 sensor height 2 m above the highest water the other one measures the incoming irradiance cosine response sensor to integrate hemispherical irradiance remote sensing reflectance is computed as the ratio of up welling radiance by incoming irradiance and then multiplied by a factor π to give the dimensionless surface reflectance eq 2 to be compared to sentinel 2 msi surface reflectance total up welling radiance comprises water leaving radiance and specular reflection at the water surface caused by skyglint 2 ρ π rrs π l ed where ρ is the skye radiometer surface reflectance dimensionless rrs the skye remote sensing reflectance sr 1 l is the total observed radiance μmol sr 1 m 2 s 1 and ed the down welling irradiance μmol m 2 s 1 sentinel 2 msi data are collected by two polar orbiting satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b launched in 2015 and 2017 respectively placed on the same orbit allowing a revisit time of 5 days at the equator they carry a multi spectral instrument drusch et al 2012 with four bands at 10 m six bands at 20 m and three bands at 60 m spatial resolution for this work we used the three visible bands bands 2 3 and 4 respectively at 490 nm 560 nm and 665 nm and the near infrared band nir band 8 at 842 nm at 10 m spatial resolution as well as the shortwave infrared band band 12 at 2190 nm at 20 m spatial resolution sentinel 2 msi surface reflectance level 2 a products are made available over the study area by the theia land data center www theia land fr they are corrected for atmospheric effects using the maccs atcor joint algorithm maja processing chain hagolle et al 2015 the processing chain hagolle et al 2017 analyses temporal series of level 1 c images and ancillary data to detect clouds and clouds shadows to estimate the atmospheric optical thickness including aerosols the adjacency effects including atmospheric scattering and multiple reflections between the surface and the atmosphere and to apply a terrain correction based on topography the atmospheric corrections are performed for pixels classified as land and extrapolated for pixels classified as water the maja processing chain has been developed for land surface reflectance it benefits from previous algorithm evaluations and is widely used other atmospheric corrections schemes exist some targeting aquatic surface specifically kuhn et al 2019 pahlevan et al 2021 spm is only retrieved for clear sky pixels classified as open water sentinel 2 msi pixels not already masked by the maja chain as clouds aerosols or cloud shadows are classified as water pixels if the modified normalized difference water index mndwi which is calculated as the difference between the green band and the swir band divided by their sum is lower than 0 2 robert et al 2017 an additional threshold on the green band reflectance is added to avoid unmasked residuals clouds values lower than 0 4 are retained in order to avoid possible land adjacency effects the sentinel 2 msi data employed at the goudel sampling station and at the ansongo site were averaged over a square box three pixels away from the shores measurements of spm concentration made at a day difference day before and day after with the satellite acquisition were considered in order to increase the number of match ups 10 dates 3 results 3 1 spm nature and granulometric sizes over the study period spm concentration ranges from 0 01 g l 1 to 1 9 g l 1 the lowest concentrations occur at the beginning of the dry season mean 0 0416 g l 1 and standard deviation 0 0324 g l 1 calculated over the 1st october 28th february 2019 period the spm concentration slightly increases over the march may period and then more rapidly at the onset of the red flood from june onwards to reach its maximum around 2 g l 1 in july the term suspended particulate matter is used here for particles suspended in a water column from the nano scale to sand sized sediments bilotta et al 2012 niger river spm s size distributions curves reveal two well pronounced modes during the red flood fig 4 the two modes are centred around 0 172 0 296 and 3 9 µm ranging from medium sands to ultrafine clay particles during the black flood the same modes were found with less fine particles now centred around 0 26 µm and the larger one around 5 12 6 72 µm these fine particles are often associated in aggregates fig 5 and are predominantly composed of kaolinite and iron oxyhydroxides with minor occurrences of quartz illite muscovite and ilmenite trace amounts of organic matter were also observed in the red flood samples 3 2 monitoring spm with in situ and satellite radiometry within a day the temporal evolution of the skye radiometer reflectance is relatively constant in the morning but presents important peaks in the afternoon more or less pronounced according to the period of the year due to sunglint effect i e specular reflection of direct sun radiation observed on the red and nir bands this is consistent with the skye acquisition geometry and the sensor looking toward the south west fig 3 sunglint effects are also observed on the band ratio nir red fig 6 for each day reflectance data were therefore averaged over the 9 11 a m period only which corresponds to the time range with constant data and sun target sensor geometry less prone to glint effect glint angle larger than 50 at 10 h relative azimuth in the 80 160 interval in addition the match up interval between morning radiometer data and spm collection times is of the order of 2 h considering 9 11 h averages does not eliminate skyglint skye radiometer daily reflectance is then compared to sentinel 2 msi reflectance satellite and in situ data are well correlated in both the red and the nir band fig 7 the coefficient of determination r2 is 0 93 and 0 92 for the red and the nir respectively the rmsd root mean square difference 0 02 and 0 03 and mape mean absolute percentage error 9 3 and 63 8 reflectance measured by both the skye and the sentinel 2 msi sensors in the red and nir bands showed a strong seasonality with extremely high values fig 8 reaching 0 35 0 40 during the rainy season june september that are rarely encountered in large rivers the yearly maxima for the three years of the study period were similar msi value are generally higher than skye values during the dry season at the end of march beginning of april particularly on the nir band as is also apparent by the scatter in low nir values shown in fig 7 this is likely due to the impact of high aerosol content which is quite important at this period due to harmattan wind coming from the sahara desert and is probably not completely corrected by the maja scheme spm concentrations measured in situ are strongly correlated with reflectance or reflectance ratio the best fit is obtained using power relationships between spm and the nir band for sentinel 2 msi rmse 0 19 mape 36 7 n 25 and spm and the nir red index for the skye radiometer rmse 0 17 mape 30 6 n 125 fig 9a b eqs 3 and 4 below 3 spm 32 7892 b8 2 91417

retrieved spm obtained by the two equations above are well correlated to in situ spm measurements with rmse equal to 0 19 g l 1 and bias equal to 0 01 g l 1 for sentinel 2 msi and rmse equal to 0 17 g l 1 and bias equal to 0 007 g l 1 for the radiometer the r2 quantifying the goodness of the fit between spm measured and retrieved are equal to 0 84 for sentinel 2 msi and 0 90 for the in situ radiometer fig 9c 3 3 spm dynamics and niger river discharge the evolution of spm concentration is in phase advance in comparison to the river discharge dynamic fig 10 at the beginning of the red flood period june to september the spm concentration begins to increase and reaches its maximum at least one month before water level rises fig 10 which is typically an effect of the first flush bertrand krajewski et al 1998 the highest spm concentrations of 0 5 2 g l 1 are measured during low less than 500 m3 s 1 to medium 500 1000 m3 s 1 river discharge then while water discharge increases the spm concentration starts decreasing and continues to decrease during the peak of the red flood and afterwards fig 11 when the black flood reached niamey the spm concentration has already undergone a 10 time decrease this period is characterized by discharges that can approach 2000 m3 s 1 and low spm concentration of about 0 1 g l 1 i e 5 to more than 20 times lower than those measured during the red flood conditions fig 11 when the black flood decreases the spm concentration is still low but shows some variations between february and april the low water period displays the lowest discharge and spm values around 0 01 g l 1 spm interannual variability appears to be quite different at the beginning of the red flood with much lower spm values in 2019 than in 2018 and 2020 during the month of june fig 12 interestingly spm values of those three years become more similar at the core of the red flood although a huge difference is observed in discharge the highest discharge peak ever observed since the installation of the hydrographic station in the niger river at niamey occurred at the beginning of september 2020 3398 m3 s 1 despite this impressive discharge the spm concentration did not further increase and its value at this period in 2020 is similar with those observed in 2018 and slightly lower than the spm values in 2019 3 4 spm spatial distribution and middle niger basin contribution the main tributaries of the niger river contributing to the red flood are located downstream of ansongo and the hydrographs at this location do not show the red flood discharge peak cassé et al 2016 spm concentrations retrieved from sentinel 2 msi are similar at ansongo and niamey during the black flood period from october to may during the rainy season june september periods spm peaks are observed at both locations although with very different absolute values while at niamey the maximum concentration is about 1 5 g l 1 at ansongo it reaches only 0 15 g l 1 fig 13 this clearly shows the role of the tributaries of the middle niger in the spm routing to niamey during the red flood the average spm difference between niamey and ansongo is equal to 0 185 g l 1 over this three year period 10 times higher than the mean spm value at ansongo for the same period the significant spm contribution at the very beginning of the rainy season from the sirba river see the example in fig 14a for the 17th of june 2020 further highlights this phenomenon the sirba river a main tributary of the middle niger river contributes to 80 of the water supply recorded at the hydrological station of niamey amani and nguetora 2002 massazza et al 2019 in contrast no major differences are found between the sirba and the niger river spm concentration during the black flood fig 14b 4 discussion the aim of this study was to estimate the spm spatio temporal variability in mnrb combining available information by in situ measurements and satellite data simple relationships were therefore used to retrieve spm ad hoc for the study site from the skye and msi reflectances based on commonly employed power functions as in robert et al 2017 reflectance measurements by in situ and satellite measurements proved efficient to monitor the spm dynamics in the middle niger basin the retrieval performances obtained by both skye and sentinel 2 msi are very good and generally better than those obtained by other optical remote sensing sensors such as modis and landsat in the same region kaba et al 2014 robert et al 2016 robert et al 2017 however employing a multi band approach according to the spm range as suggested by novoa et al 2017 and han et al 2016 may provide a good option to improve spm retrievals and derive a robust relationship widely applicable over different water bodies sunglint was found to significantly affect the in situ radiometric measurements and reflectance as well as the band ratio as a result only a portion of the measurements acquired within a day can be used to investigate spm dynamics at a sub daily scale this could be overcome by using several radiometers pointing at different directions or by applying sunglint correction based on the swir reflectance harmel et al 2018 skyglint was not corrected for and causes fluctuations in the nir and red reflectance especially for overcast mornings the reflectance ratio is less affected by this effect this may be the reason why the ratio is more efficient for spm retrieval for all sky radiometer data as opposed to the nir reflectance for sentinel 2 msi for which clear sky conditions are selected although it is not obvious on our data heavy dust loadings may also impact the skye radiometer nir and red reflectances but probably less so the reflectance ratio overall the reflectance ratio data display relatively small variability during the morning period suggesting that varying cloudiness or wind conditions are not major issues here and that rapid variability of spm sub daily is not common the high values of the red and nir reflectance in this river may attenuate sunglint and skyglint effects above surface routine monitoring of water colour is mostly applied to ocean or coastal water where these issues are more severe mobley 1999 zibordi et al 2009 the results shown in this study suggest that this kind of measurements could be used for tropical turbid rivers either alone or in combination with high resolution satellite data sentinel 2 msi reflectance acquired for the niamey station did not seem to be affected by sunglint problems the niamey station is located on the western edge of the sentinel 2 swath and given that the satellite overpasses at about 10h30 in the morning specular reflection from the sun is unlikely at this site this is not the case for the ansongo site that is at the eastern edge of the sentinel 2 swath and which may therefore be subject to sunglint effects they would result in an overestimation of retrieved spm at this site which would further increase the difference observed between niamey and ansongo and would not change our findings significantly overall the atmospheric correction scheme applied by the maja chain has proved accurate enough to monitor spm variability however some issues remain these concern particularly the impact of aerosols mineral dust on sentinel 2 msi reflectance as indicated by the higher reflectance observed for sentinel 2 msi in both the nir and the red band compared to skye reflectances in the march april period fig 8 the spm characteristics and their small size combined with their high concentration resulted in the very high values of reflectance observed in this area in both the visible and the nir bands the nature of spm in the middle niger at the latitude of niamey is dominated by kaolinite iron oxyhydroxides and quartz this composition is consistent with the nature of the sandy and sandy silty sahelian soils stroosnijder 1982 and the outcropping rocks dominated by ferruginous sandstones of the terminal continental yaou et al 2019 the iron oxyhydroxides would then come from the erosion of these surfaces the kaolinite originates from the soils of the middle basin which are recognized as not very reactive because of that kaolinitic nature mahamane et al 2020 spm concentration showed an important intra annual variability the maximum concentration 2 g l 1 was recorded at the beginning of the rainy season june july it was much higher than in the upper basins 0 6 g l 1 at banankoro picouet et al 2009 and lower than that observed on the gorouol tributary at alcongui 3 751 g l 1 in 2007 08 amogu 2009 the high spm concentration in the middle part of the niger river is likely related to the low vegetation cover at the beginning of the rainy season leading to strong soil erosion indeed the soils have experienced significant crusting and increased erosion resulting in tons of sediment drained into the river mamadou 2012 previous measurements of spm concentration in the middle niger although discontinuous have shown quantities of the same order about 0 182 g l 1 to 1 5787 g l 1 alhou et al 2016 in the major rivers of west africa the senegal faye et al 2020 and the black volta in tanguasie bowan and tingan 2020 the concentrations of spm measured were respectively 1 4 and 2 15 times lower than those of the middle niger river spm concentration decrease observed during the rising water should rather be related to the conjugation of vegetation development on the water basin and the net decrease of the free elements in surfaces already washed out by the first rains a similar decrease in spm concentration occurring at the same period was observed in the bangou kirey lake located east of the niamey and ascribed to water dilution due to the rise in the water table abdourhamane touré et al 2016 at the end of the black flood close to the low water season the spm concentration displays a slight increase in the absence of any input of water flow by runoff this increase may be ascribed to the decrease in water volume leading to a local production of particles by the phenomenon of bank erosion alternatively the march april period is characterized by an increase in the speed of the trade winds harmattan that could stir the water and resuspend particles abdourhamane touré et al 2018 a similar increase in the middle of the dry season has been observed for sahelian lakes in northern mali robert et al 2017 with wind driven turbulence possibly inducing a recirculation of bottom and bank sediments the spm discharge hysteresis of the niger river at niamey are quite different from most hydrological systems during the red flood the spm discharge curve follow the classic scenario observed in the tropics with the maximum of spm occurring before the discharge peak this is the case for example at the congo river outlet n kaya et al 2020 for the mississippi snedden et al 2007 or orinoco gallay et al 2019 however a major difference lies in the fact that the discharge curve of the niger river at niamey presents a second peak absent in these other systems this peak is characterized by low spm values which produce a distinctive feature for the middle niger river in terms of inter annual variability it is striking that the 2020 red flood which was severe in niamey did not notably increase the river s spm concentration 5 conclusion this study has documented the spm spatio temporal variability in the middle niger river radiometric measurements collected in situ or by satellite proved useful to monitor spm which in this area is characterized by very fine kaolinite and iron oxyhydroxide particles that at high concentrations resulted in extremely high values of reflectance good relationships were established between the radiometric measurements nir red for skye in situ radiometer and nir b8 for sentinel 2 msi and spm concentration this allowed to retrieve spm concentration at niamey at a daily time step skye measurements and to analyse their spatial variability within the middle niger river sentinel 2 msi the red flood was characterised by very high spm values with the spm maximum reached at least one month before the maximum of the discharge while low spm values were recorded during the black flood we have highlighted the important spm contribution from the main tributary of the middle niger river during the red flood which explains the difference in spm between niamey and ansongo located upstream finally the interannual variability of spm during the red flood was not found to play a major role on spm concentration in particular spm values after july in 2020 were similar to those in the previous two years despite that record discharge values measured in 2020 however future changes in spm concentration under climate and anthropic changes as for example the intensification of the hydrological cycle or the dam construction planned at the upstream on niamey and their impacts on spm concentration in niamey cannot be excluded and strongly underline the need to maintain monitoring of spm in this area author statement conceptualization m b m m gr a a t l k and e r

quality parameters and suspended particulate matter spm dynamics remain poorly known spm impacts dam silting exacerbating flooding and microbial water quality this study couples in situ spm measurements to radiometric measurements by in situ and satellite sensors to analyse the temporal and spatial evolution of spm in the mnrb and assess the contribution of the local flood red flood to spm in niamey new hydrological insights for the region spm is composed of very fine kaolinites with a major mode around 200 300 nanometers which results in high reflectance in the visible and infrared bands radiometric measurements by both radiometer and sentinel 2 msi sensors are well correlated to in situ spm allowing efficient spatio temporal monitoring of spm concentration spm increases very rapidly at the beginning of the rainy season reaching a peak characterized by very high spm values about one month before the red flood satellite data highlight the significant contribution of the right bank tributaries to spm in the mnrb during this period spm then decreases and remains low despite the second runoff increase black flood arriving in niamey after the end of the rainy season from

worldpopulationreview 2022 the niger river originates in the humid guinean zone which receives more than 2000 mm of rain per year and the basin is divided into four units fig 1 the upper niger the inner delta the middle niger and the lower niger amogu 2009 in its middle part the river runs more than 1000 km through the sahelian region and shows distinct flow regime at different locations at ansongo located in mali about 350 km upstream of niamey the annual hydrograph displays one discharge peak typically occurring between october and march olivry 2002 this flood black flood has its origins in water contributions from the upper basin and arrives at ansongo well after the end of the rainy season because of a two to three months residence time in the inner niger delta two different discharge peaks are observed in niamey fig 2 in addition to the previous flood a large second flood the red flood occurs during the local rainy season typically between june and september amani and nguetora 2002 this flood is the result of rainfall and water inputs from tributaries located downstream of ansongo in the middle part of the niger river basin the low water period in niamey extends between april and may the sahelian part of the niger river watershed is very sensitive to climatic variations and anthropogenic constraints nicholson et al 1998 since the 1960 s this region has experienced rainfall deficits beginning in the late 1960 s to 1990 s of 20 40 and a retreat of isohyets 1970 1989 over 200 km to the south hulme et al 2001 lebel and ali 2009 severe droughts in the early 1970 s and the early mid 1980 s led to a decrease in vegetation cover and an increase of erosion processes descroix et al 2012 descroix et al 2015 descroix et al 2018 janicot et al 1996 in 1985 the niger river even stopped flowing in niamey billon 1985 after the drought period the vegetation globally recovered following the return of precipitations dardel et al 2014a dardel et al 2014b

breaks in the middle niger river watershed amogu et al 2010 descroix et al 2018 favreau et al 2009 mahé et al 2013 an example of this situation is the intensification of the red flood phenomenon that was observed in niamey after the 90 s and the recurrent floodings occurring in niamey causing severe damage in the river plain cassé et al 2016 mahamadou et al 2018 the greatest flood ever registered

quality parameters in particular increased erosion and or increase in precipitation amount and intensity panthou et al 2018 taylor et al 2017 would lead to an increase of sediment transport and of suspended particulate matter spm in surface waters this would impact in turn water flow and dam silting with further consequences on floods in addition spm plays also an important role on aquatic ecosystems i e hauer et al 2018 pennock and sharp 1994 and human health by facilitating the transport and the development of pathogens robert et al 2021 rochelle newall et al 2015 zheng and digiacomo 2017 if the niger river hydrology and the red flood phenomena have been widely addressed in the literature from a quantitative point of view water quality and spm monitoring has received much less attention measurements of spm in the niger river basin are generally sparse and limited in time in the middle part of the niger watershed the earliest spm measurements were carried out between 1976 and 1982 for the feasibility study of a dam at kandadji gallaire 1995 more recently amogu 2009 reported spm concentrations in the middle niger and alhou et al 2016 recorded two years fortnightly sampling from april 2011 to march 2013 of spm measurements at niamey however a detailed assessment of the spatio temporal dynamics of spm at a fine temporal scale has yet to be done this study fills this information gap by providing spm at a daily scale and during several hydrological cycles remote sensing techniques have been developed for inland water studies in the last 20 years to provide estimates of spm variability in space and time data from optical radiometers detect near surface sediments but this information has been successfully used to assess total suspended solid and sediment transport in various rivers martinez et al 2009 nechad et al 2010 petus et al 2010 pinet et al 2017 most of the studies addressing spm dynamics in rivers use data from medium resolution sensors such as the medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis because a high temporal frequency is necessary to correctly sample the rapid dynamics of rivers however their coarse spatial resolution ranging from 250 m in the visible and the near infrared nir to 1 km in the short wave infrared swir bands for modis is not sufficient to accurately monitor the niger river particularly during low water periods when river reaches are narrower only recently have high resolution satellite data been available at the temporal frequency necessary to monitor spm over smaller dynamics rivers in particular the multispectral instrument msi sensor on board the sentinel 2 provides data every 5 days at a 10 m spatial resolution in the visible and near infrared bands and 20 m in the swir bands such data have proved efficient to monitor spm dynamics in different water bodies i e caballero et al 2018 liu et al 2017 pahlevan et al 2017 several algorithms have been developed to retrieve spm from radiometric measurements from satellite over turbid waters using theoretical nechad et al 2010 semi empirical shen et al 2010 and empirical approaches mostly site specifics doxaran et al 2002 robert et al 2017 caballero et al 2018 li et al 2019 renosh et al 2020 employing wavelengths in the nir domain in combination with those in the visible range li et al 2019 or alone robert et al 2017 has been shown useful to avoid saturation for high spm values switching algorithms shen et al 2010 han et al 2016 novoa et al 2017 caballero et al 2018 renosh et al 2020 have been proved efficient to address a wide range of spm values until now few studies have focused on the sahelian region as it is quite challenging for optical remote sensing this is because on the one hand the very high atmospheric aerosol loading mineral dust and biomass burning and the highly variable water vapor content make atmospheric corrections difficult and on the other hand the very high values of reflectance of west african waters challenge inversion algorithms classically used in other regions some encouraging result have been obtained on a few lakes using data from landsat kaba et al 2014 robert et al 2016 robert et al 2017 and sentinel 2 msi robert et al 2021 but further validation especially for rivers is needed the main objective of this work was to analyse the spatio temporal dynamics of spm in the middle niger river together with the hydrological variability and water discharge at niamey and in the upstream part of the basin to do this we first assess the potential of radiometric measurements by both an in situ skye radiometer and sentinel 2 msi to monitor spm in this area skye data are then employed to complete the temporal series of spm sampled in situ to get daily time series over three years finally sentinel 2 msi data are used to explore the spatial variability of spm in the middle niger river and to assess the overall contribution of the red flood to spm arriving at niamey 2 material and methods 2 1 study site in situ measurements were carried out in niamey located downstream of the confluences of some major middle niger river tributaries like the sirba the dargol and the gorouol fig 1 the area is characterized by a semi arid tropical climate with well marked contrasting seasons a rainy season may september and a dry season october april the average rainfall between 1970 and 2017 in niamey was equal to 527 36 mm per year hamadou younoussa et al 2020 the potential evapotranspiration etp is around 3000 mm per year allies et al 2020 in niamey two drinking water treatment plants ensure the supply of the potable water 72 of which is provided by the goudel station our sampling site with remaining water provided by the yantala station both plants are located on the left bank of the niger river discharge data were obtained from the niger basin authority nba the flow rate is measured daily at 00 00 with an automatic hydrometer seba ps light 2gsm the data used in this study cover three hydrological cycles between 2018 and 2021 fig 2 during this period maximum discharge was 2136 m3 s 1 2620 m3 s 1 and 3998 m3 s 1 for the red floods of 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the record value in 2020 is the highest discharge peak ever measured since the station was built in 1929 largely exceeding the previous 2492 m3 s 1 record of 2012 lebel et al 2020 the maximum discharge recorded for the black flood during this study was the 22th of january 2019 with 2238 m3 s 1 the low water period occurring between april and may with very low discharges 60 m3 s 1 in april 2020 2 2 suspended particulate matter spm measurements spm measurements were conducted between july 17 2018 and august 16 2020 river water samples were collected between 10 a m and 1 p m from the top 20 cm of the water column in 500 ml bottles the sampling point lat 13 520313 north lon 2 066145 east is located on the left bank and is approximately 7 m from the shoreline fig 1 the river water was collected at different time steps to follow the hydrological variability during the red flood the sampling time step was daily from july 1 to august 15 2019 and every 2nd day from july 1 to august 15 2020 outside the red flood period the sampling time step varied from one week until the end of the rainy season to one month during the remaining of the hydrological cycle the sampled water was homogenized and then 50 ml were collected and filtered through a whatman fiberglass filter with a porosity of 0 7 µm the filters were previously heated to 105 c and weighed the sediment deposited on the filter was heated again at 105 c for 1h30 and then re weighed the spm concentration was calculated for each sampling date from the spm mass and the volume of filtered water eq 1 1 spm mfs mf vw where mfs is the filter mass with sediment mf is the original filter mass vw is the filtered water volume two or three replicates were made for each water sample and averaged to reduce noise and check consistency the particle size distribution and mineralogy of sediments were assessed over few water samples collected during the black flood 2017 10 06 and 2017 10 24 and the red flood 2018 07 03 2018 07 08 2018 07 09 and 2019 08 06 the particle size distribution was measured with a partica la 950v2 laser granulometer partica la950 v2 horiba 2022 the particles were also observed with a jeol jem 2100 f transmission electron microscope tem with an operating voltage of 200 kv and a resolution of 2 3 å cmos gatan rio 16is 4 k camera the mineralogy was determined using edxs analysis ultim max tem 80 mm2 windowless oxford instruments for tem imaging and microanalysis the sample was resuspended under ultrasonication a drop of suspension was deposited on a formvar coated copper grid and excess water was blotted with filter paper 2 3 niger river water reflectance the niger river water reflectance was measured in situ with a skye radiometer installed at the water sampling point location since july 2018 the radiometer is composed of two sensors skr1840d i two channel sensor skye instruments ltd wales uk measuring the incoming radiation in the red and infrared bands at the same wavelengths as the sentinel 2 msi sensor centred at 665 4 nm and 829 0 nm data were recorded every 30 min with a datahog2 skye one sensor steered to the southwest looks at the water surface at a 45 angle fig 3 to measure the total radiance ifov 25 sensor height 2 m above the highest water the other one measures the incoming irradiance cosine response sensor to integrate hemispherical irradiance remote sensing reflectance is computed as the ratio of up welling radiance by incoming irradiance and then multiplied by a factor π to give the dimensionless surface reflectance eq 2 to be compared to sentinel 2 msi surface reflectance total up welling radiance comprises water leaving radiance and specular reflection at the water surface caused by skyglint 2 ρ π rrs π l ed where ρ is the skye radiometer surface reflectance dimensionless rrs the skye remote sensing reflectance sr 1 l is the total observed radiance μmol sr 1 m 2 s 1 and ed the down welling irradiance μmol m 2 s 1 sentinel 2 msi data are collected by two polar orbiting satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b launched in 2015 and 2017 respectively placed on the same orbit allowing a revisit time of 5 days at the equator they carry a multi spectral instrument drusch et al 2012 with four bands at 10 m six bands at 20 m and three bands at 60 m spatial resolution for this work we used the three visible bands bands 2 3 and 4 respectively at 490 nm 560 nm and 665 nm and the near infrared band nir band 8 at 842 nm at 10 m spatial resolution as well as the shortwave infrared band band 12 at 2190 nm at 20 m spatial resolution sentinel 2 msi surface reflectance level 2 a products are made available over the study area by the theia land data center www theia land fr they are corrected for atmospheric effects using the maccs atcor joint algorithm maja processing chain hagolle et al 2015 the processing chain hagolle et al 2017 analyses temporal series of level 1 c images and ancillary data to detect clouds and clouds shadows to estimate the atmospheric optical thickness including aerosols the adjacency effects including atmospheric scattering and multiple reflections between the surface and the atmosphere and to apply a terrain correction based on topography the atmospheric corrections are performed for pixels classified as land and extrapolated for pixels classified as water the maja processing chain has been developed for land surface reflectance it benefits from previous algorithm evaluations and is widely used other atmospheric corrections schemes exist some targeting aquatic surface specifically kuhn et al 2019 pahlevan et al 2021 spm is only retrieved for clear sky pixels classified as open water sentinel 2 msi pixels not already masked by the maja chain as clouds aerosols or cloud shadows are classified as water pixels if the modified normalized difference water index mndwi which is calculated as the difference between the green band and the swir band divided by their sum is lower than 0 2 robert et al 2017 an additional threshold on the green band reflectance is added to avoid unmasked residuals clouds values lower than 0 4 are retained in order to avoid possible land adjacency effects the sentinel 2 msi data employed at the goudel sampling station and at the ansongo site were averaged over a square box three pixels away from the shores measurements of spm concentration made at a day difference day before and day after with the satellite acquisition were considered in order to increase the number of match ups 10 dates 3 results 3 1 spm nature and granulometric sizes over the study period spm concentration ranges from 0 01 g l 1 to 1 9 g l 1 the lowest concentrations occur at the beginning of the dry season mean 0 0416 g l 1 and standard deviation 0 0324 g l 1 calculated over the 1st october 28th february 2019 period the spm concentration slightly increases over the march may period and then more rapidly at the onset of the red flood from june onwards to reach its maximum around 2 g l 1 in july the term suspended particulate matter is used here for particles suspended in a water column from the nano scale to sand sized sediments bilotta et al 2012 niger river spm s size distributions curves reveal two well pronounced modes during the red flood fig 4 the two modes are centred around 0 172 0 296 and 3 9 µm ranging from medium sands to ultrafine clay particles during the black flood the same modes were found with less fine particles now centred around 0 26 µm and the larger one around 5 12 6 72 µm these fine particles are often associated in aggregates fig 5 and are predominantly composed of kaolinite and iron oxyhydroxides with minor occurrences of quartz illite muscovite and ilmenite trace amounts of organic matter were also observed in the red flood samples 3 2 monitoring spm with in situ and satellite radiometry within a day the temporal evolution of the skye radiometer reflectance is relatively constant in the morning but presents important peaks in the afternoon more or less pronounced according to the period of the year due to sunglint effect i e specular reflection of direct sun radiation observed on the red and nir bands this is consistent with the skye acquisition geometry and the sensor looking toward the south west fig 3 sunglint effects are also observed on the band ratio nir red fig 6 for each day reflectance data were therefore averaged over the 9 11 a m period only which corresponds to the time range with constant data and sun target sensor geometry less prone to glint effect glint angle larger than 50 at 10 h relative azimuth in the 80 160 interval in addition the match up interval between morning radiometer data and spm collection times is of the order of 2 h considering 9 11 h averages does not eliminate skyglint skye radiometer daily reflectance is then compared to sentinel 2 msi reflectance satellite and in situ data are well correlated in both the red and the nir band fig 7 the coefficient of determination r2 is 0 93 and 0 92 for the red and the nir respectively the rmsd root mean square difference 0 02 and 0 03 and mape mean absolute percentage error 9 3 and 63 8 reflectance measured by both the skye and the sentinel 2 msi sensors in the red and nir bands showed a strong seasonality with extremely high values fig 8 reaching 0 35 0 40 during the rainy season june september that are rarely encountered in large rivers the yearly maxima for the three years of the study period were similar msi value are generally higher than skye values during the dry season at the end of march beginning of april particularly on the nir band as is also apparent by the scatter in low nir values shown in fig 7 this is likely due to the impact of high aerosol content which is quite important at this period due to harmattan wind coming from the sahara desert and is probably not completely corrected by the maja scheme spm concentrations measured in situ are strongly correlated with reflectance or reflectance ratio the best fit is obtained using power relationships between

l 1 and bias equal to 0 007 g l 1 for the radiometer the r2 quantifying the goodness of the fit between spm measured and retrieved are equal to 0 84 for sentinel 2 msi and 0 90 for the in situ radiometer fig 9c 3 3 spm dynamics and niger river discharge the evolution of spm concentration is in phase advance in comparison to the river discharge dynamic fig 10 at the beginning of the red flood period june to september the spm concentration begins to increase and reaches its maximum at least one month before water level rises fig 10 which is typically an effect of the first flush bertrand krajewski et al 1998 the highest spm concentrations of 0 5 2 g l 1 are measured during low less than 500 m3 s 1 to medium 500 1000 m3 s 1 river discharge then while water discharge increases the spm concentration starts decreasing and continues to decrease during the peak of the red flood and afterwards fig 11 when the black flood reached niamey the spm concentration has already undergone a 10 time decrease this period is characterized by discharges that can approach 2000 m3 s 1 and low spm concentration of about 0 1 g l 1 i e 5 to more than 20 times lower than those measured during the red flood conditions fig 11 when the black flood decreases the spm concentration is still low but shows some variations between february and april the low water period displays the lowest discharge and spm values around 0 01 g l 1 spm interannual variability appears to be quite different at the beginning of the red flood with much lower spm values in 2019 than in 2018 and 2020 during the month of june fig 12 interestingly spm values of those three years become more similar at the core of the red flood although a huge difference is observed in discharge the highest discharge peak ever observed since the installation of the hydrographic station in the niger river at niamey occurred at the beginning of september 2020 3398 m3 s 1 despite this impressive discharge the spm concentration did not further increase and its value at this period in 2020 is similar with those observed in 2018 and slightly lower than the spm values in 2019 3 4 spm spatial distribution and middle niger basin contribution the main tributaries of the niger river contributing to the red flood are located downstream of ansongo and the hydrographs at this location do not show the red flood discharge peak cassé et al 2016 spm concentrations retrieved from sentinel 2 msi are similar at ansongo and niamey during the black flood period from october to may during the rainy season june september periods spm peaks are observed at both locations although with very different absolute values while at niamey the maximum concentration is about 1 5 g l 1 at ansongo it reaches only 0 15 g l 1 fig 13 this clearly shows the role of the tributaries of the middle niger in the spm routing to niamey during the red flood the average spm difference between niamey and ansongo is equal to 0 185 g l 1 over this three year period 10 times higher than the mean spm value at ansongo for the same period the significant spm contribution at the very beginning of the rainy season from the sirba river see the example in fig 14a for the 17th of june 2020 further highlights this phenomenon the sirba river a main tributary of the middle niger river contributes to 80 of the water supply recorded at the hydrological station of niamey amani and nguetora 2002 massazza et al 2019 in contrast no major differences are found between the sirba and the niger river spm concentration during the black flood fig 14b 4 discussion the aim of this study was to estimate the spm spatio temporal variability in mnrb combining available information by in situ measurements and satellite data simple relationships were therefore used to retrieve spm ad hoc for the study site from the skye and msi reflectances based on commonly employed power functions as in robert et al 2017 reflectance measurements by in situ and satellite measurements proved efficient to monitor the spm dynamics in the middle niger basin the retrieval performances obtained by both skye and sentinel 2 msi are very good and generally better than those obtained by other optical remote sensing sensors such as modis and landsat in the same region kaba et al 2014 robert et al 2016 robert et al 2017 however employing a multi band approach according to the spm range as suggested by novoa et al 2017 and han et al 2016 may provide a good option to improve spm retrievals and derive a robust relationship widely applicable over different water bodies sunglint was found to significantly affect the in situ radiometric measurements and reflectance as well as the band ratio as a result only a portion of the measurements acquired within a day can be used to investigate spm dynamics at a sub daily scale this could be overcome by using several radiometers pointing at different directions or by applying sunglint correction based on the swir reflectance harmel et al 2018 skyglint was not corrected for and causes fluctuations in the nir and red reflectance especially for overcast mornings the reflectance ratio is less affected by this effect this may be the reason why the ratio is more efficient for spm retrieval for all sky radiometer data as opposed to the nir reflectance for sentinel 2 msi for which clear sky conditions are selected although it is not obvious on our data heavy dust loadings may also impact the skye radiometer nir and red reflectances but probably less so the reflectance ratio overall the reflectance ratio data display relatively small variability during the morning period suggesting that varying cloudiness or wind conditions are not major issues here and that rapid variability of spm sub daily is not common the high values of the red and nir reflectance in this river may attenuate sunglint and skyglint effects above surface routine monitoring of water colour is mostly applied to ocean or coastal water where these issues are more severe mobley 1999 zibordi et al 2009 the results shown in this study suggest that this kind of measurements could be used for tropical turbid rivers either alone or in combination with high resolution satellite data sentinel 2 msi reflectance acquired for the niamey station did not seem to be affected by sunglint problems the niamey station is located on the western edge of the sentinel 2 swath and given that the satellite overpasses at about 10h30 in the morning specular reflection from the sun is unlikely at this site this is not the case for the ansongo site that is at the eastern edge of the sentinel 2 swath and which may therefore be subject to sunglint effects they would result in an overestimation of retrieved spm at this site which would further increase the difference observed between niamey and ansongo and would not change our findings significantly overall the atmospheric correction scheme applied by the maja chain has proved accurate enough to monitor spm variability however some issues remain these concern particularly the impact of aerosols mineral dust on sentinel 2 msi reflectance as indicated by the higher reflectance observed for sentinel 2 msi in both the nir and the red band compared to skye reflectances in the march april period fig 8 the spm characteristics and their small size combined with their high concentration resulted in the very high values of reflectance observed in this area in both the visible and the nir bands the nature of spm in the middle niger at the latitude of niamey is dominated by kaolinite iron oxyhydroxides and quartz this composition is consistent with the nature of the sandy and sandy silty sahelian soils stroosnijder 1982 and the outcropping rocks dominated by ferruginous sandstones of the terminal continental yaou et al 2019 the iron oxyhydroxides would then come from the erosion of these surfaces the kaolinite originates from the soils of the middle basin which are recognized as not very reactive because of that kaolinitic nature mahamane et al 2020 spm concentration showed an important intra annual variability the maximum concentration 2 g l 1 was recorded at the beginning of the rainy season june july it was much higher than in the upper basins 0 6 g l 1 at banankoro picouet et al 2009 and lower than that observed on the gorouol tributary at alcongui 3 751 g l 1 in 2007 08 amogu 2009 the high spm concentration in the middle part of the niger river is likely related to the low vegetation cover at the beginning of the rainy season leading to strong soil erosion indeed the soils have experienced significant crusting and increased erosion resulting in tons of sediment drained into the river mamadou 2012 previous measurements of spm concentration in the middle niger although discontinuous have shown quantities of the same order about 0 182 g l 1 to 1 5787 g l 1 alhou et al 2016 in the major rivers of west africa the senegal faye et al 2020 and the black volta in tanguasie bowan and tingan 2020 the concentrations of spm measured were respectively 1 4 and 2 15 times lower than those of the middle niger river spm concentration decrease observed during the rising water should rather be related to the conjugation of vegetation development on the water basin and the net decrease of the free elements in surfaces already washed out by the first rains a similar decrease in spm concentration occurring at the same period was observed in the bangou kirey lake located east of the niamey and ascribed to water dilution due to the rise in the water table abdourhamane touré et al 2016 at the end of the black flood close to the low water season the spm concentration displays a slight increase in the absence of any input of water flow by runoff this increase may be ascribed to the decrease in water volume leading to a local production of particles by the phenomenon of bank erosion alternatively the march april period is characterized by an increase in the speed of the trade winds harmattan that could stir the water and resuspend particles abdourhamane touré et al 2018 a similar increase in the middle of the dry season has been observed for sahelian lakes in northern mali robert et al 2017 with wind driven turbulence possibly inducing a recirculation of bottom and bank sediments the spm discharge hysteresis of the niger river at niamey are quite different from most hydrological systems during the red flood the spm discharge curve follow the classic scenario observed in the tropics with the maximum of spm occurring before the discharge peak this is the case for example at the congo river outlet n kaya et al 2020 for the mississippi snedden et al 2007 or orinoco gallay et al 2019 however a major difference lies in the fact that the discharge curve of the niger river at niamey presents a second peak absent in these other systems this peak is characterized by low spm values which produce a distinctive feature for the middle niger river in terms of inter annual variability it is striking that the 2020 red flood which was severe in niamey did not notably increase the river s spm concentration 5 conclusion this study has documented the spm spatio temporal variability in the middle niger river radiometric measurements collected in situ or by satellite proved useful to monitor spm which in this area is characterized by very fine kaolinite and iron oxyhydroxide particles that at high concentrations resulted in extremely high values of reflectance good relationships were established between the radiometric measurements nir red for skye in situ radiometer and nir b8 for sentinel 2 msi and spm concentration this allowed to retrieve spm concentration at niamey at a daily time step skye measurements and to analyse their spatial variability within the middle niger river sentinel 2 msi the red flood was characterised by very high spm values with the spm maximum reached at least one month before the maximum of the discharge while low spm values were recorded during the black flood we have highlighted the important spm contribution from the main tributary of the middle niger river during the red flood which explains the difference in spm between niamey and ansongo located upstream finally the interannual variability of spm during the red flood was not found to play a major role on spm concentration in particular spm values after july in 2020 were similar to those in the previous two years despite that record discharge values measured in 2020 however future changes in spm concentration under climate and anthropic changes as for example the intensification of the hydrological cycle or the dam construction planned at the upstream on niamey and their impacts on spm concentration in niamey cannot be excluded and strongly underline the need to maintain monitoring of spm in this area author statement conceptualization m b m m gr a a t l k and e r

7996,study region a plain region covering 8000 km2 in extreme north eastern romania in which two groundwater levels are identified near the surface 1 5 m and in depth 4 5 m respectively study focus the statistical relationship between climate conditions and underground water resources was assessed by means of correlation analysis and autoregressive neural networks anns based on this the study explores the quantitative changes in groundwater levels towards the end of this century according to most relevant climate scenarios regarding the evolution of air temperature and precipitation amount new hydrological insights for the region the results of the anns model show that air temperature together with precipitation amount explain between 50 and 70 of the groundwater levels variability for 1983 2017 interval for local conditions instead analysed at the level of main regional weather stations the explained variability by the climate conditions decreases between 40 and 60 this overall good statistical performance enables us to assimilate into the model the climate scenarios data for the region the groundwater projections indicate that the decline in groundwater levels is expected to be general in both climate scenarios analysed thus the impact of climate change on groundwater supply is expected to be very high over the study region adding to the onset effect of diminishing water quality raising a great risk on water availability for natural and socio economic environment graphical abstract using k mean clustering a the 47 hydrological observation points from northeastern romania b have been grouped in 4 clusters from which two are representative for the aquifer c and piezometric d level assimilating climate scenario information regarding air temperature and precipitation amount as input data in an artificial neural network model narx the projections until 2100 indicate a generalized decrease of groundwater level over the studied region both for aquifer e and piezometric f levels ga1 keywords groundwater levels climate scenarios narx northeastern romania 1 introduction nowadays the depletion of aquifers as a result of increased economic demand and the imprint of climate change manifested in many of the world regions through aridization receives growing scientific interest famiglietti 2014 huang et al 2016 massoud et al 2021 even if this topic seems to be largely investigated mainly in arid and semi arid tropical regions of the world jain et al 2021 ashraf et al 2021 the temperate regions also experience this this became an acute environmental problem in the light of future climate scenarios al atawneh et al 2021 some studies claim a possible increase in groundwater resources for some parts in europe especially the northern parts reinecke et al 2021 mainly as an effect of more precipitation amount expected in a warmer climate klammler et al 2013 despite this most studies cases indicate a general negative impact of climate change on groundwater resources such as for eastern france haidu and nistor 2020 united states meixner et al 2016 or southern and southeastern europe nistor 2019 reinecke et al 2021 this increasing problem will overlap with the pressure exerted by global population growth and the growing demand for water resources for food social and economic activities changming et al 2001 the high magnitude of projected climate change ipcc 2021 raises major concerns regarding a future with less groundwater resources this impacts drastically on people s accessibility to water eekhout et al 2018 hu et al 2019 putting at risk the agriculture in those regions and demanding intensive irrigation water supplies of small and large human communities foster and custodio 2019 especially those in need of socio economic development are also at risk mustafa et al 2017 even if groundwater is controlled by a variety of factors and in many dense populated areas the groundwater levels are driven by intense human use mustafa et al 2017 climate conditions are expected to represent one of the major drivers of groundwater resource transformation in the future smerdon 2017 in this regard during the last decade a significant increase in air temperature was observed for the territory of romanian bîrsan et al 2019 to add to this even if drought is a common phenomenon for this area minea et al 2021 dobri et al 2021 the trend in precipitation amount is not similarly clear croitoru et al 2016 so as a combined effect of increased air temperature and unsteady trend in precipitation amount the climate water balance tends to indicate an increasing water deficit prăvălie et al 2019 moreover for the next decades climate change is expected to bring major increase in the air temperature in romania while the projected changes for the precipitation amount the projected changes are more complex croitoru et al 2018 in brief the northeastern part of romania is placed at the northern limit of the north hemisphere domain that is expected to record a slight increase in precipitation amount but an overall decrease in soil moisture and runoff according to both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 collins et al 2013 ipcc 2021 as a result of the significant increase in air temperature actually the higher the air temperature the higher the precipitation amount is but the water resource will be exposed to more evapotranspiration leading to diminishing water resources at surface and inside the ground at the european level the pressure on the groundwater resources is not as significant as for arid and semi arid areas of the world according to the european environmental agency 2021 approximately 18 of the european population is subject to water stress with the most affected areas in the mediterranean basin the northeastern part of romania can be included in this category this is a region where groundwater bodies are the main water reservoirs to supply local communities only 25 of the region rural population being connected to the main water supply system minea 2020 while the rest is being fed from local underground resources through individual wells the natural conditions of recharge of surface aquifers in this region have changed in recent decades this is due to the changes in land use in the last century stângă et al 2016 along with regional climate change minea and croitoru 2017 and obvious trends in increasing the depth of the piezometric level in recent decades minea et al 2020a amid the occurrence of frequent periods of hydrogeological drought minea et al 2020b this has increased the degree of vulnerability of human communities to this resource boicu et al 2019 due to the already onset trends in climate and hydrological conditions the interest on how much the groundwater level will be affected by climate change is increasing previously some studies indicated in a relative approach that the groundwater resources in the study region will be very affected by the climate change nistor 2019 in this context the current study represents according to our knowledge the first quantitative study in romania aiming to analyse the absolute changes in groundwater levels as induced by future climate scenarios contributing to filling the knowledge gap in this regard for the eastern part of the continent 2 study region the northeastern part of romania overlaps geographically with a plateau area moldavian plateau and extends over 8000 km2 with heights varying between 30 and 250 m fig 1 the landforms developed on a geological matrix formed by sarmatian sedimentary deposits have a medium fragmentation and slopes that do not generally exceed 5 10 the hydrographic network tributary to the main collecting river prut the river located on the border between romania and the republic of moldova has a weak runoff due to the climatic specificity but also due to a narrow catchment area of prut river over the carpathian mountains the multiannual mean air temperature over the region ranges from 8 c in the north to 9 c in the south and multiannual precipitation amount values are varying annually between 520 mm in the southeastern area up to 600 mm in the western and hillier side of the region sandu et al 2008 according to köppen geiger s classification these overall climate conditions correspond to cfb climate conditions cheval et al 2022 for the recent period evolving from previous dfb climate conditions in the past these climatic conditions determine a subxeric environment for the vegetation botti 2018 a relatively narrow transition zone between axeric conditions of the central and europe forest area and xeric conditions characterising the southeastern part of the continent steppe area according to climate scenarios the climate conditions are envisaged to shift towards semi arid conditions corresponding to bsk climate type in the same köppen geiger classification beck et al 2018 3 data and methodology 3 1 groundwater level data according to the european framework 2000 60 ec 3 groundwater bodies can be indentified in northeastern part of romania bretotean et al 2006 corresponding to the upper major prut riverbed with its tributaries ropr01 the middle major prut riverbed with its tributaries ropr02 and the moldavian plain ropr07 the development of these groundwater bodies is conditioned by the presence of sarmatian deposits at depth between 10 and 25 m these are formed by a succession of marly and compact clays layers above which sandy layers of the same geological age or quaternary loessoid and alluvial deposits are arranged this type of lithology determines the appearance of the aquifer level at depths between 1 and 15 m they are closer to the ground surface in the alluvial deposits along the hydrographic network and deeper in the terrace deposits with important quantitative and qualitative variations depending on the water supply from the surface from precipitation or from the hydrographic network for the analysis of the groundwater conditions the used database in this study comprises of 47 hydrogeological stations with one or multiple hydrogeological wells included having a relatively homogenous geographical distribution the criteria used for selecting hydrogeological wells included the lack of anthropic influence no underground water seeping the measurements covering a long period of time and also the presence of unconfined or semi confined phreatic level variations well highlighted in the groundwater levels data the analysis time frame spans from 1983 to 2017 and has a monthly time resolution the entire hydrogeological database used in this study comes from the prut bârlad basin branch of the romanian national water administration minea et al 2021 3 2 climate data the selected climate parameters included the air temperature characteristics mean maximum and minimum the climate parameters indicating water availability at ground surface relative humidity water vapour deficit precipitation amount and also wind speed given its role in evaporation evaporation was calculated based on penman equation climate water balance was computed as the difference between precipitation amount and potential evapotranspiration prăvălie et al 2019 it gives a measure of the potential recharge of groundwater condon et al 2020 basically 4 weather stations data were used iași cotnari botoșani darabani with similarly monthly time resolution as for groundwater level data however for some analyses taking to account the relatively small variability of the climate elements over the studied region the values of climatic parameters for the entire region in a single data series have been averaged this database was concatenated from official weather stations observation and era 5 land data muñoz sabater 2019 3 3 climate scenario data nowadays it is widely accepted that precipitation amount and air temperature represent the main climatic drivers of groundwater level green et al 2011 mohan et al 2018 therefore in this study 10 bias corrected regional climate models rcms of daily air temperature and precipitation amount over romania s territory were used the 10 bias corrected rcms used in the study are showed in supplementary table 1 those adjusted rcms are freely available via an open access repository in netcdf cf 1 4 compliant file format being known as roclib database dumitrescu and amihaesei 2021 the database resides on daily climate projections by using two representative concentration pathways rcps a medium one rcp45 and extreme one rcp85 over the 21st century at 0 11 spatial resolution about 12 5 km 12 5 km derived from the euro cordex initiative kotlarski et al 2017 mezghani et al 2017 the data was averaged at monthly level same as we did for the other parameters in this study 3 4 methodology using the above described datasets a methodological flow was conceived fig 2 aiming on the one hand to assess the statistical relationship between climate elements and groundwater level and on the other hand to extrapolate this observed relationship towards the end of the century by using climate scenarios data 3 4 1 clustering of groundwater levels and correlation analysis to identify some homogeneous groundwater levels points within the moldavian plain domain the k means clustering was applied by using the factor scores as new inputs the finding of the common spatial behaviour variability of the data was conducted by an empirical orthogonal function firstly the factor analysis fa was used to erase the redundant information by transforming a large number of variables to a smaller set of data factors richard and wichern 2013 the fa was applied to the monthly groundwater data from 1983 to 2017 the series was scaled to zero mean and unit variance before applying the fa the matrix loadings correlation in which each variable received an individual loadings score was calculated in order to obtain the new variables used in cluster analysis the factor scores were calculated following the regression combination of raw variables with value loadings furthermore the factor scores obtained in the fa method have been used as inputs the k means clustering was applied directly on scaled raw for comparison to identify the most appropriate number of clusters we used the average silhouette coefficient and visual interpretation the silhouette method is a measure of how well an observation fits into its own cluster vs the others rousseeuw 1987 and it is implemented in r software via the facto extra package through this method 4 clusters were identified in our analysis the function k means from rstat package was used for the cluster algorithm r core team and contributors worldwide 2019 also the points on each cluster were assigned to one of the 4 weather station data used over the region through thiessen polygons fig s1 consequently in the current study the results are presented as mean for the entire region but also for 4 sub regions resulted from thiessen polygons assignment the mean monthly values for all the points in each of 4 clusters were correlated with meteorological parameters through pearson correlation coefficient using a 0 05 level of significance 3 4 2 denoising datasets for autoregressive model input a denoising method was applied on the input data so as to avoid the influence of noise on prediction by this denoising procedure we aimed to eliminate the sources of high frequency variability from the data series this type of variability could be induced for instance by how the observations on ground water level are made or by the action of sudden weather events i e local rainshowers since our study is conducted on a long period of time and our goal is to capture the general image of the groundwater level variations in relation to climate inputs we consider that this high frequency variability should be excluded also denoising data by means of wavelet transform wt has been proven to be one of the most effective techniques to obtain more efficient results when employing ann models adamowski et al 2009 adamowski and chan 2011 campisi pinto et al 2012 the main factors that determine the efficiency of the wavelet denoising method are the wavelet function and the decomposition level yu and lin 2015 several studies he et al 2014 2021 moosavi et al 2013 have shown that daubechies 4 db4 wavelet function offers good performance when applied on groundwater level data therefore in this study the db4 wavelet function and one decomposition level were applied in denoising the original data 3 4 3 autoregressive models artificial neural networks anns have been widely used during the last two decades for understanding the non linear relationship between various environmental variables this type of black box model emulates the human brain s behaviour and can discover relationships between variables by applying certain training algorithms on available data fig 3 anns are especially valuable for investigating complex scenarios when a liniar understanding of the relevant processes is limited often showing comparable performance to that of numerical models sahoo et al 2017 because of their capacity to capture system dynamics and nonlinearities anns are ideal for studying hydrological systems with significant spatiotemporal variabilities wunsch et al 2018 nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous inputs narx allow a bidirectional flow of information unlike the feedforward neural networks asce task committee on application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000 this makes narx networks particularly suitable for time series forecasting lowering the number of input parameters necessary to improve the model s performance guzman et al 2017 while more complex deep learning dl methods such as long short term memory lstm or convolutional neural networks cnns have also been applied in the study of water resource variables jeong et al 2020 a comparative study wunsch et al 2021 has shown that shallow narx networks seem to perform better than dl models especially when few training data is available the basic architecture of the narx model used in this study is presented in fig 3 the number of hidden nodes neurons was chosen heuristically based on cross validation results in the first phase 70 of the datased was used for training and other 15 of the dataset for validation based on the validation results the best model was selected in this selection phase the maximum number of training epochs was 30 for each model to prevent over fitting of the model the training process was stopped if the errors for the validation dataset increased for a number of 6 epochs in the end the rest of 15 of the dataset was used for testing the selected model in order to assess the performance of the narx network several evaluation metrics were calculated for both the training and the testing datasets the coefficient of determination r2 was used to assess the best linear fit between observed and predicted values the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse have been calculated to indicate the errors for the predicted values while the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse was used to asses hydrological predictions nash and sutcliffe 1970 generally aiming to avoid over or under estimation of the prediction capabilities of the model the training phase stopped after the algorithm ran approx 12 h for the parameters that gave the best results after that we have selected the model with the lowest rmse value 3 4 4 climate scenarios two regional concentration pathways rcps climate projections were used for a moderate radiative forcing to stabilise at 4 5 w m2 before the year 2100 and business as usual radiative forcing to stabilise at 8 5 w m2 before the year 2100 scenarios commonly these two projections correspond with a moderate rcp4 5 and an extreme rcp8 5 climate change scenario for our analysis a multimodel ensemble mean from the 10 available models table s1 was calculated we can underline here that the current pace in annual increase of co2 emissions estimated between 2 0 and 2 5 parts per million noaa 2021 places the end of the century between these two scenarios the narx model trained and tested on the observation period as described in section 3 4 3 was used after that to produce projections of the groundwater levels by assimilating data regarding monthly air temperature and precipitation amount from the climate scenarios 4 results and discussions 4 1 clustering results from the 4 clusters obtained through k means clustering fig 4a two 1st and 3rd gather a small number of points 9 of 47 being represented by scattered and isolated points over the region fig 4b most of the hydrogeological wells included in these clusters were drilled in clay sand deposits belonging to the upper sarmatian located at the level of the middle terraces of the hydrographic network ionesi et al 2005 it is these features in particular which make their composite series of these two clusters to have a high month to month variability induced by the fact that the wells are influenced mainly by local lithological factors and not by major climate drivers due to this further on our analysis is restrained on the other two clusters that sum up together 81 from the total of observation points the 2nd cluster gathers 25 observation points and represents the surface aquifers over the region the descriptive parameters of these clusters are represented by a mean depth of 160 5 cm with a maximum mean depth of 284 7 cm and a minimum mean depth of 34 1 cm and a standard deviation of 75 8 cm the hydrogeological wells included in this cluster were drilled mainly in alluvial deposits composed mainly of sands and gravels located along river network no trend is observed for this cluster for the entire analysed period 1983 2017 but a decreasing trend of groundwater level is observed after the year 2000 fig 4c a buishand s test for homogeneity indicates on this time series a break point in 2011 the data presenting a mean depth of 188 2 cm after this year 2011 2017 while for the previous period 1983 2011 the mean depth was 143 6 cm this shift may already represent a sign of the ongoing climate change impact on surface aquifers over the region minea et al 2020a the 4th cluster instead gathering 13 observation points indicates clearly the piezometric level the descriptive parameters of this cluster are represented by a mean depth of 448 6 cm with a maximum mean depth of 616 6 cm a minimum mean depth of 335 8 cm and a standard deviation of 96 7 cm fig 4d the points within this cluster are distributed mostly over the upper terraces deposits of the two main rivers of the region jijia and bahlui the buishand s test for homogeneity also indicates even more clearly than for the cluster 2 that a change point occurs in 2011 for the piezometric level with a mean depth of 484 5 cm for 2011 2017 and 432 1 cm before 2011 the points within this cluster are distributed mostly over the terrace deposits of the two main rivers of the region jijia and bahlui in this case the declining groundwater level manifested for the entire analysed period indicates that the piezometric level is more sensitive to changes in climate conditions and therefore will be more impacted on by future climate conditions 4 2 correlation analysis between climate variables and groundwater levels the best performance of the correlation analysis was obtained for 1 month lag between meteorological parameters and groundwater level and therefore only these results are shown table 1 this better lagged correlation is clearly explained especially by the slow speed of infiltration of the precipitation water in the lithological deposits of ground water levels in the region in which clays with low infiltration coefficients prevails minea et al 2022 also during winter it is quite normal to have 2 3 snow accumulation melting episodes so that the accumulation of snow occurs in one month while the infiltration is produced during the melting period that occurs mostly in the aftermonth the results indicate that for the cluster 3 and especially for cluster 1 the correlations are weak most probably this is another effect of their particular hydrogeological conditions discussed previously inducing an inertial response of these observation points to the meteorological triggers instead the most important clusters for our analysis 2 and 4 are the most sensitive to climate variability we can therefore observe that the most important climate parameters for the monthly groundwater levels variability are represented by mean and maximum air temperature water vapour deficit relative humidity precipitation amount evaporation and consequently water balance table 1 the depth of groundwater level is directly correlated with mean and maximum air temperature but less with minimum air temperature this is explained by the fact that the evapotranspiration a very important driver of regional aridity is better correlated especially with the higher air temperature during the day and less with the minimum air temperature commonly recorded during the morning hours accordingly the evapotranspiration which is positively correlated also with the groundwater levels is driven both by the maximum air temperature and by the water vapour deficit recognised as the most important driver of groundwater level change in a warm climate condon et al 2020 the relative humidity and the precipitation amount instead are negatively correlated to the groundwater levels confirming that precipitation amount exhibit the most important influence on month to month groundwater variability changes thomas and famiglietti 2019 moreover the highest correlation coefficient among the meteorological parameters with groundwater levels is specific to climate water balance this parameter integers information both for precipitation and evapotranspiration and give a better image on the water resource available in the climate system prăvălie et al 2019 overall the higher lower the air temperature the water vapour and the evaporation then the lower higher the groundwater level is at the same time higher lower relative air humidity precipitation amount and water balance are related to higher lower ground water level it is worth mentioning that the intensity of the correlation is generally similar for surface aquifers cluster 2 and for piezometric level cluster 4 proving that the climate parameters play a similarly important role for the entire groundwater resource these results also confirm that groundwater level could by far be estimated with very good accuracy by using air temperature and precipitation amounts as predictors al atawneh et al 2021 4 3 assessment of the relationship between groundwater levels and climate variables using narx model the results obtained in the training phase of the narx model development 1983 2007 show a remarkable level of statistical significance table 2 overall the best results are specific for the regional mean of two main clusters analysed the highest statistical performance was obtained for the aquifer level corresponding to cluster 2 whose variability is largely explained by air temperature and precipitation amount r2 0 87 nse 0 85 consequently the associated errors are rather small and reflect a good prediction skill of the model mae 11 5 rmse 14 4 for cluster 4 the performance of the model is weaker r2 0 73 nse 0 54 but remains sufficiently high in order to be used as prediction tool the smaller statistical performance in this case could be explained by the more complex lithology of these observation points on the one hand and by the smaller sample size of this cluster on the other the higher depth of this cluster impedes or slows down the response of piezometric level to climate inputs consequently the errors of the model for this cluster increase significantly mae 18 98 rmse 23 86 generally the statistical performance of the model remains higher for cluster 2 than for cluster 4 and also for the observation points assigned through thiessen polygons to each weather station the lower performance on cluster 4 for cotnari is mostly explained by the position of this weather station at higher altitude while the piezometric level is located on lower altitude generally the smaller the sample size of observation points the smaller the statistical performance of the model is indicating that in these conditions the series are not very smooth and the influence of local hydrological conditions remains prevalent on the groundwater levels variability our results also indicate a limited relevance of the meteorological weather stations data for the observation points assigned through thiessen polygons and this could be explained primarly by the diveristy of local climate conditions these results obtained in the training phase have been used in the second phase to test the model s capabilities to predict the evolution of the groundwater level as they are induced by the air temperature and precipitation amount fig 5 as a general feature the prediction fits well with the observation data series both in capturing the overall variability and the peak values occurrence the fitting is better for cluster 2 in correspondence with the better statistical performance of the narx model discussed previously considering these results we assume that the narx model could be used with confidence to predict the groundwater changes based on the results of climate scenarios simulations 4 4 climate scenarios projections the results of climate projections are in line with other assessments available for the study region collins et al 2013 ipcc 2021 but they bring a clear idea on the quantitative assessment of the projected climate change this way our results indicate a clear increase for air temperature towards the end of the century over the study region for the moderate scenario rcp4 5 the increase in mean air temperature for 2100 is limited at 2 5 c above the 1980 2010 mean while for the extreme scenario rcp8 5 an increase exceeding 4 0 c is expected fig 6a b these results are in line with the estimations of other european studies carvalho et al 2021 but also with the few studies on this topic for the territory of romania croitoru et al 2018 also the difference between the two scenarios is small until 2060 around 2 5 c but it is increasing especially towards the end of the century the spatial distribution of the air temperature increase is quite homogenous over the study region only with lower values for the hilly regions in the northwestern part the major shift in the air temperature increase is expected for 2070 2100 for which the increase will reach 4 0 c in case of rcp8 5 scenarios it is also worth noticing that the increase for 2041 2070 in rcp8 5 is higher than the increase for 2070 2100 in rcp4 5 fig 7a f regarding the changes in the annual precipitation amount they are rather small and go towards a slight increase of the annual amount towards the end of the century fig 6c d however the difference between the two scenarios is small but comparatively with the current climate conditions an increase in the multiannual variability is also expected with more years recording annomalies ranged between 50 and 100 from the annual mean despite the small extent of the study region this increase in precipitation amount is higher in the north with approx 20 than in the south in the rcp8 5 scenarios fig 7g l for the end of the analysed interval 2070 2100 in fact most of climate scenarios split the european continent regarding the change in the amount of precipitation between the southern part with more drought and the northern part with more precipitation coppola et al 2021 the study region being placed somewhere between these two major regions once more the major changes are expected after 2070 and especially for the most extreme emission scenario rcp8 5 and it is obvious that they should be regarded with caution however according to some studies hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020 myhre et al 2019 the changes in precipitation amount can lead to higher variability with more alternating high amounts of precipitation followed by intense periods of droughts at sub annual time scale and with associated changes in water infiltration which is also able to affect the groundwater supply 4 5 groundwater levels estimation for 2020 2100 using climate scenarios data the narx model trained and tested on the historical data for the observation period 1983 2017 as explained above was used as prediction model for the interval 2020 2100 with input data given by the monthly mean air temperature and precipitation amount derived from climate scenarios the model was run for aquifer cluster 2 and piezometric cluster 4 levels for the entire study region both for moderate rcp4 5 and extreme rcp8 5 climate scenarios fig 8 the model was run also for the mean of groundwater observation points assigned through thiessen polygons to each of the four weather stations on the region figs 9 10 firstly we can outline that both aquifer and piezometric levels are expected to be drastically impacted upon during the current century as effect of the projected climate change the aquifer levels tend to decrease with almost 200 cm compared with the mean of the observation period instead the already felt decrease at piezometric level will progress from 600 cm at the end of the observation period 1983 2017 to 1200 cm in 2100 fig 8 actually the projected change in piezometric level can lead in some cases depending on local hydrogeology to the total depletion of groundwater reservoirs in other cases this process will probably be avoided due to the clay horizons in which water can be easily contained and consequently the effect of the evapotranspiration could be reduced this decrease of piezometric level in particular should raise major concerns from socio economic perspective due to the fact that the aquifer levels of the region already record a decrease of water quality as effect of pollution determined by agriculture paiu and breaban 2016 also another important feature of projected groundwater level changes as reflected by our results is given by the similar decrease expected for both scenarios used moreover for some intervals in the current century higher levels of groundwater are expected for rcp8 5 for piezometric levels this is expected to occur between 2030 and 2080 as a result of the projected increase of precipitation amount over the study region in this extreme climate scenario however towards the end of the century the evapotranspiration increase triggered by higher air temperature will overwhelm the increase in precipitation amount and will lead to increased decline also for the piezometric level these results support the theory of aridization over the study region indicated in other studies beck et al 2018 prăvălie et al 2019 and also the lack of change in groundwater supply in eastern europe reinecke et al 2021 despite the expected increase in precipitation these results underline that the depletion of the groundwater is not an issue to be restricted only to arid or semi arid regions of the world but also can affect sub humid temperate zone as the analysed region this major impact of climate change in the groundwater levels is caused by a synergic effect of multiple factors firstly less snow and higher run off during winter on the background of higher air temperature will impede solid precipitation and will decrease groundwater supply during late winter and spring secondly higher intensity of precipitation during summer expected in the future hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020 is also related with the decrease in infiltration on the ground not last in a sub humid region groundwater is available for evapotranspiration near the surface condon et al 2020 leading to pronounced decrease in groundwater level the results for each weather station translates pronouncedly the local climate conditions but also the local hydrological environment in this way one can notice that no clear changes could be outlined in both scenarios for aquifer levels except for the clear decrease indicated by extreme case scenario for 2071 2020 instead for the southern part of the region iași and cotnari the decline in groundwater resources is perceivable even for moderate scenario rcp4 5 beginning with 2021 2050 the north south difference is explained especially by the climate asymmetry between these regions with more precipitation more aridity in the north south the existing differences in hydrogeological conditions should also be taken into account in the north part of the region the geological deposits are sandier with slightly higher permeability in the southern part they are more clayey with lower permeability this influences the appearance of aquifers and also limits the ability to respond to water input from the surface for the piezometric levels instead the changes are pronounced for both scenarios except for cotnari where no major modifications are foreseen for 2021 2050 for all thiessen polygons the extreme climate scenario diminishes the decrease in groundwater resource with clear differences in this regard in the north of the region it is also to be noticed that for northernmost weather station darabani the moderate rcp4 5 and extreme rcp8 5 climate scenarios 2020 2100 the decline in groundwater is limited to 1100 cm analysing these results we emphasise that our study accuracy firstly rely on the conservation of the observed relation between climate drivers and groundwater levels in the future secondly the reliability of the groundwater level estimations presented here resides on the reliability of the climate scenarios used due to the well known relationship between greenhouse gases concentrations and air temperature it is quite clear that the air temperature will increase as indicated by climate scenarios as for the precipitation amount the future evolution is not similarly clear and therefore it can lead to uncertainties however it is known that uncertainties in precipitation amount and evapotranspiration wartenburger et al 2018 lead to considerable unvertainty in groundwater projections and that changes in groundwater increase with increasing greenhouse emissions reinecke et al 2021 even so taking into consideration these drawbacks in climate projections the major finding of our study consists in the fact that the study region even if it is expected to experience an increase in precipitation amount will face a decrease in groundwater resources due to the more important effect of air temperature on groundwater manifested through evapotranspiration 5 conclusions the current study proves that the decline in groundwater resource is worth being studied outside of the arid regions of the world in the temperate sub humid conditions that are expecting to record a moderate increase in precipitation amount in the future the collapse of groundwater levels after 2070 represents a cumulated effect of climate changes manifested through various processes coupled with human pressure over groundwater resources firstly the almost continuous positive air temperature and prevailing liquid precipitation projected by climate scenarios during winter will increase the run off instead of infiltration and groundwater recharge secondly the higher air temperature will increase evapotranspiration contributing to groundwater depletion the impact of climate change on groundwater is expected to be very high especially since the water is more available to increased potential evapotranspiration demand imposed by higher air temperature in this region however the results for 2070 2100 in particular should be regarded with caution due to the well known uncertainties of climate scenarios obviously the validity of our results is conditioned by the accuracy of climate scenarios we used the lithological conditions manifested locally or changes in land use will also lead to uncertainties but this should be investigated separately from a hydrogeological perspective actually the aim of our paper is to give a general image on the changes expected to groundwater levels in the future according to climate scenarios not to deal with local conditions a fact that remains to be investigated in further studies since only the climate conditions are taken into account further investigations are planned in order to understand the role of other socio economic factors involved in groundwater level long term variability the results obtained are the first phase of analysis of the vulnerability of groundwater resources in relation to various scenarios of climate change and are aimed to represent a starting point in identifying viable solutions for the exploitation of these resources reducing anthropogenic pressure by expanding water supply systems identifying agro technical solutions for more efficient use of groundwater can mitigate long term effects in the evolution

7996,study region a plain region covering 8000 km2 in extreme north eastern romania in which two groundwater levels are identified near the surface 1 5 m and in depth 4 5 m respectively study focus the statistical relationship between climate conditions and underground water resources was assessed by means of correlation analysis and autoregressive neural networks anns based on this the study explores the quantitative changes in groundwater levels towards the end of this century according to most relevant climate scenarios regarding the evolution of air temperature and precipitation amount new hydrological insights for the region the results of the anns model show that air temperature together with precipitation amount explain between 50 and 70 of the groundwater levels variability for 1983 2017 interval for local conditions instead analysed at the level of main regional weather stations the explained variability by the climate conditions decreases between 40 and 60 this overall good statistical performance enables us to assimilate into the model the climate scenarios data for the region the groundwater projections indicate that the decline in groundwater levels is expected to be general in both climate scenarios analysed thus the impact of climate change on groundwater supply is expected to be very high over the study region adding to the onset effect of diminishing water quality raising a great risk on water availability for natural and socio economic environment graphical abstract using k mean clustering a the 47 hydrological observation points from northeastern romania b have been grouped in 4 clusters from which two are representative for the aquifer c and piezometric d level assimilating climate scenario information regarding air temperature and precipitation amount as input data in an artificial neural network model narx the projections until 2100 indicate a generalized decrease of groundwater level over the studied region both for aquifer e and piezometric f levels ga1 keywords groundwater levels climate scenarios narx northeastern romania 1 introduction nowadays the depletion of aquifers as a result of increased economic demand and the imprint of climate change manifested in many of the world regions through aridization receives growing scientific interest famiglietti 2014 huang et al 2016 massoud et al 2021 even if this topic seems to be largely investigated mainly in arid and semi arid tropical regions of the world jain et al 2021 ashraf et al 2021 the temperate regions also experience this this became an acute environmental problem in the light of future climate scenarios al atawneh et al 2021 some studies claim a possible increase in groundwater resources for some parts in europe especially the northern parts reinecke et al 2021 mainly as an effect of more precipitation amount expected in a warmer climate klammler et al 2013 despite this most studies cases indicate a general negative impact of climate change on groundwater resources such as for eastern france haidu and nistor 2020 united states meixner et al 2016 or southern and southeastern europe nistor 2019 reinecke et al 2021 this increasing problem will overlap with the pressure exerted by global population growth and the growing demand for water resources for food social and economic activities changming et al 2001 the high magnitude of projected climate change ipcc 2021 raises major concerns regarding a future with less groundwater resources this impacts drastically on people s accessibility to water eekhout et al 2018 hu et al 2019 putting at risk the agriculture in those regions and demanding intensive irrigation water supplies of small and large human communities foster and custodio 2019 especially those in need of socio economic development are also at risk mustafa et al 2017 even if groundwater is controlled by a variety of factors and in many dense populated areas the groundwater levels are driven by intense human use mustafa et al 2017 climate conditions are expected to represent one of the major drivers of groundwater resource transformation in the future smerdon 2017 in this regard during the last decade a significant increase in air temperature was observed for the territory of romanian bîrsan et al 2019 to add to this even if drought is a common phenomenon for this area minea et al 2021 dobri et al 2021 the trend in precipitation amount is not similarly clear croitoru et al 2016 so as a combined effect of increased air temperature and unsteady trend in precipitation amount the climate water balance tends to indicate an increasing water deficit prăvălie et al 2019 moreover for the next decades climate change is expected to bring major increase in the air temperature in romania while the projected changes for the precipitation amount the projected changes are more complex croitoru et al 2018 in brief the northeastern part of romania is placed at the northern limit of the north hemisphere domain that is expected to record a slight increase in precipitation amount but an overall decrease in soil moisture and runoff according to both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 collins et al 2013 ipcc 2021 as a result of the significant increase in air temperature actually the higher the air temperature the higher the precipitation amount is but the water resource will be exposed to more evapotranspiration leading to diminishing water resources at surface and inside the ground at the european level the pressure on the groundwater resources is not as significant as for arid and semi arid areas of the world according to the european environmental agency 2021 approximately 18 of the european population is subject to water stress with the most affected areas in the mediterranean basin the northeastern part of romania can be included in this category this is a region where groundwater bodies are the main water reservoirs to supply local communities only 25 of the region rural population being connected to the main water supply system minea 2020 while the rest is being fed from local underground resources through individual wells the natural conditions of recharge of surface aquifers in this region have changed in recent decades this is due to the changes in land use in the last century stângă et al 2016 along with regional climate change minea and croitoru 2017 and obvious trends in increasing the depth of the piezometric level in recent decades minea et al 2020a amid the occurrence of frequent periods of hydrogeological drought minea et al 2020b this has increased the degree of vulnerability of human communities to this resource boicu et al 2019 due to the already onset trends in climate and hydrological conditions the interest on how much the groundwater level will be affected by climate change is increasing previously some studies indicated in a relative approach that the groundwater resources in the study region will be very affected by the climate change nistor 2019 in this context the current study represents according to our knowledge the first quantitative study in romania aiming to analyse the absolute changes in groundwater levels as induced by future climate scenarios contributing to filling the knowledge gap in this regard for the eastern part of the continent 2 study region the northeastern part of romania overlaps geographically with a plateau area moldavian plateau and extends over 8000 km2 with heights varying between 30 and 250 m fig 1 the landforms developed on a geological matrix formed by sarmatian sedimentary deposits have a medium fragmentation and slopes that do not generally exceed 5 10 the hydrographic network tributary to the main collecting river prut the river located on the border between romania and the republic of moldova has a weak runoff due to the climatic specificity but also due to a narrow catchment area of prut river over the carpathian mountains the multiannual mean air temperature over the region ranges from 8 c in the north to 9 c in the south and multiannual precipitation amount values are varying annually between 520 mm in the southeastern area up to 600 mm in the western and hillier side of the region sandu et al 2008 according to köppen geiger s classification these overall climate conditions correspond to cfb climate conditions cheval et al 2022 for the recent period evolving from previous dfb climate conditions in the past these climatic conditions determine a subxeric environment for the vegetation botti 2018 a relatively narrow transition zone between axeric conditions of the central and europe forest area and xeric conditions characterising the southeastern part of the continent steppe area according to climate scenarios the climate conditions are envisaged to shift towards semi arid conditions corresponding to bsk climate type in the same köppen geiger classification beck et al 2018 3 data and methodology 3 1 groundwater level data according to the european framework 2000 60 ec 3 groundwater bodies can be indentified in northeastern part of romania bretotean et al 2006 corresponding to the upper major prut riverbed with its tributaries ropr01 the middle major prut riverbed with its tributaries ropr02 and the moldavian plain ropr07 the development of these groundwater bodies is conditioned by the presence of sarmatian deposits at depth between 10 and 25 m these are formed by a succession of marly and compact clays layers above which sandy layers of the same geological age or quaternary loessoid and alluvial deposits are arranged this type of lithology determines the appearance of the aquifer level at depths between 1 and 15 m they are closer to the ground surface in the alluvial deposits along the hydrographic network and deeper in the terrace deposits with important quantitative and qualitative variations depending on the water supply from the surface from precipitation or from the hydrographic network for the analysis of the groundwater conditions the used database in this study comprises of 47 hydrogeological stations with one or multiple hydrogeological wells included having a relatively homogenous geographical distribution the criteria used for selecting hydrogeological wells included the lack of anthropic influence no underground water seeping the measurements covering a long period of time and also the presence of unconfined or semi confined phreatic level variations well highlighted in the groundwater levels data the analysis time frame spans from 1983 to 2017 and has a monthly time resolution the entire hydrogeological database used in this study comes from the prut bârlad basin branch of the romanian national water administration minea et al 2021 3 2 climate data the selected climate parameters included the air temperature characteristics mean maximum and minimum the climate parameters indicating water availability at ground surface relative humidity water vapour deficit precipitation amount and also wind speed given its role in evaporation evaporation was calculated based on penman equation climate water balance was computed as the difference between precipitation amount and potential evapotranspiration prăvălie et al 2019 it gives a measure of the potential recharge of groundwater condon et al 2020 basically 4 weather stations data were used iași cotnari botoșani darabani with similarly monthly time resolution as for groundwater level data however for some analyses taking to account the relatively small variability of the climate elements over the studied region the values of climatic parameters for the entire region in a single data series have been averaged this database was concatenated from official weather stations observation and era 5 land data muñoz sabater 2019 3 3 climate scenario data nowadays it is widely accepted that precipitation amount and air temperature represent the main climatic drivers of groundwater level green et al 2011 mohan et al 2018 therefore in this study 10 bias corrected regional climate models rcms of daily air temperature and precipitation amount over romania s territory were used the 10 bias corrected rcms used in the study are showed in supplementary table 1 those adjusted rcms are freely available via an open access repository in netcdf cf 1 4 compliant file format being known as roclib database dumitrescu and amihaesei 2021 the database resides on daily climate projections by using two representative concentration pathways rcps a medium one rcp45 and extreme one rcp85 over the 21st century at 0 11 spatial resolution about 12 5 km 12 5 km derived from the euro cordex initiative kotlarski et al 2017 mezghani et al 2017 the data was averaged at monthly level same as we did for the other parameters in this study 3 4 methodology using the above described datasets a methodological flow was conceived fig 2 aiming on the one hand to assess the statistical relationship between climate elements and groundwater level and on the other hand to extrapolate this observed relationship towards the end of the century by using climate scenarios data 3 4 1 clustering of groundwater levels and correlation analysis to identify some homogeneous groundwater levels points within the moldavian plain domain the k means clustering was applied by using the factor scores as new inputs the finding of the common spatial behaviour variability of the data was conducted by an empirical orthogonal function firstly the factor analysis fa was used to erase the redundant information by transforming a large number of variables to a smaller set of data factors richard and wichern 2013 the fa was applied to the monthly groundwater data from 1983 to 2017 the series was scaled to zero mean and unit variance before applying the fa the matrix loadings correlation in which each variable received an individual loadings score was calculated in order to obtain the new variables used in cluster analysis the factor scores were calculated following the regression combination of raw variables with value loadings furthermore the factor scores obtained in the fa method have been used as inputs the k means clustering was applied directly on scaled raw for comparison to identify the most appropriate number of clusters we used the average silhouette coefficient and visual interpretation the silhouette method is a measure of how well an observation fits into its own cluster vs the others rousseeuw 1987 and it is implemented in r software via the facto extra package through this method 4 clusters were identified in our analysis the function k means from rstat package was used for the cluster algorithm r core team and contributors worldwide 2019 also the points on each cluster were assigned to one of the 4 weather station data used over the region through thiessen polygons fig s1 consequently in the current study the results are presented as mean for the entire region but also for 4 sub regions resulted from thiessen polygons assignment the mean monthly values for all the points in each of 4 clusters were correlated with meteorological parameters through pearson correlation coefficient using a 0 05 level of significance 3 4 2 denoising datasets for autoregressive model input a denoising method was applied on the input data so as to avoid the influence of noise on prediction by this denoising procedure we aimed to eliminate the sources of high frequency variability from the data series this type of variability could be induced for instance by how the observations on ground water level are made or by the action of sudden weather events i e local rainshowers since our study is conducted on a long period of time and our goal is to capture the general image of the groundwater level variations in relation to climate inputs we consider that this high frequency variability should be excluded also denoising data by means of wavelet transform wt has been proven to be one of the most effective techniques to obtain more efficient results when employing ann models adamowski et al 2009 adamowski and chan 2011 campisi pinto et al 2012 the main factors that determine the efficiency of the wavelet denoising method are the wavelet function and the decomposition level yu and lin 2015 several studies he et al 2014 2021 moosavi et al 2013 have shown that daubechies 4 db4 wavelet function offers good performance when applied on groundwater level data therefore in this study the db4 wavelet function and one decomposition level were applied in denoising the original data 3 4 3 autoregressive models artificial neural networks anns have been widely used during the last two decades for understanding the non linear relationship between various environmental variables this type of black box model emulates the human brain s behaviour and can discover relationships between variables by applying certain training algorithms on available data fig 3 anns are especially valuable for investigating complex scenarios when a liniar understanding of the relevant processes is limited often showing comparable performance to that of numerical models sahoo et al 2017 because of their capacity to capture system dynamics and nonlinearities anns are ideal for studying hydrological systems with significant spatiotemporal variabilities wunsch et al 2018 nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous inputs narx allow a bidirectional flow of information unlike the feedforward neural networks asce task committee on application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000 this makes narx networks particularly suitable for time series forecasting lowering the number of input parameters necessary to improve the model s performance guzman et al 2017 while more complex deep learning dl methods such as long short term memory lstm or convolutional neural networks cnns have also been applied in the study of water resource variables jeong et al 2020 a comparative study wunsch et al 2021 has shown that shallow narx networks seem to perform better than dl models especially when few training data is available the basic architecture of the narx model used in this study is presented in fig 3 the number of hidden nodes neurons was chosen heuristically based on cross validation results in the first phase 70 of the datased was used for training and other 15 of the dataset for validation based on the validation results the best model was selected in this selection phase the maximum number of training epochs was 30 for each model to prevent over fitting of the model the training process was stopped if the errors for the validation dataset increased for a number of 6 epochs in the end the rest of 15 of the dataset was used for testing the selected model in order to assess the performance of the narx network several evaluation metrics were calculated for both the training and the testing datasets the coefficient of determination r2 was used to assess the best linear fit between observed and predicted values the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse have been calculated to indicate the errors for the predicted values while the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse was used to asses hydrological predictions nash and sutcliffe 1970 generally aiming to avoid over or under estimation of the prediction capabilities of the model the training phase stopped after the algorithm ran approx 12 h for the parameters that gave the best results after that we have selected the model with the lowest rmse value 3 4 4 climate scenarios two regional concentration pathways rcps climate projections were used for a moderate radiative forcing to stabilise at 4 5 w m2 before the year 2100 and business as usual radiative forcing to stabilise at 8 5 w m2 before the year 2100 scenarios commonly these two projections correspond with a moderate rcp4 5 and an extreme rcp8 5 climate change scenario for our analysis a multimodel ensemble mean from the 10 available models table s1 was calculated we can underline here that the current pace in annual increase of co2 emissions estimated between 2 0 and 2 5 parts per million noaa 2021 places the end of the century between these two scenarios the narx model trained and tested on the observation period as described in section 3 4 3 was used after that to produce projections of the groundwater levels by assimilating data regarding monthly air temperature and precipitation amount from the climate scenarios 4 results and discussions 4 1 clustering results from the 4 clusters obtained through k means clustering fig 4a two 1st and 3rd gather a small number of points 9 of 47 being represented by scattered and isolated points over the region fig 4b most of the hydrogeological wells included in these clusters were drilled in clay sand deposits belonging to the upper sarmatian located at the level of the middle terraces of the hydrographic network ionesi et al 2005 it is these features in particular which make their composite series of these two clusters to have a high month to month variability induced by the fact that the wells are influenced mainly by local lithological factors and not by major climate drivers due to this further on our analysis is restrained on the other two clusters that sum up together 81 from the total of observation points the 2nd cluster gathers 25 observation points and represents the surface aquifers over the region the descriptive parameters of these clusters are represented by a mean depth of 160 5 cm with a maximum mean depth of 284 7 cm and a minimum mean depth of 34 1 cm and a standard deviation of 75 8 cm the hydrogeological wells included in this cluster were drilled mainly in alluvial deposits composed mainly of sands and gravels located along river network no trend is observed for this cluster for the entire analysed period 1983 2017 but a decreasing trend of groundwater level is observed after the year 2000 fig 4c a buishand s test for homogeneity indicates on this time series a break point in 2011 the data presenting a mean depth of 188 2 cm after this year 2011 2017 while for the previous period 1983 2011 the mean depth was 143 6 cm this shift may already represent a sign of the ongoing climate change impact on surface aquifers over the region minea et al 2020a the 4th cluster instead gathering 13 observation points indicates clearly the piezometric level the descriptive parameters of this cluster are represented by a mean depth of 448 6 cm with a maximum mean depth of 616 6 cm a minimum mean depth of 335 8 cm and a standard deviation of 96 7 cm fig 4d the points within this cluster are distributed mostly over the upper terraces deposits of the two main rivers of the region jijia and bahlui the buishand s test for homogeneity also indicates even more clearly than for the cluster 2 that a change point occurs in 2011 for the piezometric level with a mean depth of 484 5 cm for 2011 2017 and 432 1 cm before 2011 the points within this cluster are distributed mostly over the terrace deposits of the two main rivers of the region jijia and bahlui in this case the declining groundwater level manifested for the entire analysed period indicates that the piezometric level is more sensitive to changes in climate conditions and therefore will be more impacted on by future climate conditions 4 2 correlation analysis between climate variables and groundwater levels the best performance of the correlation analysis was obtained for 1 month lag between meteorological parameters and groundwater level and therefore only these results are shown table 1 this better lagged correlation is clearly explained especially by the slow speed of infiltration of the precipitation water in the lithological deposits of ground water levels in the region in which clays with low infiltration coefficients prevails minea et al 2022 also during winter it is quite normal to have 2 3 snow accumulation melting episodes so that the accumulation of snow occurs in one month while the infiltration is produced during the melting period that occurs mostly in the aftermonth the results indicate that for the cluster 3 and especially for cluster 1 the correlations are weak most probably this is another effect of their particular hydrogeological conditions discussed previously inducing an inertial response of these observation points to the meteorological triggers instead the most important clusters for our analysis 2 and 4 are the most sensitive to climate variability we can therefore observe that the most important climate parameters for the monthly groundwater levels variability are represented by mean and maximum air temperature water vapour deficit relative humidity precipitation amount evaporation and consequently water balance table 1 the depth of groundwater level is directly correlated with mean and maximum air temperature but less with minimum air temperature this is explained by the fact that the evapotranspiration a very important driver of regional aridity is better correlated especially with the higher air temperature during the day and less with the minimum air temperature commonly recorded during the morning hours accordingly the evapotranspiration which is positively correlated also with the groundwater levels is driven both by the maximum air temperature and by the water vapour deficit recognised as the most important driver of groundwater level change in a warm climate condon et al 2020 the relative humidity and the precipitation amount instead are negatively correlated to the groundwater levels confirming that precipitation amount exhibit the most important influence on month to month groundwater variability changes thomas and famiglietti 2019 moreover the highest correlation coefficient among the meteorological parameters with groundwater levels is specific to climate water balance this parameter integers information both for precipitation and evapotranspiration and give a better image on the water resource available in the climate system prăvălie et al 2019 overall the higher lower the air temperature the water vapour and the evaporation then the lower higher the groundwater level is at the same time higher lower relative air humidity precipitation amount and water balance are related to higher lower ground water level it is worth mentioning that the intensity of the correlation is generally similar for surface aquifers cluster 2 and for piezometric level cluster 4 proving that the climate parameters play a similarly important role for the entire groundwater resource these results also confirm that groundwater level could by far be estimated with very good accuracy by using air temperature and precipitation amounts as predictors al atawneh et al 2021 4 3 assessment of the relationship between groundwater levels and climate variables using narx model the results obtained in the training phase of the narx model development 1983 2007 show a remarkable level of statistical significance table 2 overall the best results are specific for the regional mean of two main clusters analysed the highest statistical performance was obtained for the aquifer level corresponding to cluster 2 whose variability is largely explained by air temperature and precipitation amount r2 0 87 nse 0 85 consequently the associated errors are rather small and reflect a good prediction skill of the model mae 11 5 rmse 14 4 for cluster 4 the performance of the model is weaker r2 0 73 nse 0 54 but remains sufficiently high in order to be used as prediction tool the smaller statistical performance in this case could be explained by the more complex lithology of these observation points on the one hand and by the smaller sample size of this cluster on the other the higher depth of this cluster impedes or slows down the response of piezometric level to climate inputs consequently the errors of the model for this cluster increase significantly mae 18 98 rmse 23 86 generally the statistical performance of the model remains higher for cluster 2 than for cluster 4 and also for the observation points assigned through thiessen polygons to each weather station the lower performance on cluster 4 for cotnari is mostly explained by the position of this weather station at higher altitude while the piezometric level is located on lower altitude generally the smaller the sample size of observation points the smaller the statistical performance of the model is indicating that in these conditions the series are not very smooth and the influence of local hydrological conditions remains prevalent on the groundwater levels variability our results also indicate a limited relevance of the meteorological weather stations data for the observation points assigned through thiessen polygons and this could be explained primarly by the diveristy of local climate conditions these results obtained in the training phase have been used in the second phase to test the model s capabilities to predict the evolution of the groundwater level as they are induced by the air temperature and precipitation amount fig 5 as a general feature the prediction fits well with the observation data series both in capturing the overall variability and the peak values occurrence the fitting is better for cluster 2 in correspondence with the better statistical performance of the narx model discussed previously considering these results we assume that the narx model could be used with confidence to predict the groundwater changes based on the results of climate scenarios simulations 4 4 climate scenarios projections the results of climate projections are in line with other assessments available for the study region collins et al 2013 ipcc 2021 but they bring a clear idea on the quantitative assessment of the projected climate change this way our results indicate a clear increase for air temperature towards the end of the century over the study region for the moderate scenario rcp4 5 the increase in mean air temperature for 2100 is limited at 2 5 c above the 1980 2010 mean while for the extreme scenario rcp8 5 an increase exceeding 4 0 c is expected fig 6a b these results are in line with the estimations of other european studies carvalho et al 2021 but also with the few studies on this topic for the territory of romania croitoru et al 2018 also the difference between the two scenarios is small until 2060 around 2 5 c but it is increasing especially towards the end of the century the spatial distribution of the air temperature increase is quite homogenous over the study region only with lower values for the hilly regions in the northwestern part the major shift in the air temperature increase is expected for 2070 2100 for which the increase will reach 4 0 c in case of rcp8 5 scenarios it is also worth noticing that the increase for 2041 2070 in rcp8 5 is higher than the increase for 2070 2100 in rcp4 5 fig 7a f regarding the changes in the annual precipitation amount they are rather small and go towards a slight increase of the annual amount towards the end of the century fig 6c d however the difference between the two scenarios is small but comparatively with the current climate conditions an increase in the multiannual variability is also expected with more years recording annomalies ranged between 50 and 100 from the annual mean despite the small extent of the study region this increase in precipitation amount is higher in the north with approx 20 than in the south in the rcp8 5 scenarios fig 7g l for the end of the analysed interval 2070 2100 in fact most of climate scenarios split the european continent regarding the change in the amount of precipitation between the southern part with more drought and the northern part with more precipitation coppola et al 2021 the study region being placed somewhere between these two major regions once more the major changes are expected after 2070 and especially for the most extreme emission scenario rcp8 5 and it is obvious that they should be regarded with caution however according to some studies hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020 myhre et al 2019 the changes in precipitation amount can lead to higher variability with more alternating high amounts of precipitation followed by intense periods of droughts at sub annual time scale and with associated changes in water infiltration which is also able to affect the groundwater supply 4 5 groundwater levels estimation for 2020 2100 using climate scenarios data the narx model trained and tested on the historical data for the observation period 1983 2017 as explained above was used as prediction model for the interval 2020 2100 with input data given by the monthly mean air temperature and precipitation amount derived from climate scenarios the model was run for aquifer cluster 2 and piezometric cluster 4 levels for the entire study region both for moderate rcp4 5 and extreme rcp8 5 climate scenarios fig 8 the model was run also for the mean of groundwater observation points assigned through thiessen polygons to each of the four weather stations on the region figs 9 10 firstly we can outline that both aquifer and piezometric levels are expected to be drastically impacted upon during the current century as effect of the projected climate change the aquifer levels tend to decrease with almost 200 cm compared with the mean of the observation period instead the already felt decrease at piezometric level will progress from 600 cm at the end of the observation period 1983 2017 to 1200 cm in 2100 fig 8 actually the projected change in piezometric level can lead in some cases depending on local hydrogeology to the total depletion of groundwater reservoirs in other cases this process will probably be avoided due to the clay horizons in which water can be easily contained and consequently the effect of the evapotranspiration could be reduced this decrease of piezometric level in particular should raise major concerns from socio economic perspective due to the fact that the aquifer levels of the region already record a decrease of water quality as effect of pollution determined by agriculture paiu and breaban 2016 also another important feature of projected groundwater level changes as reflected by our results is given by the similar decrease expected for both scenarios used moreover for some intervals in the current century higher levels of groundwater are expected for rcp8 5 for piezometric levels this is expected to occur between 2030 and 2080 as a result of the projected increase of precipitation amount over the study region in this extreme climate scenario however towards the end of the century the evapotranspiration increase triggered by higher air temperature will overwhelm the increase in precipitation amount and will lead to increased decline also for the piezometric level these results support the theory of aridization over the study region indicated in other studies beck et al 2018 prăvălie et al 2019 and also the lack of change in groundwater supply in eastern europe reinecke et al 2021 despite the expected increase in precipitation these results underline that the depletion of the groundwater is not an issue to be restricted only to arid or semi arid regions of the world but also can affect sub humid temperate zone as the analysed region this major impact of climate change in the groundwater levels is caused by a synergic effect of multiple factors firstly less snow and higher run off during winter on the background of higher air temperature will impede solid precipitation and will decrease groundwater supply during late winter and spring secondly higher intensity of precipitation during summer expected in the future hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020 is also related with the decrease in infiltration on the ground not last in a sub humid region groundwater is available for evapotranspiration near the surface condon et al 2020 leading to pronounced decrease in groundwater level the results for each weather station translates pronouncedly the local climate conditions but also the local hydrological environment in this way one can notice that no clear changes could be outlined in both scenarios for aquifer levels except for the clear decrease indicated by extreme case scenario for 2071 2020 instead for the southern part of the region iași and cotnari the decline in groundwater resources is perceivable even for moderate scenario rcp4 5 beginning with 2021 2050 the north south difference is explained especially by the climate asymmetry between these regions with more precipitation more aridity in the north south the existing differences in hydrogeological conditions should also be taken into account in the north part of the region the geological deposits are sandier with slightly higher permeability in the southern part they are more clayey with lower permeability this influences the appearance of aquifers and also limits the ability to respond to water input from the surface for the piezometric levels instead the changes are pronounced for both scenarios except for cotnari where no major modifications are foreseen for 2021 2050 for all thiessen polygons the extreme climate scenario diminishes the decrease in groundwater resource with clear differences in this regard in the north of the region it is also to be noticed that for northernmost weather station darabani the moderate rcp4 5 and extreme rcp8 5 climate scenarios 2020 2100 the decline in groundwater is limited to 1100 cm analysing these results we emphasise that our study accuracy firstly rely on the conservation of the observed relation between climate drivers and groundwater levels in the future secondly the reliability of the groundwater level estimations presented here resides on the reliability of the climate scenarios used due to the well known relationship between greenhouse gases concentrations and air temperature it is quite clear that the air temperature will increase as indicated by climate scenarios as for the precipitation amount the future evolution is not similarly clear and therefore it can lead to uncertainties however it is known that uncertainties in precipitation amount and evapotranspiration wartenburger et al 2018 lead to considerable unvertainty in groundwater projections and that changes in groundwater increase with increasing greenhouse emissions reinecke et al 2021 even so taking into consideration these drawbacks in climate projections the major finding of our study consists in the fact that the study region even if it is expected to experience an increase in precipitation amount will face a decrease in groundwater resources due to the more important effect of air temperature on groundwater manifested through evapotranspiration 5 conclusions the current study proves that the decline in groundwater resource is worth being studied outside of the arid regions of the world in the temperate sub humid conditions that are expecting to record a moderate increase in precipitation amount in the future the collapse of groundwater levels after 2070 represents a cumulated effect of climate changes manifested through various processes coupled with human pressure over groundwater resources firstly the almost continuous positive air temperature and prevailing liquid precipitation projected by climate scenarios during winter will increase the run off instead of infiltration and groundwater recharge secondly the higher air temperature will increase evapotranspiration contributing to groundwater depletion the impact of climate change on groundwater is expected to be very high especially since the water is more available to increased potential evapotranspiration demand imposed by higher air temperature in this region however the results for 2070 2100 in particular should be regarded with caution due to the well known uncertainties of climate scenarios obviously the validity of our results is conditioned by the accuracy of climate scenarios we used the lithological conditions manifested locally or changes in land use will also lead to uncertainties but this should be investigated separately from a hydrogeological perspective actually the aim of our paper is to give a general image on the changes expected to groundwater levels in the future according to climate scenarios not to deal with local conditions a fact that remains to be investigated in further studies since only the climate conditions are taken into account further investigations are planned in order to understand the role of other socio economic factors involved in groundwater level long term variability the results obtained are the first phase of analysis of the vulnerability of groundwater resources in relation to various scenarios of climate change and are aimed to represent a starting point in identifying viable solutions for the exploitation of these resources reducing anthropogenic pressure by expanding water supply systems identifying agro technical solutions for more efficient use of groundwater can mitigate long term effects in the evolution

7997,study region sangdo dong dongjak gu which is classified as inland water disaster risk zone within seoul republic of korea study focus this study evaluated the amount of flooding that could occur in the carbon neutral era and optimized low impact development lid technology for an urban flood adaptation the optimal scenario of lid technologies was proposed for the sangdo dong area at the urban level and the amount of runoff and flood reduction was evaluated new hydrological insights the lid controls provided by the storm water management model were used to analyze the flood damage that may occur under rcp 2 6 scenario the evaluation simulated eight combinations of three optimized techniques green roofs permeable pavements and vegetative swales to construct evidence based data for the use by decision makers in scenario 8 which was evaluated as the most efficient both peak and total flooding could be reduced by 55 60 respectively this study not only evaluate the runoff but also the flooding value reflecting the interactions among lid pipe networks the lid installation area and runoff damage scale are inversely proportional in contrast as total flooding considers the capacity of the sewage network a non uniform graph can be seen compared to the runoff results of this study can be used as guidance for lid evidence based design and construction as well as strategies for decision maker keywords hydrology lid pipe network climate change scenario net zero rcp 2 6 storm water management 1 introduction the frequency of localized downpours is increasing due to climate change and rainfall events frequently occur on a scale that exceeds the capacity of drainage facilities kim et al 2013a annex 2012 hirabayashi et al 2013 in addition rapid urbanization due to economic development and population growth has increased impermeable areas and thus the flood vulnerability in urban areas adger 2006 jongman 2018 son et al 2010 flooding is considered to be a dangerous disaster because it causes secondary socioeconomic damage such as electricity gas and water supply damage as well as problems related to rising water levels pachauri et al 2021 choi et al 2021 kim and kang 2021 bae and lee 2020 the socioeconomic damage caused by urban floods is a serious problem in the korean peninsula cho et al 2021 kang et al 2021 choi 2021 the summer rainy season in 2020 started on june 24 in the central region of the korean peninsula and ended on august 16 lasting a total of 54 days it was the longest rainy season since the start of korean meteorological observations in 1973 the average precipitation in korea during this period was 858 mm with the exception of jeju island which received 66 of the average annual rainfall of 1299 7 mm in korea mun et al 2020 lee et al 2020 in korea various policies have been established to solve water cycle distortions such as increased surface runoff reduced base runoff increased rainfall runoff and increased flow rates caused by impervious water surfaces to restore the water circulation the ministry of environment enacted the water management basic act and implemented a policy for integrated water resources management iwrm sim 2021 kang et al 2014 lee et al 2014 in addition the demand for improved water resources management in south korea is growing up due to the increase in population and the development of industries as of 2014 about 7 6 billion tons of water for domestic use 2 3 billion tons of water for industrial use and 15 2 billion tons of water for agricultural use were used annually the current water supply system however is insufficient for supplying living water therefore it is essential to adopt iwrm from the initial stage of rainwater runoff mun et al 2020 sim 2021 park 2018 in addition to korea developed countries such as germany canada singapore the united states and china are implementing policies for water circulation management and iwrm park 2018 china s sponge city urban construction

shuster et al 2010 khoo and guo 2017 dupras et al 2015 although various types of flood reduction technologies have been implemented the most commonly used technologies are low impact development lid

attention as fundamental solutions to climate change as nature based solutions nbss kim 2020 jo 2020 woo and han 2020 in general nbss are widely regarded to be effective measures for urban flood risk areas based on which the environmental and economic benefits of the society can be enhanced by improving the service capacity of the ecosystem potschin et al 2016 faivre et al 2017 in korea many nbs based lid technologies have been implemented to reduce flooding and enhance socioeconomic benefits lee et al 2020 kim 2020 jo 2020 woo and han 2020 from a long term perspective it is essential to simulate and evaluate lid technology in response to flooding since 2017 developed countries such as sweden the united kingdom france and denmark have declared carbon neutrality net zero to reduce disasters such as heatwaves and floods that may occur due to climate change maes and jacobs 2017 tsiropoulos et al 2020 deutch 2020 recently korea announced a declaration and promotion strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 as well as domestic climate change adaptation policies in response to the carbon neutral era korea government 2020a 2020b nam 2021 it is very important to establish a scenario for each local government that responds to carbon neutrality in the adaptation plan for urban flooding which may occur due to climate change choi et al 2021 kim and kang 2021 bae and lee 2020 hurlimann et al 2021 knighton et al 2021 asdak and supian 2018 climate scenarios for establishing adaptation scenarios can be divided into the special report on emission scenario sres or representative concentration pathways rcps the most important precipitation scenario used in the model analysis is the rcp scenario of the korean peninsula climate change scenario there are two reasons for using the rcp scenario instead of the sres scenario in this study first the rcp scenario is a latest concept introduced in the ipcc 5th assessment report in 2013 and most recent studies used the rcp scenario the sres scenario was introduced in the ipcc third assessment report in 2001 second the rcp scenario reflects the latest changes in greenhouse gas concentration and the latest prediction model is used and the resolution is updated the sres scenario however calculates the climate change scenario after setting the greenhouse gas emission by socioeconomic type whereas the rcp scenario calculates the climate change scenario after setting the greenhouse gas concentration value and determines the greenhouse gas emission policy for each socioeconomic field as a countermeasure do pachauri et al 2021 the rcp scenarios can be divided into rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 here the rcp scenario number means radiative forcing in other words it means the degree of influence that changes the energy balance with greenhouse gases for example the radiative forcing of rcp 8 5 is 8 5 w m2 pachauri et al 2021 the definition of each rcp scenario is shown in table 2 pachauri et al 2021 choi et al 2021 kim and kang 2021 in most previous studies the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios were used to prepare for severe precipitation due to climate change however in this study the rcp 2 6 scenario was used for the flood reduction simulation to prepare for the 1 5 report of the international panel on climate change ipcc and 2050 net zero carbon the rcp 2 6 is a scenario which increases the likelihood that the level of global warming can be maintained below 2 c above preindustrial temperatures pachauri et al 2021 kim and kang 2021 the rcp scenarios are used as preemptive data to assess the number of disasters that can occur due to climate change pachauri et al 2021 kim and kang 2021 the aims of this study were to design a flood adaptation scenario that can be applied to carbon neutral scenarios by adopting a storm water management model swmm and analyzing its effects in this study simulation data based on the parameter optimization of eight types of lid controls provided in the epa swmm 5 1 version are provided which decision makers can use for the design of policies considering the location of the target site the lid controls that were optimized in this study include bioretention cells rain garden green roof infiltration trench permeable pavement rain barrel rooftop disconnection and vegetative swale bae and lee 2020 fassman beck and saleh 2021 lee and gil 2021 kim et al 2021 agency 2015 these are evidence based data that can be used by decision makers such as mayors or public officials to establish useful climate change adaptation policies for citizens finally the flood occurrence probability under scenario rcp 2 6 and the magnitude of disaster reduction based on the proposed lid scenario were determined 2 materials 2 1 target site analysis sangdo dong dongjak gu seoul was selected as target site for this study as explained in the introduction the rainy season continued for 54 days in 2020 in seoul and the socioeconomic damage was severe the target site seoul has the highest population density in korea and the cost of buildings and real estate is very high causing great socioeconomic damage in the event of a disaster koh and lee 2012 kim et al 2013b therefore it has been identified as the region in which adaptation policies should be introduced first in korea sangdo dong dongjak gu is classified as inland water disaster risk zone within seoul to prevent and reduce flood damage in all local governments e g metropolitan and self governing cities in the republic of korea a comprehensive plan for the reduction of storm and flood damage is established every five years seoul metropolitan city is considered to be an inland region that is floods are not caused by tidal waves the comprehensive plan mainly analyzes disasters caused by typhoons heavy rain strong winds and other similar natural phenomena seoul metropolitan government 2016 ministry of public administration and security 2018 in the comprehensive plan for flood reduction inland flood risk areas are selected in addition rainwater is concentrated on roads and low lying areas which therefore have been selected as risk zones for flooding it has been evaluated that the stormwater pipe capacity is insufficient kim et al 2013b seoul metropolitan government 2016 kim 2013 in the rcp climate change scenario in this study the future precipitation in sangdo dong is expected to significantly increase reaching larger values than the average value of seoul in particular in rcp 8 5 the rate of the increase in the precipitation in seoul in the second half of the 21st century 2071 2100 is 32 9 whereas that in dongjak gu is 35 5 indicating a very high probability of damage the scenario aims at minimizing the damage to dongjak gu by installing flood adaptation technology on an appropriate scale korea meteorological administration 2014 kim et al 2020a sangdo dong is located south of the han river in seoul and covers an area of 3 83 km2 longitude 126 94 126 98 latitude 37 48 37 49 accounting for 23 4 of the total area of 16 35 km2 in dongjak gu fig 1 based on the data provided by the national geographic information service operated by the ministry of land infrastructure and transport 85 of the buildings in sangdo dong are apartments houses and general buildings which are mainly residential areas the second largest number of facilities are neighborhood park facilities which can also be regarded as living facilities the next most common facilities are educational or nursing facilities considering that the policy to support the installation of lid facilities by local governments is targeted at residential areas the opportunity to install lid facilities sangdo dong is great korea national spatial data infrastructure potal 2021 fig 2 2 2 model 2 2 1 storm water management model in this study the epa swmm5 was used as runoff analysis program a model within the downtown area was built using network data provided by the seoul metropolitan government the epa swmm5 which was optimized for the drainage system model was determined to be an appropriate program the reason this study selected swmm 5 among many hydrology programs is that it has the advantage of facilitating complex modeling of gi and gray infrastructure because lid control options can be added agency 2015 in other words epa swmm5 implements lid pipe networks in the modeling which means that the effects of both lid and gray infrastructure e g drainage pipes are considered in the analyses in addition it has a function to adjust the parameters for optimization for each lid that is intended in this study and it also has good compatibility with arc map 10 5 and r in this study gis arcmap 10 5 r environmental statistical computing and graphic programs were used to construct and model a subwatershed in an area of 3 83 km2 the r program converts the file provided with a shp extension to one with an inp extension such that it can be run in epa swmm5 based on this method it is easy to input three dimensional 3d parameters leading to a more accurate resolution of the digital elevation model dem venables et al 2021 2 2 2 nonlinear reservoir model of the subcatchment the nonlinear reservoir runoff model used in epa swmm5 is mostly based on the continuity equation eq 1 refers to the variation in the depth of the water runoff that changes with time eq 1 includes precipitation and outflow occurring within the subcatchment and is based on the correlation between the precipitation inflow and outflow precipitation inflow includes rainfall and snowmelt and losses include water runoff evaporation losses and infiltration losses abi aad et al 2010 kim et al 2020b rossman and huber 2015 1 d x t i e f q where d x is the depth of the water runoff i is the rate of rainfall and snowmelt m s e is the surface evaporation m s f is the infiltration rate ft s and q is the runoff rate m s note that the fluxes i e f and q are the flow rates per unit area m s the runoff q of each subwatershed is derived from manning s equation 2 q 1 n s 1 2 r 2 3 a x where q is the outflow of the subcatchment m3 time n is manning s surface roughness coefficient s is the apparent or average slope of the subcatchment r is the hydraulic radius associated with the area m and a x is the cross sectional flow area based on substituting eq 2 into eq 3 q can be written as 3 q 1 n w s 1 2 d d s 5 3 and the flow per unit area of the subcatchment can be expressed as 4 q q a s 1 a s n w s 1 2 d d s 5 3 based on substituting this equation into the original mass balance relation in eq 1 5 d x t i e f α d d s 5 3 where α is defined as 6 α w s 1 2 a s n eq 5 is a general nonlinear differential equation which is numerically computed by epa swmm5 through iterations of discrete time steps assigned by the researcher using the time step options menu 2 3 adaptation technologies because epa swmm5 was used in this study the applicable lid technology was divided into eight types although the lid technology supported by epa swmm5 is limited to a total of eight technologies various types of technologies can be modeled by adjusting the parameters of each technology among the lid controls the green roof and rain garden functions were upgraded from version 5 1 001 on march 24 2014 the most recently added technology is rooftop disconnection the ability to model the roof runoff was added in version 5 1 008 on april 2 2015 agency 2015 table 3 shows the types of lid controls for which parameters were optimized in this study considering the location and situation of the target site 2 4 data 2 4 1 rainfall scenario carbon net zero rcp 2 6 with respect to precipitation data used in this study the korean peninsula climate change scenario rcp 2 6 was considered for a 10 year frequency the expected carbon dioxide concentration is 420 ppm in this scenario the temperature increases by about 2 c compared with the preindustrial level there are two reasons why this study adapted to the rcp 2 6 scenarios for modeling rainfall first the predicted precipitation scenario has an irregular distribution unlike the temperature distribution in the case of the seoul rcp 8 5 the maximum annual precipitation expected by 2100 is approximately 2169 mm in the rcp 2 6 scenario in which the carbon emission level is less than 50 it is estimated that 2134 mm of precipitation will fall by 2100 fig 3 considering that the average annual precipitation which has a significant effect on flooding is already maintained at a similar level it is necessary to design an urban flood countermeasure that can adapt to the rcp 2 6 scenario second in the rcp 2 6 scenario large scale flooding was predicted for the mid 2000 s around 2060 whereas such flooding was predicted for the late 2000 s around 2090 based on the rcp 8 5 scenario therefore a flood adaptation plan with a relatively high level of infrastructure construction should be required for the 2060 s rather than for the 2090 s rossman and huber 2017 korea meteorological administration 2018 the climate change scenario uses precipitation in units of days and peak precipitation in units of ten years the huff equation established in 1967 is used to simulate the daily climate change scenario in minutes the huff equation is nondimensional and provides the distribution of rainfall by statistically analyzing the rainfall records of illinois united states park et al 2008 the huff equation uses the third quartile equation which is officially used by the ministry of land infrastructure and transport of the republic of korea bonta and shahalam 2003 lee 2008 the coefficient used in the six dimensional huff equation is the rainfall time distribution created based on the empirical equation measured by the ministry of environment kim and kang 2021 ministry of environment 2019 as shown in eq 7 7 y 6 66094771241445 e 09 x 6 1 85645739064733 e 06 x 5 0 000191483251633836 x 4 0

rainfall duration for the climate change scenario was calculated to be 6 h however in this study the rainfall duration was calculated to be 3 h considering the laws and reports of the republic of korea the referenced data are reports used in flood planning such as the natural measures act seoul metropolitan city sewerage maintenance plan report and guidelines for establishing the sewerage maintenance basic plan published by the ministry of environment seoul metropolitan government 2019 ministry of environment 2020 korea national law information center 2021 table 4 is presented the 10 year frequency period with high precipitation the huff equation was used to analyze the precipitation for each climate change scenario according to the duration in a temporal distribution format 2 4 2 drain pipe network and road network data for the swmm construction implemented with lid pipe networks a map of the sewage pipe network around dongjak gu was provided by the seoul metropolitan government the database includes the geographic information system gis sewage facility layer file and database db design such as sewage pipelines and manholes around the site the database is the latest file built by seoul city in 2020 the dem data were built by seoul city in 2018 because no large scale civil works were carried out in seoul after 2018 the dem data continue until 2021 in large areas such as seoul it is common to build a dem with a resolution of 30 5 m vaze et al 2010 in this study the resolution of one grid was set to 10 m to allow for more accurate hydrologic analysis and model construction to simulate an appropriate type of lid control for the sangdo dong site it is necessary to establish a road network and building information because lid controls such as bioretention cells or permeable pavements can be installed depending on the cross sectional width of the road it is also essential to understand the spatial data because the scale of the lid controls such as the green roof rooftop disconnection and rain barrel may vary depending on the sizes of the building and catchment areas therefore the 2020 gis building integration information and standard node link provided by the korea national spatial data infrastructure portal open api of the ministry of land infrastructure and transport were downloaded and analyzed 3 methodology 3 1 workflow a schematic diagram of the workflow of this study is presented in fig 4 the broad framework can be divided into four stages that is historical hazard analysis model construction model application and results analysis during hazard analysis the past disaster history is analyzed a disaster is selected and the past flood history is explored this was mostly covered in the introduction and materials section the disasters to be adapted to are urban flood disasters in the model construction stage a model for hydrological analysis is created based on spatial information including dem and rainfall data programs such as arcmap swmmr and qgis are used to model large scale sites in the model application stage a scenario is constructed while changing two factors and a comparison with the baseline simulation is performed the two factors are changed to select the most suitable technology among the optimized lid controls the rcp 2 6 scenario examines the possibility of flood adaptation from 2030 to 2100 with a 10 year frequency the items that are finally evaluated include the reduced peak runoff runoff outflow volume and flood volume based on the results an expert discussion is conducted and conclusions are drawn 3 2 subcatchment generalization the model of the sangdo dong area established using arcgis and r is shown in fig 5 a total of 870 subwatersheds were modeled using sewage pipe network 2866 junctions were connected and 3027 conduits and two outlet outlets were constructed in general sewer conduits include both rectangular and round conduits with a diameter of 1000 mm bae and lee 2020 however in this study all pipe network files provided by the seoul metropolitan government were used to increase the accuracy the sewage conduit network is based on the 2020 file built by seoul metropolitan city which is the most recent file the shape length and depth of the conduit were displayed on the sewer network map arcmap version 10 5 was used to construct the slope and impervious area ratio of the site the average slope of the site is 6 9 and the impervious area ratio is 73 7 considering that the number of subwatersheds in previous studies is generally less than ten the swmm constructed in this study is very precise and detailed 3 3 optimal parameter research for lid controls the swmm includes dynamic analysis considering sewage networks and time series the parameters of the lid technology were optimized to create an optimal adaptation plan the parameter optimization is shown in fig 6 for each lid control parameter a value was obtained that can minimize flooding and is more economical compared with previous studies for example in a previous study a storage depth of the bioretention cell function of 300 mm was used for the simulation but it has not been proven that this value is the most economical and minimizes the flooding value by changing the parameter values we determined the most economical value that minimizes the total of the four values first the minimum value for peak flooding was obtained which is a critical value that directly affects urban flooding subsequently a value that minimizes the total flooding was determined and the surface runoff was optimized because lid parameters include values that cannot be artificially controlled such as the wilting point and conductivity expert advice and design are required finally among the optimized lid controls the most suitable technologies for the sangdo dong area were identified and the amount of flooding reduction corresponding to rcp 2 6 was evaluated 3 4 scenarios for spatial distribution of lid techniques among the eight technologies supported by epa swmm5 three technologies can be implemented in the sangdo dong area green roofs can be applied to the largest area in sangdo dong with many buildings and residential areas in addition permeable pavements and vegetative swales are applied to roads with large widths that is four or more lanes choi et al 2021 kim and kang 2021 the application width of permeable pavements was set to 1 5 m based on previous studies and the width of the vegetative swales was set to 0 5 m the applicable area for green roofs determined using arcgis is 1166 582 5 m2 which is approximately 30 5 of the total area the length of the road to which vegetative swales and permeable pavements can be applied within the site is 9890 m covering an area of 14 836 1 m2 0 4 and 4945 4 m2 0 13 respectively the master plan and cross sectional view of the sangdo dong area for the design based on the above mentioned conditions are shown in fig 7 and the applied scenarios are shown in table 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 lid optimization results the parameters of the three lid controls were optimized table 6 the parameters that affect the flooding and runoff of the green roof are the surface berm height vegetation volume soil thickness porosity field capacity wilting point conductivity conductivity slope suction head drainage mat thickness and void ratio fig 8 shows a comparison of the referenced parameter values and optimized values used in a previous study and the table shows the parameters of the lid controls applied to the scenario yeon et al 2015 choi et al 2020 optimized green roofs can reduce the peak flooding by 5 2 cubic meter per second cms 15 4 and total flooding by 11 0 cms 6 compared with previous studies fig 8 in the case of vegetative swales the peak flooding amount can be reduced by 8 4 cms 24 1 and the total flooding amount can be reduced by 9 16 cms 4 3 although permeable pavements do not affect the flooding head they can be economically designed by minimizing the soil height 4 2 effects of lid simulations on flood events in this study the runoff and flood characteristics obtained after the application of lid technologies to the entire watershed system with the same characteristics were investigated using swmm from the 2020 s to 2100 with a frequency of ten years however raw data were only provided for three cases 2070 s 2080 s and 2090 s for which the largest precipitation amounts were predicted table 7 first when analyzing the runoff which is affected the most by impermeability it was observed that the amount of runoff decreases proportional with the area installed in the subwatershed in scenario 4 in which only 0 13 of the lid area is occupied the peak and total runoff could be reduced by less than 1 in all cases on the other hand in scenario 8 the peak runoff could be reduced by 39 in all cases and the decrease in the total runoff ranged from 36 to 40 when referring to the case of the 2070 s the peak runoff of scenarios 1 and 8 is 47 5 cms and 28 82 cms respectively representing a reduction of 39 33 as shown in the fig 9 the peak flow occurred at 120 min and 10 min after 110 min when most of the precipitation fell resulting in a delay of 10 min in the case of flooding another evaluation factor the graph was drawn much more nonlinear than the runoff however the peak flooding and total flooding values which are the most important factors in urban flooding decreased at a certain rate interestingly even in scenario 4 which led to an insignificant reduction of the runoff amount the peak flooding could be reduced by up to 25 47 and the total flooding could be reduced by up to 14 77 in scenario 8 both peak and total flooding could be reduced by 55 60 figs 9 11 therefore it is important to not only evaluate the runoff but also the flooding value reflecting the interactions among lid pipe networks in previous studies in which only the runoff was evaluated the runoff was inferred based on the direct proportionality but this is problematic because flooding which also considers the discharge capacity of the conduit was not referred to the arrival time of peak flooding in the 2070 s insignificantly changed which is due to the fact that it occurred in the downtown area far from the river 4 3 discussion 4 3 1 hydrology the most difficult part of the urban flood disaster prevention simulation is the expression of the city s pipe networks and topography the urban pipe networks used for the simulation in this study are the most recent and are very meaningful in that they model the current situation in addition the statistical coding program r s add in r swmm was used for accurate modeling such as dem construction and impermeability calculation in previous studies the number of subwatersheds with similar areas was 10 whereas more than 800 subwatersheds were constructed along the pipe in this study therefore this model is suitable for urban flooding and its accuracy can be increased more by hydrology analysis the use of flooding with lid pipe networks as evaluation factors is the primary differentiation of this study in general for studies in which the hydrology is evaluated typically only the runoff is considered however because the runoff changes according to the impervious area ratio it decreases proportionally with increasing area on the other hand based on epa swmm5 flooding occurs when the depth of the node exceeds the maximum available water depth making the model a suitable evaluation system for urban flooding because it considers pipe networks still even better results can be obtained in the future by creating a small testbed and verifying the flooding value with full consideration of the pipe network 4 3 2 climate change scenario the most interesting aspect of this study is that the rcp 2 6 scenario is used as the precipitation scenario in most previous studies the rcp 8 5 scenario was used to adapt to very serious situations however as mentioned in this paper researchers must establish an adaptation plan and evidence based data that can respond to the net zero era in this work we explain why it is important to use the rcp 2 6 scenario instead of rcp 8 5 heavy rainfall is expected earlier in the case of the rcp 2 6 scenario among the precipitation forecasts up to 2100 as we approach the year 2100 society s infrastructure and disaster prevention technology will further develop therefore we are obligated to prepare for the rcp 2 6 scenario based on which very heavy rainfall is expected to occur earlier because urban flooding is related to one rainfall event it is also meaningful to compare the peak precipitation of the rcp 8 5 and rcp 2 6 scenarios this study is meaningful in that the precipitation was analyzed at a frequency of ten years among the climate change scenarios rcp 2 6 is based on a large amount of accumulated data however uncertainties with respect to climate change due to covid 19 social changes and social events are limitations that have been pointed out before a popular method to address these limitations is to view the scenario using a 10 year frequency studies to correct various scenarios and factors such as the precipitation are being conducted to reduce the uncertainty in climate change scenarios which will facilitate the development of more accurate data in the future 4 3 3 lid and gi the primary difference between this study and other studies is the parameter optimization in many previous studies it has not been clearly explained as to why or how the parameters utilized for the swmm were employed for hydrological analysis for example in several studies it was not specified which parameters were used for lid control this study in contrast determines the effects of several parameters on the two evaluated factors of flooding and runoff in addition during the application of lid controls locations were selected based on gis and clear criteria were used it is of advantage to not simply use lid controls but to clearly analyze the location at which the three technologies can be installed using a field visit 5 conclusion the aims of this study were to design a flood adaptation scenario that is applicable to carbon neutral scenarios by adopting a swmm and discuss its effects in this study the flooding reduction based on the application of lid controls to sangdo dong dongjak gu seoul which is a risk area for inland flooding was calculated to apply the net zero policy which has recently attracted attention a precipitation scenario based on the rcp 2 6 korean peninsula climate change scenario was implemented the significance of this study can be summarized as follows first a climate change scenario suitable for a carbon neutral era was used there is enough time for ecosystems and environments to return to the preindustrial status and fully recover even if carbon neutrality is realized immediately countless natural disasters will occur until the rainfall and temperature are restored in this study climate change adaptation that can be endured until full recovery is reached was analyzed second the lid control parameters were optimized interestingly in the case of lid scenario 4 which was the most inefficient although the runoff value was only reduced by 0 05 the flooding value could be reduced by up to 25 this demonstrates that it is important to not only evaluate the amount of runoff but also carry out dynamic analysis using lid pipe networks which include the pipe capacity and evapotranspiration scenario 8 was the most effective among all scenarios the results show that decision makers should make appropriate decisions with respect to the lid installation policy according to the budget and size of the project third evidence based data were provided to policymakers to create an overall plan in preparation for urban flooding decision makers will be able to refer to this thesis when selecting the appropriate technology for the city in which they wish to implement their policies manuals and guidelines can be developed that can be applied to each local government and national level in the future in addition the design of lid controls was carried out by conducting gis analysis and field visits necessary for the selection of sites for technology installation however this study has two limitations the first is the uncertainty with respect to climate change climate change can change any time either due to human activities or large scale events in other words it is important to develop an evidence based disaster reduction plan and design using data with minimal uncertainty the second limitation is that the social infrastructure might change in particular in the case of manholes or sewage pipe networks which have a large effect on urban flooding large scale construction is carried out every 30 years and small scale facilities are added and removed due to changes in buildings therefore a social change pattern and modeling method that reflects it must be established addressing the above mentioned two

7997,study region sangdo dong dongjak gu which is classified as inland water disaster risk zone within seoul republic of korea study focus this study evaluated the amount of flooding that could occur in the carbon neutral era and optimized low impact development lid technology for an urban flood adaptation the optimal scenario of lid technologies was proposed for the sangdo dong area at the urban level and the amount of runoff and flood reduction was evaluated new hydrological insights the lid controls provided by the storm water management model were used to analyze the flood damage that may occur under rcp 2 6 scenario the evaluation simulated eight combinations of three optimized techniques green roofs permeable pavements and vegetative swales to construct evidence based data for the use by decision makers in scenario 8 which was evaluated as the most efficient both peak and total flooding could be reduced by 55 60 respectively this study not only evaluate the runoff but also the flooding value reflecting the interactions among lid pipe networks the lid installation area and runoff damage scale are inversely proportional in contrast as total flooding considers the capacity of the sewage network a non uniform graph can be seen compared to the runoff results of this study can be used as guidance for lid evidence based design and construction as well as strategies for decision maker keywords hydrology lid pipe network climate change scenario net zero rcp 2 6 storm water management 1 introduction the frequency of localized downpours is increasing due to climate change and rainfall events frequently occur on a scale that exceeds the capacity of drainage facilities kim et al 2013a annex 2012 hirabayashi et al 2013 in addition rapid urbanization due to economic development and population growth has increased impermeable areas and thus the flood vulnerability in urban areas adger 2006 jongman 2018 son et al 2010 flooding is considered to be a dangerous disaster because it causes secondary socioeconomic damage such as electricity gas and water supply damage as well as problems related to rising water levels pachauri et al 2021 choi et al 2021 kim and kang 2021 bae and lee 2020 the socioeconomic damage caused by urban floods is a serious problem in the korean peninsula cho et al 2021 kang et al 2021 choi 2021 the summer rainy season in 2020 started on june 24 in the central region of the korean peninsula and ended on august 16 lasting a total of 54 days it was the longest rainy season since the start of korean meteorological observations in 1973 the average precipitation in korea during this period was 858 mm with the exception of jeju island which received 66 of the average annual rainfall of 1299 7 mm in korea mun et al 2020 lee et al 2020 in korea various policies have been established to solve water cycle distortions such as increased surface runoff reduced base runoff increased rainfall runoff and increased flow rates caused by impervious water surfaces to restore the water circulation the ministry of environment enacted the water management basic act and implemented a policy for integrated water resources management iwrm sim 2021 kang et al 2014 lee et al 2014 in addition the demand for improved water resources management in south korea is growing up due to the increase in population and the development of industries as of 2014 about 7 6 billion tons of water for domestic use 2 3 billion tons of water for industrial use and 15 2 billion tons of water for agricultural use were used annually the current water supply system however is insufficient for supplying living water therefore it is essential to adopt iwrm from the initial stage of rainwater runoff mun et al 2020 sim 2021 park 2018 in addition to korea developed countries such as germany canada singapore the united states and china are implementing policies for water circulation management and iwrm park 2018 china s sponge city urban construction

shuster et al 2010 khoo and guo 2017 dupras et al 2015 although various types of flood reduction technologies have been implemented the most commonly used technologies are low impact development lid and green infrastructure gi which contribute to the reduction of the impervious area of a city potschin et al 2016 faivre et al 2017 costa et al 2021 the lid and gi technologies have attracted attention as fundamental solutions to climate change as nature based solutions nbss kim 2020 jo 2020 woo and han 2020 in general nbss are widely regarded to be effective measures for urban flood risk areas based on which the environmental and economic benefits of the society can be enhanced by improving the service capacity of the ecosystem potschin et al 2016 faivre et al 2017 in korea many nbs based lid technologies have been implemented to reduce flooding and enhance socioeconomic benefits lee et al 2020 kim 2020 jo 2020 woo and han 2020 from a long term perspective it is essential to simulate and evaluate lid technology in response to flooding since 2017 developed countries such as sweden the united kingdom france and denmark have declared carbon neutrality net zero to reduce disasters such as heatwaves and floods that may occur due to climate change maes and jacobs 2017 tsiropoulos et al 2020 deutch 2020 recently korea announced a declaration and promotion strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 as well as domestic climate change adaptation policies in response to the carbon neutral era korea government 2020a 2020b nam 2021 it is very important to establish a scenario for each local government that responds to carbon neutrality in the adaptation plan for urban flooding which may occur due to climate change choi et al 2021 kim and kang 2021 bae and lee 2020 hurlimann et al 2021 knighton et al 2021 asdak and supian 2018 climate scenarios for establishing adaptation scenarios can be divided into the special report on emission scenario sres or representative concentration pathways rcps the most important precipitation scenario used in the model analysis is the rcp scenario of the korean peninsula climate change scenario there are two reasons for using the rcp scenario instead of the sres scenario in this study first the rcp scenario is a latest concept introduced in the ipcc 5th assessment report in 2013 and most recent studies used the rcp scenario the sres scenario was introduced in the ipcc third assessment report in 2001 second the rcp scenario reflects the latest changes in greenhouse gas concentration and the latest prediction model is used and the resolution is updated the sres scenario however calculates the climate change scenario after setting the greenhouse gas emission by socioeconomic type whereas the rcp scenario calculates the climate change scenario after setting the greenhouse gas concentration value and determines the greenhouse gas emission policy for each socioeconomic field as a countermeasure do pachauri et al 2021 the rcp scenarios can be divided into rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 here the rcp scenario number means radiative forcing in other words it means the degree of influence that changes the energy balance with greenhouse gases for example the radiative forcing of rcp 8 5 is 8 5 w m2 pachauri et al 2021 the definition of each rcp scenario is shown in table 2 pachauri et al 2021 choi et al 2021 kim and kang 2021 in most previous studies the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios were used to prepare for severe precipitation due to climate change however in this study the rcp 2 6 scenario was used for the flood reduction simulation to prepare for the 1 5 report of the international panel on climate change ipcc and 2050 net zero carbon the rcp 2 6 is a scenario which increases the likelihood that the level of global warming can be maintained below 2 c above preindustrial temperatures pachauri et al 2021 kim and kang 2021 the rcp scenarios are used as preemptive data to assess the number of disasters that can occur due to climate change pachauri et al 2021 kim and kang 2021 the aims of this study were to design a flood adaptation scenario that can be applied to carbon neutral scenarios by adopting a storm water management model swmm and analyzing its effects in this study simulation data based on the parameter optimization of eight types of lid controls provided in the epa swmm 5 1 version are provided which decision makers can use for the design of policies considering the location of the target site the lid controls that were optimized in this study include bioretention cells rain garden green roof infiltration trench permeable pavement rain barrel rooftop disconnection and vegetative swale bae and lee 2020 fassman beck and saleh 2021 lee and gil 2021 kim et al 2021 agency 2015 these are evidence based data that can be used by decision makers such as mayors or public officials to establish useful climate change adaptation policies for citizens finally the flood occurrence probability under scenario rcp 2 6 and the magnitude of disaster reduction based on the proposed lid scenario were determined 2 materials 2 1 target site analysis sangdo dong dongjak gu seoul was selected as target site for this study as explained in the introduction the rainy season continued for 54 days in 2020 in seoul and the socioeconomic damage was severe the target site seoul has the highest population density in korea and the cost of buildings and real estate is very high causing great socioeconomic damage in the event of a disaster koh and lee 2012 kim et al 2013b therefore it has been identified as the region in which adaptation policies should be introduced first in korea sangdo dong dongjak gu is classified as inland water disaster risk zone within seoul to prevent and reduce flood damage in all local governments e g metropolitan and self governing cities in the republic of korea a comprehensive plan for the reduction of storm and flood damage is established every five years seoul metropolitan city is considered to be an inland region that is floods are not caused by tidal waves the comprehensive plan mainly analyzes disasters caused by typhoons heavy rain strong winds and other similar natural phenomena seoul metropolitan government 2016 ministry of public administration and security 2018 in the comprehensive plan for flood reduction inland flood risk areas are selected in addition rainwater is concentrated on roads and low lying areas which therefore have been selected as risk zones for flooding it has been evaluated that the stormwater pipe capacity is insufficient kim et al 2013b seoul metropolitan government 2016 kim 2013 in the rcp climate change scenario in this study the future precipitation in sangdo dong is expected to significantly increase reaching larger values than the average value of seoul in particular in rcp 8 5 the rate of the increase in the precipitation in seoul in the second half of the 21st century 2071 2100 is 32 9 whereas that in dongjak gu is 35 5 indicating a very high probability of damage the scenario aims at minimizing the damage to dongjak gu by installing flood adaptation technology on an appropriate scale korea meteorological administration 2014 kim et al 2020a sangdo dong is located south of the han river in seoul and covers an area of 3 83 km2 longitude 126 94 126 98 latitude 37 48 37 49 accounting for 23 4 of the total area of 16 35 km2 in dongjak gu fig 1 based on the data provided by the national geographic information service operated by the ministry of land infrastructure and transport 85 of the buildings in sangdo dong are apartments houses and general buildings which are mainly residential areas the second largest number of facilities are neighborhood park facilities which can also be regarded as living facilities the next most common facilities are educational or nursing facilities considering that the policy to support the installation of lid facilities by local governments is targeted at residential areas the opportunity to install lid facilities sangdo dong is great korea national spatial data infrastructure potal 2021 fig 2 2 2 model 2 2 1 storm water management model in this study the epa swmm5 was used as runoff analysis program a model within the downtown area was built using network data provided by the seoul metropolitan government the epa swmm5 which was optimized for the drainage system model was determined to be an appropriate program the reason this study selected swmm 5 among many hydrology programs is that it has the advantage of facilitating complex modeling of gi and gray infrastructure because lid control options can be added agency 2015 in other words epa swmm5 implements lid pipe networks in the modeling which means that the effects of both lid and gray infrastructure e g drainage pipes are considered in the analyses in addition it has a function to adjust the parameters for optimization for each lid that is intended in this study and it also has good compatibility with arc map 10 5 and r in this study gis arcmap 10 5 r environmental statistical computing and graphic programs were used to construct and model a subwatershed in an area of 3 83 km2 the r program converts the file provided with a shp extension to one with an inp extension such that it can be run in epa swmm5 based on this method it is easy to input three dimensional 3d parameters leading to a more accurate resolution of the digital elevation model dem venables et al 2021 2 2 2 nonlinear reservoir model of the subcatchment the nonlinear reservoir runoff model used in epa swmm5 is mostly based on the continuity equation eq 1 refers to the variation in the depth of the water runoff that changes with time eq 1 includes precipitation and outflow occurring within the subcatchment and is based on the correlation between the precipitation inflow and outflow precipitation inflow includes rainfall and snowmelt and losses include water runoff evaporation losses and infiltration losses abi aad et al 2010 kim et al 2020b rossman and huber 2015 1 d x t i e f q where d x is the depth of the water runoff i is the rate of rainfall and snowmelt m s e is the surface evaporation m s f is the infiltration rate ft s and q is the runoff rate m s note that the fluxes i e f and q are the flow rates per unit area m s the runoff q of each subwatershed is derived from manning s equation 2 q 1 n s 1 2 r 2 3 a x where q is the outflow of the subcatchment m3 time n is manning s surface roughness coefficient s is the apparent or average slope of the subcatchment r is the hydraulic radius associated with the area m and a x is the cross sectional flow area based on substituting eq 2 into eq 3 q can be written as 3 q 1 n w s 1 2 d d s 5 3 and the flow per unit area of the subcatchment can be expressed as 4 q q a s 1 a s n w s 1 2 d d s 5 3 based on substituting this equation into the original mass balance relation in eq 1 5 d x t i e f α d d s 5 3 where α is defined as 6 α w s 1 2 a s n eq 5 is a general nonlinear differential equation which is numerically computed by epa swmm5 through iterations of discrete time steps assigned by the researcher using the time step options menu 2 3 adaptation technologies because epa swmm5 was used in this study the applicable lid technology was divided into eight types although the lid technology supported by epa swmm5 is limited to a total of eight technologies various types of technologies can be modeled by adjusting the parameters of each technology among the lid controls the green roof and rain garden functions were upgraded from version 5 1 001 on march 24 2014 the most recently added technology is rooftop disconnection the ability to model the roof runoff was added in version 5 1 008 on april 2 2015 agency 2015 table 3 shows the types of lid controls for which parameters were optimized in this study considering the location and situation of the target site 2 4 data 2 4 1 rainfall scenario carbon net zero rcp 2 6 with respect to precipitation data used in this study the korean peninsula climate change scenario rcp 2 6 was considered for a 10 year frequency the expected carbon dioxide concentration is 420 ppm in this scenario the temperature increases by about 2 c compared with the preindustrial level there are two reasons why this study adapted to the rcp 2 6 scenarios for modeling rainfall first the predicted precipitation scenario has an irregular distribution unlike the temperature distribution in the case of the seoul rcp 8 5 the maximum annual precipitation expected by 2100 is approximately 2169 mm in the rcp 2 6 scenario in which the carbon emission level is less than 50 it is estimated that 2134 mm of precipitation will fall by 2100 fig 3 considering that the average annual precipitation which has a significant effect on flooding is already maintained at a similar level it is necessary to design an urban flood countermeasure that can adapt to the rcp 2 6 scenario second in the rcp 2 6 scenario large scale flooding was predicted for the mid 2000 s around 2060 whereas such flooding was predicted for the late 2000 s around 2090 based on the rcp 8 5 scenario therefore a flood adaptation plan with a relatively high level of infrastructure construction should be required for the 2060 s rather than for the 2090 s rossman and huber 2017 korea meteorological administration 2018 the climate change scenario uses precipitation in units of days and peak precipitation in units of ten years the huff equation established in 1967 is used to simulate the daily climate change scenario in minutes the huff equation is nondimensional and provides the distribution of rainfall by statistically analyzing the rainfall records of illinois united states park et al 2008 the huff equation uses the third quartile equation which is officially used by the ministry of land infrastructure and transport of the republic of korea bonta and shahalam 2003 lee 2008 the coefficient used in the six dimensional huff equation is the rainfall time distribution created based on the empirical equation measured by the ministry of environment kim and kang 2021 ministry of environment 2019 as shown in eq 7 7 y 6 66094771241445 e 09 x 6 1 85645739064733 e 06 x 5 0 000191483251633836 x 4 0

rainfall duration for the climate change scenario was calculated to be 6 h however in this study the rainfall duration was calculated to be 3 h considering the laws and reports of the republic of korea the referenced data are reports used in flood planning such as the natural measures act seoul metropolitan city sewerage maintenance plan report and guidelines for establishing the sewerage maintenance basic plan published by the ministry of environment seoul metropolitan government 2019 ministry of environment 2020 korea national law information center 2021 table 4 is presented the 10 year frequency period with high precipitation the huff equation was used to analyze the precipitation for each climate change scenario according to the duration in a temporal distribution format 2 4 2 drain pipe network and road network data for the swmm construction implemented with lid pipe networks a map of the sewage pipe network around dongjak gu was provided by the seoul metropolitan government the database includes the geographic information system gis sewage facility layer file and database db design such as sewage pipelines and manholes around the site the database is the latest file built by seoul city in 2020 the dem data were built by seoul city in 2018 because no large scale civil works were carried out in seoul after 2018 the dem data continue until 2021 in large areas such as seoul it is common to build a dem with a resolution of 30 5 m vaze et al 2010 in this study the resolution of one grid was set to 10 m to allow for more accurate hydrologic analysis and model construction to simulate an appropriate type of lid control for the sangdo dong site it is necessary to establish a road network and building information because lid controls such as bioretention cells or permeable pavements can be installed depending on the cross sectional width of the road it is also essential to understand the spatial data because the scale of the lid controls such as the green roof rooftop disconnection and rain barrel may vary depending on the sizes of the building and catchment areas therefore the 2020 gis building integration information and standard node link provided by the korea national spatial data infrastructure portal open api of the ministry of land infrastructure and transport were downloaded and analyzed 3 methodology 3 1 workflow a schematic diagram of the workflow of this study is presented in fig 4 the broad framework can be divided into four stages that is historical hazard analysis model construction model application and results analysis during hazard analysis the past disaster history is analyzed a disaster is selected and the past flood history is explored this was mostly covered in the introduction and materials section the disasters to be adapted to are urban flood disasters in the model construction stage a model for hydrological analysis is created based on spatial information including dem and rainfall data programs such as arcmap swmmr and qgis are used to model large scale sites in the model application stage a scenario is constructed while changing two factors and a comparison with the baseline simulation is performed the two factors are changed to select the most suitable technology among the optimized lid controls the rcp 2 6 scenario examines the possibility of flood adaptation from 2030 to 2100 with a 10 year frequency the items that are finally evaluated include the reduced peak runoff runoff outflow volume and flood volume based on the results an expert discussion is conducted and conclusions are drawn 3 2 subcatchment generalization the model of the sangdo dong area established using arcgis and r is shown in fig 5 a total of 870 subwatersheds were modeled using sewage pipe network 2866 junctions were connected and 3027 conduits and two outlet outlets were constructed in general sewer conduits include both rectangular and round conduits with a diameter of 1000 mm bae and lee 2020 however in this study all pipe network files provided by the seoul metropolitan government were used to increase the accuracy the sewage conduit network is based on the 2020 file built by seoul metropolitan city which is the most recent file the shape length and depth of the conduit were displayed on the sewer network map arcmap version 10 5 was used to construct the slope and impervious area ratio of the site the average slope of the site is 6 9 and the impervious area ratio is 73 7 considering that the number of subwatersheds in previous studies is generally less than ten the swmm constructed in this study is very precise and detailed 3 3 optimal parameter research for lid controls the swmm includes dynamic analysis considering sewage networks and time series the parameters of the lid technology were optimized to create an optimal adaptation plan the parameter optimization is shown in fig 6 for each lid control parameter a value was obtained that can minimize flooding and is more economical compared with previous studies for example in a previous study a storage depth of the bioretention cell function of 300 mm was used for the simulation but it has not been proven that this value is the most economical and minimizes the flooding value by changing the parameter values we determined the most economical value that minimizes the total of the four values first the minimum value for peak flooding was obtained which is a critical value that directly affects urban flooding subsequently a value that minimizes the total flooding was determined and the surface runoff was optimized because lid parameters include values that cannot be artificially controlled such as the wilting point and conductivity expert advice and design are required finally among the optimized lid controls the most suitable technologies for the sangdo dong area were identified and the amount of flooding reduction corresponding to rcp 2 6 was evaluated 3 4 scenarios for spatial distribution of lid techniques among the eight technologies supported by epa swmm5 three technologies can be implemented in the sangdo dong area green roofs can be applied to the largest area in sangdo dong with many buildings and residential areas in addition permeable pavements and vegetative swales are applied to roads with large widths that is four or more lanes choi et al 2021 kim and kang 2021 the application width of permeable pavements was set to 1 5 m based on previous studies and the width of the vegetative swales was set to 0 5 m the applicable area for green roofs determined using arcgis is 1166 582 5 m2 which is approximately 30 5 of the total area the length of the road to which vegetative swales and permeable pavements can be applied within the site is 9890 m covering an area of 14 836 1 m2 0 4 and 4945 4 m2 0 13 respectively the master plan and cross sectional view of the sangdo dong area for the design based on the above mentioned conditions are shown in fig 7 and the applied scenarios are shown in table 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 lid optimization results the parameters of the three lid controls were optimized table 6 the parameters that affect the flooding and runoff of the green roof are the surface berm height vegetation volume soil thickness porosity field capacity wilting point conductivity conductivity slope suction head drainage mat thickness and void ratio fig 8 shows a comparison of the referenced parameter values and optimized values used in a previous study and the table shows the parameters of the lid controls applied to the scenario yeon et al 2015 choi et al 2020 optimized green roofs can reduce the peak flooding by 5 2 cubic meter per second cms 15 4 and total flooding by 11 0 cms 6 compared with previous studies fig 8 in the case of vegetative swales the peak flooding amount can be reduced by 8 4 cms 24 1 and the total flooding amount can be reduced by 9 16 cms 4 3 although permeable pavements do not affect the flooding head they can be economically designed by minimizing the soil height 4 2 effects of lid simulations on flood events in this study the runoff and flood characteristics obtained after the application of lid technologies to the entire watershed system with the same characteristics were investigated using swmm from the 2020 s to 2100 with a frequency of ten years however raw data were only provided for three cases 2070 s 2080 s and 2090 s for which the largest precipitation amounts were predicted table 7 first when analyzing the runoff which is affected the most by impermeability it was observed that the amount of runoff decreases proportional with the area installed in the subwatershed in scenario 4 in which only 0 13 of the lid area is occupied the peak and total runoff could be reduced by less than 1 in all cases on the other hand in scenario 8 the peak runoff could be reduced by 39 in all cases and the decrease in the total runoff ranged from 36 to 40 when referring to the case of the 2070 s the peak runoff of scenarios 1 and 8 is 47 5 cms and 28 82 cms respectively representing a reduction of 39 33 as shown in the fig 9 the peak flow occurred at 120 min and 10 min after 110 min when most of the precipitation fell resulting in a delay of 10 min in the case of flooding another evaluation factor the graph was drawn much more nonlinear than the runoff however the peak flooding and total flooding values which are the most important factors in urban flooding decreased at a certain rate interestingly even in scenario 4 which led to an insignificant reduction of the runoff amount the peak flooding could be reduced by up to 25 47 and the total flooding could be reduced by up to 14 77 in scenario 8 both peak and total flooding could be reduced by 55 60 figs 9 11 therefore it is important to not only evaluate the runoff but also the flooding value reflecting the interactions among lid pipe networks in previous studies in which only the runoff was evaluated the runoff was inferred based on the direct proportionality but this is problematic because flooding which also considers the discharge capacity of the conduit was not referred to the arrival time of peak flooding in the 2070 s insignificantly changed which is due to the fact that it occurred in the downtown area far from the river 4 3 discussion 4 3 1 hydrology the most difficult part of the urban flood disaster prevention simulation is the expression of the city s pipe networks and topography the urban pipe networks used for the simulation in this study are the most recent and are very meaningful in that they model the current situation in addition the statistical coding program r s add in r swmm was used for accurate modeling such as dem construction and impermeability calculation in previous studies the number of subwatersheds with similar areas was 10 whereas more than 800 subwatersheds were constructed along the pipe in this study therefore this model is suitable for urban flooding and its accuracy can be increased more by hydrology analysis the use of flooding with lid pipe networks as evaluation factors is the primary differentiation of this study in general for studies in which the hydrology is evaluated typically only the runoff is considered however because the runoff changes according to the impervious area ratio it decreases proportionally with increasing area on the other hand based on epa swmm5 flooding occurs when the depth of the node exceeds the maximum available water depth making the model a suitable evaluation system for urban flooding because it considers pipe networks still even better results can be obtained in the future by creating a small testbed and verifying the flooding value with full consideration of the pipe network 4 3 2 climate change scenario the most interesting aspect of this study is that the rcp 2 6 scenario is used as the precipitation scenario in most previous studies the rcp 8 5 scenario was used to adapt to very serious situations however as mentioned in this paper researchers must establish an adaptation plan and evidence based data that can respond to the net zero era in this work we explain why it is important to use the rcp 2 6 scenario instead of rcp 8 5 heavy rainfall is expected earlier in the case of the rcp 2 6 scenario among the precipitation forecasts up to 2100 as we approach the year 2100 society s infrastructure and disaster prevention technology will further develop therefore we are obligated to prepare for the rcp 2 6 scenario based on which very heavy rainfall is expected to occur earlier because urban flooding is related to one rainfall event it is also meaningful to compare the peak precipitation of the rcp 8 5 and rcp 2 6 scenarios this study is meaningful in that the precipitation was analyzed at a frequency of ten years among the climate change scenarios rcp 2 6 is based on a large amount of accumulated data however uncertainties with respect to climate change due to covid 19 social changes and social events are limitations that have been pointed out before a popular method to address these limitations is to view the scenario using a 10 year frequency studies to correct various scenarios and factors such as the precipitation are being conducted to reduce the uncertainty in climate change scenarios which will facilitate the development of more accurate data in the future 4 3 3 lid and gi the primary difference between this study and other studies is the parameter optimization in many previous studies it has not been clearly explained as to why or how the parameters utilized for the swmm were employed for hydrological analysis for example in several studies it was not specified which parameters were used for lid control this study in contrast determines the effects of several parameters on the two evaluated factors of flooding and runoff in addition during the application of lid controls locations were selected based on gis and clear criteria were used it is of advantage to not simply use lid controls but to clearly analyze the location at which the three technologies can be installed using a field visit 5 conclusion the aims of this study were to design a flood adaptation scenario that is applicable to carbon neutral scenarios by adopting a swmm and discuss its effects in this study the flooding reduction based on the application of lid controls to sangdo dong dongjak gu seoul which is a risk area for inland flooding was calculated to apply the net zero policy which has recently attracted attention a precipitation scenario based on the rcp 2 6 korean peninsula climate change scenario was implemented the significance of this study can be summarized as follows first a climate change scenario suitable for a carbon neutral era was used there is enough time for ecosystems and environments to return to the preindustrial status and fully recover even if carbon neutrality is realized immediately countless natural disasters will occur until the rainfall and temperature are restored in this study climate change adaptation that can be endured until full recovery is reached was analyzed second the lid control parameters were optimized interestingly in the case of lid scenario 4 which was the most inefficient although the runoff value was only reduced by 0 05 the flooding value could be reduced by up to 25 this demonstrates that it is important to not only evaluate the amount of runoff but also carry out dynamic analysis using lid pipe networks which include the pipe capacity and evapotranspiration scenario 8 was the most effective among all scenarios the results show that decision makers should make appropriate decisions with respect to the lid installation policy according to the budget and size of the project third evidence based data were provided to policymakers to create an overall plan in preparation for urban flooding decision makers will be able to refer to this thesis when selecting the appropriate technology for the city in which they wish to implement their policies manuals and guidelines can be developed that can be applied to each local government and national level in the future in addition the design of lid controls was carried out by conducting gis analysis and field visits necessary for the selection of sites for technology installation however this study has two limitations the first is the uncertainty with respect to climate change climate change can change any time either due to human activities or large scale events in other words it is important to develop an evidence based disaster reduction plan and design using data with minimal uncertainty the second limitation is that the social infrastructure might change in particular in the case of manholes or sewage pipe networks which have a large effect on urban flooding large scale construction is carried out every 30 years and small scale facilities are added and removed due to changes in buildings therefore a social change pattern and modeling method that reflects it must be established addressing the above mentioned two

for negotiating operational compromises that are both efficient and socially inclusive moreover even though the performance of the planned infrastructure is expected to decline in the future under

associated with future climate socio economic and technological projections adds an extra layer of complexity to the development of long term water resources planning strategies herman et al 2020 the performance of a decision made now strongly depends on the uncertain conditions that will unfold in the future mcphail et al 2018 recently several approaches have been proposed to identify robust solutions with respect to a large ensemble of deeply uncertain future conditions i e whose probabilities are not known nor widely agreed upon herman et al 2015 despite some methodological differences in their implementation these approaches share two common goals i to identify robust solutions to deeply uncertain external factors and ii to discover the critical scenarios under which designed solutions can no longer satisfy minimum performance levels in this paper we investigate the potential for a participatory decision analytic framework in designing economically efficient ecologically sustainable and socially inclusive river basin development pathways under current and projected hydroclimatic and socio economic conditions our framework is demonstrated for the omo river lake turkana basin otb shared by ethiopia and kenya lake turkana is an endorheic lake in the kenyan rift valley its northern end extends into ethiopia close to the delta of the omo river which contributes most of the lake inflow volume as part of the ethiopian energy security strategy a number of dams are either operational or under construction along the omo river zaniolo et al 2021a yet hydropower development in the basin is impacting several water related sectors both in ethiopia and kenya yielding social and international tensions the economist 2016 zaniolo et al 2021b besides in the coming years large scale agricultural production projects dependent on irrigation will be implemented in the lower omo region avery and eng 2012 since the beginning of the dafne project 1 1 dafne decision analytic framework to explore the water energy food nexus in complex transboundary water resource systems of fast developing countries http dafne project eu local stakeholders belonging to a wide range of public and private institutions as well as to civil society organizations have been involved in a series of negotiation simulation labs nsls a safe environment where participants had the opportunity to simulate a negotiation process and jointly discuss potential solutions enabling the building of trust and social learning while operating with integrity and transparency exercising neutrality and employing conflict resolution when needed lumosi 2020 in the first nsl meeting we interacted with several stakeholders from different sectors to identify candidate interventions and elicit their sectoral interests these were later formalized into a selection of candidate development pathways and associated assessment indicators our definition of a pathway is a combination of structural and non structural actions that generate alternative adaptation options to climatic and socio economic changes haasnoot et al 2012 a set of efficient pathways was then extracted from this candidate selection by optimizing the coordinated operation of water infrastructures in the otb with respect to the multiple assessment indicators the resulting solutions were discussed in a second nsl meeting that identified a small set of negotiated solutions among the efficient pathways as having the most interesting inter sectoral trade offs finally the analysis of the latter was complemented by testing their robustness against a wide range of future uncertainties reflecting potential changes in both river flow regimes and water demands for irrigated agriculture designing development pathways and assessing their sustainability across multiple sectors and over a range of infrastructural options and future climates goes beyond the scope of traditional cost benefit analysis methods which typically only focus on one infrastructure one stakeholder and current hydrological conditions instead the employed state of the art robust multi objective reinforcement learning based optimization methods offer a computationally tractable approach to embed the system complexity and multi stakeholder preferences in a comprehensive computational framework other than eliciting stakeholders experience part of the scope of the nsls was to familiarize them with our models and build trust around the computational methods applied in summary this paper provides two main contributions a decision analytic framework integrating several state of the art approaches including the analysis of model based and synthetic scenarios that are often considered as alternative and mutually exclusive options and a demonstration of this integration in the omo turkana case study where the active collaboration with local stakeholders enabled the co production of relevant policy outcomes related to the discovery of multisectoral synergies tradeoffs and future vulnerabilities in this basin for prioritizing investments in projects the paper is organized as follows the next section introduces the omo turkana basin section 3 describes the participatory decision analytic framework including stakeholders engagement and participation development of the otb model for assessing the performance of candidate development pathways generation of future scenarios accounting for plausible and uncertain changes in both climate i e precipitation temperature and streamflow and irrigation demands modeling results and analysis are reported and discussed in sections 4 and 5 while final remarks are presented in the last section 2 the omo turkana basin in 1996 the ethiopian government presented a master plan woodroofe 1996 for developing the omo basin and exploiting its large hydropower potential by constructing the gibe cascade table 1 a series of infrastructures complementing the already existing gibe i dam 180 mw and including gibe ii hydropower plant 420 mw gibe iii dam 1870 mw gibe iv dam 1470 mw and gibe v dam 560 mw in 2016 the construction of a new mega dam named koysha started in place of the originally planned gibe iv and v which will add an installed capacity of 2200 mw to the cascade in addition in the coming years the lower omo region is to be exploited for large scale agricultural production in two separate districts table 2 with about 175 000 ha designated for irrigated sugar cane plantations recently reduced to 100 000 ha and about 80 000 ha for private commercial irrigated agriculture avery and eng 2012 while the ethiopian development strategy of becoming a significant exporter of energy and food in east africa in the short to medium term zaniolo et al 2021a can be justified due to the accessibility of natural resources in the country it is not clear whether the long term sustainability of this strategy has been comprehensively assessed against current and future changes in climate and society these infrastructures are already impacting several water related sectors in ethiopia and their downstream neighbor kenya yielding social and international tensions the artificial regulation of the river can alter the hydrology of the lower omo characterized by a late summer streamflow peak that overflows the riverbanks and supports crucial ecosystem services and food production strategies in the region among them the streamflow peak enables flood recession agriculture practiced by nomadic or semi nomadic tribes fertilizes livestock grazing land nourishes wetlands and generates spawning areas for fish there are also increasing concerns that the projected abstraction of river water for irrigation agriculture would lead to a significant and permanent drop in the lake turkana level with negative impacts for the local populations that depend on the lake services especially in terms of fish yields avery 2013 while no central body exists for the governance of the shared watercourse of the otb gibson and yihdego 2021 the environmental and social impact assessment conducted for gibe iii did consider transboundary impacts and proposed a number of mitigation measures eepco 2009 such measures included the maintenance of a minimum flow release to meet the ecological requirements of the omo and to mimic seasonal flooding with greater water release however due to the lack of discharge data from gibe iii it is unclear whether any of these mitigation measures have yet been adopted 3 methods and tools building on castelletti and soncini sessa 2006 as part of the dafne project we developed a participatory decision analytic framework to guide the development and selection of future pathways reconciling diverse water uses in the basin engagement with ethiopian and kenyan stakeholders from different sectors see supplementary material including water and ecosystems energy food socio economy and governance began at the outset of the project using an actor analysis based on the approach proposed by hermans 2005 this procedure ensured good coverage of all sectors in the aforementioned negotiation simulation labs as described in detail in melenhorst et al 2018 three nsls involving approximately 20 stakeholders from ethiopia and kenya were held annually between 2017 and 2019 in an initial nsl sectoral interests were translated into a selection of candidate development pathways and led to the co development of a suite of evaluation indicators to allow the comparative assessment of alternative pathways with respect to the interests of each group of stakeholders soncini sessa et al 2007 the elaborated pathways include the construction of the koysha dam and the development of two large scale agricultural districts along with the coordinated operations of the reservoirs cascade and the irrigation diversions a set of efficient pathways was subsequently designed by optimizing the otb system operations for a subset of the evaluation indicators suggested by the stakeholders called design indicators selected as representative of the main stakeholders interests the resulting solutions were then negotiated in a second nsl meeting in which the stakeholders were involved in the simulation of an interactive negotiation exercise that identified a small set of compromise solutions no formal decisions were taken as the participants had no official mandate with the exercise intended as a demonstration of the methodology finally the analysis of the latter was complemented by testing their robustness against a wide range of future uncertainties about the potential changes in both flow regimes and irrigation demands according to matalas and fiering 1977 a robust pathway is a solution that is as insensitive as possible to a large degree of uncertainty in the inputs and assumptions and therefore able to ensure robust performance across multiple plausible futures generally represented by an ensemble of climate i e precipitation temperature and streamflow and socio economic scenarios i e irrigation demands the robustness of the efficient pathways is evaluated against a first ensemble of scenarios obtained following a scenario led approach wilby and dessai 2010 which relies on a cascade of models from global representative concentration pathways moss et al 2010 to local hydrologic conditions we considered both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in order to capture the large uncertainties characterizing the future evolution of the climate system besides following the taxonomy for robustness frameworks suggested by herman et al 2015 our analysis also includes the generation of a second larger ensemble of synthetic scenarios which is used to complement the analysis of robustness and identify via scenario discovery the most critical drivers under which the system is expected to fail i e a pathway does not meet pre specified performance criteria the results discussed in a third nsl meeting eventually allowed the identification of possible development pathways able to address the multisectoral tradeoff in the basin while sustaining a robust performance under changing climate and society 3 1 stakeholders participation the participatory approach adopted in dafne entailed that candidate actions which represent the building blocks of the candidate pathways as well as evaluation and designed indicators were identified collaboratively during the nsls which represented a safe environment to facilitate interactions between local stakeholders and project partners local stakeholders possess deep knowledge and understanding of the multisectoral dynamics in the otb which complemented the technical expertise of project partners in modeling the system and the different interests impacted by the pathways under evaluation the first nsl see fig 1 represented the starting point for the process of identification of the candidate actions and evaluation indicators which was structured in 4 steps 1 an interactive mapping exercise was run to identify issues related to the diverse stakeholders interests single out actions able to solve or influence the identified issues and collect proposals of relevant evaluation indicators able to measure the effects of these actions 2 the outcomes of the mapping exercise were structured into tables reporting all the issues actions and evaluation indicators identified grouped according to different sectorial interests e g energy food etc 3 contents of the tables were subsequently elaborated through an iterative process driven by criteria of relevance for the specific otb context and feasibility with respect to available data and modeling tools these elaborations also included the selection of a subset of evaluation indicators called design indicators to be used for the design of efficient pathways this process took part both in presence and remotely involved dafne partners and local stakeholders and was supported by a number of participatory tools developed within the project 4 a consolidated list of evaluation and design indicators candidate actions and pathways was eventually defined and shared online with all stakeholders to be available for further references and ensure the possibility of continuous exchange of related comments and information the following set of design indicators which can be used as objective functions in designing the efficient pathways using the system model described in section 3 2 were selected from the list of evaluation indicators hydropower production jhp gwh year maximization of the mean annual hydropower production at the basin level i e the cumulative production of all the power plants environment in the omo

the lower omo valley orange line in fig 2 fish in lake turkana jf mt minimization of the deviation of annual fish biomass in lake turkana under a given pathway with respect to natural conditions the adopted worst case formulation is motivated by the observation that several indigenous communities resort to fishing exclusively in exceptionally dry years when other survival strategies fail to provide sustenance according to gownaris et al 2017 the fish biomass is estimated from the daily trajectories simulated by the model as a function of the average lake turkana water level in the previous year and the amplitude of lake level oscillation in the current year between dry season january august and wet season september december irrigation ji minimization of the average deficit of irrigation water at the basin scale computed by aggregating the normalized deficits occurring in the two irrigation districts i e kuraz sugar plantation and private commercial agriculture the deficit is computed using the values of irrigation demand from table 2 in the analysis conducted under observed conditions while demand projections see section 3 3 and supplementary fig s3 are considered for testing the robustness of the efficient pathways 3 2 the otb model the otb model is a conceptual model composed of the following building blocks see fig 3 three artificial reservoirs with associated hydropower plants namely gibe i gi gibe iii giii and koysha k the gibe ii gii hydropower plant that is connected to gi through a diversion tunnel two irrigation districts i e kuraz sugar plantation and private commercial agriculture lake turkana t and all the river stretches connecting these elements artificial reservoirs and lake turkana dynamics are modeled through a mass balance equation of the corresponding water storage using a daily time step s t 1 gi s t gi q t 1 gi e t gi a t gi r t 1 gi s t 1 giii s t giii q t 1 giii e t giii a t giii r t 1 giii s t 1 k s t k q t 1 k e t k a t k r t 1 k s t 1 t s t t q t 1 delta q t 1 turkw q t 1 ker e t t a t t where s t i i gi giii k t is the water storage in the i th reservoir and lake turkana at the beginning of day t while q t 1 i r t 1 i e t i a t i are the inflow to the reservoir the volume of water released including spills and the water evaporated in the time interval t t 1 respectively in particular e t i is the average daily evaporation rate computed according to the equation proposed by priestley and taylor 1972 and a t i is the reservoir surface area uniquely defined for each reservoir and the lake by a non linear storage surface area relation given s t i seepage losses are considered negligible in the adopted notation the time subscript of a variable indicates the instant when its value is deterministically known the release of the j th artificial reservoir j gi giii k is defined as r t 1 j f s t j u t j q t 1 j e t j where f describes the non linear relation between the release decision u t j determined by a candidate operating policy as a function of a vector of inputs such as reservoirs storage and the actual release r t 1 j soncini sessa et al 2007 the actual release at the end of the time interval is generally equal to the release decision unless physical constraints prohibit it for instance because of the activation of the spillways lake turkana instead is an endorheic lake therefore the only outgoing water is due to evaporation it is worth mentioning that the model does not include the turkwel dam as its operation is independent of the strategy adopted for managing dams and irrigation diversion along the omo river moreover the only indicator potentially impacted by this dam operation is the fish in lake turkana which however depends on the average annual lake level and its associated seasonal variations that are minimally affected by the turkwel dam operation given the limited reservoir capacity and the limited annual streamflow compared to the ones along the omo river according to the daily time step adopted in the model the river reaches are modeled as plug flow canals in which the velocity and direction of flow are constant everywhere without any routing effect transit lag times from gibe i to gibe iii 3 days gibe iii to koysha 6 days and koysha to lake turkana 12 days are estimated as the average time required by the water to transit between the two points the inflows from the gilgel gibe omo gojeb turkwel kerio rivers and the lateral contributions upstream and downstream of koysha were estimated using the topkapi eth model a spatially distributed hydrological model that extends the original topkapi rainfall runoff model of liu and todini 2002 by adding several additional model components topkapi eth performs a spatial and temporal representation of the main hydrological processes at the basin scale spatial heterogeneity is represented by discretizing the domain with a regular grid of 1 km2 of resolution while the temporal dynamics are characterized at a daily time step the model inputs are daily values of precipitation from the trimm 3b42 archive huffman et al 2007 and model reanalysis temperature and cloud cover records from merra 2 reichle et al 2017 due to the limited availability of observed flow records in the catchment the model calibration followed a two stage process first a calibration was carried out against the abelti gauging station in the upper reaches of the omo catchment downstream of the gibe i dam this was to develop some confidence in the flows modeled in respect of the timing of response to rainfall and recession behaviors the second phase of model calibration was to calibrate the model parameters most affecting the catchment water balance to achieve a good representation of the daily historical levels of lake turkana as observed by satellite altimetry cretaux et al 2011 the comparison of observed and simulated levels of lake turkana is reported in the supplementary fig s1 the correlation between modeled and observed levels is 0 93 while the rmse of the lake levels is 0 34 m all investigated development pathways for the otb include the planned construction of both the koysha dam and the large scale agricultural districts still they differ depending on the overall operations of the network of dams i e gibe i gibe iii and koysha and the two irrigation diversions the strategies determining the coordinated operations of the system are modeled as a closed loop operating policy castelletti et al 2008 in the absence of publically available operating rules and considering that all dams are controlled by the ethiopian electric power corporation we assumed that the optimal coordinated operation is a plausible representation of a rational policy that the could be implemented for operating the system when the construction of koysha dam will be completed such policy determines the dam release decisions as a function of the storage in each of the three reservoirs along with the sine and cosine of the day number of the year to capture the seasonality of the inflows as well as of the environmental and flood recession flow requirements specifically this policy is defined as a non linear approximating network using gaussian radial basis functions with five inputs i e sine and cosine day of the year and three reservoir storages 9 gaussian bases and 3 outputs i e releases from gibe i gibe iii and koysha for a total of 120 policy parameters in addition the diversion channels that abstract water from the main omo river to provide irrigation to the two agricultural districts are regulated according to two non linear hedging rules celeste and billib 2009 which allows diverting into the irrigation canals less water than their corresponding demands to compensate for downstream users each hedging rule depends on 2 additional parameters formally the set of pareto approximate operating policies p θ is then generated by solving the following multi objective optimal control problem p θ argj j hp j e j r j f j i where the policy parameters are searched in the decision space θ θ and the problem is constrained by the system s dynamics this problem is solved via evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps giuliani et al 2016 a reinforcement learning approach that combines direct policy search non linear approximating networks and multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas the advantage of using emodps against other optimal control methods giuliani et al 2021 is the possibility of designing the coordinated control across multiple reservoirs alleviating the well known curse of dimensionality giuliani et al 2018 moreover emodps enables the computation of an approximation of the pareto front in a single run of the algorithm which supports the exploration of multidimensional trade offs between conflicting objectives giuliani et al 2014 to perform the optimization we use the borg moea hadka and reed 2013 which has been shown to be highly robust in solving multi objective optimal control problems zatarain salazar et al 2016 each optimization was run for 2 million function evaluations to improve solution diversity and avoid dependence on randomness the final set of pareto optimal policies is obtained as the set of nondominated solutions identified from 10 random optimization trials in total the 20 million simulations required around 1600 computing hours each optimization run was parallelized over 128 processing cores of the cube cluster of cornell university a 512 processing cores system with a 120 terabyte terascale file system 3 3 future scenarios the model based generation of future scenarios blue box in fig 1 produced an ensemble of 600 scenarios obtained as the cartesian product of 60 climate projections and 10 irrigation demand scenarios for the two considered representative concentration pathways rcps namely rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 a 30 member ensemble of climate scenarios over the period 2020 2100 is generated via stochastic downscaling of the climate trajectories simulated by different combinations of general circulation models gcms and regional circulation models rcms to refine the coarse spatial resolution of gcms and rcms as well as to obtain an ensemble that includes the internal climate variability in addition to the general changes from the climate models which would not be represented by a single run of the climate models fatichi et al 2016 specifically factors of change are estimated by comparing the climate variables simulated by the 22 members ensemble of rcm gcm models i e 10 gcms and 6 rcms but not all combinations are available over the historical control period 1976 2005 with seven 30 year time windows of projected climate simulated by the same climate models in time blocks from 2010 to 2039 through to 2070 2099 the estimated factors of change are then applied to the stochastic simulations of the historical climate produced by the awe gen 2d model peleg et al 2017 a two dimensional downscaling weather generator to generate an ensemble of future climate realizations including precipitation near surface air temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity at the same space and time scales of the stochastic weather generator peleg et al 2019 the median change in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration based on the penman monteith formulation allen et al 1998 computed over the 30 member ensemble produced by awe gen 2d between 1976 2005 and 2070 2099 time periods under the rcp8 5 is reported in supplementary fig s2 subsequently 30 realizations of the daily streamflow sequences for each of the two rcps were generated using the topkapi eth model by combining downscaled precipitation and evapotranspiration ensembles future irrigation demand scenarios were generated by simulating planned irrigation schemes using the aquacrop model steduto et al 2009 using the projected precipitation and temperature trajectories for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 along with soil characteristics from isric soil grids default crop parameters assuming a 45 and a 58 irrigation efficiency these reference values for irrigation efficiency are obtained by combining conveyance efficiency and field application efficiency provided by brouwer et al 1989 the resulting trajectories of irrigation demands were then synthetically perturbed using scaling factors i e 5 and 10 to include a wider range of plausible future irrigation abstractions to account for model errors and uncertainty in input data and assumptions the generated ensemble of irrigation demand scenarios is reported in supplementary fig s3 as a cyclostationary mean for 2020 2099 to exhaustively and uniformly explore the drivers space for informing the scenario discovery analysis we complemented the ensemble of model based scenarios described in the previous section with a new synthetically generated ensemble of 15 000 scenarios red box in fig 1 according to the methodology originally introduced by quinn et al 2018 the future inflows are produced using a synthetic streamflow generator that explores changes in several statistics of streamflow abundance and timing starting from daily observed streamflow time series it produces correlated synthetic daily streamflow series at multiple sites assuming stationarity in hydrologic processes the goal of this first step is to artificially expand the historical observational dataset by generating statistically equivalent data for a more in depth exploration of the natural processes variability secondly a non stationary generator is employed to alter the synthetic series imposing trends on historical climate including monthly varying mean and standard deviation multipliers in addition changes in streamflow timings are generated by applying time varying multipliers to fourier series fitted to the historical log space monthly mean flows finally the future agricultural water demands are generated via global sampling of scaling factors within a range of 30 with respect to the historical values this large ensemble of scenarios is then used to perform scenario discovery through the patient rule induction method friedman and fisher 1999 a data mining technique that has been adopted in many recent robust decision making studies e g trindade et al 2017 to identify critical ranges of uncertain drivers where system failures are likely to occur prim returns alternative sub sets of scenarios delimited by failure boxes that are identified by maximizing two conflicting metrics i density i e the ratio of the number of cases of failures inside a candidate box to the total number of scenarios inside that box and ii coverage i e the ratio of the number of failures inside a candidate box to the total number of failures in the entire ensemble of scenarios in an interactive process prim suggests alternative candidate boxes that lie on a pareto optimal surface described by the two metrics from which the users can navigate the trade off curve to select a specific result for more details see bryant and lempert 2010 4 results 4 1 trade off analysis the performance of each pathway is estimated via simulation of the otb model over the historical horizon 2002 2016 the performance of the pareto efficient solutions is depicted in fig 4 each line in the parallel axes plot represents the performance of one pathway across the different design indicators represented by the 5 vertical axes namely hydropower environment recession fish and irrigation the indicator values are normalized between 0 and 1 where the values equal to 0 and 1 correspond to worst and best performance over the set of pathways respectively as indicated by the upward preference arrow e g hydropower 0 means that the pathway has an average production of 632 92 gw h y whereas hydropower 1 corresponds to a pathway with an average production of 873 18 gw h y a horizontal line laying at the top of the graph would thus correspond to a pathway that fully satisfies all stakeholders however such a solution is unattainable for the system given the presence of conflicts among water uses designated as diagonal lines between two adjacent axes lines are colored by the environment indicator measuring the deviation of the simulated flow in the omo delta under a given pathway with respect to the natural regime with a color scale that ranges from green best solution to purple worst solution results show a clear conflict between hydropower and irrigation on the one hand and environment recession agriculture and fish on the other almost parallel lines in the uppermost portion of the environment recession agriculture and fish axes show that solutions preserving the environment in the omo delta green lines are generally good also in terms of recession agriculture and fish in lake turkana as all these indicators tend to restore the natural flow conditions conversely the best hydropower production and irrigation supply pathways are purple lines scattered in the center and lower region of the environment axis notably the sharpest conflict is between irrigation and fish indicators the water abstracted and consumed for irrigation no longer contributes to lake turkana inflows negatively impacting the ecosystems supporting fish reproduction lastly hydropower and irrigation do not seem to conflict indicating that the system appears well designed for maximizing the economic return of the water resources in the basin at the same time the costs of this solution for the environment and local activities in the lower omo region are expected to be significant and largely overlooked by traditional planning procedures that often fail to address the trade off between economic development and long term sustainability despite the existence of conflicts the abundance of efficient pathways reported in fig 4 i e 848 alternative solutions represents a rich context for supporting the identification of compromise solutions during the 2nd nsl meeting stakeholders from different countries and sectors analyzed the whole volume of options to converge toward one compromise solution they were involved in an interactive session in which they simulated a negotiation exercise iteratively filtering the set of pathways and eventually identified a set of six negotiated solutions notably the iterative process leading to the selection of interesting alternatives during the negotiation substantially reduced the risks of producing unbalanced outcomes due to the existing variability of stakeholders economic importance and political relevance because this strategy ultimately simulates different power dynamics among sectors without assuming necessarily reproducing the real one however kleinschroth et al 2021 examined potential power dynamics using the concept of narratives and concluded that such underlying narratives should be explicitly accounted for in stakeholder engagements in the rest of the paper we will focus on one of these negotiated solutions selecting the compromise pathway which provides the most balanced trade off across all the five design indicators see the bold black line in fig 4 this stakeholders negotiated pathway produces the indicator values reported in table 3 which also includes the best and worst values of the design indicators as a reference consistently with the visual analysis in fig 4 we can notice that this pathway performs very well i e top 1 of the solutions in terms of recession agriculture with an annual streamflow deficit equal to 87 m3 s against a target requirement to practice recession agriculture of 16 800 m3 s thus ensuring more than 99 of the considered target this pathway is in the top 20 of solutions for both environment and fish as it provides about 70 of the natural water flow regime in the omo delta and 6 8 m tonnes of fish in lake turkana i e 85 of the yield in natural conditions the performance in terms of hydropower is relatively good namely in the top 30 of the designed pathways the estimated average production of 8578 6 gw h y could satisfy 86 of the total ethiopian energy use in 2017 i e 10 tw h international energy agency 2019 assuming electricity is used for internal consumption lastly irrigation is the indicator with the lowest performance with a value of normalized deficit that is 45 higher than the best possible performance in this indicator 4 2 robustness analysis to evaluate the potential vulnerabilities of the 848 efficient pathways illustrated in fig 4 to changes in climate and socio economic conditions we ran a monte carlo simulation of the otb model for all these alternative pathways over the 600 member ensemble of model based generated scenarios see section 3 3 fig 5 provides a synthesis of the outputs of these 508 800 simulations by computing the empirical cumulative density function ecdf of the pathway performance across the five design indicators in the plot the vertical axis reports the fraction of plausible futures that achieves or exceeds the performance level shown on the horizontal axis hence the worst value of each indicator is achieved or exceeded in 100 of scenarios and the best value only for one scenario this strategy allows exploration of a multidimensional satisfying surface a posteriori rather than specifying acceptable performance thresholds a priori bertoni et al 2019 in all subplots the different lines are fairly close to each other indicating a contained variability across different pathways on the contrary the difference between a given pathway s best and worst performance spans a much larger range this implies that when system operation is designed to be efficient under a given scenario the uncertainty in the future performance is largely driven by the projected socio economic and climatic conditions the shape of the ecdf denotes the robustness of the performance against future uncertainties convex ecdfs e g hydropower recession irrigation are associated with large vulnerabilities where a small increase in performance on the x axis implies a large drop on the y axis in the percentage of futures under which that performance level is attained or exceeded conversely sigmoidal shapes e g fish environment indicate the presence of a tipping point in future conditions that turns the performance from robust to vulnerable in fig 5 we highlight the ecdf of the stakeholders negotiated pathway orange line and the most robust pathways for the different indicators using different colors for each indicator the most robust pathway is defined as the one resulting in the minimum performance degradation with respect to the stakeholders negotiated pathway in 75 of the considered futures in other words the robust pathway is the one that for a large number of futures minimizes the regret associated with a projected performance degradation the 75 threshold was selected as a compromise between a risk neutral approach which would have searched for a minimum regret over 50 of future scenarios and a completely risk averse behavior which would have searched a minimum regret over 100 scenarios as visible from the figure for a given indicator the robust pathway is the uppermost solution in correspondence to the 75 tick on the vertical axis marked with a dashed black line to further investigate the difference between the robust and stakeholders negotiated pathways introduced in fig 5 we contrast the cyclostationary trajectories of gibe iii and koysha levels simulated over the historical horizon 2002 2016 this comparative analysis can support the identification of good practices in reservoir operation that are expected to be robust against a broad range of future conditions results in fig 6 show that reservoirs levels should be kept fairly low to ensure robust performance in terms of recession agriculture and fish in lake turkana allowing a recharge period between may to august to accumulate water which is released during the following months of september and october the robust strategy according to the other indicators instead maintains the koysha level high and close to the maximum operating level upper black dashed line for all pathways while the gibe iii reservoir is variable 4 3 scenario discovery in this section we present the results of the scenario discovery analysis conducted via the patient rule induction method with the aim of identifying the most critical conditions under which the system is expected to fail for this analysis we focus on the stakeholders negotiated pathway bold line in fig 4 which was simulated over the 15 000 members ensemble of synthetically generated scenarios see section 3 3 each of these scenarios is then characterized in terms of relative deviations in average low 10th percentile and high 90th percentile streamflow magnitude with respect to the historical conditions moreover changes in the northern upstream gibe iii and southern downstream gibe iii parts of the basin are considered separately to include a spatial dimension in the analysis finally deviations in the water demands for both the kuraz sugar plantation and the private agricultural district are also included the prim analysis was carried out independently for each design indicator setting a failure threshold equal to the 25th percentile of the simulated future performance here we report the results related to hydropower and environment as representative of the two antagonist interests in the system see fig 4 it is worth mentioning that prim produces a set of results trading off coverage and density here we report the results obtained by choosing the knee point of the pareto front traced by coverage and density the scenario discovery results are illustrated in fig 7 as a scatterplot mapping each future scenario as a point in a bidimensional space where red points indicate failures i e the performance of the pathway is below the failure threshold and blue points indicate successes i e the performance of the pathway exceeds the failure threshold the axes of the scatterplot are the most relevant drivers of future performance identified by the prim algorithm deviations in the average and high flows in the northern part of the basin are selected as the most important drivers for hydropower production as they determine the water volumes entering the cascade of dams for the environment indicator our results suggest the failure conditions will be primarily driven by alterations in both the northern and southern sub basins the black box superimposed on the scatterplots delimits the critical range of values of the two drivers that consistently corresponds to a failure interestingly the results related to hydropower left panel show that while the critical deviations in average flows x axis are all negative i e from 10 to 65 reductions in the case of changes in high flow y axis the system is expected to fail also under slightly positive deviations which are likely related to the frequent occurrence of dam spillages the results for the environment indicator right panel show that the relevant drivers of change are the deviations in the average streamflow in the northern δnorth avg and southern δsouth avg sub basins with the critical changes that are different for the two drivers not surprisingly flow reductions in both the northern and southern sub basins are considered critical as they will reduce most of the natural contribution to the flow in the delta not captured by the reservoirs in addition prim considers an increase in the average flow in the northern part of the basin as potentially critical for the environment this result may be explained by the fact that increasing inflows to gibe iii and koysha reservoirs can result in a more frequent activation of the spillways that produce large and sudden water releases downstream which can be highly disturbing for the ecosystems adapted to the natural hydrology 5 discussion our results discover more than 800 alternative strategies for operating the system that differently reconcile the competing water demands and uses in the otb the trade off analysis conducted over these solutions shows that hydropower and irrigation are not particularly conflicting which suggests that similarly to other african systems giuliani et al 2022 alexander et al 2020 basheer et al 2021 the dams and irrigation schemes are well designed from the perspective of these primary water uses the sharpest conflict emerges between irrigation supply and fish production in lake turkana emphasizing the transboundary issue of the basin as the irrigated areas are in ethiopia whereas the majority of lake turkana is in kenya this finding is in line with the results from avery and tebbs 2018 which emphasizes the risks for lake turkana induced by large water abstractions for irrigation supply interestingly the stakeholders negotiated pathway indicates a slight preference for fish at the expense of irrigation our interpretation of this result is related to the fact that large scale irrigation is something that in the context of our analysis does not exist yet so every solution is somehow better than the historical situation while other sectors like fish or environment have their historical reference negatively impacted by the majority of the considered pathways this pathway indeed attains a performance in the top 20 of the solutions set for environment recession and fish primarily at the cost of a performance in terms of irrigation deficit close to 45 of best feasible solution along with a 70 gwh y reduction in hydropower production this result is not surprising as a good performance in terms of environment recession and fish requires a streamflow regime close to the natural conditions in the lower omo which can be obtained by limiting the water diversion especially to the kuraz sugar plantation the practical implementation of this solution would entail reducing the extent of the irrigation district or increasing the fraction of fallow land within the district a recommendation that is similar to the ones suggested by hodbod et al 2019 the possibility of implementing this pathway is however controversial as the original investments described in the master plan were largely motivated by the expansion of hydropower and irrigated agriculture additional efforts are likely needed to identify an implementable solution with a better performance in terms of hydropower and irrigation possibly introducing additional mitigation options for reducing the negative impacts of this alternative solution on the other stakeholders the fact that the nsl was clearly framed as a simulation exercise likely encouraged participants to explore solutions with low political acceptability but potentially interesting some stakeholders indicate that a possible way to resolve the strong trade off between irrigation and fish can be favoring the practices of aquaculture in the omo delta to reduce the dependency on natural fish yields in lake turkana in addition increasing the access to small scale irrigation pumps for the communities relying on flood recession agriculture can contribute to enhancing the acceptability of a more hydropower inclined solution further studies are however needed to assess the social implications of these interventions for the pastoralist communities living the lower omo valley amos et al 2021 the second part of our analysis shows that the performance of the considered pathways is expected to degrade under the considered ensemble of future scenarios with large vulnerabilities in terms of hydropower production recession agriculture and water supply for irrigation the scenario discovery performed over a larger ensemble of 15 000 synthetically generated scenarios provides valuable insights about the main sources of vulnerability of the system changes in streamflow in the northern basin emerge as the most critical for the system as a whole while reductions in streamflow in the south of the basin are generally less relevant probably because they carry much lower volumes of water compared to the northern flows over the next years stakeholders and decision makers should therefore carefully monitor the evolution of the upper part of the basin particularly with respect to the existing projects for expanding small scale irrigated agriculture in that area avery and tebbs 2018 which could substantially decrease the water volumes flowing into the southern part of the basin a limitation in the presented results is the simplified representation of some key hydrological processes in the omo river delta particularly in terms of evaporation losses occurring when floodwater spreads over the floodplain or flow returns from the irrigated areas these simplifications influence the simulated water balance in the delta with respect to the role of irrigation abstractions against the evaporation losses in natural conditions however we expect return flow to play a minor role because the irrigation policy is designed to meet the irrigation demands required for optimal agricultural yield another simplification of our model is related to the use of average travel times along the river stretches impacting the assessment of both environment and recession agriculture all these assumptions have been resolved in the dafne project which also produced a high fidelity assessment of selected pathways obtained by re simulating them using the topkapi eth model yet the computational requirements of this model prevent its use in large monte carlo simulations and robustness analysis ultimately making the above simplifications unavoidable for the present study furthermore our results do not account for the dams contribution related to flood protection as this aspect was not raised by our stakeholders during the nsl dedicated to the definition of assessment indicators it is worth remarking that while dams designed for flood protection typically include a flood buffer zone this latter is not present in either gibe iii or koysha thus suggesting this aspect is likely secondary with respect to the role of hydropower production 6 conclusions in this paper we describe the implementation of a participatory decision analytic framework for promoting water related development pathways that are efficient socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable the application of this approach in the omo turkana basin enabled the exploration of multisectoral trade offs across the main stakeholders impacted by the ongoing hydropower and agricultural expansion projects in the basin including indigenous recession agriculture ecosystem services in the lower omo and fish yield in lake turkana moreover we assessed the robustness of these alternative development pathways across a broad array of plausible climate and socio economic futures overall the pathway negotiated by the stakeholders during the negotiation simulation labs represents a good compromise across all competing interests with relevant degradation of performance only for irrigated agriculture moreover it attains a medium level of robustness when exposed to the uncertainty of future scenarios this solution which recommends keeping a large buffer in gibe iii to handle the future inflow variability while keeping koysha close to its full supply level see fig 6 emerges as a promising balanced solution to address the multisectoral trade offs across multiple uncertain futures these findings suggest that our participatory decision analytic framework provides stakeholders and decision makers with a rich context for better understanding complex multisector dynamics and for prioritizing investments in projects the extensive trade off analysis investigating alternative operations of the system suggests there is space for enhancing the flexibility and the adaptive capacity of the basin without the need for additional infrastructural upgrades and associated financial outlays finally our results show how facilitating the negotiation of compromise solutions balancing diverse and competing indicators could contribute to increasing the system resilience under changing climate and society to ensure the correct interpretation of the simulated outputs and a common understanding across all stakeholder groups we recommend planning dedicated training sessions to acquire the necessary competencies funding

7998,study region omo turkana basin trans boundary basin between ethiopia and kenya north eastern africa study focus significant investments in large dams have been mobilized in the omo turkana basin to expand hydropower and support extensive irrigation projects assessing the impacts of these infrastructures particularly on local stakeholders constitutes a crucial foundation for socially inclusive as well as environmentally and economically sustainable development this study showcases the potential of a participatory decision analytic framework in investigating the impacts of alternative development pathways on competing stakeholders interests in the omo turkana basin to support strategic planning under both current and projected hydroclimatic and socio economic conditions the optimal operation of the planned system expansion including the current and future dam cascade and the irrigation projects is investigated to provide insights into multisectoral trade offs five main sectors with competing interests are considered hydropower production environmental protection indigenous recession agriculture fish yield in lake turkana and large scale commercial irrigated agriculture new hydrological insights for the region results show that the planned infrastructure can negatively impact local stakeholders particularly in terms of fish yields in lake turkana still a potential exists for negotiating operational compromises that are both efficient and socially inclusive moreover even though the performance of the planned infrastructure is expected to decline in the future under changing climate and irrigation demands this can be mitigated by timely implementing robust solutions triggered by the alterations of streamflows in the northern part of the basin graphical abstract

performance of a decision made now strongly depends on the uncertain conditions that will unfold in the future mcphail et al 2018 recently several approaches have been proposed to identify robust solutions with respect to a large ensemble of deeply uncertain future conditions i e whose probabilities are not known nor widely agreed upon herman et al 2015 despite some methodological differences in their implementation these approaches share two common goals i to identify robust solutions to deeply uncertain external factors and ii to discover the critical scenarios under which designed solutions can no longer satisfy minimum performance levels in this paper we investigate the potential for a participatory decision analytic framework in designing economically efficient ecologically sustainable and socially inclusive river basin development pathways under current and projected hydroclimatic and socio economic conditions our framework is demonstrated for the omo river lake turkana basin otb shared by ethiopia and kenya lake turkana is an endorheic lake in the kenyan rift valley its northern end extends into ethiopia close to the delta of the omo river which contributes most of the lake inflow volume as part of the ethiopian energy security strategy a number of dams are either operational or under construction along the omo river zaniolo et al 2021a yet hydropower development in the basin is impacting several water related sectors both in ethiopia and kenya yielding social and international tensions the economist 2016 zaniolo et al 2021b besides in the coming years large scale agricultural production projects dependent on irrigation will be implemented in the lower omo region avery and eng 2012 since the beginning of the dafne project 1 1 dafne decision analytic framework to explore the water energy food nexus in complex transboundary water resource systems of fast developing countries http dafne project eu local stakeholders belonging to a wide range of public and private institutions as well as to civil society organizations have been involved in a series of negotiation simulation labs nsls a safe environment where participants had the opportunity to simulate a negotiation process and jointly discuss potential solutions enabling the building of trust and social learning while operating with integrity and transparency exercising neutrality and employing conflict resolution when needed lumosi 2020 in the first nsl meeting we interacted with several stakeholders from different sectors to identify candidate interventions and elicit their sectoral interests these were later formalized into a selection of candidate development pathways and associated assessment indicators our definition of a pathway is a combination of structural and non structural actions that generate alternative adaptation options to climatic and socio economic changes haasnoot et al 2012 a set of efficient pathways was then extracted from this candidate selection by optimizing the coordinated operation of water infrastructures in the otb with respect to the multiple assessment indicators the resulting solutions were discussed in a second nsl meeting that identified a small set of negotiated solutions among the efficient pathways as having the most interesting inter sectoral trade offs finally the analysis of the latter was complemented by testing their robustness against a wide range of future uncertainties reflecting potential changes in both river flow regimes and water demands for irrigated agriculture designing development pathways and assessing their sustainability across multiple sectors and over a range of infrastructural options and future climates goes beyond the scope of traditional cost benefit analysis methods which typically only focus on one infrastructure one stakeholder and current hydrological conditions instead the employed state of the art robust multi objective reinforcement learning based optimization methods offer a computationally tractable approach to embed the system complexity and multi stakeholder preferences in a comprehensive computational framework other than eliciting stakeholders experience part of the scope of the nsls was to familiarize them with our models and build trust around the computational methods applied in summary this paper provides two main contributions a decision analytic framework integrating several state of the art approaches including the analysis of model based and synthetic scenarios that are often considered as alternative and mutually exclusive options and a demonstration of this integration in the omo turkana case study where the active collaboration with local stakeholders enabled the co production of relevant policy outcomes related to the discovery of multisectoral synergies tradeoffs and future vulnerabilities in this basin for prioritizing investments in projects the paper is organized as follows the next section introduces the omo turkana basin section 3 describes the participatory decision analytic framework including stakeholders engagement and participation development of the otb model for assessing the performance of candidate development pathways generation of future scenarios accounting for plausible and uncertain changes in both climate i e precipitation temperature and streamflow and irrigation demands modeling results and analysis are reported and discussed in sections 4 and 5 while final remarks are presented in the last section 2 the omo turkana basin in 1996 the ethiopian government presented a master plan woodroofe 1996 for developing the omo basin and exploiting its large hydropower potential by constructing the gibe cascade table 1 a series of infrastructures complementing the already existing gibe i dam 180 mw and including gibe ii hydropower plant 420 mw gibe iii dam 1870 mw gibe iv dam 1470 mw and gibe v dam 560 mw in 2016 the construction of a new mega dam named koysha started in place of the originally planned gibe iv and v which will add an installed capacity of 2200 mw to the cascade in addition in the coming years the lower omo region is to be exploited for large scale agricultural production in two separate districts table 2 with about 175 000 ha designated for irrigated sugar cane plantations recently reduced to 100 000 ha and about 80 000 ha for private commercial irrigated agriculture avery and eng 2012 while the ethiopian development strategy of becoming a significant exporter of energy and food in east africa in the short to medium term zaniolo et al 2021a can be justified due to the accessibility of natural resources in the country it is not clear whether the long term sustainability of this strategy has been comprehensively assessed against current and future changes in climate and society these infrastructures are already impacting several water related sectors in ethiopia and their downstream neighbor kenya yielding social and international tensions the artificial regulation of the river can alter the hydrology of the lower omo characterized by a late summer streamflow peak that overflows the riverbanks and supports crucial ecosystem services and food production strategies in the region among them the streamflow peak enables flood recession agriculture practiced by nomadic or semi nomadic tribes fertilizes livestock grazing land nourishes wetlands and generates spawning areas for fish there are also increasing concerns that the projected abstraction of river water for irrigation agriculture would lead to a significant and permanent drop in the lake turkana level with negative impacts for the local populations that depend on the lake services especially in terms of fish yields avery 2013 while no central body exists for the governance of the shared watercourse of the otb gibson and yihdego 2021 the environmental and social impact assessment conducted for gibe iii did consider transboundary impacts and proposed a number of mitigation measures eepco 2009 such measures included the maintenance of a minimum flow release to meet the ecological requirements of the omo and to mimic seasonal flooding with greater water release however due to the lack of discharge data from gibe iii it is unclear whether any of these mitigation measures have yet been adopted 3 methods and tools building on castelletti and soncini sessa 2006 as part of the dafne project we developed a participatory decision analytic framework to guide the development and selection of future pathways reconciling diverse water uses in the basin engagement with ethiopian and kenyan stakeholders from different sectors see supplementary material including water and ecosystems energy food socio economy and governance began at the outset of the project using an actor analysis based on the approach proposed by hermans 2005 this procedure ensured good coverage of all sectors in the aforementioned negotiation simulation labs as described in detail in melenhorst et al 2018 three nsls involving approximately 20 stakeholders from ethiopia and kenya were held annually between 2017 and 2019 in an initial nsl sectoral interests were translated into a selection of candidate development pathways and led to the co development of a suite of evaluation indicators to allow the comparative assessment of alternative pathways with respect to the interests of each group of stakeholders soncini sessa et al 2007 the elaborated pathways include the construction of the koysha dam and the development of two large scale agricultural districts along with the coordinated operations of the reservoirs cascade and the irrigation diversions a set of efficient pathways was subsequently designed by optimizing the otb system operations for a subset of the evaluation indicators suggested by the stakeholders called design indicators selected as representative of the main stakeholders interests the resulting solutions were then negotiated in a second nsl meeting in which the stakeholders were involved in the simulation of an interactive negotiation exercise that identified a small set of compromise solutions no formal decisions were taken as the participants had no official mandate with the exercise intended as a demonstration of the methodology finally the analysis of the latter was complemented by testing their robustness against a wide range of future uncertainties about the potential changes in both flow regimes and irrigation demands according to matalas and fiering 1977 a robust pathway is a solution that is as insensitive as possible to a large degree of uncertainty in the inputs and assumptions and therefore able to ensure robust performance across multiple plausible futures generally represented by an ensemble of climate i e precipitation temperature and streamflow and socio economic scenarios i e irrigation demands the robustness of the efficient pathways is evaluated against a first ensemble of scenarios obtained following a scenario led approach wilby and dessai 2010 which relies on a cascade of models from global representative concentration pathways moss et al 2010 to local hydrologic conditions we considered both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in order to capture the large uncertainties characterizing the future evolution of the climate system besides following the taxonomy for robustness frameworks suggested by herman et al 2015 our analysis also includes the generation of a second larger ensemble of synthetic scenarios which is used to complement the analysis of robustness and identify via scenario discovery the most critical drivers under which the system is expected to fail i e a pathway does not meet pre specified performance criteria the results discussed in a third nsl meeting eventually allowed the identification of possible development pathways able to address the multisectoral tradeoff in the basin while sustaining a robust performance under changing climate and society 3 1 stakeholders participation the participatory approach adopted in dafne entailed that candidate actions which represent the building blocks of the candidate pathways as well as evaluation and designed indicators were identified collaboratively during the nsls which represented a safe environment to facilitate interactions between local stakeholders and project partners local stakeholders possess deep knowledge and understanding of the multisectoral dynamics in the otb which complemented the technical expertise of project partners in modeling the system and the different interests impacted by the pathways under evaluation the first nsl see fig 1 represented the starting point for the process of identification of the candidate actions and evaluation indicators which was structured in 4 steps 1 an interactive mapping exercise was run to identify issues related to the diverse stakeholders interests single out actions able to solve or influence the identified issues and collect proposals of relevant evaluation indicators able to measure the effects of these actions 2 the outcomes of the mapping exercise were structured into tables reporting all the issues actions and evaluation indicators identified grouped according to different sectorial interests e g energy food etc 3 contents of the tables were subsequently elaborated through an iterative process driven by criteria of relevance for the specific otb context and feasibility with respect to available data and modeling tools these elaborations also included the selection of a subset of evaluation indicators called design indicators to be used for the design of efficient pathways this process took part both in presence and remotely involved dafne partners and local stakeholders and was supported by a number of participatory tools developed within the project 4 a consolidated list of evaluation and design indicators candidate actions and pathways was eventually defined and shared online with all stakeholders to be available for further references and ensure the possibility of continuous exchange of related comments and information the following set of design indicators which can be used as objective functions in designing the efficient pathways using the system model described in section 3 2 were selected from the list of evaluation

the lower omo valley orange line in fig 2 fish in lake turkana jf mt minimization of the deviation of annual fish biomass in lake turkana under a given pathway with respect to natural conditions the adopted worst case formulation is motivated by the observation that several indigenous communities resort to fishing exclusively in exceptionally dry years when other survival strategies fail to provide sustenance according to gownaris et al 2017 the fish biomass is estimated from the daily trajectories simulated by the model as a function of the average lake turkana water level in the previous year and the amplitude of lake level oscillation in the current year between dry season january august and wet season september december irrigation ji minimization of the average deficit of irrigation water at the basin scale computed by aggregating the normalized deficits occurring in the two irrigation districts i e kuraz sugar plantation and private commercial agriculture the deficit is computed using the values of irrigation demand from table 2 in the analysis conducted under observed conditions while demand projections see section 3 3 and supplementary fig s3 are considered for testing the robustness of the efficient pathways 3 2 the otb model the otb model is a conceptual model composed of the following building blocks see fig 3 three artificial reservoirs with associated hydropower plants namely gibe i gi gibe iii giii and koysha k the gibe ii gii hydropower plant that is connected to gi through a diversion tunnel two irrigation districts i e kuraz sugar plantation and private commercial agriculture lake turkana t and all the river stretches connecting these elements artificial reservoirs and lake turkana dynamics are modeled through a mass balance equation of the corresponding water storage using a daily time step s t 1 gi s t gi q t 1 gi e t gi a t gi r t 1 gi s t 1 giii s t giii q t 1 giii e t giii a t giii r t 1 giii s t 1 k s t k q t 1 k e t k a t k r t 1 k s t 1 t s t t q t 1 delta q t 1 turkw q t 1 ker e t t a t t where s t i i gi giii k t is the water storage in the i th reservoir and lake turkana at the beginning of day t while q t 1 i r t 1 i e t i a t i are the inflow to the reservoir the volume of water released including spills and the water evaporated in the time interval t t 1 respectively in particular e t i is the average daily evaporation rate computed according to the equation proposed by priestley and taylor 1972 and a t i is the reservoir surface area uniquely defined for each reservoir and the lake by a non linear storage surface area relation given s t i seepage losses are considered negligible in the adopted notation the time subscript of a variable indicates the instant when its value is deterministically known the release of the j th artificial reservoir j gi giii k is defined as r t 1 j f s t j u t j q t 1 j e t j where f describes the non linear relation between the release decision u t j determined by a candidate operating policy as a function of a vector of inputs such as reservoirs storage and the actual release r t 1 j soncini sessa et al 2007 the actual release at the end of the time interval is generally equal to the release decision unless physical constraints prohibit it for instance because of the activation of the spillways lake turkana instead is an endorheic lake therefore the only outgoing water is due to evaporation it is worth mentioning that the model does not include the turkwel dam as its operation is independent of the strategy adopted for managing dams and irrigation diversion along the omo river moreover the only indicator potentially impacted by this dam operation is the fish in lake turkana which however depends on the average annual lake level and its associated seasonal variations that are minimally affected by the turkwel dam operation given the limited reservoir capacity and the limited annual streamflow compared to the ones along the omo river according to the daily time step adopted in the model the river reaches are modeled as plug flow canals in which the velocity and direction of flow are constant everywhere without any routing effect transit lag times from gibe i to gibe iii 3 days gibe iii to koysha 6 days and koysha to lake turkana 12 days are estimated as the average time required by the water to transit between the two points the inflows from the gilgel gibe omo gojeb turkwel kerio rivers and the lateral contributions upstream and downstream of koysha were estimated using the topkapi eth model a spatially distributed hydrological model that extends the original topkapi rainfall runoff model of liu and todini 2002 by adding several additional model components topkapi eth performs a spatial and temporal representation of the main hydrological processes at the basin scale spatial heterogeneity is represented by discretizing the domain with a regular grid of 1 km2 of resolution while the temporal dynamics are characterized at a daily time step the model inputs are daily values of precipitation from the trimm 3b42 archive huffman et al 2007 and model reanalysis temperature and cloud cover records from merra 2 reichle et al 2017 due to the limited availability of observed flow records in the catchment the model calibration followed a two stage process first a calibration was carried out against the abelti gauging station in the upper reaches of the omo catchment downstream of the gibe i dam this was to develop some confidence in the flows modeled in respect of the timing of response to rainfall and recession behaviors the second phase of model calibration was to calibrate the model parameters most affecting the catchment water balance to achieve a good representation of the daily historical levels of lake turkana as observed by satellite altimetry cretaux et al 2011 the comparison of observed and simulated levels of lake turkana is reported in the supplementary fig s1 the correlation between modeled and observed levels is 0 93 while the rmse of the lake levels is 0 34 m all investigated development pathways for the otb include the planned construction of both the koysha dam and the large scale agricultural districts still they differ depending on the overall operations of the network of dams i e gibe i gibe iii and koysha and the two irrigation diversions the strategies determining the coordinated operations of the system are modeled as a closed loop operating policy castelletti et al 2008 in the absence of publically available operating rules and considering that all dams are controlled by the ethiopian electric power corporation we assumed that the optimal coordinated operation is a plausible representation of a rational policy that the could be implemented for operating the system when the construction of koysha dam will be completed such policy determines the dam release decisions as a function of the storage in each of the three reservoirs along with the sine and cosine of the day number of the year to capture the seasonality of the inflows as well as of the environmental and flood recession flow requirements specifically this policy is defined as a non linear approximating network using gaussian radial basis functions with five inputs i e sine and cosine day of the year and three reservoir storages 9 gaussian bases and 3 outputs i e releases from gibe i gibe iii and koysha for a total of 120 policy parameters in addition the diversion channels that abstract water from the main omo river to provide irrigation to the two agricultural districts are regulated according to two non linear hedging rules celeste and billib 2009 which allows diverting into the irrigation canals less water than their corresponding demands to compensate for downstream users each hedging rule depends on 2 additional parameters formally the set of pareto approximate operating policies p θ is then generated by solving the following multi objective optimal control problem p θ argj j hp j e j r j f j i where the policy parameters are searched in the decision space θ θ and the problem is constrained by the system s dynamics this problem is solved via evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps giuliani et al 2016 a reinforcement learning approach that combines direct policy search non linear approximating networks and multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas the advantage of using emodps against other optimal control methods giuliani et al 2021 is the possibility of designing the coordinated control across multiple reservoirs alleviating the well known curse of dimensionality giuliani et al 2018 moreover emodps enables the computation of an approximation of the pareto front in a single run of the algorithm which supports the exploration of multidimensional trade offs between conflicting objectives giuliani et al 2014 to perform the optimization we use the borg moea hadka and reed 2013 which has been shown to be highly robust in solving multi objective optimal control problems zatarain salazar et al 2016 each optimization was run for 2 million function evaluations to improve solution diversity and avoid dependence on randomness the final set of pareto optimal policies is obtained as the set of nondominated solutions identified from 10 random optimization trials in total the 20 million simulations required around 1600 computing hours each optimization run was parallelized over 128 processing cores of the cube cluster of cornell university a 512 processing cores system with a 120 terabyte terascale file system 3 3 future scenarios the model based generation of future scenarios blue box in fig 1 produced an ensemble of 600 scenarios obtained as the cartesian product of 60 climate projections and 10 irrigation demand scenarios for the two considered representative concentration pathways rcps namely rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 a 30 member ensemble of climate scenarios over the period 2020 2100 is generated via stochastic downscaling of the climate trajectories simulated by different combinations of general circulation models gcms and regional circulation models rcms to refine the coarse spatial resolution of gcms and rcms as well as to obtain an ensemble that includes the internal climate variability in addition to the general changes from the climate models which would not be represented by a single run of the climate models fatichi et al 2016 specifically factors of change are estimated by comparing the climate variables simulated by the 22 members ensemble of rcm gcm models i e 10 gcms and 6 rcms but not all combinations are available over the historical control period 1976 2005 with seven 30 year time windows of projected climate simulated by the same climate models in time blocks from 2010 to 2039 through to 2070 2099 the estimated factors of change are then applied to the stochastic simulations of the historical climate produced by the awe gen 2d model peleg et al 2017 a two dimensional downscaling weather generator to generate an ensemble of future climate realizations including precipitation near surface air temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity at the same space and time scales of the stochastic weather generator peleg et al 2019 the median change in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration based on the penman monteith formulation allen et al 1998 computed over the 30 member ensemble produced by awe gen 2d between 1976 2005 and 2070 2099 time periods under the rcp8 5 is reported in supplementary fig s2 subsequently 30 realizations of the daily streamflow sequences for each of the two rcps were generated using the topkapi eth model by combining downscaled precipitation and evapotranspiration ensembles future irrigation demand scenarios were generated by simulating planned irrigation schemes using the aquacrop model steduto et al 2009 using the projected precipitation and temperature trajectories for both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 along with soil characteristics from isric soil grids default crop parameters assuming a 45 and a 58 irrigation efficiency these reference values for irrigation efficiency are obtained by combining conveyance efficiency and field application efficiency provided by brouwer et al 1989 the resulting trajectories of irrigation demands were then synthetically perturbed using scaling factors i e 5 and 10 to include a wider range of plausible future irrigation abstractions to account for model errors and uncertainty in input data and assumptions the generated ensemble of irrigation demand scenarios is reported in supplementary fig s3 as a cyclostationary mean for 2020 2099 to exhaustively and uniformly explore the drivers space for informing the scenario discovery analysis we complemented the ensemble of model based scenarios described in the previous section with a new synthetically generated ensemble of 15 000 scenarios red box in fig 1 according to the methodology originally introduced by quinn et al 2018 the future inflows are produced using a synthetic streamflow generator that explores changes in several statistics of streamflow abundance and timing starting from daily observed streamflow time series it produces correlated synthetic daily streamflow series at multiple sites assuming stationarity in hydrologic processes the goal of this first step is to artificially expand the historical observational dataset by generating statistically equivalent data for a more in depth exploration of the natural processes variability secondly a non stationary generator is employed to alter the synthetic series imposing trends on historical climate including monthly varying mean and standard deviation multipliers in addition changes in streamflow timings are generated by applying time varying multipliers to fourier series fitted to the historical log space monthly mean flows finally the future agricultural water demands are generated via global sampling of scaling factors within a range of 30 with respect to the historical values this large ensemble of scenarios is then used to perform scenario discovery through the patient rule induction method friedman and fisher 1999 a data mining technique that has been adopted in many recent robust decision making studies e g trindade et al 2017 to identify critical ranges of uncertain drivers where system failures are likely to occur prim returns alternative sub sets of scenarios delimited by failure boxes that are identified by maximizing two conflicting metrics i density i e the ratio of the number of cases of failures inside a candidate box to the total number of scenarios inside that box and ii coverage i e the ratio of the number of failures inside a candidate box to the total number of failures in the entire ensemble of scenarios in an interactive process prim suggests alternative candidate boxes that lie on a pareto optimal surface described by the two metrics from which the users can navigate the trade off curve to select a specific result for more details see bryant and lempert 2010 4 results 4 1 trade off analysis the performance of each pathway is estimated via simulation of the otb model over the historical horizon 2002 2016 the performance of the pareto efficient solutions is depicted in fig 4 each line in the parallel axes plot represents the performance of one pathway across the different design indicators represented by the 5 vertical axes namely hydropower environment recession fish and irrigation the indicator values are normalized between 0 and 1 where the values equal to 0 and 1 correspond to worst and best performance over the set of pathways respectively as indicated by the upward preference arrow e g hydropower 0 means that the pathway has an average production of 632 92 gw h y whereas hydropower 1 corresponds to a pathway with an average production of 873 18 gw h y a horizontal line laying at the top of the graph would thus correspond to a pathway that fully satisfies all stakeholders however such a solution is unattainable for the system given the presence of conflicts among water uses designated as diagonal lines between two adjacent axes lines are colored by the environment indicator measuring the deviation of the simulated flow in the omo delta under a given pathway with respect to the natural regime with a color scale that ranges from green best solution to purple worst solution results show a clear conflict between hydropower and irrigation on the one hand and environment recession agriculture and fish on the other almost parallel lines in the uppermost portion of the environment recession agriculture and fish axes show that solutions preserving the environment in the omo delta green lines are generally good also in terms of recession agriculture and fish in lake turkana as all these indicators tend to restore the natural flow conditions conversely the best hydropower production and irrigation supply pathways are purple lines scattered in the center and lower region of the environment axis notably the sharpest conflict is between irrigation and fish indicators the water abstracted and consumed for irrigation no longer contributes to lake turkana inflows negatively impacting the ecosystems supporting fish reproduction lastly hydropower and irrigation do not seem to conflict indicating that the system appears well designed for maximizing the economic return of the water resources in the basin at the same time the costs of this solution for the environment and local activities in the lower omo region are expected to be significant and largely overlooked by traditional planning procedures that often fail to address the trade off between economic development and long term sustainability despite the existence of conflicts the abundance of efficient pathways reported in fig 4 i e 848 alternative solutions represents a rich context for supporting the identification of compromise solutions during the 2nd nsl meeting stakeholders from different countries and sectors analyzed the whole volume of options to converge toward one compromise solution they were involved in an interactive session in which they simulated a negotiation exercise iteratively filtering the set of pathways and eventually identified a set of six negotiated solutions notably the iterative process leading to the selection of interesting alternatives during the negotiation substantially reduced the risks of producing unbalanced outcomes due to the existing variability of stakeholders economic importance and political relevance because this strategy ultimately simulates different power dynamics among sectors without assuming necessarily reproducing the real one however kleinschroth et al 2021 examined potential power dynamics using the concept of narratives and concluded that such underlying narratives should be explicitly accounted for in stakeholder engagements in the rest of the paper we will focus on one of these negotiated solutions selecting the compromise pathway which provides the most balanced trade off across all the five design indicators see the bold black line in fig 4 this stakeholders negotiated pathway produces the indicator values reported in table 3 which also includes the best and worst values of the design indicators as a reference consistently with the visual analysis in fig 4 we can notice that this pathway performs very well i e top 1 of the solutions in terms of recession agriculture with an annual streamflow deficit equal to 87 m3 s against a target requirement to practice recession agriculture of 16 800 m3 s thus ensuring more than 99 of the considered target this pathway is in the top 20 of solutions for both environment and fish as it provides about 70 of the natural water flow regime in the omo delta and 6 8 m tonnes of fish in lake turkana i e 85 of the yield in natural conditions the performance in terms of hydropower is relatively good namely in the top 30 of the designed pathways the estimated average production of 8578 6 gw h y could satisfy 86 of the total ethiopian energy use in 2017 i e 10 tw h international energy agency 2019 assuming electricity is used for internal consumption lastly irrigation is the indicator with the lowest performance with a value of normalized deficit that is 45 higher than the best possible performance in this indicator 4 2 robustness analysis to evaluate the potential vulnerabilities of the 848 efficient pathways illustrated in fig 4 to changes in climate and socio economic conditions we ran a monte carlo simulation of the otb model for all these alternative pathways over the 600 member ensemble of model based generated scenarios see section 3 3 fig 5 provides a synthesis of the outputs of these 508 800 simulations by computing the empirical cumulative density function ecdf of the pathway performance across the five design indicators in the plot the vertical axis reports the fraction of plausible futures that achieves or exceeds the performance level shown on the horizontal axis hence the worst value of each indicator is achieved or exceeded in 100 of scenarios and the best value only for one scenario this strategy allows exploration of a multidimensional satisfying surface a posteriori rather than specifying acceptable performance thresholds a priori bertoni et al 2019 in all subplots the different lines are fairly close to each other indicating a contained variability across different pathways on the contrary the difference between a given pathway s best and worst performance spans a much larger range this implies that when system operation is designed to be efficient under a given scenario the uncertainty in the future performance is largely driven by the projected socio economic and climatic conditions the shape of the ecdf denotes the robustness of the performance against future uncertainties convex ecdfs e g hydropower recession irrigation are associated with large vulnerabilities where a small increase in performance on the x axis implies a large drop on the y axis in the percentage of futures under which that performance level is attained or exceeded conversely sigmoidal shapes e g fish environment indicate the presence of a tipping point in future conditions that turns the performance from robust to vulnerable in fig 5 we highlight the ecdf of the stakeholders negotiated pathway orange line and the most robust pathways for the different indicators using different colors for each indicator the most robust pathway is defined as the one resulting in the minimum performance degradation with respect to the stakeholders negotiated pathway in 75 of the considered futures in other words the robust pathway is the one that for a large number of futures minimizes the regret associated with a projected performance degradation the 75 threshold was selected as a compromise between a risk neutral approach which would have searched for a minimum regret over 50 of future scenarios and a completely risk averse behavior which would have searched a minimum regret over 100 scenarios as visible from the figure for a given indicator the robust pathway is the uppermost solution in correspondence to the 75 tick on the vertical axis marked with a dashed black line to further investigate the difference between the robust and stakeholders negotiated pathways introduced in fig 5 we contrast the cyclostationary trajectories of gibe iii and koysha levels simulated over the historical horizon 2002 2016 this comparative analysis can support the identification of good practices in reservoir operation that are expected to be robust against a broad range of future conditions results in fig 6 show that reservoirs levels should be kept fairly low to ensure robust performance in terms of recession agriculture and fish in lake turkana allowing a recharge period between may to august to accumulate water which is released during the following months of september and october the robust strategy according to the other indicators instead maintains the koysha level high and close to the maximum operating level upper black dashed line for all pathways while the gibe iii reservoir is variable 4 3 scenario discovery in this section we present the results of the scenario discovery analysis conducted via the patient rule induction method with the aim of identifying the most critical conditions under which the system is expected to fail for this analysis we focus on the stakeholders negotiated pathway bold line in fig 4 which was simulated over the 15 000 members ensemble of synthetically generated scenarios see section 3 3 each of these scenarios is then characterized in terms of relative deviations in average low 10th percentile and high 90th percentile streamflow magnitude with respect to the historical conditions moreover changes in the northern upstream gibe iii and southern downstream gibe iii parts of the basin are considered separately to include a spatial dimension in the analysis finally deviations in the water demands for both the kuraz sugar plantation and the private agricultural district are also included the prim analysis was carried out independently for each design indicator setting a failure threshold equal to the 25th percentile of the simulated future performance here we report the results related to hydropower and environment as representative of the two antagonist interests in the system see fig 4 it is worth mentioning that prim produces a set of results trading off coverage and density here we report the results obtained by choosing the knee point of the pareto front traced by coverage and density the scenario discovery results are illustrated in fig 7 as a scatterplot mapping each future scenario as a point in a bidimensional space where red points indicate failures i e the performance of the pathway is below the failure threshold and blue points indicate successes i e the performance of the pathway exceeds the failure threshold the axes of the scatterplot are the most relevant drivers of future performance identified by the prim algorithm deviations in the average and high flows in the northern part of the basin are selected as the most important drivers for hydropower production as they determine the water volumes entering the cascade of dams for the environment indicator our results suggest the failure conditions will be primarily driven by alterations in both the northern and southern sub basins the black box superimposed on the scatterplots delimits the critical range of values of the two drivers that consistently corresponds to a failure interestingly the results related to hydropower left panel show that while the critical deviations in average flows x axis are all negative i e from 10 to 65 reductions in the case of changes in high flow y axis the system is expected to fail also under slightly positive deviations which are likely related to the frequent occurrence of dam spillages the results for the environment indicator right panel show that the relevant drivers of change are the deviations in the average streamflow in the northern δnorth avg and southern δsouth avg sub basins with the critical changes that are different for the two drivers not surprisingly flow reductions in both the northern and southern sub basins are considered critical as they will reduce most of the natural contribution to the flow in the delta not captured by the reservoirs in addition prim considers an increase in the average flow in the northern part of the basin as potentially critical for the environment this result may be explained by the fact that increasing inflows to gibe iii and koysha reservoirs can result in a more frequent activation of the spillways that produce large and sudden water releases downstream which can be highly disturbing for the ecosystems adapted to the natural hydrology 5 discussion our results discover more than 800 alternative strategies for operating the system that differently reconcile the competing water demands and uses in the otb the trade off analysis conducted over these solutions shows that hydropower and irrigation are not particularly conflicting which suggests that similarly to other african systems giuliani et al 2022 alexander et al 2020 basheer et al 2021 the dams and irrigation schemes are well designed from the perspective of these primary water uses the sharpest conflict emerges between irrigation supply and fish production in lake turkana emphasizing the transboundary issue of the basin as the irrigated areas are in ethiopia whereas the majority of lake turkana is in kenya this finding is in line with the results from avery and tebbs 2018 which emphasizes the risks for lake turkana induced by large water abstractions for irrigation supply interestingly the stakeholders negotiated pathway indicates a slight preference for fish at the expense of irrigation our interpretation of this result is related to the fact that large scale irrigation is something that in the context of our analysis does not exist yet so every solution is somehow better than the historical situation while other sectors like fish or environment have their historical reference negatively impacted by the majority of the considered pathways this pathway indeed attains a performance in the top 20 of the solutions set for environment recession and fish primarily at the cost of a performance in terms of irrigation deficit close to 45 of best feasible solution along with a 70 gwh y reduction in hydropower production this result is not surprising as a good performance in terms of environment recession and fish requires a streamflow regime close to the natural conditions in the lower omo which can be obtained by limiting the water diversion especially to the kuraz sugar plantation the practical implementation of this solution would entail reducing the extent of the irrigation district or increasing the fraction of fallow land within the district a recommendation that is similar to the ones suggested by hodbod et al 2019 the possibility of implementing this pathway is however controversial as the original investments described in the master plan were largely motivated by the expansion of hydropower and irrigated agriculture additional efforts are likely needed to identify an implementable solution with a better performance in terms of hydropower and irrigation possibly introducing additional mitigation options for reducing the negative impacts of this alternative solution on the other stakeholders the fact that the nsl was clearly framed as a simulation exercise likely encouraged participants to explore solutions with low political acceptability but potentially interesting some stakeholders indicate that a possible way to resolve the strong trade off between irrigation and fish can be favoring the practices of aquaculture in the omo delta to reduce the dependency on natural fish yields in lake turkana in addition increasing the access to small scale irrigation pumps for the communities relying on flood recession agriculture can contribute to enhancing the acceptability of a more hydropower inclined solution further studies are however needed to assess the social implications of these interventions for the pastoralist communities living the lower omo valley amos et al 2021 the second part of our analysis shows that the performance of the considered pathways is expected to degrade under the considered ensemble of future scenarios with large vulnerabilities in terms of hydropower production recession agriculture and water supply for irrigation the scenario discovery performed over a larger ensemble of 15 000 synthetically generated scenarios provides valuable insights about the main sources of vulnerability of the system changes in streamflow in the northern basin emerge as the most critical for the system as a whole while reductions in streamflow in the south of the basin are generally less relevant probably because they carry much lower volumes of water compared to the northern flows over the next years stakeholders and decision makers should therefore carefully monitor the evolution of the upper part of the basin particularly with respect to the existing projects for expanding small scale irrigated agriculture in that area avery and tebbs 2018 which could substantially decrease the water volumes flowing into the southern part of the basin a limitation in the presented results is the simplified representation of some key hydrological processes in the omo river delta particularly in terms of evaporation losses occurring when floodwater spreads over the floodplain or flow returns from the irrigated areas these simplifications influence the simulated water balance in the delta with respect to the role of irrigation abstractions against the evaporation losses in natural conditions however we expect return flow to play a minor role because the irrigation policy is designed to meet the irrigation demands required for optimal agricultural yield another simplification of our model is related to the use of average travel times along the river stretches impacting the assessment of both environment and recession agriculture all these assumptions have been resolved in the dafne project which also produced a high fidelity assessment of selected pathways obtained by re simulating them using the topkapi eth model yet the computational requirements of this model prevent its use in large monte carlo simulations and robustness analysis ultimately making the above simplifications unavoidable for the present study furthermore our results do not account for the dams contribution related to flood protection as this aspect was not raised by our stakeholders during the nsl dedicated to the definition of assessment indicators it is worth remarking that while dams designed for flood protection typically include a flood buffer zone this latter is not present in either gibe iii or koysha thus suggesting this aspect is likely secondary with respect to the role of hydropower production 6 conclusions in this paper we describe the implementation of a participatory decision analytic framework for promoting water related development pathways that are efficient socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable the application of this approach in the omo turkana basin enabled the exploration of multisectoral trade offs across the main stakeholders impacted by the ongoing hydropower and agricultural expansion projects in the basin including indigenous recession agriculture ecosystem services in the lower omo and fish yield in lake turkana moreover we assessed the robustness of these alternative development pathways across a broad array of plausible climate and socio economic futures overall the pathway negotiated by the stakeholders during the negotiation simulation labs represents a good compromise across all competing interests with relevant degradation of performance only for irrigated agriculture moreover it attains a medium level of robustness when exposed to the uncertainty of future scenarios this solution which recommends keeping a large buffer in gibe iii to handle the future inflow variability while keeping koysha close to its full supply level see fig 6 emerges as a promising balanced solution to address the multisectoral trade offs across multiple uncertain futures these findings suggest that our participatory decision analytic framework provides stakeholders and decision makers with a rich context for better understanding complex multisector dynamics and for prioritizing investments in projects the extensive trade off analysis investigating alternative operations of the system suggests there is space for enhancing the flexibility and the adaptive capacity of the basin without the need for additional infrastructural upgrades and associated financial outlays finally our results show how facilitating the negotiation of compromise solutions balancing diverse and competing indicators could contribute to increasing the system resilience under changing climate and society to ensure the correct interpretation of the simulated outputs and a common understanding across all stakeholder groups we recommend planning dedicated training sessions to acquire the necessary competencies funding

understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of water bodies over large areas remain a major challenge this study used all the available landsat images and the google earth engine gee to map and analyze annual changes of all water bodies 0 001 km2 in hunan province china from 1987 to 2020 new hydrological insights for the region a total of 76 928 wbs were detected with a total area of 4181 14 km2 both were averages during the study period with an interannual variability of 117 and 20 05 km2 year 1 respectively surface areas of small 0 001 1 km2 medium 1 50 km2 and large 50 km2 wbs changed at various rates and directions the size abundance relationship of wbs followed the power scaling law with a positive trend in the scaling exponent implying the fraction of small wb number has decreased over the past three decades the temporal change of the size abundance relationship reflects the strong and dynamic imprints of both human activities and regional climate change future research should strive to understand the temporal change of the size abundance relationship of wbs as it is important for water resources management and estimating the temporal changes of greenhouse gas fluxes from

environment changes keller et al 2020 zou et al 2018 thus understanding the dynamic changes of wbs and their causes is essential for the socioeconomic and sustainable management of water resources the abundance and area of wbs over large regions provide valuable information for water resource management feng et al 2019 pickens et al 2020 many studies have mapped and monitored wbs with coarse resolution satellite sensors e g terra aqua modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 0 25 1 km resolutions in large areas klein et al 2017 lu et al 2019 though coarse resolution images can be used to monitor wb dynamics the minimal detectable wb size defined by the resolution of the data is insufficient to identify the small wbs that are critical to the maintenance of regional biodiversity and biogeochemical processes carroll et al 2009 holgerson and raymond 2016 khandelwal et al 2017 on the other hand the detection of more frequent isolated small wbs over large areas as shown by the power scaling law between wb size and abundance mcdonald et al 2012 steele 2018 often presents great challenges palmer et al 2015 to address these challenges finer resolution satellite imageries are required to improve the accuracy in estimating the wbs abundance area understanding and quantifying of historical change of surface wbs in large regions are important for long term sustainability of water resources and ecosystem services hou et al 2020 zou et al 2018 various efforts have been undertaken to examine the long term surface water change tao et al 2015 quantified the decadal changes of lakes over 1 km2 in in mongolian plateau from 1970 s to 2010 using landsat satellite imageries the lake area in inner mongolia showed a doubled rate of decline compared to that in mongolia zhang et al 2019 recently mapped and monitored the lake area dynamics in china during 1960 s 2015 at 5 to 10 year intervals and found that the total area of nationwide lakes 1 km2 has increased by 5858 06 km2 9 over the past several decades with strong spatial variations however due to the strong intra and interannual variations in surface wbs such epoch based studies might miss important information on interannual and seasonal variations messager et al 2016 these results only represented the snapshots of wb conditions in the sampled years messager et al 2016 wang et al 2020 consequently the overall wbs dynamics particularly in wet and dry years are not well monitored messager et al 2016 sheng et al 2016 as a result monitoring wb changes with dense data points in time is needed to reduce the uncertainties an explicit consideration of different waterbody types is crucial for exploring the details of long term water changes and biogeochemical cycles such as greenhouse gas fluxes from wbs yu et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 several recent studies have examined the dynamic of water bodies and generated various wb extent maps in many regions ji et al 2018 rao et al 2018 for example deng et al 2019 demonstrated that the total surface water area in the yangtze river basin experienced an increasing trend mainly due to intensified human activities however it should be noted that the multiple water types e g rivers lakes ponds and reservoirs may have different change patterns as a result of climate change and human activities yu et al 2021 for instance dam construction has experienced an unprecedented boom worldwide since the 1950 s latrubesse et al 2017 zarfl et al 2015 resulting in an increase in reservoir area and in yangtze river basin of china the newly constructed reservoirs contributed over half of the total water increase from 1950 s yang and lu 2013 2014 undoubtedly these variations of wb in regions are largely driven by human activities the omission of changes of various wb types might mask divergent changing patterns among different wb types feng et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 furthermore biogeochemical processes such as greenhouse gas fluxes are proved to be size and wb type dependent the greenhouse gases fluxes of the lakes rivers and ponds were several orders of magnitude different holgerson and raymond 2016 thus masking the differences of the various wb types would lead to some uncertainties in quantifying the greenhouse gas emissions consequently a comprehensive consideration of different wb types is required to assess the dynamics of wbs and other biogeochemical processes raymond et al 2013 wen et al 2017 in this study we employed all available landsat images to quantify and understand the dynamics of surface wbs in hunan province from 1987 to 2020 and to demonstrate the necessity of the concept described above in water resources research and monitoring over large areas in general the aims of this study were to 1 detect and map the locations sizes and changes of surface wbs annually in hunan province from 1987 to 2020 2 quantify and understand the distribution and spatial temporal dynamics of surface wbs in hunan during 1987 2020 3 investigate the effects of anthropogenic activities on surface wbs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area as illustrated in fig 1 hunan province 24 38 30 08 e and 108 47 114 15 n is located in southern china with an area of approximately 211 800 km2 liu et al 2018 hunan province constitutes 13 prefecture level cities and one autonomous prefecture with a population of about 70 million at the end of 2019 liu et al 2018 the region has a humid subtropical monsoon climate the annual precipitation ranges from 1200 to 1700 mm approximately 70 of which falls in the spring and summer which causes widely variable changes in wbs luo and tao 2016 the annual average temperature in hunan is approximately 15 18 c hu et al 2020 the intensive human activities have put a heavy pressure on the water resource dongting lake a globally important wetland in hunan province has undergone drastic changes in history yang et al 2020 the lake area decreased by 17 after the impoundment of the three gorges dam tgd in 2003 feng et al 2013 triggering various changes of wbs in the region 2 2 landsat images all the landsat 5 7 and 8 surface reflectance tier 1 images of entire hunan

modified normalized difference water index mndwi eq 1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi eq 2 and enhanced vegetation index evi eq 3 zhou et al 2019 zou et al 2017 in addition two versions of automated water extraction index awei including aweinsh eq 4 and aweish eq 5 were employed to remove errors caused by the shadow and dark surfaces from the image deng et al 2019 feyisa et al 2014 aweinsh was an index which was suited for eliminating nonwatery pixels in urban background and aweish was an index that was introduced to remove shadow pixels that aweinsh may not effectively eliminate deng et al 2019 feyisa et al 2014 despite these indices have been widely used to map surface wbs the mndwi and ndwi still have commission error in mixed pixels and other water related land cover types especially when the water pixels comprises the vegetation zou et al 2018 consequently in order to remove the noise caused by vegetation mndwi was combined with evi and ndvi to identify surface water bodies wang et al 2018 2020 1 mndwi ρ green ρ swir 1 ρ green ρ swir 1 2 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red 3 evi 2 5 ρ nir ρ red 1 ρ nir 6 ρ red 7 5 ρ blue 4 awei nsh 4 ρ g reen ρ swir 1 0 25

and shortwave infrared band respectively these bands of landsat 5 7 8 images have same spatial resolutions 30 m based on the efforts of deng et al 2019 and feyisa et al 2014 we used mndwi ndvi evi and awei to detect surface water specifically the criteria mndwi ndvi or mndwi evi was used to identify the pixels with water signal a criterion aweinsh aweish 0 1 was used to further remove the mixed pixels zou et al 2018 therefore only the pixels that met the criteria eq 6 were classified as water pixels the water frequency defined as the proportion of water observations during 1987 2020 was calculated to separate permanent water pixels seasonal water pixels and land pixels yamazaki et al 2015 zou et al 2017 in addition to reduce the potential error from uncertain image preprocessing the pixels with water frequency eq 7 less than 0 25 were excluded deng et al 2019 zou et al 2017 consequently when the water pixel frequency was greater than or equal to 0 25 the pixel was classified as the surface wb for each year the water pixels were classified into year long wbs wb frequency 0 75 and seasonal wbs 0 25 wb frequency 0 75 wang et al 2019 zou et al 2018 and all these pixels in a year formed the maximum wb extent in that year then we calculated the areas of the maximum year long and seasonal wbs correspondingly from 1987 to 2020 6 water awei nsh awei sh 0 1 and mndwi ndvi or mndwi evi 7 f y 1 n y i 1 n y w y i where f y is the water frequency ranging from 0 to 1 y is the specified year ny is the pixel number of all good observations in a year w y i denotes whether one observation of the pixel is water f y ranges from 0 to 1 to better extract the characteristics of the different wbs by size i e small medium and large wbs we followed the methods of feng et al 2019 as our goal was to investigate the interannual variations in number and area of all wbs i e lakes ponds and reservoirs we used the maximum water extent mwe to detect the locations and dynamics of wbs thus the rivers and artificial rice paddy fields were excluded from the mwe in arcgis v10 2 esri following feng et al 2019 finally these wbs were categorized into three classes small 1 km2 medium 1 50 km2 and large 50 km2 in addition the lakes and reservoirs 1 km2 were extracted to explore the changes of different water body types first we used the reservoir polygon data 1 km2 from global reservoir and dam database grand http globaldamwatch org grand accessed on 10 november 2021 and hunan water resources department http slt hunan gov cn slt index html accessed on 10 november 2021 to extract reservoirs second the lake boundary polygons 1 km2 obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center http data tpdc ac cn zh hans accessed on 10 november 2021 was used to extract the lake locations through overlay operation in arcgis v10 2 esri redlands ca usa in addition all lakes and reservoirs 1 km2 in our water map were manually corrected by visual inspection against google earth high resolution images to validate the surface water maps and determine the user s accuracy and producer s accuracy very high spatial resolution images from google earth and jrc water database were used as the reference data sample points were generated randomly within the surface water body map in 2020 we adopted a visual inspection to check each point from google earth and jrc water data altogether 1996 random points including 1020 water samples and 976 non water samples were selected which covered different land cover types the confusion matrix for water detection is shown in table s1 the producer accuracies of water and non water were 97 35 and 99 28 respectively the overall accuracy is 98 3 with a kappa coefficient equal to 0 966 suggesting that the classification was satisfactory foody 2020 cross comparison with other datasets were also performed to assess the quality of our results these datasets included the global surface water database gswd from pekel et al 2016 the china land cover dataset clcd from yang and huang 2021 the global forest change gfc data from hansen et al 2013 the water dataset derived from ccdc algorithm liu et al 2020 zhu and woodcock

addition the dynamic thresholding method e g otsu was an efficient algorithm for water detection otsu 1979 rad et al 2021 we also applied the augmented normalized difference water index andwi with otsu thresholding method and compared the results 2 5 statistical analyses the non parametric mann kendall mk test has been successfully employed to analyze long term trend in hydro meteorological variables salehi et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 in this study the mk method was employed as the primary tool to analyze the change trend of wbs in hunan province from 1987 to 2020 moreover the theil sen

ywa seasonal water area swa in hunan province was 6374 49 km2 equivalent to 3 01 of its land area table 1 the mean year long wb was 3713 05 km2 most of which were large lakes rivers reservoirs the seasonal wb was 2661 44 km2 most of which were found at the edge of large wbs rice fields and small wbs water resources distributed unevenly across regions fig 2a table 1 specifically the mean mwa ranged from 88 65 km2 in zhangjiajie city to 1919 96 km2 in yueyang city the three regions with the largest wb areas were yuy cd and yiy their mwa all exceeded 1000 km2 together representing about 64 46 of the total wb area in hunan the three regions including zjj ld and xx had the smallest mean mwa together only accounted for 2 81 of total wb area in hunan the wb area in the three regions in north hunan i e cd yuy and yiy was roughly seven times that in west hunan i e zjj xx and hh likewise the water area was also distributed unevenly at the watershed scale fig 2c table s3 3 2 spatial temporal dynamics of wb abundance and area overall changes of wbs in hunan and regions from 1987 to 2020 are shown in figs 2b and 2d between 1987 and 2020 the mwa ywa and swa clearly showed remarkably divergent trends fig 2b and table s2 total wb area in whole hunan province varied between 5203 23 km2 in 2011 and 7924 82 km2 in 1996 a downward trend was found in the mwa shrinking approximately 17 23 km2 year 1 table 1 the year long wb area in hunan province ranged from 2867 79 km2 in 1992 4321 17 km2 in 1994 gaining at a pace of 0 95 km2 year 1 the seasonal water varied from 1943 18 km2 in 2015 4105 91 km2 in 1996 fig s1 and table s2 according to the mann kendall mk test three regions i e yueyang yiyang and xiangtan had decreasing trends in total surface wb area p 0 05 in contrast four regions mainly distributed in mountainous areas showed significant increase p 0 05 in the last three decades the water and non water transitions in hunan during the two epochs i e 1987 2003 2003 2020 are demonstrated in fig 3 the dominant change in hunan in the first period was from seasonal water 1394 51 km2 to non water 767 20 km2 and year long water 627 31 km2 fig 3a table s4 and s5 additionally a large area of non water 1432 90 km2 was transitioned into year long water 401 84 km2 and seasonal water 1031 06 km2 among regions the three regions around dongting lake including cd yuy and yiy had the largest transitional area accounting for 60 of total in hunan after 2003 the major transitions were from water to non water fig 3b 3 3 long term evolution of different surface water body types in this study we detected a total of 107 392 wbs 0 001 km2 covering a total surface area of 8925 07 km2 the small wbs 0 001 1 km2 amounted to 107 066 wbs accounting for 99 6 of total number fig 4a the number of the medium 1 50 km2 and large wbs 50 km2 were 317 and 8 wbs taking fractions of 0 36 and 0 0074 respectively the total number of wbs during 1987 2020 showed remarkable interannual variation varying from 57 313 in 2013 78 127 in 1994 overall the total number of wbs decreased over the last three decades 245 wbs year 1 although the small wbs took the dominant fraction in number they only accounted for 20 35 850 98 km2 of the total wb area fig 4b the medium and large wbs accounted for 23 05 and 56 60 of the total respectively over the past three decades the long term evolution of small and large wbs has shown a significant decrease trend in surface area at 5 12 km2 year 1 and 16 57 km2 year 1 respectively while the medium wbs increased at 2 11 km2 year 1 fig 4c the size abundance relationship of wbs in hunan province conformed to the power law fig 4d the yearly scaling exponents in the whole province varied from 0 94 in 1990 to 0 87 in 2010 and the exponent in each year presented a shallower slope than that of maximum wb extent 0 98 fig 4d in addition the annual exponents showed a significant increase p 0 05 suggesting the fraction of small wb number has decreased over the past three decades the total lake area 1 km2 in hunan province showed a significant decrease trend slope 14 89 km2 year 1 p 0 05 from 1987 and 2020 fig 5 the spatial patterns of lake area change showed clear heterogeneity figs 5a and 5b the expanding lakes were mainly located in the east of dongting lake region the shrinking lakes were mainly found in the north and south of dongting lake region among these lakes dongting lake showed the largest decrease with a decreasing rate of 10 36 km2 year 1 during the study area the total reservoir area of the 218 reservoirs 1 km2 identified increased rapidly during the past decades slope 4 68 km2 year 1 p 0 05 fig 5 for reservoirs with year long water 125 reservoirs expanded which was obviously greater than shrinking reservoirs in number figs 5c and 5g for the reservoirs with seasonal water the number of shrinking reservoirs was larger than that of expanding reservoirs figs 5d and 5g 3 4 effects of climate and anthropogenic factors on water bodies wb changes across hunan province were largely driven by climate change and land use change activities the interannual variation of water area showed some multiyear dry and wet rotation events from 1987 to 2020 according to hunan statistical yearbook and the spei value and five drought events were documented i e 1988 1990 1992 2003 2007 2009 2011 and 2013 fig 6a the spei value during these events all dropped substantially especially in 2007 2009 and 2011 meanwhile the water area and grace lws had substantial decline during the drought periods and reached the lowest level of water area in 2011 which was 18 3 below the average during the 2002 2019 reservoir storage and water withdrawal have contributed to the expansion and shrinkage of wbs throughout the province both reservoir storage and water withdrawal all showed a significant increasing trend of 9 58 km3 year 1 p 0 05 and 1 27 km3 year 1 p 0 05 respectively fig 6b it can be observed when the wb area shrank during the drought events both the reservoir storage and water diversion and pumping presented increasing trends and gradually reached their peak circa 2019 after the drought events the water area showed recovery as shown by the upward trends of precipitation spei grace lws fig 6a 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with previous studies we compared our dataset with other datasets for cross comparison at the region area fig 7 as demonstrated in fig 6 except the omission information due to the source data the total area and interannual variability of wb area from our dataset had a good agreement with that of gswd slope 0 98 r2 0 96 se 0 01 fig 7a the water layer from modis land cover data had a shallower slope slope 0 83 r2 0 93 se 0 01 than that in our study and gswd this deviation indicated that the water area derived from the coarse spatial resolution remote sensing data might be underestimated because some wbs especially the small wbs under their defined resolution might be missed in images feng et al 2019 messager et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 the slopes between our study and globaland30 gfc and glcd were all below 1 suggesting underestimation of wbs in these datasets indeed these datasets while useful for characterizing water conditions at a given time lacked a dense temporal sequence observation feng et al 2020 and could not overcome the impact of regional differences in wet dry cycles and other hydrological events hamilton and casey 2016 messager et al 2016 in contrast the total water extent from ccdc dataset was larger than our estimate slope 1 21 fig 7b this might be caused by the fact that the ccdc wbs included ephemeral water bodies and wetlands and the ccdc algorithms relies on the detection of long term trends and large breakpoints rather than interannual variability thereby the ccdc has a smaller interannual variability of total water area compared with other datasets fig 7b comparing with other datasets our results showed more interannual variabilities as shown by the larger difference between estimates in wet and dry years fig 7b for example our estimate of the total area of wbs in 2002 wet year was 7104 61 km2 which is 13 and 39 larger than that of gswd and glcd respectively and 2 15 times the modis estimate in 2011 dry year our estimate was 1 03 times larger than the previous highest estimate and 1 59 times the lowest estimate for the estimate with otsu thresholding method the total area and interannual variability of water area derived from these two approaches had a good agreement the regression line is not significantly different from the 1 1 line slope 0 98 r2 0 95 fig s2 4 2 fractal dimensions of size abundance scaling the estimated pareto coefficient of the size abundance relationship from 1987 to 2020 for hunan varied from 0 94 to 0 87 fallen within the theoretical constraints 0 5 b 1 cael and seekell 2016 seekell et al 2013 the lower pareto coefficient than that for china 0 835 feng et al 2019 suggests that the small wbs weight more in hunan province than those in china our results also demonstrated that small wbs conform to power law distributions which is different from findings that small wbs deviated from the power law distribution due to the impact of topographic relief geology and complexity of landscapes seekell et al 2013 steele and heffernan 2014 previous research on size abundance scaling of wbs are mainly on testing the feasibility of the pareto law in various watersheds and regions feng et al 2019 one interesting finding from our study was that the scaling exponent showed an increasing trend from 1987 to 2020 signifying temporal change of the size abundance relationship of wbs in time to our knowledge a feature that has never been investigated the impact of human activities and climate change on the size abundance relationship of wb specifically during 1987 2020 rapid increases in agricultural land occurred in hunan especially in dongting lake region the deliberate drainage and infilling of surface water to increase arable land brought about the decline of small wbs and the shrinkage of water extent yang et al 2020 in addition regional climate factors such as the precipitation in wet year and prolong drought in dry year could result in the interannual variation of the scaling exponent steele and heffernan 2017 abundant precipitation might propel the increase of frequency and extent while drought might dry up wbs particularly small wbs feng et al 2020 these processes might modify the landscape at scales that can accounting for the increasing of the scaling exponent in wbs shi et al 2017 the temporal dynamics of size abundance relationship of wbs can not only reflect the impacts of human activities and global change on the structural change of wbs but also have important implications for global change research for example constant size abundance relationships of wbs are often used to estimate inland water carbon budget at the regional to global scales delsontro et al 2018 which likely underestimates the temporal changes of the fluxes 4 3 impacts of climatic and anthropogenic forces water area change in hunan province showed great heterogeneity across regions which were most likely caused by complex processes of accelerated climate change and direct human activities from 1987 2020 the surface water area had a positive correlation with annual precipitation p 0 05 furthermore although the precipitation in the whole hunan province showed a slightly increased trend over the last three decades deng et al 2019 the dry and wet rotation events along with variation of precipitation influence the surface water dynamics wang et al 2012 the features together present more chances for the surface water transition apart from the precipitation land use activities have contributed to the dynamic changes of wbs throughout hunan province as also shown by other studies ran and lu 2012 yang and lu 2014 for example dam and reservoir constructions can substantially change the area and storage of wbs upstream and downstream bai et al 2017 hunan province has the largest number of dams and reservoirs in china which increased rapidly during the past few decades yang and lu 2013 for example the number of reservoirs in hunan increased from 8712 to 14 047 from 1984 to 2020 an increase of 5355 or 61 2 in number the water area has a positive correlation with dam number pearson s r 0 36 p 0 05 the capacity of reservoirs increased from 20 96 km3 in 1988 51 40 km3 in 2019 a gain of 29 5 km3 or more than doubled the initial capacity hunan statistical yearbook 2020 while in the dongting lake the water area has decreased gradually since 2003 and the lake recorded the lowest water level in 2004 as a result of the impoundment of the great three gorges dam feng et al 2013 wu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 land reclamation or wbs impoldering i e convert water into other land uses has led to the constant shrinking of wbs fang et al 2018 li et al 2020 wu et al 2018 on the one hand after the release of aquaculture development directive in 1985 the fishery throughout the province increased rapidly from 1987 to 2000 which enhanced the fishery production throughout hunan in this epoch the freshwater cultured area expanded rapidly at 48 76 km2 year 1 on the other hand between 1985 and 2018 there was a rapid increase in agricultural and built up areas in dongting lake in defiance of central government directives geng et al 2021 hou et al 2020 these two processes together brought about the decline of wetlands and the shrinkage of water area in addition the continued development of urbanization industrialization and population in hunan have rapidly increased the industrial and domestic water consumption which resulted in the water area shrinkage for example according to the hunan water resources bulletin for 2001 2019 the total water consumption in hunan increased from 318 6 108 m3 in 2001 332 9 108 m3 in 2019 with an increase rate of 4 5 hunan water resources bulletin 2020 various policies have been released by regional governments to protect and promote wetland restoration since the 21st century zhao and fang 2004 historically long term farmland reclamation from lakes is a major human activity to meet the needs of a growing population wang et al 2015 however after the catastrophic flood in 1998 the government implemented the various policies and promoted the conversion of farmland to natural water to prevent floods hou et al 2020 in hunan a project in dongting lake region called 4350 was implemented since 1998 to restore the lake to its original size of 4350 km2 in 1949 zhao and fang 2004 which systematically returned parts of cultivated lands to wetlands and increased the water area yu et al 2021 in addition the government issued the national wetland conservation plan nwcp to prevent natural water from further degradation and loss wang et al 2012 4 4 uncertainties and future directions in this study we employed all available landsat images on the google earth engine gee platform to explore the spatial temporal dynamics of wbs and the associated driving forces in hunan province from 1987 to 2020 we provided the information of wb change in different wb types based on the annual water maps which are critical for water resource management however the optical images cannot penetrate the vegetation thus the wb underneath vegetation might be missed furthermore in optical images shadows usually have similar spectral characteristics to water surface making it difficult to detect water bodies with assurance zheng et al 2019 given that the fragmented nature of the inland wbs and obscuration from shadows tedious visual inspection and manual editing are usually required to improve the accuracy of water classification grill et al 2019 thus like previous studies our study should have introduced unpredictable uncertainties and underrepresent some wbs from maps for the optical remote sensing applications the last decade was a rapid development period largely driven by the stable performance of modis and landsat sensors as well as the policy of free data distribution wulder et al 2019 even though these optical remote sensing approaches are powerful in monitoring water dynamics cloud shadow vegetation obscuration spatial and temporal resolution limitations rendered them deficient in accurately detecting water bodies palmer et al 2015 to alleviate this dilemma multiple sources of remote sensing data such as sar data sentinel 2 msi and industrial sensors with high spatial and temporal resolutions should be employed in future efforts 5 conclusions in this study we employed all the available landsat images and the google earth engine gee to map and analyze annual changes of all water bodies 0 001 km2 in hunan province china from 1987 to 2020 the results provide many detailed features on surface wbs in the region a total of 76 928 wbs were detected with a total area of 4181 14 km2 both were averages during the study period with an interannual variability of 117 and 20 05 km2 year 1 respectively the total surface water area in hunan decreased from 1987 to 2020 on an average speed of 17 23 km2 year 1 with obvious differences across regions and wb sizes surface areas of small medium and large waterbodies changed at various rates and directions the size abundance relationship of wbs followed the power scaling law and the scaling exponent demonstrated strong interannual variability between 0 94 and 0 87 implying the fraction of small wb number has decreased over the past three decades the temporal change of the size abundance relationship a feature that has rarely been studied in the past reflects the strong and dynamic imprints of both human activities and regional climate change the wb area increased in some regions and watersheds mainly resulted from the filling of reservoirs and the restoration of wetlands and wbs the area loss was mainly associated with human actions including the intensification of agriculture land reclamation or wbs impoldering and water consumption and the large variability of wb area in wet and dry years was mainly driven by the variation of precipitation and water withdrawal our efforts demonstrate that the long term dense satellite data has the potential to effectively characterize the distributional properties and change dynamics of wbs and their responses to environmental changes in large regions which is important for advancing hydrological research and water resource management the approach described in this study can certainly be applied to other regions in the world credit authorship contribution statement shuguang liu

7999,study region surface water bodies in hunan province china study focus surface water bodies wb are important for agriculture aquiculture and aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems yet monitoring and understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of water bodies over large areas remain a major challenge this study used all the available landsat images and the google earth engine gee to map and analyze annual changes of all water bodies 0 001 km2 in hunan province china from 1987 to 2020 new hydrological insights for the region a total of 76 928 wbs were detected with a total area of 4181 14 km2 both were averages during the study period with an interannual variability of 117 and 20 05 km2 year 1 respectively surface areas of small 0 001 1 km2 medium 1 50 km2 and large 50 km2 wbs changed at various rates and directions the size abundance relationship of wbs followed the power scaling law with a positive trend in the scaling exponent implying the fraction of small wb number has decreased over the past three decades the temporal change of the size abundance relationship reflects the strong and dynamic imprints of both human activities and regional climate change future research should strive to understand the temporal change of the size abundance relationship of wbs as it is important for water resources management and estimating the temporal changes of greenhouse gas fluxes from wbs over large areas keywords water body detection dynamics size abundance spatiotemporal variability 1 introduction surface water bodies play a crucial role in agriculture aquiculture and aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems feng et al 2019 ran et al 2021 wang et al 2020 over the past several decades approximately 90 000 km2 of surface water area has been lost globally and about 800 000 km2 of the global surface waters is affected by seasonal drought keller et al 2020 pekel et al 2016 changes in water body wb area has tremendous impacts on ecosystem services biogeochemical cycles and other environment changes keller et al 2020 zou et al 2018 thus understanding the dynamic changes of wbs and their causes is essential for the socioeconomic and sustainable management of water resources the abundance and area of wbs over large regions provide valuable information for water resource management feng et al 2019 pickens et al 2020 many studies have mapped and monitored wbs with coarse resolution satellite sensors e g terra aqua modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 0 25 1 km resolutions in large areas klein et al 2017 lu et al 2019 though coarse resolution images can be used to monitor wb dynamics the minimal detectable wb size defined by the resolution of the data is insufficient to identify the small wbs that are critical to the maintenance of regional biodiversity and biogeochemical processes carroll et al 2009 holgerson and raymond 2016 khandelwal et al 2017 on the other hand the detection of more frequent isolated small wbs over large areas as shown by the power scaling law between wb size and abundance mcdonald et al 2012 steele 2018 often presents great challenges palmer et al 2015 to address these challenges finer resolution satellite imageries are required to improve the accuracy in estimating the wbs abundance area understanding and quantifying of historical change of surface wbs in large regions are important for long term sustainability of water resources and ecosystem services hou et al 2020 zou et al 2018 various efforts have been undertaken to examine the long term surface water change tao et al 2015 quantified the decadal changes of lakes over 1 km2 in in mongolian plateau from 1970 s to 2010 using landsat satellite imageries the lake area in inner mongolia showed a doubled rate of decline compared to that in mongolia zhang et al 2019 recently mapped and monitored the lake area dynamics in china during 1960 s 2015 at 5 to 10 year intervals and found that the total area of nationwide lakes 1 km2 has increased by 5858 06 km2 9 over the past several decades with strong spatial variations however due to the strong intra and interannual variations in surface wbs such epoch based studies might miss important information on interannual and seasonal variations messager et al 2016 these results only represented the snapshots of wb conditions in the sampled years messager et al 2016 wang et al 2020 consequently the overall wbs dynamics particularly in wet and dry years are not well monitored messager et al 2016 sheng et al 2016 as a result monitoring wb changes with dense data points in time is needed to reduce the uncertainties an explicit consideration of different waterbody types is crucial for exploring the details of long term water changes and biogeochemical cycles such as greenhouse gas fluxes from wbs yu et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 several recent studies have examined the dynamic of water bodies and generated various wb extent maps in many regions ji et al 2018 rao et al 2018 for example deng et al 2019 demonstrated that the total surface water area in the yangtze river basin experienced an increasing trend mainly due to intensified human activities however it should be noted that the multiple water types e g rivers lakes ponds and reservoirs may have different change patterns as a result of climate change and human activities yu et al 2021 for instance dam construction has experienced an unprecedented boom worldwide since the 1950 s latrubesse et al 2017 zarfl et al 2015 resulting in an increase in reservoir area and in yangtze river basin of china the newly constructed reservoirs contributed over half of the total water increase from 1950 s yang and lu 2013 2014 undoubtedly these variations of wb in regions are largely driven by human activities the omission of changes of various wb types might mask divergent changing patterns among different wb types feng et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 furthermore biogeochemical processes such as greenhouse gas fluxes are proved to be size and wb type dependent the greenhouse gases fluxes of the lakes rivers and ponds were several orders of magnitude different holgerson and raymond 2016 thus masking the differences of the various wb types would lead to some uncertainties in quantifying the greenhouse gas emissions consequently a comprehensive consideration of different wb types is required to assess the dynamics of wbs and other biogeochemical processes raymond et al 2013 wen et al 2017 in this study we employed all available landsat images to quantify and understand the dynamics of surface wbs in hunan province from 1987 to 2020 and to demonstrate the necessity of the concept described above in water resources research and monitoring over large areas in general the aims of this study were to 1 detect and map the locations sizes and changes of surface wbs annually in hunan province from 1987 to 2020 2 quantify and understand the distribution and spatial temporal dynamics of surface wbs in hunan during 1987 2020 3 investigate the effects of anthropogenic activities on surface wbs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area as illustrated in fig 1 hunan province 24 38 30 08 e and 108 47 114 15 n is located in southern china with an area of approximately 211 800 km2 liu et al 2018 hunan province constitutes 13 prefecture level cities and one autonomous prefecture with a population of about 70 million at the end of 2019 liu et al 2018 the region has a humid subtropical monsoon climate the annual precipitation ranges from 1200 to 1700 mm approximately 70 of which falls in the spring and summer which causes widely variable changes in wbs luo and tao 2016 the annual average temperature in hunan is approximately 15 18 c hu et al 2020 the intensive human activities have put a heavy pressure on the water resource dongting lake a globally important wetland in hunan province has undergone drastic changes in history yang et al 2020 the lake area decreased by 17 after the impoundment of the three gorges dam tgd in 2003 feng et al 2013 triggering various changes of wbs in the region 2 2 landsat images all the landsat 5 7 and 8 surface reflectance tier 1 images of entire hunan province from 1987 to 2020 10 000 images 70 terabytes of data in the google earth engine platform were used in this study landsat tiles path rows of the landsat worldwide reference system wrs 2 were

on 10 november 2021 was obtained to analysis the relationship between spei and water area change beguería et al 2014 2 4 water body detection and validation surface wbs can be detected by using the modified normalized difference water index mndwi eq 1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi eq 2 and enhanced vegetation index evi eq 3 zhou et al 2019 zou et al 2017 in addition two versions of automated water extraction index awei including aweinsh eq 4 and aweish eq 5 were employed to remove errors caused by the shadow and dark surfaces from the image deng et al 2019 feyisa et al 2014 aweinsh was an index which was suited for eliminating nonwatery pixels in urban background and aweish was an index that was introduced to remove shadow pixels that aweinsh may not effectively eliminate deng et al 2019 feyisa et al 2014 despite these indices have been widely used to map surface wbs the mndwi and ndwi still have commission error in mixed pixels and other water related land cover types especially when the water pixels comprises the vegetation zou et al 2018 consequently in order to remove the noise caused by vegetation mndwi was combined with evi and ndvi to identify surface water bodies wang et al 2018 2020 1 mndwi ρ green ρ swir 1 ρ green ρ swir 1 2 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red 3 evi 2 5 ρ nir ρ red 1 ρ nir 6 ρ red 7 5 ρ blue 4 awei nsh 4 ρ g reen ρ swir 1 0 25 ρ nir 2 75 ρ swir 2 5 aweish ρ blue 2 5 ρ g reen 1 5 ρ nir ρ swir 1 0 25 ρ swir 2 where ρblue ρgreen ρred ρnir and ρswir1 2 are the surface reflectance values of landsat blue green red near infrared and shortwave infrared band respectively these bands of landsat 5 7 8 images have same spatial resolutions 30 m based on the efforts of deng et al 2019 and feyisa et al 2014 we used mndwi ndvi evi and awei to detect surface water specifically the criteria mndwi ndvi or mndwi evi was used to identify the pixels with water signal a criterion aweinsh aweish 0 1 was used to further remove the mixed pixels zou et al 2018 therefore only the pixels that met the criteria eq 6 were classified as water pixels the water frequency defined as the proportion of water observations during 1987 2020 was calculated to separate permanent water pixels seasonal water pixels and land pixels yamazaki et al 2015 zou et al 2017 in addition to reduce the potential error from uncertain image preprocessing the pixels with water frequency eq 7 less than 0 25 were excluded deng et al 2019 zou et al 2017 consequently when the water pixel frequency was greater than or equal to 0 25 the pixel was classified as the surface wb for each year the water pixels were classified into year long wbs wb frequency 0 75 and seasonal wbs 0 25 wb frequency 0 75 wang et al 2019 zou et al 2018 and all these pixels in a year formed the maximum wb extent in that year then we calculated the areas of the maximum year long and seasonal wbs correspondingly from 1987 to 2020 6 water awei nsh awei sh 0 1 and mndwi ndvi or mndwi evi 7 f y 1 n y i 1 n y w y i where f y is the water frequency ranging from 0 to 1 y is the specified year ny is the pixel number of all good observations in a year w y i denotes whether one observation of the pixel is water f y ranges from 0 to 1 to better extract the characteristics of the different wbs by size i e small medium and large wbs we followed the methods of feng et al 2019 as our goal was to investigate the interannual variations in number and area of all wbs i e lakes ponds and reservoirs we used the maximum water extent mwe to detect the locations and dynamics of wbs thus the rivers and artificial rice paddy fields were excluded from the mwe in arcgis v10 2 esri following feng et al 2019 finally these wbs were categorized into three classes small 1 km2 medium 1 50 km2 and large 50 km2 in addition the lakes and reservoirs 1 km2 were extracted to explore the changes of different water body types first we used the reservoir polygon data 1 km2 from global reservoir and dam database grand http globaldamwatch org grand accessed on 10 november 2021 and hunan water resources department http slt hunan gov cn slt index html accessed on 10 november 2021 to extract reservoirs second the lake boundary polygons 1 km2 obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center http data tpdc ac cn zh hans accessed on 10 november 2021 was used to extract the lake locations through overlay operation in arcgis v10 2 esri redlands ca usa in addition all lakes and reservoirs 1 km2 in our water map were manually corrected by visual inspection against google earth high resolution images to validate the surface water maps and determine the user s accuracy and producer s accuracy very high spatial resolution images from google earth and jrc water database were used as the reference data sample points were generated randomly within the surface water body map in 2020 we adopted a visual inspection to check each point from google earth and jrc water data altogether 1996 random points including 1020 water samples and 976 non water samples were selected which covered different land cover types the confusion matrix for water detection is shown in table s1 the producer accuracies of water and non water were 97 35 and 99 28 respectively the overall accuracy is 98 3 with a kappa coefficient equal to 0 966 suggesting that the classification was satisfactory foody 2020 cross comparison with other datasets were also performed to assess the quality of our results these datasets included the global surface water database gswd from pekel et al 2016 the china land cover dataset clcd from yang and huang 2021 the global forest change gfc data from hansen et al 2013 the water dataset derived from ccdc algorithm liu et al 2020 zhu and woodcock

addition the dynamic thresholding method e g otsu was an efficient algorithm for water detection otsu 1979 rad et al 2021 we also applied the augmented normalized difference water index andwi with otsu thresholding method and compared the results 2 5 statistical analyses the non parametric mann kendall mk test has been successfully employed to analyze long term trend in hydro meteorological variables salehi et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 in this study the mk method was employed as the primary tool to analyze the change trend of wbs in hunan province from 1987 to 2020 moreover the theil sen slope estimator was employed to quantify linear trends during the investigated period sen 1968 zhao et al 2020 the anthropogenic factors included the yearly gdp reservoir number and reservoir storage were gathered from china statistical year book 1987 2019 http www stats gov cn tjsj ndsj accessed on 10 november 2021 which were used to explore the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic factors

november 2021 3 results 3 1 spatial pattern of surface water bodies the overall characteristics of wbs in hunan and its regions are shown in table 1 and fig 2 the mean maximum wb area mwa year long ywa seasonal water area swa in hunan province was 6374 49 km2 equivalent to 3 01 of its land area table 1 the mean year long wb was 3713 05 km2 most of which were large lakes rivers reservoirs the seasonal wb was 2661 44 km2 most of which were found at the edge of large wbs rice fields and small wbs water resources distributed unevenly across regions fig 2a table 1 specifically the mean mwa ranged from 88 65 km2 in zhangjiajie city to 1919 96 km2 in yueyang city the three regions with the largest wb areas were yuy cd and yiy their mwa all exceeded 1000 km2 together representing about 64 46 of the total wb area in hunan the three regions including zjj ld and xx had the smallest mean mwa together only accounted for 2 81 of total wb area in hunan the wb area in the three regions in north hunan i e cd yuy and yiy was roughly seven times that in west hunan i e zjj xx and hh likewise the water area was also distributed unevenly at the watershed scale fig 2c table s3 3 2 spatial temporal dynamics of wb abundance and area overall changes of wbs in hunan and regions from 1987 to 2020 are shown in figs 2b and 2d between 1987 and 2020 the mwa ywa and swa clearly showed remarkably divergent trends fig 2b and table s2 total wb area in whole hunan province varied between 5203 23 km2 in 2011 and 7924 82 km2 in 1996 a downward trend was found in the mwa shrinking approximately 17 23 km2 year 1 table 1 the year long wb area in hunan province ranged from 2867 79 km2 in 1992 4321 17 km2 in 1994 gaining at a pace of 0 95 km2 year 1 the seasonal water varied from 1943 18 km2 in 2015 4105 91 km2 in 1996 fig s1 and table s2 according to the mann kendall mk test three regions i e yueyang yiyang and xiangtan had decreasing trends in total surface wb area p 0 05 in contrast four regions mainly distributed in mountainous areas showed significant increase p 0 05 in the last three decades the water and non water transitions in hunan during the two epochs i e 1987 2003 2003 2020 are demonstrated in fig 3 the dominant change in hunan in the first period was from seasonal water 1394 51 km2 to non water 767 20 km2 and year long water 627 31 km2 fig 3a table s4 and s5 additionally a large area of non water 1432 90 km2 was transitioned into year long water 401 84 km2 and seasonal water 1031 06 km2 among regions the three regions around dongting lake including cd yuy and yiy had the largest transitional area accounting for 60 of total in hunan after 2003 the major transitions were from water to non water fig 3b 3 3 long term evolution of different surface water body types in this study we detected a total of 107 392 wbs 0 001 km2 covering a total surface area of 8925 07 km2 the small wbs 0 001 1 km2 amounted to 107 066 wbs accounting for 99 6 of total number fig 4a the number of the medium 1 50 km2 and large wbs 50 km2 were 317 and 8 wbs taking fractions of 0 36 and 0 0074 respectively the total number of wbs during 1987 2020 showed remarkable interannual variation varying from 57 313 in 2013 78 127 in 1994 overall the total number of wbs decreased over the last three decades 245 wbs year 1 although the small wbs took the dominant fraction in number they only accounted for 20 35 850 98 km2 of the total wb area fig 4b the medium and large wbs accounted for 23 05 and 56 60 of the total respectively over the past three decades the long term evolution of small and large wbs has shown a significant decrease trend in surface area at 5 12 km2 year 1 and 16 57 km2 year 1 respectively while the medium wbs increased at 2 11 km2 year 1 fig 4c the size abundance relationship of wbs in hunan province conformed to the power law fig 4d the yearly scaling exponents in the whole province varied from 0 94 in 1990 to 0 87 in 2010 and the exponent in each year presented a shallower slope than that of maximum wb extent 0 98 fig 4d in addition the annual exponents showed a significant increase p 0 05 suggesting the fraction of small wb number has decreased over the past three decades the total lake area 1 km2 in hunan province showed a significant decrease trend slope 14 89 km2 year 1 p 0 05 from 1987 and 2020 fig 5 the spatial patterns of lake area change showed clear heterogeneity figs 5a and 5b the expanding lakes were mainly located in the east of dongting lake region the shrinking lakes were mainly found in the north and south of dongting lake region among these lakes dongting lake showed the largest decrease with a decreasing rate of 10 36 km2 year 1 during the study area the total reservoir area of the 218 reservoirs 1 km2 identified increased rapidly during the past decades slope 4 68 km2 year 1 p 0 05 fig 5 for reservoirs with year long water 125 reservoirs expanded which was obviously greater than shrinking reservoirs in number figs 5c and 5g for the reservoirs with seasonal water the number of shrinking reservoirs was larger than that of expanding reservoirs figs 5d and 5g 3 4 effects of climate and anthropogenic factors on water bodies wb changes across hunan province were largely driven by climate change and land use change activities the interannual variation of water area showed some multiyear dry and wet rotation events from 1987 to 2020 according to hunan statistical yearbook and the spei value and five drought events were documented i e 1988 1990 1992 2003 2007 2009 2011 and 2013 fig 6a the spei value during these events all dropped substantially especially in 2007 2009 and 2011 meanwhile the water area and grace lws had substantial decline during the drought periods and reached the lowest level of water area in 2011 which was 18 3 below the average during the 2002 2019 reservoir storage and water withdrawal have contributed to the expansion and shrinkage of wbs throughout the province both reservoir storage and water withdrawal all showed a significant increasing trend of 9 58 km3 year 1 p 0 05 and 1 27 km3 year 1 p 0 05 respectively fig 6b it can be observed when the wb area shrank during the drought events both the reservoir storage and water diversion and pumping presented increasing trends and gradually reached their peak circa 2019 after the drought events the water area showed recovery as shown by the upward trends of precipitation spei grace lws fig 6a 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with previous studies we compared our dataset with other datasets for cross comparison at the region area fig 7 as demonstrated in fig 6 except the omission information due to the source data the total area and interannual variability of wb area from our dataset had a good agreement with that of gswd slope 0 98 r2 0 96 se 0 01 fig 7a the water layer from modis land cover data had a shallower slope slope 0 83 r2 0 93 se 0 01 than that in our study and gswd this deviation indicated that the water area derived from the coarse spatial resolution remote sensing data might be underestimated because some wbs especially the small wbs under their defined resolution might be missed in images feng et al 2019 messager et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 the slopes between our study and globaland30 gfc and glcd were all below 1 suggesting underestimation of wbs in these datasets indeed these datasets while useful for characterizing water conditions at a given time lacked a dense temporal sequence observation feng et al 2020 and could not overcome the impact of regional differences in wet dry cycles and other hydrological events hamilton and casey 2016 messager et al 2016 in contrast the total water extent from ccdc dataset was larger than our estimate slope 1 21 fig 7b this might be caused by the fact that the ccdc wbs included ephemeral water bodies and wetlands and the ccdc algorithms relies on the detection of long term trends and large breakpoints rather than interannual variability thereby the ccdc has a smaller interannual variability of total water area compared with other datasets fig 7b comparing with other datasets our results showed more interannual variabilities as shown by the larger difference between estimates in wet and dry years fig 7b for example our estimate of the total area of wbs in 2002 wet year was 7104 61 km2 which is 13 and 39 larger than that of gswd and glcd respectively and 2 15 times the modis estimate in 2011 dry year our estimate was 1 03 times larger than the previous highest estimate and 1 59 times the lowest estimate for the estimate with otsu thresholding method the total area and interannual variability of water area derived from these two approaches had a good agreement the regression line is not significantly different from the 1 1 line slope 0 98 r2 0 95 fig s2 4 2 fractal dimensions of size abundance scaling the estimated pareto coefficient of the size abundance relationship from 1987 to 2020 for hunan varied from 0 94 to 0 87 fallen within the theoretical constraints 0 5 b 1 cael and seekell 2016 seekell et al 2013 the lower pareto coefficient than that for china 0 835 feng et al 2019 suggests that the small wbs weight more in hunan province than those in china our results also demonstrated that small wbs conform to power law distributions which is different from findings that small wbs deviated from the power law distribution due to the impact of topographic relief geology and complexity of landscapes seekell et al 2013 steele and heffernan 2014 previous research on size abundance scaling of wbs are mainly on testing the feasibility of the pareto law in various watersheds and regions feng et al 2019 one interesting finding from our study was that the scaling exponent showed an increasing trend from 1987 to 2020 signifying temporal change of the size abundance relationship of wbs in time to our knowledge a feature that has never been investigated the impact of human activities and climate change on the size abundance relationship of wb specifically during 1987 2020 rapid increases in agricultural land occurred in hunan especially in dongting lake region the deliberate drainage and infilling of surface water to increase arable land brought about the decline of small wbs and the shrinkage of water extent yang et al 2020 in addition regional climate factors such as the precipitation in wet year and prolong drought in dry year could result in the interannual variation of the scaling exponent steele and heffernan 2017 abundant precipitation might propel the increase of frequency and extent while drought might dry up wbs particularly small wbs feng et al 2020 these processes might modify the landscape at scales that can accounting for the increasing of the scaling exponent in wbs shi et al 2017 the temporal dynamics of size abundance relationship of wbs can not only reflect the impacts of human activities and global change on the structural change of wbs but also have important implications for global change research for example constant size abundance relationships of wbs are often used to estimate inland water carbon budget at the regional to global scales delsontro et al 2018 which likely underestimates the temporal changes of the fluxes 4 3 impacts of climatic and anthropogenic forces water area change in hunan province showed great heterogeneity across regions which were most likely caused by complex processes of accelerated climate change and direct human activities from 1987 2020 the surface water area had a positive correlation with annual precipitation p 0 05 furthermore although the precipitation in the whole hunan province showed a slightly increased trend over the last three decades deng et al 2019 the dry and wet rotation events along with variation of precipitation influence the surface water dynamics wang et al 2012 the features together present more chances for the surface water transition apart from the precipitation land use activities have contributed to the dynamic changes of wbs throughout hunan province as also shown by other studies ran and lu 2012 yang and lu 2014 for example dam and reservoir constructions can substantially change the area and storage of wbs upstream and downstream bai et al 2017 hunan province has the largest number of dams and reservoirs in china which increased rapidly during the past few decades yang and lu 2013 for example the number of reservoirs in hunan increased from 8712 to 14 047 from 1984 to 2020 an increase of 5355 or 61 2 in number the water area has a positive correlation with dam number pearson s r 0 36 p 0 05 the capacity of reservoirs increased from 20 96 km3 in 1988 51 40 km3 in 2019 a gain of 29 5 km3 or more than doubled the initial capacity hunan statistical yearbook 2020 while in the dongting lake the water area has decreased gradually since 2003 and the lake recorded the lowest water level in 2004 as a result of the impoundment of the great three gorges dam feng et al 2013 wu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 land reclamation or wbs impoldering i e convert water into other land uses has led to the constant shrinking of wbs fang et al 2018 li et al 2020 wu et al 2018 on the one hand after the release of aquaculture development directive in 1985 the fishery throughout the province increased rapidly from 1987 to 2000 which enhanced the fishery production throughout hunan in this epoch the freshwater cultured area expanded rapidly at 48 76 km2 year 1 on the other hand between 1985 and 2018 there was a rapid increase in agricultural and built up areas in dongting lake in defiance of central government directives geng et al 2021 hou et al 2020 these two processes together brought about the decline of wetlands and the shrinkage of water area in addition the continued development of urbanization industrialization and population in hunan have rapidly increased the industrial and domestic water consumption which resulted in the water area shrinkage for example according to the hunan water resources bulletin for 2001 2019 the total water consumption in hunan increased from 318 6 108 m3 in 2001 332 9 108 m3 in 2019 with an increase rate of 4 5 hunan water resources bulletin 2020 various policies have been released by regional governments to protect and promote wetland restoration since the 21st century zhao and fang 2004 historically long term farmland reclamation from lakes is a major human activity to meet the needs of a growing population wang et al 2015 however after the catastrophic flood in 1998 the government implemented the various policies and promoted the conversion of farmland to natural water to prevent floods hou et al 2020 in hunan a project in dongting lake region called 4350 was implemented since 1998 to restore the lake to its original size of 4350 km2 in 1949 zhao and fang 2004 which systematically returned parts of cultivated lands to wetlands and increased the water area yu et al 2021 in addition the government issued the national wetland conservation plan nwcp to prevent natural water from further degradation and loss wang et al 2012 4 4 uncertainties and future directions in this study we employed all available landsat images on the google earth engine gee platform to explore the spatial temporal dynamics of wbs and the associated driving forces in hunan province from 1987 to 2020 we provided the information of wb change in different wb types based on the annual water maps which are critical for water resource management however the optical images cannot penetrate the vegetation thus the wb underneath vegetation might be missed furthermore in optical images shadows usually have similar spectral characteristics to water surface making it difficult to detect water bodies with assurance zheng et al 2019 given that the fragmented nature of the inland wbs and obscuration from shadows tedious visual inspection and manual editing are usually required to improve the accuracy of water classification grill et al 2019 thus like previous studies our study should have introduced unpredictable uncertainties and underrepresent some wbs from maps for the optical remote sensing applications the last decade was a rapid development period largely driven by the stable performance of modis and landsat sensors as well as the policy of free data distribution wulder et al 2019 even though these optical remote sensing approaches are powerful in monitoring water dynamics cloud shadow vegetation obscuration spatial and temporal resolution limitations rendered them deficient in accurately detecting water bodies palmer et al 2015 to alleviate this dilemma multiple sources of remote sensing data such as sar data sentinel 2 msi and industrial sensors with high spatial and temporal resolutions should be employed in future efforts 5 conclusions in this study we employed all the available landsat images and the google earth engine gee to map and analyze annual changes of all water bodies 0 001 km2 in hunan province china from 1987 to 2020 the results provide many detailed features on surface wbs in the region a total of 76 928 wbs were detected with a total area of 4181 14 km2 both were averages during the study period with an interannual variability of 117 and 20 05 km2 year 1 respectively the total surface water area in hunan decreased from 1987 to 2020 on an average speed of 17 23 km2 year 1 with obvious differences across regions and wb sizes surface areas of small medium and large waterbodies changed at various rates and directions the size abundance relationship of wbs followed the power scaling law and the scaling exponent demonstrated strong interannual variability between 0 94 and 0 87 implying the fraction of small wb number has decreased over the past three decades the temporal change of the size abundance relationship a feature that has rarely been studied in the past reflects the strong and dynamic imprints of both human activities and regional climate change the wb area increased in some regions and watersheds mainly resulted from the filling of reservoirs and the restoration of wetlands and wbs the area loss was mainly associated with human actions including the intensification of agriculture land reclamation or wbs impoldering and water consumption and the large variability of wb area in wet and dry years was mainly driven by the variation of precipitation and water withdrawal our efforts demonstrate that the long term dense satellite data has the potential to effectively characterize the distributional properties and change dynamics of wbs and their responses to environmental changes in large regions which is important for advancing hydrological research and water resource management the approach described in this study can certainly be applied to other regions in the world credit authorship contribution statement shuguang liu
