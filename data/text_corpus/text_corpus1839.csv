9195,it is a huge challenge for china to produce enough food on its own croplands to feed a population of over 1 4 billion plastic film mulching technology has been applied widely in the past decades and china represents a major player in terms of plastic film use in the world so far a series of field experiments have been conducted across the croplands to investigate the effects of plastic film mulching on crop productivity this offers an opportunity to comprehensively identify the crop yield and water use improvement potential and their key drivers based on local environmental conditions here a synthetic analysis was conducted to illustrate the overall effects of plastic film mulching on relative changes in crop yield water use efficiency wue and evapotranspiration et as well as the key impacting factors behind the changes the results showed that plastic film mulching significantly increased crop yield by 39 5 and wue by 37 9 whereas the increase of et under plastic film mulching 1 9 was insignificant the crop yield improvement under traditional film was significantly higher than that under degradable film whereas the difference of crop yield improvement between film colours was not significant furthermore crop yield and wue improvements varied among different cropping regions and crop species and were influenced by mean annual precipitation map mean annual temperature mat elevation and soil organic carbon soc concentration generally the performance of plastic film mulching in sustaining crop production was better in regions with poor environmental conditions including low temperature and precipitation high elevation and poor soc content unlike the significant increases of yield and wue in most cases the changes in et varied among groups ranging from significant decline to insignificant change to significant increase the results of this study illustrate that plastic film mulching plays a critical role in terms of promoting crop production improving water use increasing farmers income and securing food security the successful application of plastic film mulching in china may have important implications for other developing regions in the world to overcome the severe problems of food shortage however the adverse effects on environment must be properly addressed by upgrading mulching film materials in the future keywords food security plastic film mulching crop yield water use efficiency evapotranspiration china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction china as one of the largest agriculture countries is facing a huge challenge to feed a population of over 1 4 billion the redline of 1 8 billion mu 666 67 m2 per mu of arable land has been emphasized repeatedly and monitored seriously by the chinese government in order to ensure national food security liu et al 2014 yin et al 2019 nevertheless it was reported that the total food imports by china have reached 164 5 million tons in 2021 which is nearly a quarter of its own production of 682 85 million tons nbsc 2021 china has determined to keep the rice bowl firmly in its own hands fang and shuai 2021 gaudreau 2019 therefore increasing crop production per capita in croplands is not only essential for china to solve the problems of food shortage but also critical for global food security and market stability in recent decades a range of conservative and innovative agriculture technologies have been adopted worldwide aiming at increasing crop production such as tillage reduction crop rotation and mulching jat et al 2020 pittelkow et al 2015 however the preferences of these new technologies vary among countries depending on their farming traditions and natural conditions of cropland for instance in the north america and the south america no tillage combined with residue retention has been applied widely since 1960 s to reduce soil erosion and increase crop yield huggins and reganold 2008 in china on the other hand straws have been an important resource for feeding livestock and cooking in rural areas so crop residues are mostly harvested and collected for other uses shen et al 2011 instead plastic film mulching has been applied widely to nearly 13 of china s croplands accounting for 60 of the plastic film used for agricultural land mulching worldwide sun et al 2020 the total amount of plastic film increased significantly from about 0 3 million tons to 1 5 million tons from 1991 to 2017 with an annual growth rate of 30 and covering 18 4 million ha croplands in recent years gao et al 2019 steinmetz et al 2016 this indicates that plastic film mulching represents one of the most favorable new agriculture measures to chinese farmers as one of the most popular agricultural technologies in china the high application rate of plastic film mulching relies on the high increase of crop yield and thus the high return of income fu et al 2021 sun et al 2020 applying plastic film mulching can efficiently improve soil hydrothermal conditions by reducing nitrogen leaching increasing soil temperature and reducing soil water loss through evaporation gu et al 2020 adoption of plastic film mulching may also control weed growth and reduce water and nutrients losses to the weed gao et al 2019 therefore the role of plastic film mulching in china s food security has been becoming more and more critical in the past decades accompanying its widespread a range of field experiments have been conducted in china to investigate the mechanisms of plastic film mulching on crop yield improvement nitrogen and water use promotion soil organic carbon accumulation greenhouse gases emission reduction etc lee et al 2021 ma et al 2018 wang et al 2021 yang et al 2022 2018 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2012 since the main purpose of the farmers adoption of plastic film mulching is promoting income by increasing crop yield the main focus of these experiments among others has been the crop yield and related impacting factors based on these experiments a series of meta analyses have been published in recent years to investigate the key drivers for crop production and water use improvement under plastic film mulching for instance sun et al 2020 comprehensively investigated the overall effects of plastic film mulching on crop yield and water use efficiency wue based on data derived from 51 crop species across china and found plastic film mulching improved crop yield and wue by 45 5 and 58 0 respectively gao et al 2019 examined the impact of climatic conditions and crop species in different cropping regions in china on crop yield and wue under plastic film mulching they reported that plastic film mulching significantly increased crop yield by 24 32 and wue by 27 63 ma et al 2018 quantified the impacts of plastic film mulching on crop yield soil water nitrate and organic carbon in northwestern china although the progresses above are essential to further our understanding on how plastic film mulching impacts on crop yield several knowledge gaps remain to be filled for instance rice maize wheat and potato are recognized as the top four food crops in the world and they also play an important role in ensuring food security in china fao 2015 it is necessary to understand how the application of plastic film mulching impact on the production of the key food crops in order to ensure food security more importantly crop yield depends on various variables including crop species plastic film color and type soil organic carbon soc content precipitation temperature and topography only a few of these variables have been investigated in previous studies and the effects of several key drivers for crop yield and water use changes e g soc content and topography remains unclear this significantly limits us from comprehensively understanding the potentially different efficacies of plastic film mulching in contrasting environmental conditions in addition crop yield wue and evapotranspiration et are three key indexes in plastic film mulching research to the best of our knowledge however only yield and wue were investigated in most studies e g gao et al 2019 apart from the significant increases of crop yield and wue it remains unclear how plastic film mulching may impact on et in croplands under various environmental conditions and crop species in this study a synthetic analysis was conducted based on data regarding the effects of plastic film mulching on crop yield and water use improvement obtained from field experiments across china we aimed to comprehensively 1 investigate the overall impacts of plastic film mulching on improvements of crop yield wue and et 2 identify the key drivers for crop yield and water use improvements 3 provide solid scientific evidence for the further application of plastic film mulching in achieving food security 2 materials and methods the datasets of this study were based on peer reviewed papers published in english or chinese as well as master and phd theses published online in chinese two databases were used to search the related literature including web of science wos http www webofknowledge com and the china national knowledge infrastructure cnki http www cnki net the two databases could cover the most influential literature in english and in chinese respectively key word searches were performed first to select the most related literature by using the search terms of plastic film mulching crop yield crop production water use efficiency evapotranspiration and china the following criteria were then adopted to identify the literature falling properly into the scope of this study 1 studies reported at least one data type of crop yield wue and et 2 studies reported comparisons of plastic film mulching and non plastic film mulching based on field experiments 3 plastic film mulching and non plastic film mulching treatments received the same field managements including tillage fertilization and irrigation as well as herbicide and pesticide application rate 4 data obtained from the same experiment but reported in different literature were only included once the main reason that some data were reported in different references was that the data from several phd and master theses were repeatedly used to publish journal papers finally we identified 186 references falling into the scope of this study fig 1 the main reasons to exclude the rest of the literature were 1 they reported changes in crop yield or water use under different tillage practices 2 the plastic film mulching was combined with other field managements such as a different fertilization application rate or different tillage practices compared to the control groups after literature screening data of crop yield wue and et were first collected directly from tables or indirectly from figures with getdata software getdata graph digitizer http getdata graph digitizer com for those references only reporting data of yield and wue et was calculated as the ratio of yield to wue similarly for references only reporting data of yield and et wue was calculated as the ratio of yield to et in addition in order to investigate the different responses of crop yield and water use to various environmental conditions and field managements the most frequently reported information including cropping region crop species plastic film color and type mean annual precipitation map mean annual temperature mat elevation and soc concentration were also collected some information could not be obtained from the references simply because the authors did not report such information in this case we thus only used the data available to conduct further analyses it should be noted that some basic information such as map and mat were not available from the published papers in order to maximize the use of the field experimental data we extracted the climatic data from the local statistic year books if available although these data were not observed during the experiments they could reflect the average climatic level over the long term in china there are four major cropping regions i e northeast china north china northwest china and south china xiao et al 2020b data were classified as the categories above to identify the responses of crop production and water use to plastic film mulching in different regions wheat corn rice and potato represent the four top food crops in the world and they are cultivated widely under plastic film mulching in china therefore we investigated how plastic film mulching impacted on crop production and water use for the four key crop species furthermore plastic film color and type were the most frequently reported indexes in terms of plastic film properties in the references according to the categories in the references film colors were divided into the black and the transparent and film types were divided into the traditional and the degradable following a previous study zheng et al 2014 map were divided into 400 mm 400 600 mm and 600 mm corresponding to arid semi arid and humid regions in china mat of 10 is an important threshold because most woody plants or crops grow actively when mat is higher than 10 hou et al 2014 thus mat were divided into 10 and 10 classes corresponding to cold and temperate regions in china elevation of 1000 m represents a critical threshold to divide the topography in china jin et al 2016 wang et al 2020 it was adopted here to investigate the importance of topography on crop production and water use in low and high elevation regions respectively the concentration of soc is regarded as a key parameter of soil fertilization and soc concentration were divided into 10 g kg 1 and 10 g kg 1 following a previous study xiao et al 2021 such divisions not only reflected the geographical and climatic regions used in previous studies xiao et al 2020b zheng et al 2014 but also ensured that we obtained a relatively balanced distribution of datasets for each class of those environmental conditions listed above during data compilation it was found that standard errors or deviations of crop yield wue and et were mostly not reported in the references as previous studies suggested zhang et al 2013 2014 it was unable to account for variable errors or deviations among different experiments due to the unavailability of such data hunter and schmidt 1990 the relative changes in crop yield wue et under plastic film mulching compared to that under non plastic film mulching were then calculated directly for each experimental site following eq 1 1 relative change traita traitb traitb 100 where traita and traitb indicate crop yield wue and et under plastic film mulching and non plastic film mulching respectively after obtaining the relative changes in crop yield wue and et of each experimental site we further calculated descriptive statistics including mean values and standard deviations for all three traits respectively in addition to the overall relative changes we also calculated relative changes for each class of cropping region crop species plastic film color and type map mat elevation and soc concentration in order to examine if the overall relative changes in the three traits above were significant different from zero and if the relative changes were significantly different among various classes further statistical analyses were performed we first performed the d agostino pearson test to examine whether the datasets were normally distributed in case the dataset was normally distributed one sample t tests were conducted to examine whether the relative changes were significantly from zero for those datasets failed normality tests wilcoxon signed rank tests were then conducted to examine if the relative changes were significantly different from zero the differences of relative changes among various groups of certain impacting factors including cropping region plastic film color crop species map mat elevation and soc concentration were tested by one way anova for all the significance tests confidence level of p 0 05 was considered significant 3 results plastic film mulching significantly promoted crop yield by 39 5 and wue by 37 9 the increase of et under plastic film mulching 1 9 however was not significant fig 2 crop yields in different cropping regions were in the order of south china 46 3 northwest china 44 1 north china 24 2 northeast china 14 0 crop yields in northeast china and south china were significantly different from that of northwest china for wue and et despite the insignificant differences among cropping regions the trends of northwest china north china northeast china were similar with that of crop yield fig 3 plastic film mulching significantly increased yields of rice wheat potato and corn by 50 2 42 6 39 3 and 33 2 respectively the difference of yield between rice and potato was significant the increases of wue in wheat corn and potato under plastic film mulching were also significant and the increase of wue in potato was significantly higher than that of wheat the highest increase of et was observed for wheat which was significantly higher than the insignificant increase of corn and the significant reduction of potato fig 4 the increases of crop yield and wue as well as the reduction of et under black plastic film were generally higher than that under transparent plastic film however the differences were not significant for plastic film type the crop yield improvement under traditional film was 39 4 which was significantly higher than that under degradable film 18 5 the changes in wue were not significantly different between the two types of film and no significant changes in et were observed for the two types of film either fig 5 the highest crop yield improvement was observed in areas with map of 400 mm 53 8 which was significantly higher than areas with map of 400 600 30 8 and 600 mm 40 8 the improvement of wue in areas with map of 400 mm were also higher than that of 400 600 and 600 mm classes but the differences were not significant adoption of plastic film mulching significantly increased et in areas with map of 400 600 mm and no significant changes were observed in areas with map of 400 600 and 600 mm the improvements of crop yield and wue under plastic film mulching were significant in different temperature regions and the increases in areas with map of 10 45 8 were significantly higher than that of 10 30 9 the relative changes in et were not significantly different between the two temperature classes fig 6 the crop yield increase under plastic film mulching in areas with elevation of 1000 m 46 9 was nearly three times higher than that of 1000 m 17 3 similarly wue improvement in areas with elevation of 1000 m 48 7 was also much higher than that of 1000 m 14 0 despite the higher increase of et in areas with elevation of 1000 m compared to that of 1000 m the difference was not significant however fig 7 plastic film mulching significantly increased crop yield and wue for the two soc concentration classes whereas the changes in et were not significant crop yield improvement in areas with soc concentration of 10 g kg 1 21 0 was significantly higher than that of 10 g kg 1 11 0 however the differences of wue and et between the two classes with different soc concentrations were not significant fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 overall impacts of plastic film mulching on crop yield and wue improvements the overall increases of crop yield by 39 5 and wue by 37 9 illustrate that the effects of plastic film mulching on improvements of crop yield and water use are remarkable in china fig 2 these results are in line with previous studies regarding efficacy of plastic film mulching on crop production for instance zhang et al 2013 reported that plastic film mulching promoted wheat yield and wue by 31 6 and 28 on the chinese loess plateau average effects of plastic film mulching on crop yield and wue improvements in china were 24 32 and 27 6 respectively gao et al 2019 furthermore a range of meta studies on conservation tillage have been published and provided solid and comprehensive evidence on their efficacy in china in the past decades plastic film mulching may represent one of the most effective technologies compared to other conservation measures such as no tillage and straw mulching in xiao et al 2020b the highest crop yield improvements were found in conventional tillage plus straw mulching and no tillage with straw mulching 15 18 in china in other studies the increase of crop yield under conservation tillage was usually no more than 10 zheng et al 2014 such a crop production improvement was only less than a half of that promoted by plastic film mulching in this study 39 5 if combined with other conservation measures the crop yield improvement under plastic film mulching could be even higher it was reported that plastic film mulching with ridges finally led to an additional crop yield increase of 17 4 sun et al 2020 these results demonstrate plastic film mulching represents a critical management for crop production improvement and have significantly contributed to food security of china considering the total application area of nearly 20 million ha already 4 2 key impacting factors on crop yield and wue improvements under pm we found the efficacy of plastic film mulching on crop yield and wue improvements was dependent on cropping regions the highest efficacy was observed in south china and northwest china fig 3 however the mechanisms in the two regions might not be the same in south china weed control has been a major challenge for crop growth adoption of plastic film mulching could largely inhibit weed growth by as much as 90 which benefits for higher nutrient uptake and space for crops and consequently promotes crop production and water use gao et al 2019 in northwest china on the other hand water stress and cool temperature represent the two key limiting factors for crop growth sun et al 2020 it was reported nearly 80 of weekly precipitation could be lost through evaporation in crop fields without plastic film mulching in this region ren et al 2008 low air and soil temperatures especially during spring significantly decline germination rate and slow crop growth awal and ikeda 2002 yu et al 2018 adoption of plastic film mulching can significantly reduce the water loss from evaporation and increase soil temperature finally contributing to crop yield improvement zhou et al 2009 the lowest crop yield and wue improvements were found in northeast china where the temperature represents the key constraint factor due to the high latitude it has been widely reported the effect of plastic film mulching on increasing topsoil temperature is considerable wang et al 2011 considering the higher crop yield improvement in the water stressed northwest china than the temperature stressed northeast china however our results confirmed that the impact of plastic film mulching on soil temperature had less of an importance in yield increase compared to on water sun et al 2020 applying plastic film mulching could significantly promote crop yield but high expectations should be avoided in the cold regions the efficacy of plastic film mulching on crop yield and wue varied among different crops fig 4 nevertheless the improvements of crop yield and wue were all considerably significant because even the lowest increase could also reach 33 such a crop yield increase was overwhelmingly higher than the highest yield increase of 7 5 observed in maize among different crop species under no tillage zheng et al 2014 these results indicate that adopting proper crop species with higher improvement under plastic film mulching is beneficial for crop yield and income on the basis of local conditions the results showed that crop yield improvement under black film mulching was slightly higher than that under transparent film mulching but the difference was not significant fig 5 this agrees well with the results of a previous study gao et al 2019 although both transparent and black films can increase soil temperature and reduce soil water evaporation the colours of plastic film mainly affect crop growth through influencing sunlight sreedevi et al 2017 the transparent color is beneficial for the topsoil temperature increase whereas the black color strongly absorbs sun light and thus suppresses weed growth leading to a reduced soil nutrients loss and increased yield and wue rajablariani et al 2012 it was reported that transparent film performed better than black film in certain regions with mat of 10 15 or map 500 mm or for certain plants gao et al 2019 therefore the efficacy of film colour depends on cropping regions or crop species but the overall differences were found not significant in this study as for the film type the traditional film generally performed better than the degradable one fig 5 probably because the degradable film has a higher permeability due to gradual disintegration on site steinmetz et al 2016 the higher permeability may reduce its ability to maintain soil temperature and moisture furthermore degradable films especially the liquid degradable film carries higher risks to be damaged by raindrops in heavy precipitations preventing the soil from saving more water and increasing soil temperature gu et al 2020 it is well documented that plastic film mulching increases crop production through increasing soil temperature and moisture wang et al 2022 our results further suggested that crop yield improvement under plastic film mulching was more significant in arid cold areas than humid temperate areas fig 6 this is understandable because the water and sun radiation shortage are more severe for crop production in arid cold areas compared to humid temperate areas sun et al 2020 the remedy resulted from application of plastic film mulching played a critical role in improving crop growth environment this is particularly important to accelerate the speed of germination and emergence in the early growing stage at relatively low temperatures and delay seeding emergence in the east and west regions of china gao et al 2019 yu et al 2018 considering the arid cold areas are mainly located in northwest china where the average elevation is over 1000 m we consequently observed the higher crop yield and wue in high elevation regions 1000 m than low elevation regions 1000 m fig 7 the cultivated land per capita as well as the average crop yield per hectare in arid cold regions e g northwest china is the lowest in the whole country li et al 2013 xiao et al 2020b our results suggest plastic film mulching plays a critical role in terms of increasing crop production and the income of the local farmers actually our previous studies have illustrated that the efficacy of conservation measures including no tillage straw mulching is also significantly higher in the arid cold and high elevation regions compared to the humid temperate and low elevation regions in terms of increasing crop production reducing wind and water erosion xiao et al 2021 2019 2020a applying conservation measures such as conservation tillage and plastic film mulching should therefore be regarded as a top priority in the regions with poor climatic and soil conditions a sustainable and conservative agriculture system in northwestern regions may not only improve the local environment but also benefit the food security of china our results showed that the increase of crop yield in fields with soc concentration 10 g kg 1 was two times that with soc concentration 10 g kg 1 suggesting a better performance of plastic film mulching in less fertilized croplands fig 8 such a result highlights the importance of applying plastic film mulching in poorly fertilized soils to achieve a better crop production however the potential degradation of soc pool under plastic film mulching deserves further attention it was reported that the increased soil temperature and water content in the tillage depth may promote soc decomposition and decrease its pool size ma et al 2018 wang et al 2021 some studies thus argued that plastic film carried certain risks to be regarded as sustainable agriculture practice steinmetz et al 2016 although our results cannot provide solid evidence regarding the relationship between soc pool and crop yield under plastic film mulching further research are definitely needed to investigate whether the higher increase of crop yield in soc poor soils will lead to higher soc loss or not plastic film mulching combined with other conservation practices such as no tillage and straw mulching that are able to accumulate soc might be an option to at least maintain the soc pool size 4 3 uncertain changes in et under plastic film mulching the overall change in et under plastic film mulching was not significant which was different from the clearly significant increases of crop yield and wue by definition et is composed of evaporation and transpiration crop growth mainly depends on transpiration rather than evaporation considering application of plastic film mulching can largely decrease evaporation by over 50 chen et al 2019 the average insignificant increase of et indicates that the application of plastic film mulching largely transfers the decreased evaporation into transpiration and consequently promotes crop yield improvement chai et al 2022 it was reported that plastic film could increase crop transpiration by over 30 chen et al 2019 in addition the changes in crop yield were generally in line with the changes in wue for all impacting factor groups of this study considering the changes in et were not significantly or at least relatively low in most cases it mathematically led to a close relationship between crop yield changes and wue changes this is simply because wue is calculated as the ratio of crop yield and et notably the changes in et varied among groups ranging from significant decline to insignificant change to significant increase figs 3 8 significant reductions of et were observed in subgroups including region of northeast china crop species of potato plastic film color of black whereas significant increases of et were observed in subgroups including crop species of wheat map of 400 600 mm and soc concentration of 10 g kg 1 significant decreases of et may correspond to higher crop yield improvement e g in subgroups of the crop species of potato and the plastic film color of black in contrast significant increase of et may also correspond to the lower yield improvement including the subgroups of map of 400 600 mm class and the soc concentration 10 g kg 1 class for the species of wheat the increase of et corresponded to an increase of wheat yield compared to other species while the decrease of et in the region of northeast corresponded to a decrease of crop yield compared to other regions such results indicate the changes in et highly depend on cropping region crop species plastic film color map and soc concentration furthermore the increase of et does not necessarily lead to the increase of crop yield and vice versa for instance applying plastic film to potato led to a higher yield at a reduced consumption of water indicating the higher transpiration rate in et however in nearly all cases investigated here evaporation and transpiration were not clearly separated so we were not able to identify how much evaporation was transferred into transpiration in different scenarios quantitatively distinguishing evaporation and transpiration is necessary in the future field studies to thoroughly understand the relationship between crop yield and water use for various crops in different environmental conditions blum 2009 4 4 policy implications 4 4 1 global food security the successful application of plastic film mulching in china may have useful implications for other developing regions in the world where other kinds of conservation measures have been widely adopted but the application rate of plastic film mulching is still low for instance in the past decades conservation agriculture has become a dominant paradigm among scientists and policy makers in sub saharan africa in order to achieve sustainable improvement of crop production corbeels et al 2020 however the overall increase of crop production under conservation agriculture in this region is very limited with an increase of only 3 7 based on 933 pairs of field experimental trials corbeels et al 2020 it thus may not represent an ideal technology for the smallholder farmers in this region to increase crop production and ensure food security this indicates that the farmers in this region must turn to find other substitutes in order to realize intensification of crop production crop yield improvement may vary depending on climatic conditions soil properties and crop species the overall results of this study however suggest a great advantage of plastic film mulching that is notably the better performance in environment with poor conditions e g arid cold regions and low soc concentration soils the results obtained based on experiments conducted in china indicates that it is worth further verifying the benefits of plastic film mulching which may have a promising potential to overcome the shortcomings of conservation agriculture in fact the major limitation for promoting plastic film mulching in developing regions is the availability of plastic film it is critical for the smallholder farmers to obtain plastic film easily at an acceptable price this certainly needs helps from developed countries and countries with rich experiences in plastic film application such as china international organizations including fao and world bank should also pay more attention to plastic film mulching in sustainable programs in order to realize food security in the developing regions such as sub saharan africa 4 4 2 environmental pollution despite the remarkable performance of plastic film mulching in water use and crop production improvements a critical issue that should never be overlooked is its potential impact on environment the use of plastic film especially the traditional film produces a considerable amount of hardly recyclable waste it will cause environmental pollution through various processes including incineration emissions landfill leaching and accumulation of microplastic residues steinmetz et al 2016 the development and application of more degradable mulching film appears a promising choice to overcome the adverse impacts on environment the results of this study however suggest that the efficacy of degradable materials used in nowadays seems still lower than the traditional film together with the higher cost it may limit the enthusiasm of the farmers to adopt the more environment friendly mulches in addition the current degradable film mainly involves mechanical rather than chemical breakdown leading to an accumulation of invisible microplastics briassoulis et al 2015 the innovation on degradable film materials thus represents a critical step in order to maximize the benefits of plastic film mulching technology agriculturally economically and environmentally 5 conclusions the results of this study demonstrated that the crop yield and wue improvements under plastic film mulching could reach up to 40 compared to non mulching fields whereas the changes in et were overall insignificant the increase of crop yield and wue highly depended on cropping region crop species climatic conditions film color and type topography and soc concentration in general plastic film mulching had a better performance in areas with low map mat soc concentration and high elevation in china where the crop production and average income were low in addition despite the average insignificant changes in et our results showed that the changes in et highly depended on cropping region crop species plastic film color map and soc concentration varying from significant decline to significant increase overall plastic film mulching has a critical role to play in china to ensure food security and develop local economy the successful application of plastic film mulching in china may have important implications for other developing regions in the world e g sub sahara africa where the environmental conditions are poor and other conservation tillage practices are unlikely to guarantee food security notably the cost of using plastic film mulching may represent a critical obstacle for its extension and the adverse effects on environment must be properly addressed plastic film mulching deserves further attention from agronomists and policy makers and international cooperation is necessary in the future to grantee the accessibility in

increasing crop production per capita in croplands is not only essential for china to solve the problems of food shortage but also critical for global food security and market stability in recent decades a range of conservative and innovative agriculture technologies have been adopted worldwide aiming at increasing crop production such as tillage reduction crop rotation and mulching jat et al 2020 pittelkow et al 2015 however the preferences of these new technologies vary among countries depending on their farming traditions and natural conditions of cropland for instance in the north america and the south america no tillage combined with residue retention has been applied widely since 1960 s to reduce soil erosion and increase crop yield huggins and reganold 2008 in china on the other hand straws have been an important resource for feeding livestock and cooking in rural areas so crop residues are mostly harvested and collected for other uses shen et al 2011 instead plastic film mulching has been applied widely to nearly 13 of china s croplands accounting for 60 of the plastic film used for agricultural land mulching worldwide sun et al 2020 the total amount of plastic film increased significantly from about 0 3 million tons to 1 5 million tons from 1991 to 2017 with an annual growth rate of 30 and covering 18 4 million ha croplands in recent years gao et al 2019 steinmetz et al 2016 this indicates that plastic film mulching represents one of the most favorable new agriculture measures to chinese farmers as one of the most popular agricultural technologies in china the high application rate of plastic film mulching relies on the high increase of crop yield and thus the high return of income fu et al 2021 sun et al 2020 applying plastic film mulching can efficiently improve soil hydrothermal conditions by reducing nitrogen leaching increasing soil temperature and reducing soil water loss through evaporation gu et al 2020 adoption of plastic film mulching may also control weed growth and reduce water and nutrients losses to the weed gao et al 2019 therefore the role of plastic film mulching in china s food security has been becoming more and more critical in the past decades accompanying its widespread a range of field experiments have been conducted in china to investigate the mechanisms of plastic film mulching on crop yield improvement nitrogen and water use promotion soil organic carbon accumulation greenhouse gases emission reduction etc lee et al 2021 ma et al 2018 wang et al 2021 yang et al 2022 2018 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2012 since the main purpose of the farmers adoption of plastic film mulching is promoting income by increasing crop yield the main focus of these experiments among others has been the crop yield and related impacting factors based on these experiments a series of meta analyses have been published in recent years to investigate the key drivers for crop production and water use improvement under plastic film mulching for instance sun et al 2020 comprehensively investigated the overall effects of plastic film mulching on crop yield and water use efficiency wue based on data derived from 51 crop species across china and found plastic film mulching improved crop yield and wue by 45 5 and 58 0 respectively gao et al 2019 examined the impact of climatic conditions and crop species in different cropping regions in china on crop yield and wue under plastic film mulching they reported that plastic film mulching significantly increased crop yield by 24 32 and wue by 27 63 ma et al 2018 quantified the impacts of plastic film mulching on crop yield soil water nitrate and organic carbon in northwestern china although the progresses above are essential to further our understanding on how plastic film mulching impacts on crop yield several knowledge gaps remain to be filled for instance rice maize wheat and potato are recognized as the top four food crops in the world and they also play an important role in ensuring food security in china fao 2015 it is necessary to understand how the application of plastic film mulching impact on the production of the key food crops in order to ensure food security more importantly crop yield depends on various variables including crop species plastic film color and type soil organic carbon soc content precipitation temperature and topography only a few of these variables have been investigated in previous studies and the effects of several key drivers for crop yield and water use changes e g soc content and topography remains unclear this significantly limits us from comprehensively understanding the potentially different efficacies of plastic film mulching in contrasting environmental conditions in addition crop yield wue and evapotranspiration et are three key indexes in plastic film mulching research to the best of our knowledge however only yield and wue were investigated in most studies e g gao et al 2019 apart from the significant increases of crop yield and wue it remains unclear how plastic film mulching may impact on et in croplands under various environmental conditions and crop species in this study a synthetic analysis was conducted based on data regarding the effects of plastic film mulching on crop yield and water use improvement obtained from field experiments across china we aimed to comprehensively 1 investigate the overall impacts of plastic film mulching on improvements of crop yield wue and et 2 identify the key drivers for crop yield and water use improvements 3 provide solid scientific evidence for the further application of plastic film mulching in achieving food security 2 materials and methods the datasets of this study were based on peer reviewed papers published in english or chinese as well as master and phd theses published online in chinese two databases were used to search the related literature including web of science wos http www webofknowledge com and the china national knowledge infrastructure cnki http www cnki net the two databases could cover the most influential literature in english and in chinese respectively key word searches were performed first to select the most related literature by using the search terms of plastic film mulching crop yield crop production water use efficiency evapotranspiration and china the following criteria were then adopted to identify the literature falling properly into the scope of this study 1 studies reported at least one data type of crop yield wue and et 2 studies reported comparisons of plastic film mulching and non plastic film mulching based on field experiments 3 plastic film mulching and non plastic film mulching treatments received the same field managements including tillage fertilization and irrigation as well as herbicide and pesticide application rate 4 data obtained from the same experiment but reported in different literature were only included once the main reason that some data were reported in different references was that the data from several phd and master theses were repeatedly used to publish journal papers finally we identified 186 references falling into the scope of this study fig 1 the main reasons to exclude the rest of the literature were 1 they reported changes in crop yield or water use under different tillage practices 2 the plastic film mulching was combined with other field managements such as a different fertilization application rate or different tillage practices compared to the control groups after literature screening data of crop yield wue and et were first collected directly from tables or indirectly from figures with getdata software getdata graph digitizer http getdata graph digitizer com for those references only reporting data of yield and wue et was calculated as the ratio of yield to wue similarly for references only reporting data of yield and et wue was calculated as the ratio of yield to et in addition in order to investigate the different responses of crop yield and water use to various environmental conditions and field managements the most frequently reported information including cropping region crop species plastic film color and type mean annual precipitation map mean annual temperature mat elevation and soc concentration were also collected some information could not be obtained from the references simply because the authors did not report such information in this case we thus only used the data available to conduct further analyses it should be noted that some basic information such as map and mat were not available from the published papers in order to maximize the use of the field experimental data we extracted the climatic data from the local statistic year books if available although these data were not observed during the experiments they could reflect the average climatic level over the long term in china there are four major cropping regions i e northeast china north china northwest china and south china xiao et al 2020b data were classified as the categories above to identify the responses of crop production and water use to plastic film mulching in different regions wheat corn rice and potato represent the four top food crops in the world and they are cultivated widely under plastic film mulching in china therefore we investigated how plastic film mulching impacted on crop production and water use for the four key crop species furthermore plastic film color and type were the most frequently reported indexes in terms of plastic film properties in the references according to the categories in the references film colors were divided into the black and the transparent and film types were divided into the traditional and the degradable following a previous study zheng et al 2014 map were divided into 400 mm 400 600 mm and 600 mm corresponding to arid semi arid and humid regions in china mat of 10 is an important threshold because most woody plants or crops grow actively when mat is higher than 10 hou et al 2014 thus mat were divided into 10 and 10 classes corresponding to cold and temperate regions in china elevation of 1000 m represents a critical threshold to divide the topography in china jin et al 2016 wang et al 2020 it was adopted here to investigate the importance of topography on crop production and water use in low and high elevation regions respectively the concentration of soc is regarded as a key parameter of soil fertilization and soc concentration were divided into 10 g kg 1 and 10 g kg 1 following a previous study xiao et al 2021 such divisions not only reflected the geographical and climatic regions used in previous studies xiao et al 2020b zheng et al 2014 but also ensured that we obtained a relatively balanced distribution of datasets for each class of those environmental conditions listed above during data compilation it was found that standard errors or deviations of crop yield wue and et were mostly not reported in the references as previous studies suggested zhang et al 2013 2014 it was unable to account for variable errors or deviations among different experiments due to the unavailability of such data hunter and schmidt 1990 the relative changes in crop yield wue et under plastic film mulching compared to that under non plastic film mulching were then calculated directly for each experimental site following eq 1 1 relative change traita traitb traitb 100 where traita and traitb indicate crop yield wue and et under plastic film mulching and non plastic film mulching respectively after obtaining the relative changes in crop yield wue and et of each experimental site we further calculated descriptive statistics including mean values and standard deviations for all three traits respectively in addition to the overall relative changes we also calculated relative changes for each class of cropping region crop species plastic film color and type map mat elevation and soc concentration in order to examine if the overall relative changes in the three traits above were significant different from zero and if the relative changes were significantly different among various classes further statistical analyses were performed we first performed the d agostino pearson test to examine whether the datasets were normally distributed in case the dataset was normally distributed one sample t tests were conducted to examine whether the relative changes were significantly from zero for those datasets failed normality tests wilcoxon signed rank tests were then conducted to examine if the relative changes were significantly different from zero the differences of relative changes among various groups of certain impacting factors including cropping region plastic film color crop species map mat elevation and soc concentration were tested by one way anova for all the significance tests confidence level of p 0 05 was considered significant 3 results plastic film mulching significantly promoted crop yield by 39 5 and wue by 37 9 the increase of et under plastic film mulching 1 9 however was not significant fig 2 crop yields in different cropping regions were in the order of south china 46 3 northwest china 44 1 north china 24 2 northeast china 14 0 crop yields in northeast china and south china were significantly different from that of northwest china for wue and et despite the insignificant differences among cropping regions the trends of northwest china north china northeast china were similar with that of crop yield fig 3 plastic film mulching significantly increased yields of rice wheat potato and corn by 50 2 42 6 39 3 and 33 2 respectively the difference of yield between rice and potato was significant the increases of wue in wheat corn and potato under plastic film mulching were also significant and the increase of wue in potato was significantly higher than that of wheat the highest increase of et was observed for wheat which was significantly higher than the insignificant increase of corn and the significant reduction of potato fig 4 the increases of crop yield and wue as well as the reduction of et under black plastic film were generally higher than that under transparent plastic film however the differences were not significant for plastic film type the crop yield improvement under traditional film was 39 4 which was significantly higher than that under degradable film 18 5 the changes in wue were not significantly different between the two types of film and no significant changes in et were observed for the two types of film either fig 5 the highest crop yield improvement was observed in areas with map of 400 mm 53 8 which was significantly higher than areas with map of 400 600 30 8 and 600 mm 40 8 the improvement of wue in areas with map of 400 mm were also higher than that of 400 600 and 600 mm classes but the differences were not significant adoption of plastic film mulching significantly increased et in areas with map of 400 600 mm and no significant changes were observed in areas with map of 400 600 and 600 mm the improvements of crop yield and wue under plastic film mulching were significant in different temperature regions and the increases in areas with map of 10 45 8 were significantly higher than that of 10 30 9 the relative changes in et were not significantly different between the two temperature classes fig 6 the crop yield increase under plastic film mulching in areas with elevation of 1000 m 46 9 was nearly three times higher than that of 1000 m 17 3 similarly wue improvement in areas with elevation of 1000 m 48 7 was also much higher than that of 1000 m 14 0 despite the higher increase of et in areas with elevation of 1000 m compared to that of 1000 m the difference was not significant however fig 7 plastic film mulching significantly increased crop yield and wue for the two soc concentration classes whereas the changes in et were not significant crop yield improvement in areas with soc concentration of 10 g kg 1 21 0 was significantly higher than that of 10 g kg 1 11 0 however the differences of wue and et between the two classes with different soc concentrations were not significant fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 overall impacts of plastic film mulching on crop yield and wue improvements the overall increases of crop yield by 39 5 and wue by 37 9 illustrate that the effects of plastic film mulching on improvements of crop yield and water use are remarkable in china fig 2 these results are in line with previous studies regarding efficacy of plastic film mulching on crop production for instance zhang et al 2013 reported that plastic film mulching promoted wheat yield and wue by 31 6 and 28 on the chinese loess plateau average effects of plastic film mulching on crop yield and wue improvements in china were 24 32 and 27 6 respectively gao et al 2019 furthermore a range of meta studies on conservation tillage have been published and provided solid and comprehensive evidence on their efficacy in china in the past decades plastic film mulching may represent one of the most effective technologies compared to other conservation measures such as no tillage and straw mulching in xiao et al 2020b the highest crop yield improvements were found in conventional tillage plus straw mulching and no tillage with straw mulching 15 18 in china in other studies the increase of crop yield under conservation tillage was usually no more than 10 zheng et al 2014 such a crop production improvement was only less than a half of that promoted by plastic film mulching in this study 39 5 if combined with other conservation measures the crop yield improvement under plastic film mulching could be even higher it was reported that plastic film mulching with ridges finally led to an additional crop yield increase of 17 4 sun et al 2020 these results demonstrate plastic film mulching represents a critical management for crop production improvement and have significantly contributed to food security of china considering the total application area of nearly 20 million ha already 4 2 key impacting factors on crop yield and wue improvements under pm we found the efficacy of plastic film mulching on crop yield and wue improvements was dependent on cropping regions the highest efficacy was observed in south china and northwest china fig 3 however the mechanisms in the two regions might not be the same in south china weed control has been a major challenge for crop growth adoption of plastic film mulching could largely inhibit weed growth by as much as 90 which benefits for higher nutrient uptake and space for crops and consequently promotes crop production and water use gao et al 2019 in northwest china on the other hand water stress and cool temperature represent the two key limiting factors for crop growth sun et al 2020 it was reported nearly 80 of weekly precipitation could be lost through evaporation in crop fields without plastic film mulching in this region ren et al 2008 low air and soil temperatures especially during spring significantly decline germination rate and slow crop growth awal and ikeda 2002 yu et al 2018 adoption of plastic film mulching can significantly reduce the water loss from evaporation and increase soil temperature finally contributing to crop yield improvement zhou et al 2009 the lowest crop yield and wue improvements were found in northeast china where the temperature represents the key constraint factor due to the high latitude it has been widely reported the effect of plastic film mulching on increasing topsoil temperature is considerable wang et al 2011 considering the higher crop yield improvement in the water stressed northwest china than the temperature stressed northeast china however our results confirmed that the impact of plastic film mulching on soil temperature had less of an importance in yield increase compared to on water sun et al 2020 applying plastic film mulching could significantly promote crop yield but high expectations should be avoided in the cold regions the efficacy of plastic film mulching on crop yield and wue varied among different crops fig 4 nevertheless the improvements of crop yield and wue were all considerably significant because even the lowest increase could also reach 33 such a crop yield increase was overwhelmingly higher than the highest yield increase of 7 5 observed in maize among different crop species under no tillage zheng et al 2014 these results indicate that adopting proper crop species with higher improvement under plastic film mulching is beneficial for crop yield and income on the basis of local conditions the results showed that crop yield improvement under black film mulching was slightly higher than that under transparent film mulching but the difference was not significant fig 5 this agrees well with the results of a previous study gao et al 2019 although both transparent and black films can increase soil temperature and reduce soil water evaporation the colours of plastic film mainly affect crop growth through influencing sunlight sreedevi et al 2017 the transparent color is beneficial for the topsoil temperature increase whereas the black color strongly absorbs sun light and thus suppresses weed growth leading to a reduced soil nutrients loss and increased yield and wue rajablariani et al 2012 it was reported that transparent film performed better than black film in certain regions with mat of 10 15 or map 500 mm or for certain plants gao et al 2019 therefore the efficacy of film colour depends on cropping regions or crop species but the overall differences were found not significant in this study as for the film type the traditional film generally performed better than the degradable one fig 5 probably because the degradable film has a higher permeability due to gradual disintegration on site steinmetz et al 2016 the higher permeability may reduce its ability to maintain soil temperature and moisture furthermore degradable films especially the liquid degradable film carries higher risks to be damaged by raindrops in heavy precipitations preventing the soil from saving more water and increasing soil temperature gu et al 2020 it is well documented that plastic film mulching increases crop production through increasing soil temperature and moisture wang et al 2022 our results further suggested that crop yield improvement under plastic film mulching was more significant in arid cold areas than humid temperate areas fig 6 this is understandable because the water and sun radiation shortage are more severe for crop production in arid cold areas compared to humid temperate areas sun et al 2020 the remedy resulted from application of plastic film mulching played a critical role in improving crop growth environment this is particularly important to accelerate the speed of germination and emergence in the early growing stage at relatively low temperatures and delay seeding emergence in the east and west regions of china gao et al 2019 yu et al 2018 considering the arid cold areas are mainly located in northwest china where the average elevation is over 1000 m we consequently observed the higher crop yield and wue in high elevation regions 1000 m than low elevation regions 1000 m fig 7 the cultivated land per capita as well as the average crop yield per hectare in arid cold regions e g northwest china is the lowest in the whole country li et al 2013 xiao et al 2020b our results suggest plastic film mulching plays a critical role in terms of increasing crop production and the income of the local farmers actually our previous studies have illustrated that the efficacy of conservation measures including no tillage straw mulching is also significantly higher in the arid cold and high elevation regions compared to the humid temperate and low elevation regions in terms of increasing crop production reducing wind and water erosion xiao et al 2021 2019 2020a applying conservation measures such as conservation tillage and plastic film mulching should therefore be regarded as a top priority in the regions with poor climatic and soil conditions a sustainable and conservative agriculture system in northwestern regions may not only improve the local environment but also benefit the food security of china our results showed that the increase of crop yield in fields with soc concentration 10 g kg 1 was two times that with soc concentration 10 g kg 1 suggesting a better performance of plastic film mulching in less fertilized croplands fig 8 such a result highlights the importance of applying plastic film mulching in poorly fertilized soils to achieve a better crop production however the potential degradation of soc pool under plastic film mulching deserves further attention it was reported that the increased soil temperature and water content in the tillage depth may promote soc decomposition and decrease its pool size ma et al 2018 wang et al 2021 some studies thus argued that plastic film carried certain risks to be regarded as sustainable agriculture practice steinmetz et al 2016 although our results cannot provide solid evidence regarding the relationship between soc pool and crop yield under plastic film mulching further research are definitely needed to investigate whether the higher increase of crop yield in soc poor soils will lead to higher soc loss or not plastic film mulching combined with other conservation practices such as no tillage and straw mulching that are able to accumulate soc might be an option to at least maintain the soc pool size 4 3 uncertain changes in et under plastic film mulching the overall change in et under plastic film mulching was not significant which was different from the clearly significant increases of crop yield and wue by definition et is composed of evaporation and transpiration crop growth mainly depends on transpiration rather than evaporation considering application of plastic film mulching can largely decrease evaporation by over 50 chen et al 2019 the average insignificant increase of et indicates that the application of plastic film mulching largely transfers the decreased evaporation into transpiration and consequently promotes crop yield improvement chai et al 2022 it was reported that plastic film could increase crop transpiration by over 30 chen et al 2019 in addition the changes in crop yield were generally in line with the changes in wue for all impacting factor groups of this study considering the changes in et were not significantly or at least relatively low in most cases it mathematically led to a close relationship between crop yield changes and wue changes this is simply because wue is calculated as the ratio of crop yield and et notably the changes in et varied among groups ranging from significant decline to insignificant change to significant increase figs 3 8 significant reductions of et were observed in subgroups including region of northeast china crop species of potato plastic film color of black whereas significant increases of et were observed in subgroups including crop species of wheat map of 400 600 mm and soc concentration of 10 g kg 1 significant decreases of et may correspond to higher crop yield improvement e g in subgroups of the crop species of potato and the plastic film color of black in contrast significant increase of et may also correspond to the lower yield improvement including the subgroups of map of 400 600 mm class and the soc concentration 10 g kg 1 class for the species of wheat the increase of et corresponded to an increase of wheat yield compared to other species while the decrease of et in the region of northeast corresponded to a decrease of crop yield compared to other regions such results indicate the changes in et highly depend on cropping region crop species plastic film color map and soc concentration furthermore the increase of et does not necessarily lead to the increase of crop yield and vice versa for instance applying plastic film to potato led to a higher yield at a reduced consumption of water indicating the higher transpiration rate in et however in nearly all cases investigated here evaporation and transpiration were not clearly separated so we were not able to identify how much evaporation was transferred into transpiration in different scenarios quantitatively distinguishing evaporation and transpiration is necessary in the future field studies to thoroughly understand the relationship between crop yield and water use for various crops in different environmental conditions blum 2009 4 4 policy implications 4 4 1 global food security the successful application of plastic film mulching in china may have useful implications for other developing regions in the world where other kinds of conservation measures have been widely adopted but the application rate of plastic film mulching is still low for instance in the past decades conservation agriculture has become a dominant paradigm among scientists and policy makers in sub saharan africa in order to achieve sustainable improvement of crop production corbeels et al 2020 however the overall increase of crop production under conservation agriculture in this region is very limited with an increase of only 3 7 based on 933 pairs of field experimental trials corbeels et al 2020 it thus may not represent an ideal technology for the smallholder farmers in this region to increase crop production and ensure food security this indicates that the farmers in this region must turn to find other substitutes in order to realize intensification of crop production crop yield improvement may vary depending on climatic conditions soil properties and crop species the overall results of this study however suggest a great advantage of plastic film mulching that is notably the better performance in environment with poor conditions e g arid cold regions and low soc concentration soils the results obtained based on experiments conducted in china indicates that it is worth further verifying the benefits of plastic film mulching which may have a promising potential to overcome the shortcomings of conservation agriculture in fact the major limitation for promoting plastic film mulching in developing regions is the availability of plastic film it is critical for the smallholder farmers to obtain plastic film easily at an acceptable price this certainly needs helps from developed countries and countries with rich experiences in plastic film application such as china international organizations including fao and world bank should also pay more attention to plastic film mulching in sustainable programs in order to realize food security in the developing regions such as sub saharan africa 4 4 2 environmental pollution despite the remarkable performance of plastic film mulching in water use and crop production improvements a critical issue that should never be overlooked is its potential impact on environment the use of plastic film especially the traditional film produces a considerable amount of hardly recyclable waste it will cause environmental pollution through various processes including incineration emissions landfill leaching and accumulation of microplastic residues steinmetz et al 2016 the development and application of more degradable mulching film appears a promising choice to overcome the adverse impacts on environment the results of this study however suggest that the efficacy of degradable materials used in nowadays seems still lower than the traditional film together with the higher cost it may limit the enthusiasm of the farmers to adopt the more environment friendly mulches in addition the current degradable film mainly involves mechanical rather than chemical breakdown leading to an accumulation of invisible microplastics briassoulis et al 2015 the innovation on degradable film materials thus represents a critical step in order to maximize the benefits of plastic film mulching technology agriculturally economically and environmentally 5 conclusions the results of this study demonstrated that the crop yield and wue improvements under plastic film mulching could reach up to 40 compared to non mulching fields whereas the changes in et were overall insignificant the increase of crop yield and wue highly depended on cropping region crop species climatic conditions film color and type topography and soc concentration in general plastic film mulching had a better performance in areas with low map mat soc concentration and high elevation in china where the crop production and average income were low in addition despite the average insignificant changes in et our results showed that the changes in et highly depended on cropping region crop species plastic film color map and soc concentration varying from significant decline to significant increase overall plastic film mulching has a critical role to play in china to ensure food security and develop local economy the successful application of plastic film mulching in china may have important implications for other developing regions in the world e g sub sahara africa where the environmental conditions are poor and other conservation tillage practices are unlikely to guarantee food security notably the cost of using plastic film mulching may represent a critical obstacle for its extension and the adverse effects on environment must be properly addressed plastic film mulching deserves further attention from agronomists and policy makers and international cooperation is necessary in the future to grantee the accessibility in less developed regions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

9196,agroecosystem photosynthesis is key to coping with global climate change in farmland where human activities are highly involved the interaction between environmental factors and their influences on gross primary productivity gpp are insufficiently understood particularly the irrigation and mulching in water saving agriculture can alter the crop responses to environmental change based on eddy covariance measurements of maize fields under mulched drip irrigation dm and mulched border irrigation bm in arid areas of northwest china from 2014 to 2018 we systematically studied the interaction between multiple environmental factors and their independent effects on gpp using structural equation modeling partial correlation coefficient and decoupling analysis by bins the top three factors exerting the largest total effects on the gpp were soil temperature ts canopy temperature tc and vapor pressure deficit vpd among which ts 0 75 and tc 0 66 had the largest total effect on gpp under dm and bm respectively the independent effects of ts soil water content swc and vpd on gpp were different under the two irrigation methods swc after excluding the influence of ts showed a negative effect on gpp under dm 1 24 g cm 2d 1 while a positive effect under bm 0 02 g cm 2d 1 by contrast swc after excluding the influence of vpd showed a positive effect on gpp under dm 0 59 g cm 2d 1 while a negative effect under bm 0 05 g cm 2d 1 interestingly higher ts lower swc and higher vpd had the potential to increase gpp under the two irrigation methods we also found that the total effects of irrigation and vpd as well as the indirect effects of environmental factors on gpp should not be ignored our study will provide important reference for dealing with the effect of high temperature and drought stress on agro ecosystem gpp and evaluating the response of vegetation to environmental factors keywords gross primary productivity soil temperature soil water content vapor pressure deficit decoupling data availability the raw processed data required to reproduce these findings cannot be shared at this time as the data also forms part of an ongoing study 1 introduction co2 is the most important greenhouse gas that exacerbates global climate while vegetation photosynthesis is an effective way to absorb co2 farmland ecosystems account for a large proportion of land areas and so that their co2 exchange plays an important role in the total co2 budget in terrestrial ecosystems li et al 2018 irrigation is an important practice in agricultural management to guarantee grain production in arid regions döll and siebert 2002 kang et al 2017 yang et al 2018 mulched drip irrigation dm and mulched border irrigation bm are typical water saving irrigation methods in the arid areas of northwest china qin et al 2018 in recent decades as water shortages is worsened increasingly the promotion of dm has become a national water saving strategy and a large area of traditional bm will be replaced by dm guo et al 2021 compared with bm dm changes the infiltration mode of irrigation water reduces the deep drainage and significantly affects the field water energy and microclimate environment he et al 2018 zotarelli et al 2009 which will regulate crop growth and affect the absorption of co2 flux therefore studying how biophysical conditions control farmland co2 fluxes under different mulching irrigation management practices has will have profound implications for agriculture irrigation strategies in arid regions across the world many studies have pointed out that irrigation i precipitation p soil water content swc soil temperature ts canopy temperature tc and vapor pressure deficit vpd affect gross primary productivity gpp gimenez et al 2019 hu et al 2019 li et al 2019a different environmental factors interact with each other thus further complicating the impact of environmental factors on gpp especially in ecosystems having human interference therefore studies on the influencing factors of plant co2 uptake mainly focus on the grassland ecosystem and forest ecosystem rather than the farmland ecosystem with agricultural management measures fonseca et al 2019 quan et al 2019 reich et al 2018 most of the existing studies on influencing factors of carbon flux in farmland ecosystems only analyzed the correlation between a single factor and gpp but few studies separated the direct and indirect effects on gpp from the synergistic changes of different environmental factors li et al 2006 qin et al 2018 with more and more attention paid to global warming despite many studies try to reveal the feedback direction of carbon flux under temperature rise no final conclusion has been reached so far crowther et al 2016 dorangeville et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 some studies have pointed out the important contribution of temperature to gpp dang et al 2022 nemani et al 2003 but others have concluded that swc plays an important role in gpp green et al 2019 liu et al 2020 higher temperature can promote plant photosynthesis while lower swc will reduce the rate of co2 assimilation reich et al 2018 however higher temperature often corresponds to lower swc koster et al 2006 seneviratne et al 2010 therefore it is important to separate the relative importance of ts and swc for gpp a large number of studies have shown that swc plays a regulatory role in the feedback of carbon flux to temperature rise quan et al 2019 schindlbacher et al 2012 especially in forests and meadows dorangeville et al 2016 quan et al 2019 reich et al 2018 however in different ecosystems and vegetation types the relative importance of ts and swc to gpp varied dang et al 2022 in particular the relationship between ts and swc becomes complicated in farmland ecosystems under mulching and irrigation management in this case the independent effects of ts and swc on gpp in irrigated and mulched fields haven t been fully analyzed climate warming can lead to drought including soil drought and atmospheric drought which can have an impact on plant photosynthesis madadgar et al 2017 novick et al 2016 reichstein et al 2002 sulman et al 2016 studies have shown that high vpd could limit plant photosynthesis liu et al 2020 markow 1979 sulman et al 2016 williams et al 2012 and that low swc can also affect plant photosynthesis reich et al 2015 but negative effects of vpd on gpp may be moderated by swc kimm et al 2020 sulman et al 2016 some studies even suggested that vpd may have a greater effect on carbon flux than swc sulman et al 2016 wong et al 1979 the individual effects of swc and vpd on gpp remain unclear due to their coupling effect liu et al 2020 novick et al 2016 however disentangling the relative importance of vpd and swc on gpp in agricultural production will have important implications for managing drought risks in agricultural practices liu et al 2020 therefore in this study we obtained detailed measurements of water heat and carbon fluxes in the maize fields under dm and bm in northwest china from 2014 to 2018 we first evaluated the direct and indirect effects of environmental factors on gpp using structural equation models and further quantified independent effects of ts vs swc and swc vs vpd on gpp specifically we address the following questions 1 is there a contrasting pattern for these effects between two irrigation management 2 what are direct and indirect effects of environmental factors on gpp under dm and bm 3 what is the relative importance of ts vs swc and vpd vs swc on gpp under dm and bm 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiments on maize fields were carried out from 2014 to 2018 in the national field scientific observation and research station on efficient water use of oasis agriculture 37 52 n 102 50 e 1581 m in wuwei city gansu province northwest china the experimental fields were located in the region with typical continental temperate climate characterized with abundant light and heat resources high evaporation and low rainfall qin et al 2018 wang et al 2020b such an environmental condition provides good living environment for maize production he et al 2018 experimental study on two irrigation methods i e dm and bm was carried out applying the style of cropping of one film and four rows of maize the ratio of film mulching was 0 74 the ratio of female parents to male parents was 6 1 seeding film mulching laying drip irrigation belts and harvest were mechanized under the dm treatment two drip irrigation belts were laid under a plastic film and the irrigation water flowed out from the dripper in the form of point source and directly poured near the maize root from 2014 to 2018 the irrigation methods with less amount and more frequency were used under dm and the irrigation times were 7 8 8 7 and 8 respectively under the bm treatment irrigation water in the maize field penetrated into soil from bottom to top in the form of non point source from 2014 to 2018 the irrigation methods with more amount and less frequency were used under bm and the irrigation times were 4 5 4 6 and 5 respectively the irrigation times were slightly adjusted according to the weather and crop growth conditions of the year under two irrigation methods two eddy covariance ec systems were set up in maize fields with dm and bm to continuously observe water heat and carbon fluxes a 2 meter high automatic weather station was installed near the experimental field meteorological measurements such as precipitation p were recorded by the weather station the specific measurement variables and corresponding instruments were shown in table 1 growth seasons of maize under dm and bm from 2014 to 2018 were shown in appendix 1 the meteorological data during the growth period of maize under dm and bm from 2014 to 2018 were shown in table 2 2 2 ec flux data processing the ec flux data was processed with eddy pro 4 0 software for the purpose of data processing we used the linear interpolation method for missing data from fewer than four points but the mdv mean diurnal variation method otherwise falge et al 2001 gross primary productivity gpp was calculated as the difference between ecosystem respiration er and net ecosystem exchange nee gpp at night was assumed as 0 since no photosynthesis happened the calculation of daytime gpp required daytime er which was obtained with the fitted model after applying the nighttime er data to the respiratory model finally nee and er were used to calculate gpp here we choose the commonly used van t hoff model to obtain the er value the van t hoff model is calculated by the following formula collatz 1991 1 er er ref exp b t t ref where er ref g cm 2 is the reference er g cm 2 at 10 b is the regression parameter t is the surface temperature and t ref is the reference surface temperature at 10 the estimation of parameters applied the short term temperature dependent method proposed by reichstein et al 2005 which was mainly divided into two steps in the first step nighttime co2 flux data was divided into a 15 day window and sliding at an interval of 5 days b was used to fit each set of data and the reciprocal of standard error was used as a weighting factor to average all fitted b to obtain the final b value second fix the b value obtained in the first step used er ref to fit each group of data then got the er ref value of each group of data and then got the daily er ref value through linear interpolation fitting 2 3 crop growth data eight representative plants were selected from the experimental field every 7 10 days in the whole growth period the spad value represents the relative content of chlorophyll in leaves which can indirectly reflect the content of nitrogen in leaves we used a portable chlorophyll meter spad 502 plus konica minolta japan to measure the spad values of all the leaves of each maize plant sampled each time to obtain the average as the relative chlorophyll content of that plant when the canopy coverage cc of maize reached 80 the surface temperature data taken by the infrared temperature sensor in the farmland could be considered as the canopy temperature tc of maize dejonge et al 2015 therefore to obtain tc we segmented the surface temperature with the canopy cover cc in this study canopy cover was transformed by lai lai m2 m 2 guo et al 2019 and cc hsiao et al 2009 were calculated using the following formula 2 lai 0 74 i 1 n l i w i d s 3 cc 1 005 1 e 0 6 lai 1 2 100 where 0 74 is an empirical constant li m is the length of the leaf wi m is the width of the leaf and d m and s m are the distance between two rows and the space between two plants respectively in this experiment d and s are 0 25 m and 0 22 m respectively since the infrared temperature sensor was installed in 2016 the tc was only available from 2016 to 2018 the surface temperature of the whole growth period under dm and bm during 2016 2018 was shown in table 2 the seasonal variation of tc under dm and bm from 2016 to 2018 were shown in fig 1 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 significance analysis and structural equation model significance analysis between data groups was performed using spss for windows software version 21 0 spss inc chicago il usa the structural equation models sem were output by the amos model version ibm spss amos 22 0 amos model is a graphical modeling software which can determine the relationship between variables in an intuitive path diagram and analyze the degree of correlation between variables considering some data might be missing over a long period we selected the data from 2016 to 2018 available for all factors for analysis the causal networks of sem are based on existing knowledge and only consider the significant effects among factors we chose comparative fit index cfi and tuck lewis index tli for model evaluation the specific calculation method could be found in hu and bentler 1999 when cfi was greater than 0 95 and tli was greater than 0 90 the results of the model were satisfactory fan et al 2016 2 4 2 partial correlation coefficient in this study we applied the partial correlation coefficient to calculate the independent linear influence of each parameter on gpp under swc and ts combination and under swc and vpd combination respectively r ts gpp swc represents the correlation between ts and gpp excluding the influence of swc likewise we also calculated the r swc gpp ts r vpd gpp swc and r swc gpp vpd the calculation formula is as follows dang et al 2022 4 r 1 2 3 r 12 r 13 r 23 1 r 13 2 1 r 23 2 where r 1 2 3 is the partial correlation coefficient between variable 1 and variable 2 after controlling for the linear effect of variable 3 r 12 r 13 and r 23 are correlation coefficients between variable 1 and variable 2 variable 1 and variable 3 and variable 2 and variable 3 respectively 2 4 3 decoupling analysis by bins the method of decoupling by separate bins will not change the relative influence of factors on gpp and can better compare the relative influence of factors after separation dang et al 2022 liu et al 2020 the data was divided into 8 equal numbers of bin by the ascending order of ts and determined the boundary points of each bin the same rule was applied to swc after that we would make segmentation according to the boundary point of swc in each ts bin sum the differences in gpp from high swc to low swc at each segmentation and then divide by the number of swc segments in this ts bin hence the swc influence on gpp considering ts and swc decoupling was obtained in each ts bin denoted as δgpp swc ts the data from fewer 5 groups after segmentation were eliminated and binning and segmentation would not change the corresponding relationship between ts swc and gpp the calculation formula is as follows dang et al 2022 liu et al 2020 5 gpp swc ts 1 i i 1 i gpp i n i max gpp i n i min where i is the number of swc segmentations in ts bin i is the specific swc segmentation number n i max and n i min is the maximum and minimum of swc respectively equally we also calculated δgpp ts swc δgpp swc vpd and δgpp vpd swc 3 results 3 1 inter annual variability of ts swc and vpd the annual mean ts 0 20 cm swc 0 20 cm and vpd of maize fields under dm and bm from 2014 to 2018 were shown in fig 2 during 2015 2018 the annual mean ts under dm was higher than that under bm while in 2014 the annual mean ts under dm was lower than that under bm fig 2 a possibly due to the disturbance of the soil where the probe was located by the agronomic management measures in 2014 from 2014 to 2018 there were significant differences in daily ts between dm and bm p 0 05 and the annual mean ts under dm was 20 35 which was significantly higher than that under bm 19 58 p 0 05 the annual mean swc under dm and bm from 2014 to 2018 was shown in fig 2 b dm had a higher irrigation frequency but a smaller irrigation amount than bm so it saw a smaller fluctuation in swc accordingly since soil temperature and soil moisture sensors were installed at the same position the annual mean swc under dm in 2014 was 0 17 cm3 cm 3 slightly lower than that under bm 0 18 cm3 cm 3 from 2015 to 2018 the annual mean swc of maize field during the growth period under dm was significantly higher than that under bm p 0 05 although the irrigation amount of bm was larger there were more deep drainage therefore the 5 year mean swc was 0 22 cm3 cm 3 under dm which was higher than 0 20 cm3 cm 3 under bm the annual mean vpd under dm and bm from 2014 to 2018 was shown in fig 2 c due to failure of the instruments some data were missing for the whole growth period of 2016 in the maize field under bm therefore vpd in 2016 only showed data that existed simultaneously on the same day after sowing under both irrigation methods vpd of the whole growth period of maize in 2018 under dm was slightly lower than bm but not significantly p 0 05 from 2014 to 2018 the annual mean vpd under dm 1 46 kpa was significantly higher than that under bm 1 38 kpa p 0 05 3 2 relationships between environmental factors and gpp the seasonal variation of gpp in the growth period of maize under dm and bm were shown in fig 3 we found that the maximum value of gpp appeared in the middle growth stage of maize under both irrigation methods the difference in gpp between the two irrigation methods mainly happened in the late seedling stage and the jointing stage during the two stages the growth status of maize under dm was better than that under bm and the photosynthetic capacity of maize under dm was higher than that under bm the gpp saw little difference at the later growth stage of maize under dm and bm the mean gpp under dm and bm during the whole growth period of maize was 1351 44 g cm 2 and 1323 03 g cm 2 respectively the changes of daily gpp with ts swc and vpd during the growth period of maize under the two irrigation methods were shown in fig 4 the larger value of gpp appeared in company with higher ts while no obvious change was observed in swc possibly due to the effect of mulching film on ts and swc under both water saving irrigation measures both irrigation methods adopted full irrigation so that gpp did not show the limiting effect in the case of high vpd the distribution of gpp and vpd were similar in the whole growth period of maize under the two irrigation methods ts and swc under dm were more found in the range of higher values that those under bm 3 3 direct and indirect effects from environmental factors we used sem to analyze the effects of irrigation i precipitation p swc ts tc and vpd on gpp and the constructed sem were shown in fig 5 we selected the time when each factor co existed and analyzed 242 and 231 groups of samples from dm and bm during 2016 2018 respectively on the prerequisite of ensuring the number of samples the effects of environmental factors on gpp were analyzed under dm and bm and the results were shown in fig 6 ts tc and vpd had greater influence on the total gpp than other variables under dm and bm the total effects of ts tc and vpd on gpp under dm were 0 75 0 32 and 0 17 respectively and those under bm were 0 53 0 66 and 0 17 respectively i p ts swc and tc had an indirect effect of 0 11 0 05 0 27 0 05 and 0 11 respectively on gpp under dm while i p ts and tc had an indirect effect of 0 11 0 07 0 53 and 0 08 respectively on gpp under bm the analyzed influencing factors could explain the gpp of 0 61 and 0 47 for maize under dm and bm respectively therefore the irrigation method could change the interaction between environmental factors and their effects on gpp and dm had more ability to promote crop photosynthesis than bm among the limited environmental factors we analyzed 3 4 decoupling of ts swc and vpd impacts on gpp in order to better explain the independent influence of ts swc and vpd on gpp we calculated the partial correlation coefficients under dm and bm and the results were shown in table 3 r vpd gpp swc and r swc gpp vpd under dm were 0 15 and 0 10 respectively p 0 05 r ts gpp swc and r swc gpp ts under bm were 0 57 and 0 24 respectively p 0 05 r ts gpp swc under dm and r swc gpp vpd under bm were 0 39 and 0 25 respectively p 0 05 however the results for r swc gpp ts under dm and r vpd gpp swc under bm were not credible p 0 05 therefore based on the partial correlation coefficients vpd had a greater independent influence on gpp than swc under dm and ts had a greater independent influence on gpp than swc under bm we decoupled the effects of ts vs swc and vpd vs swc on gpp by bins to more clearly reveal the nonlinear independent influence of parameters on gpp and the results were shown in fig 7 decomposed effects of ts vs swc and vpd vs swc on gpp for each bin were shown in appendix 2 in both water saving irrigation management measures the median of δgpp ts swc was greater than that of δgpp swc ts and the median of δgpp vpd swc was greater than that of δgpp swc vpd however the median of δgpp ts swc under dm was 1 39 g cm 2d 1 higher than 0 99 g cm 2d 1 under bm the median of δgpp swc ts was negative under dm 1 24 g cm 2d 1 but a weak positive value under bm 0 02 g cm 2d 1 the median of δgpp vpd swc was positive under both dm and bm 0 89 g cm 2d 1 and 0 74 g cm 2d 1 respectively however the median of δgpp swc vpd was positive under dm 0 59 g cm 2d 1 while negative under bm 0 05 g cm 2d 1 4 discussion 4 1 major environmental factor controlling on gpp under different irrigation strategies the influence of environmental factors on gpp was different under the two irrigation methods fig 5 this indicated that irrigation methods could alter abiotic conditions and thereby affect the growth status and photosynthetic characteristics of crops abd el mageed et al 2022 ge et al 2022 wang et al 2022 the important effect of temperature on gpp has been pointed out in many studies dold et al 2017 li et al 2006 qin et al 2018 the main driving factor of gpp under dm and bm was ts and tc respectively in our study fig 6 the main reasons for different influencing factors in the two irrigation methods could be 1 dm provided a more suitable ts for the growth of maize fig 2 while bm had no significant effect on maize photosynthetic capacity which was directly affected by ts under dm spad and lai of maize were higher than those under bm appendix 3 spad as a status indicator of nitrogen content li et al 2019b yue et al 2020 which could reflect that ts under dm could promote root absorption of nitrogen and the growth of maize to improve the photosynthetic capacity of maize as a result wang et al 2021a 2 tc has been confirmed to act on gpp by affecting leaf stomata huang et al 2019a lloyd and farquhar 2008 park williams et al 2012 in our study under both irrigation methods tc had a direct and significant effect on gpp but it had a greater effect under bm tc under bm was lower than that under dm fig 1 indicating that the plant water content was higher under bm thus to promote photosynthesis prasad et al 2011 in addition swc indirectly affected gpp through influencing tc and vpd under dm while swc acted directly on gpp under bm because the frequent wetting and drying of soil under dm would affect maize root uptake which was reflected in tc chaves et al 2003 and also affect soil evaporation and thus have an impact on local vpd however bm had a lower irrigation frequency but more deep drainage deng et al 2006 wang et al 2020a so that swc had no significant influence on tc and vpd swc was less and the response of crop growth to swc was more significant under bm than those under dm fig 6 possibly attributed to the fact that moderately low water level could promote photosynthesis in plants lu et al 2022 tc had an indirect effect on gpp by influencing vpd under dm and bm figs 5 6 this was because tc affected the stomatal opening and closing of leaves fukuda et al 2018 tan 1993 which changed canopy vapor pressure through affecting plant transpiration and thus had an impact on the vpd which would also affect inflow and outflow of co2 flux in the plants olivo et al 2009 existing studies have shown that high vpd could reduce stomatal conductance and xylem conductance of plants thus limiting plant photosynthesis mcdowell et al 2008 novick et al 2016 yuan et al 2019a however both of our two irrigation methods applied full irrigation which made vpd relatively low so they both had a positive effect on gpp 0 17 4 2 disentangling the relative role of ts swc and vpd on gpp under different irrigation strategies the relative independent contributions of ts swc and vpd to gpp in binning were consistent with the conclusions of partial correlation coefficients and sem under dm and bm our study found that dominant effect of ts on gpp was greater than that of swc under the two irrigation methods which was the same as conclusions at the global scale drawn by dang et al 2022 in our experiment film mulching increased the mean ts and reduced the damage of low ts at night to crops which might have expanded the promoting effect of ts on crop growth however dang et al 2022 pointed out that swc had a greater impact on gpp in arid and semi arid areas which was inconsistent with our conclusions possibly because his study failed to consider irrigated fields with mulch could ensure sufficient swc studies have shown that under high swc availability higher temperature could improve the net photosynthetic capacity of maize and other angiosperms korner 2015 reich et al 2018 vpd can greatly affect the carbon sequestration capacity of ecosystems pan et al 2011 which was often ignored in research jin et al 2018 matheny et al 2014 the conclusion that vpd had more influence on gpp than swc was consistent with that of many other studies kimm et al 2020 sulman et al 2016 this may be related to the fact that our irrigation method was full irrigation which had a relatively small fluctuation of swc and hence reduced the effect of swc on gpp some studies have shown that the ambient temperature once having exceeded the optimum value will limit photosynthesis chen et al 2021 medlyn et al 2002 but the temperature couldn t maintain at an optimum value in most ecosystems dang et al 2022 huang et al 2019b in our study the median of δgpp ts swc under both irrigation methods was positive at the same time when ts under dm was higher than that under bm the promotion effect of ts on gpp was also greater accordingly therefore we believe that facing global warming the two irrigation methods still have the potential to increase gpp liu et al 2020 pointed out that in most of the vegetation δ gpp swc vpd was negative even in the semi arid areas and swc restrictions on gpp were the most but he failed to separate specific differences and effects under different irrigation methods our study further found that swc under dm was higher than that under bm and that the median of δ gpp swc ts under dm was negative and under bm weakly positive this was perhaps because moderate soil water deficit could increase the activity of key enzymes in the process of carbon assimilation cui et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 which was more conducive to photosynthesis lu et al 2022 in a nutshell the decrease of swc could promote gpp under both dm and bm under different conditions the effects of vpd on photosynthesis were different kimm et al 2020 sulman et al 2016 plants closed stomata to limit gpp when vpd was high mcadam and brodribb 2015 yuan et al 2019a the value of vpd has not yet reached the threshold for limiting photosynthetic capacity of maize under these two irrigation methods the vpd under dm was larger than that under bm fig 2c and had no negative effect on gpp of maize therefore the continuous increase of vpd under the two water saving irrigation methods may continue to promote gpp at present our research on the leading role of ts swc and vpd on gpp was mainly the study of laws and phenomena more mechanistic study on canopy and leaf as well as stomatal level responses to water temperature and nutrients is necessary to disentangle the physiological and phenological responses of crops to dm and bm in the future model simulation based on more experimental observation data may be carried out to make existing conclusions more convincing and further explain the underlying mechanisms 4 3 implications for agricultural microclimate and modeling research farmland management measures have an impact on microclimate conditions and even feedback to affect regional climate but relevant researches are seldom found at present zhou et al 2012 although we only conducted a single point experiment on maize fields under dm and bm we conducted a detailed comparative experimental design and data observations the obvious difference between dm and bm was irrigation according to the analysis we found that irrigation had total effect on gpp 0 11 under dm and bm fig 6 in the analysis of the results of mulched irrigation ming et al 2021 found that irrigation would increase gpp which was also confirmed in our study irrigation also had a certain degree of influence on vpd varying among different under different irrigation methods fig 6 lo valvo et al 2018 pointed out that irrigation could effectively affect vpd in the study of 28 stations in wisconsin central sands region therefore farmland management measures have an impact on microclimate at present many meteorological observations and climate models fail to fully consider the impact of irrigation despite that fact that irrigation could have a certain impact on the climate system boucher et al 2004 harding and snyder 2012 with the expansion of irrigated agriculture accuracy of the land atmosphere coupling model of the earth could be greatly improved if taking account of the impact of irrigation on climate chen et al 2017 huang et al 2013 nocco et al 2019 vpd plays an important role in the carbon flux mcdowell et al 2008 novick et al 2016 olivo et al 2009 yuan et al 2019a the error of current global vegetation dynamic models in gpp simulation happened for failing to consider vpd rigden et al 2020 yuan et al 2019b and in our study the relative contribution of vpd to gpp was even greater than that of swc fig 7 interestingly novick et al 2016 pointed out that atmospheric demand would have an increasing impact on vegetation function thus we suggest that the influence of vpd should be fully considered in microclimate research and future model development in our study we also found that i p ts and tc had indirect effects on gpp figs 5 6 in previous analysis of sem it was not difficult to find that environmental factors were prone to have indirect effects on gpp yet failing to arouse sufficient attention gui et al 2021 guo et al 2021 song et al 2021 wang et al 2021b therefore in analysis of the influence of the target parameters considering the mutual influence of each factor only focusing on the direct influence and ignoring the indirect influence may misinterpret the effect of parameters we suggest that the indirect effects of environmental factors on carbon fluxes and other parameters should be fully considered in both experimental analyses and climate models in future 5 conclusions based on the eddy covariance system we measured water heat and carbon fluxes in maize fields under dm and bm during 2014 2018 in arid areas of northwest china the effects of environmental factors on gpp were quantified using the sem and the relative importance of ts vs swc and vpd vs swc to gpp were decoupled using the partial correlation coefficient and the binning method the main research results are as follows 1 the annual mean ts swc vpd and gpp in the whole growth period of the dm were higher than those under bm 2 the top three factors having the largest total effects on gpp under the two irrigation methods were ts tc and vpd among which ts had the largest total effect on gpp under dm and tc had the largest total effect on gpp under bm 3 ts and vpd had greater relative contribution to gpp than swc under dm and bm facing climate warming and increasing drought in the future both irrigation methods have the possibility to further improve photosynthesis 4 the effects of irrigation on farmland microclimate vpd and the indirect effects of environmental factors on gpp should be highlighted in future experimental analyses and accounted for in the coupled earth system models in general we quantified the effects of environmental factors on gpp and separated the independent effects of temperature and drought on gpp under the two irrigation methods however in order to better clarify the physiological and phenological responses of crops to dm and bm it is necessary to further study the response mechanism of canopy and leaf as well as stomatal level to water temperature and nutrients and carry out

9196,agroecosystem photosynthesis is key to coping with global climate change in farmland where human activities are highly involved the interaction between environmental factors and their influences on gross primary productivity gpp are insufficiently understood particularly the irrigation and mulching in water saving agriculture can alter the crop responses to environmental change based on eddy covariance measurements of maize fields under mulched drip irrigation dm and mulched border irrigation bm in arid areas of northwest china from 2014 to 2018 we systematically studied the interaction between multiple environmental factors and their independent effects on gpp using structural equation modeling partial correlation coefficient and decoupling analysis by bins the top three factors exerting the largest total effects on the gpp were soil temperature ts canopy temperature tc and vapor pressure deficit vpd among which ts 0 75 and tc 0 66 had the largest total effect on gpp under dm and bm respectively the independent effects of ts soil water content swc and vpd on gpp were different under the two irrigation methods swc after excluding the influence of ts showed a negative effect on gpp under dm 1 24 g cm 2d 1 while a positive effect under bm 0 02 g cm 2d 1 by contrast swc after excluding the influence of vpd showed a positive effect on gpp under dm 0 59 g cm 2d 1 while a negative effect under bm 0 05 g cm 2d 1 interestingly higher ts lower swc and higher vpd had the potential to increase gpp under the two irrigation methods we also found that the total effects of irrigation and vpd as well as the indirect effects of environmental factors on gpp should not be ignored our study will provide important reference for dealing with the effect of high temperature and drought stress on agro ecosystem gpp and evaluating the response of vegetation to environmental factors keywords gross primary productivity soil temperature soil water content vapor pressure deficit decoupling data availability the raw processed data required to reproduce these findings cannot be shared at this time as the data also forms part of an ongoing study 1 introduction co2 is the most important greenhouse gas that exacerbates global climate while vegetation photosynthesis is an effective way to absorb co2 farmland ecosystems account for a large proportion of land areas and so that their co2 exchange plays an important role in the total co2 budget in terrestrial ecosystems li et al 2018 irrigation is an important practice in agricultural management to guarantee grain production in arid regions döll and siebert 2002 kang et al 2017 yang et al 2018 mulched drip irrigation dm and mulched border irrigation bm are typical water saving irrigation methods in the arid areas of northwest china qin et al 2018 in recent decades as water shortages is worsened increasingly the promotion of dm has become a national water saving strategy and a large area of traditional bm will be replaced by dm guo et al 2021 compared with bm dm changes the infiltration mode of irrigation water reduces the deep drainage and significantly affects the field water energy and microclimate environment he et al 2018 zotarelli et al 2009 which will regulate crop growth and affect the absorption of co2 flux therefore studying how biophysical conditions control farmland co2 fluxes under different mulching irrigation management practices has will have profound implications for agriculture irrigation strategies in arid regions across the world many studies have pointed out that irrigation i precipitation p soil water content swc soil temperature ts canopy temperature tc and vapor pressure deficit vpd affect gross primary productivity gpp gimenez et al 2019 hu et al 2019 li et al 2019a different environmental factors interact with each other thus further complicating the impact of environmental factors on gpp especially in ecosystems having human interference therefore studies on the influencing factors of plant co2 uptake mainly focus on the grassland ecosystem and forest ecosystem rather than the farmland ecosystem with agricultural management measures fonseca et al 2019 quan et al 2019 reich et al 2018 most of the existing studies on influencing factors of carbon flux in farmland ecosystems only analyzed the correlation between a single factor and gpp but few studies separated the direct and indirect effects on gpp from the synergistic changes of different environmental factors li et al 2006 qin et al 2018 with more and more attention paid to global warming despite many studies try to reveal the feedback direction of carbon flux under temperature rise no final conclusion has been reached so far crowther et al 2016 dorangeville et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 some studies have pointed out the important contribution of temperature to gpp dang et al 2022 nemani et al 2003 but others have concluded that swc plays an important role in gpp green et al 2019 liu et al 2020 higher temperature can promote plant photosynthesis while lower swc will reduce the rate of co2 assimilation reich et al 2018 however higher temperature often corresponds to lower swc koster et al 2006 seneviratne et al 2010 therefore it is important to separate the relative importance of ts and swc for gpp a large number of studies have shown that swc plays a regulatory role in the feedback of carbon flux to temperature rise quan et al 2019 schindlbacher et al 2012 especially in forests and meadows dorangeville et al 2016 quan et al 2019 reich et al 2018 however in different ecosystems and vegetation types the relative importance of ts and swc to gpp varied dang et al 2022 in particular the relationship between ts and swc becomes complicated in farmland ecosystems under mulching and irrigation management in this case the independent effects of ts and swc on gpp in irrigated and mulched fields haven t been fully analyzed climate warming can lead to drought including soil drought and atmospheric drought which can have an impact on plant photosynthesis madadgar et al 2017 novick et al 2016 reichstein et al 2002 sulman et al 2016 studies have shown that high vpd could limit plant photosynthesis liu et al 2020 markow 1979 sulman et al 2016 williams et al 2012 and that low swc can also affect plant photosynthesis reich et al 2015 but negative effects of vpd on gpp may be moderated by swc kimm et al 2020 sulman et al 2016 some studies even suggested that vpd may have a greater effect on carbon flux than swc sulman et al 2016 wong et al 1979 the individual effects of swc and vpd on gpp remain unclear due to their coupling effect liu et al 2020 novick et al 2016 however disentangling the relative importance of vpd and swc on gpp in agricultural production will have important implications for managing drought risks in agricultural practices liu et al 2020 therefore in this study we obtained detailed measurements of water heat and carbon fluxes in the maize fields under dm and bm in northwest china from 2014 to 2018 we first evaluated the direct and indirect effects of environmental factors on gpp using structural equation models and further quantified independent effects of ts vs swc and swc vs vpd on gpp specifically we address the following questions 1 is there a contrasting pattern for these effects between two irrigation management 2 what are direct and indirect effects of environmental factors on gpp under dm and bm 3 what is the relative importance of ts vs swc and vpd vs swc on gpp under dm and bm 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiments on maize fields were carried out from 2014 to 2018 in the national field scientific observation and research station on efficient water use of oasis agriculture 37 52 n 102 50 e 1581 m in wuwei city gansu province northwest china the experimental fields were located in the region with typical continental temperate climate characterized with abundant light and heat resources high evaporation and low rainfall qin et al 2018 wang et al 2020b such an environmental condition provides good living environment for maize production he et al 2018 experimental study on two irrigation methods i e dm and bm was carried out applying the style of cropping of one film and four rows of maize the ratio of film mulching was 0 74 the ratio of female parents to male parents was 6 1 seeding film mulching laying drip irrigation belts and harvest were mechanized under the dm treatment two drip irrigation belts were laid under a plastic film and the irrigation water flowed out from the dripper in the form of point source and directly poured near the maize root from 2014 to 2018 the irrigation methods with less amount and more frequency were used under dm and the irrigation times were 7 8 8 7 and 8 respectively under the bm treatment irrigation water in the maize field penetrated into soil from bottom to top in the form of non point source from 2014 to 2018 the irrigation methods with more amount and less frequency were used under bm and the irrigation times were 4 5 4 6 and 5 respectively the irrigation times were slightly adjusted according to the weather and crop growth conditions of the year under two irrigation methods two eddy covariance ec systems were set up in maize fields with dm and bm to continuously observe water heat and carbon fluxes a 2 meter high automatic weather station was installed near the experimental field meteorological measurements such as precipitation p were recorded by the weather station the specific measurement variables and corresponding instruments were shown in table 1 growth seasons of maize under dm and bm from 2014 to 2018 were shown in appendix 1 the meteorological data during the growth period of maize under dm and bm from 2014 to 2018 were shown in table 2 2 2 ec flux data processing the ec flux data was processed with eddy pro 4 0 software for the purpose of data processing we used the linear interpolation method for missing data from fewer than four points but the mdv mean diurnal variation method otherwise falge et al 2001 gross primary productivity gpp was calculated as the difference between ecosystem respiration er and net ecosystem exchange nee gpp at night was assumed as 0 since no photosynthesis happened the calculation of daytime gpp required daytime er which was obtained with the fitted model after applying the nighttime er data to the respiratory model finally nee and er were used to calculate gpp here we choose the commonly used van t hoff model to obtain the er value the van t hoff model is calculated by the following formula collatz 1991 1 er er ref exp b t t ref where er ref g cm 2 is the reference er g cm 2 at 10 b is the regression parameter t is the surface temperature and t ref is the reference surface temperature at 10 the estimation of parameters applied the short term temperature dependent method proposed by reichstein et al 2005 which was mainly divided into two steps in the first step nighttime co2 flux data was divided into a 15 day window and sliding at an interval of 5 days b was used to fit each set of data and the reciprocal of standard error was used as a weighting factor to average all fitted b to obtain the final b value second fix the b value obtained in the first step used er ref to fit each group of data then got the er ref value of each group of data and then got the daily er ref value through linear interpolation fitting 2 3 crop growth data eight representative plants were selected from the experimental field every 7 10 days in the whole growth period the spad value represents the relative content of chlorophyll in leaves which can indirectly reflect the content of nitrogen in leaves we used a portable chlorophyll meter spad 502 plus konica minolta japan to measure the spad values of all the leaves of each maize plant sampled each time to obtain the average as the relative chlorophyll content of that plant when the canopy coverage cc of maize reached 80 the surface temperature data taken by the infrared temperature sensor in the farmland could be considered as the canopy temperature tc of maize dejonge et al 2015 therefore to obtain tc we segmented the surface temperature with the canopy cover cc in this study canopy cover was transformed by lai lai m2 m 2 guo et al 2019 and cc hsiao et al 2009 were calculated using the following formula 2 lai 0 74 i 1 n l i w i d s 3 cc 1 005 1 e 0 6 lai 1 2 100 where 0 74 is an empirical constant li m is the length of the leaf wi m is the width of the leaf and d m and s m are the distance between two rows and the space between two plants respectively in this experiment d and s are 0 25 m and 0 22 m respectively since the infrared temperature sensor was installed in 2016 the tc was only available from 2016 to 2018 the surface temperature of the whole growth period under dm and bm during 2016 2018 was shown in table 2 the seasonal variation of tc under dm and bm from 2016 to 2018 were shown in fig 1 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 significance analysis and structural equation model significance analysis between data groups was performed using spss for windows software version 21 0 spss inc chicago il usa the structural equation models sem were output by the amos model version ibm spss amos 22 0 amos model is a graphical modeling software which can determine the relationship between variables in an intuitive path diagram and analyze the degree of correlation between variables considering some data might be missing over a long period we selected the data from 2016 to 2018 available for all factors for analysis the causal networks of sem are based on existing knowledge and only consider the significant effects among factors we chose comparative fit index cfi and tuck lewis index tli for model evaluation the specific calculation method could be found in hu and bentler 1999 when cfi was greater than 0 95 and tli was greater than 0 90 the results of the model were satisfactory fan et al 2016 2 4 2 partial correlation coefficient in this study we applied the partial correlation coefficient to calculate the independent linear influence of each parameter on gpp under swc and ts combination and under swc and vpd combination respectively r ts gpp swc represents the correlation between ts and gpp excluding the influence of swc likewise we also calculated the r swc gpp ts r vpd gpp swc and r swc gpp vpd the calculation formula is as follows dang et al 2022 4 r 1 2 3 r 12 r 13 r 23 1 r 13 2 1 r 23 2 where r 1 2 3 is the partial correlation coefficient between variable 1 and variable 2 after controlling for the linear effect of variable 3 r 12 r 13 and r 23 are correlation coefficients between variable 1 and variable 2 variable 1 and variable 3 and variable 2 and variable 3 respectively 2 4 3 decoupling analysis by bins the method of decoupling by separate bins will not change the relative influence of factors on gpp and can better compare the relative influence of factors after separation dang et al 2022 liu et al 2020 the data was divided into 8 equal numbers of bin by the ascending order of ts and determined the boundary points of each bin the same rule was applied to swc after that we would make segmentation according to the boundary point of swc in each ts bin sum the differences in gpp from high swc to low swc at each segmentation and then divide by the number of swc segments in this ts bin hence the swc influence on gpp considering ts and swc decoupling was obtained in each ts bin denoted as δgpp swc ts the data from fewer 5 groups after segmentation were eliminated and binning and segmentation would not change the corresponding relationship between ts swc and gpp the calculation formula is as follows dang et al 2022 liu et al 2020 5 gpp swc ts 1 i i 1 i gpp i n i max gpp i n i min where i is the number of swc segmentations in ts bin i is the specific swc segmentation number n i max and n i min is the maximum and minimum of swc respectively equally we also calculated δgpp ts swc δgpp swc vpd and δgpp vpd swc 3 results 3 1 inter annual variability of ts swc and vpd the annual mean ts 0 20 cm swc 0 20 cm and vpd of maize fields under dm and bm from 2014 to 2018 were shown in fig 2 during 2015 2018 the annual mean ts under dm was higher than that under bm while in 2014 the annual mean ts under dm was lower than that under bm fig 2 a possibly due to the disturbance of the soil where the probe was located by the agronomic management measures in 2014 from 2014 to 2018 there were significant differences in daily ts between dm and bm p 0 05 and the annual mean ts under dm was 20 35 which was significantly higher than that under bm 19 58 p 0 05 the annual mean swc under dm and bm from 2014 to 2018 was shown in fig 2 b dm had a higher irrigation frequency but a smaller irrigation amount than bm so it saw a smaller fluctuation in swc accordingly since soil temperature and soil moisture sensors were installed at the same position the annual mean swc under dm in 2014 was 0 17 cm3 cm 3 slightly lower than that under bm 0 18 cm3 cm 3 from 2015 to 2018 the annual mean swc of maize field during the growth period under dm was significantly higher than that under bm p 0 05 although the irrigation amount of bm was larger there were more deep drainage therefore the 5 year mean swc was 0 22 cm3 cm 3 under dm which was higher than 0 20 cm3 cm 3 under bm the annual mean vpd under dm and bm from 2014 to 2018 was shown in fig 2 c due to failure of the instruments some data were missing for the whole growth period of 2016 in the maize field under bm therefore vpd in 2016 only showed data that existed simultaneously on the same day after sowing under both irrigation methods vpd of the whole growth period of maize in 2018 under dm was slightly lower than bm but not significantly p 0 05 from 2014 to 2018 the annual mean vpd under dm 1 46 kpa was significantly higher than that under bm 1 38 kpa p 0 05 3 2 relationships between environmental factors and gpp the seasonal variation of gpp in the growth period of maize under dm and bm were shown in fig 3 we found that the maximum value of gpp appeared in the middle growth stage of maize under both irrigation methods the difference in gpp between the two irrigation methods mainly happened in the late seedling stage and the jointing stage during the two stages the growth status of maize under dm was better than that under bm and the photosynthetic capacity of maize under dm was higher than that under bm the gpp saw little difference at the later growth stage of maize under dm and bm the mean gpp under dm and bm during the whole growth period of maize was 1351 44 g cm 2 and 1323 03 g cm 2 respectively the changes of daily gpp with ts swc and vpd during the growth period of maize under the two irrigation methods were shown in fig 4 the larger value of gpp appeared in company with higher ts while no obvious change was observed in swc possibly due to the effect of mulching film on ts and swc under both water saving irrigation measures both irrigation methods adopted full irrigation so that gpp did not show the limiting effect in the case of high vpd the distribution of gpp and vpd were similar in the whole growth period of maize under the two irrigation methods ts and swc under dm were more found in the range of higher values that those under bm 3 3 direct and indirect effects from environmental factors we used sem to analyze the effects of irrigation i precipitation p swc ts tc and vpd on gpp and the constructed sem were shown in fig 5 we selected the time when each factor co existed and analyzed 242 and 231 groups of samples from dm and bm during 2016 2018 respectively on the prerequisite of ensuring the number of samples the effects of environmental factors on gpp were analyzed under dm and bm and the results were shown in fig 6 ts tc and vpd had greater influence on the total gpp than other variables under dm and bm the total effects of ts tc and vpd on gpp under dm were 0 75 0 32 and 0 17 respectively and those under bm were 0 53 0 66 and 0 17 respectively i p ts swc and tc had an indirect effect of 0 11 0 05 0 27 0 05 and 0 11 respectively on gpp under dm while i p ts and tc had an indirect effect of 0 11 0 07 0 53 and 0 08 respectively on gpp under bm the analyzed influencing factors could explain the gpp of 0 61 and 0 47 for maize under dm and bm respectively therefore the irrigation method could change the interaction between environmental factors and their effects on gpp and dm had more ability to promote crop photosynthesis than bm among the limited environmental factors we analyzed 3 4 decoupling of ts swc and vpd impacts on gpp in order to better explain the independent influence of ts swc and vpd on gpp we calculated the partial correlation coefficients under dm and bm and the results were shown in table 3 r vpd gpp swc and r swc gpp vpd under dm were 0 15 and 0 10 respectively p 0 05 r ts gpp swc and r swc gpp ts under bm were 0 57 and 0 24 respectively p 0 05 r ts gpp swc under dm and r swc gpp vpd under bm were 0 39 and 0 25 respectively p 0 05 however the results for r swc gpp ts under dm and r vpd gpp swc under bm were not credible p 0 05 therefore based on the partial correlation coefficients vpd had a greater independent influence on gpp than swc under dm and ts had a greater independent influence on gpp than swc under bm we decoupled the effects of ts vs swc and vpd vs swc on gpp by bins to more clearly reveal the nonlinear independent influence of parameters on gpp and the results were shown in fig 7 decomposed effects of ts vs swc and vpd vs swc on gpp for each bin were shown in appendix 2 in both water saving irrigation management measures the median of δgpp ts swc was greater than that of δgpp swc ts and the median of δgpp vpd swc was greater than that of δgpp swc vpd however the median of δgpp ts swc under dm was 1 39 g cm 2d 1 higher than 0 99 g cm 2d 1 under bm the median of δgpp swc ts was negative under dm 1 24 g cm 2d 1 but a weak positive value under bm 0 02 g cm 2d 1 the median of δgpp vpd swc was positive under both dm and bm 0 89 g cm 2d 1 and 0 74 g cm 2d 1 respectively however the median of δgpp swc vpd was positive under dm 0 59 g cm 2d 1 while negative under bm 0 05 g cm 2d 1 4 discussion 4 1 major environmental factor controlling on gpp under different irrigation strategies the influence of environmental factors on gpp was different under the two irrigation methods fig 5 this indicated that irrigation methods could alter abiotic conditions and thereby affect the growth status and photosynthetic characteristics of crops abd el mageed et al 2022 ge et al 2022 wang et al 2022 the important effect of temperature on gpp has been pointed out in many studies dold et al 2017 li et al 2006 qin et al 2018 the main driving factor of gpp under dm and bm was ts and tc respectively in our study fig 6 the main reasons for different influencing factors in the two irrigation methods could be 1 dm provided a more suitable ts for the growth of maize fig 2 while bm had no significant effect on maize photosynthetic capacity which was directly affected by ts under dm spad and lai of maize were higher than those under bm appendix 3 spad as a status indicator of nitrogen content li et al 2019b yue et al 2020 which could reflect that ts under dm could promote root absorption of nitrogen and the growth of maize to improve the photosynthetic capacity of maize as a result wang et al 2021a 2 tc has been confirmed to act on gpp by affecting leaf stomata huang et al 2019a lloyd and farquhar 2008 park williams et al 2012 in our study under both irrigation methods tc had a direct and significant effect on gpp but it had a greater effect under bm tc under bm was lower than that under dm fig 1 indicating that the plant water content was higher under bm thus to promote photosynthesis prasad et al 2011 in addition swc indirectly affected gpp through influencing tc and vpd under dm while swc acted directly on gpp under bm because the frequent wetting and drying of soil under dm would affect maize root uptake which was reflected in tc chaves et al 2003 and also affect soil evaporation and thus have an impact on local vpd however bm had a lower irrigation frequency but more deep drainage deng et al 2006 wang et al 2020a so that swc had no significant influence on tc and vpd swc was less and the response of crop growth to swc was more significant under bm than those under dm fig 6 possibly attributed to the fact that moderately low water level could promote photosynthesis in plants lu et al 2022 tc had an indirect effect on gpp by influencing vpd under dm and bm figs 5 6 this was because tc affected the stomatal opening and closing of leaves fukuda et al 2018 tan 1993 which changed canopy vapor pressure through affecting plant transpiration and thus had an impact on the vpd which would also affect inflow and outflow of co2 flux in the plants olivo et al 2009 existing studies have shown that high vpd could reduce stomatal conductance and xylem conductance of plants thus limiting plant photosynthesis mcdowell et al 2008 novick et al 2016 yuan et al 2019a however both of our two irrigation methods applied full irrigation which made vpd relatively low so they both had a positive effect on gpp 0 17 4 2 disentangling the relative role of ts swc and vpd on gpp under different irrigation strategies the relative independent contributions of ts swc and vpd to gpp in binning were consistent with the conclusions of partial correlation coefficients and sem under dm and bm our study found that dominant effect of ts on gpp was greater than that of swc under the two irrigation methods which was the same as conclusions at the global scale drawn by dang et al 2022 in our experiment film mulching increased the mean ts and reduced the damage of low ts at night to crops which might have expanded the promoting effect of ts on crop growth however dang et al 2022 pointed out that swc had a greater impact on gpp in arid and semi arid areas which was inconsistent with our conclusions possibly because his study failed to consider irrigated fields with mulch could ensure sufficient swc studies have shown that under high swc availability higher temperature could improve the net photosynthetic capacity of maize and other angiosperms korner 2015 reich et al 2018 vpd can greatly affect the carbon sequestration capacity of ecosystems pan et al 2011 which was often ignored in research jin et al 2018 matheny et al 2014 the conclusion that vpd had more influence on gpp than swc was consistent with that of many other studies kimm et al 2020 sulman et al 2016 this may be related to the fact that our irrigation method was full irrigation which had a relatively small fluctuation of swc and hence reduced the effect of swc on gpp some studies have shown that the ambient temperature once having exceeded the optimum value will limit photosynthesis chen et al 2021 medlyn et al 2002 but the temperature couldn t maintain at an optimum value in most ecosystems dang et al 2022 huang et al 2019b in our study the median of δgpp ts swc under both irrigation methods was positive at the same time when ts under dm was higher than that under bm the promotion effect of ts on gpp was also greater accordingly therefore we believe that facing global warming the two irrigation methods still have the potential to increase gpp liu et al 2020 pointed out that in most of the vegetation δ gpp swc vpd was negative even in the semi arid areas and swc restrictions on gpp were the most but he failed to separate specific differences and effects under different irrigation methods our study further found that swc under dm was higher than that under bm and that the median of δ gpp swc ts under dm was negative and under bm weakly positive this was perhaps because moderate soil water deficit could increase the activity of key enzymes in the process of carbon assimilation cui et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 which was more conducive to photosynthesis lu et al 2022 in a nutshell the decrease of swc could promote gpp under both dm and bm under different conditions the effects of vpd on photosynthesis were different kimm et al 2020 sulman et al 2016 plants closed stomata to limit gpp when vpd was high mcadam and brodribb 2015 yuan et al 2019a the value of vpd has not yet reached the threshold for limiting photosynthetic capacity of maize under these two irrigation methods the vpd under dm was larger than that under bm fig 2c and had no negative effect on gpp of maize therefore the continuous increase of vpd under the two water saving irrigation methods may continue to promote gpp at present our research on the leading role of ts swc and vpd on gpp was mainly the study of laws and phenomena more mechanistic study on canopy and leaf as well as stomatal level responses to water temperature and nutrients is necessary to disentangle the physiological and phenological responses of crops to dm and bm in the future model simulation based on more experimental observation data may be carried out to make existing conclusions more convincing and further explain the underlying mechanisms 4 3 implications for agricultural microclimate and modeling research farmland management measures have an impact on microclimate conditions and even feedback to affect regional climate but relevant researches are seldom found at present zhou et al 2012 although we only conducted a single point experiment on maize fields under dm and bm we conducted a detailed comparative experimental design and data observations the obvious difference between dm and bm was irrigation according to the analysis we found that irrigation had total effect on gpp 0 11 under dm and bm fig 6 in the analysis of the results of mulched irrigation ming et al 2021 found that irrigation would increase gpp which was also confirmed in our study irrigation also had a certain degree of influence on vpd varying among different under different irrigation methods fig 6 lo valvo et al 2018 pointed out that irrigation could effectively affect vpd in the study of 28 stations in wisconsin central sands region therefore farmland management measures have an impact on microclimate at present many meteorological observations and climate models fail to fully consider the impact of irrigation despite that fact that irrigation could have a certain impact on the climate system boucher et al 2004 harding and snyder 2012 with the expansion of irrigated agriculture accuracy of the land atmosphere coupling model of the earth could be greatly improved if taking account of the impact of irrigation on climate chen et al 2017 huang et al 2013 nocco et al 2019 vpd plays an important role in the carbon flux mcdowell et al 2008 novick et al 2016 olivo et al 2009 yuan et al 2019a the error of current global vegetation dynamic models in gpp simulation happened for failing to consider vpd rigden et al 2020 yuan et al 2019b and in our study the relative contribution of vpd to gpp was even greater than that of swc fig 7 interestingly novick et al 2016 pointed out that atmospheric demand would have an increasing impact on vegetation function thus we suggest that the influence of vpd should be fully considered in microclimate research and future model development in our study we also found that i p ts and tc had indirect effects on gpp figs 5 6 in previous analysis of sem it was not difficult to find that environmental factors were prone to have indirect effects on gpp yet failing to arouse sufficient attention gui et al 2021 guo et al 2021 song et al 2021 wang et al 2021b therefore in analysis of the influence of the target parameters considering the mutual influence of each factor only focusing on the direct influence and ignoring the indirect influence may misinterpret the effect of parameters we suggest that the indirect effects of environmental factors on carbon fluxes and other parameters should be fully considered in both experimental analyses and climate models in future 5 conclusions based on the eddy covariance system we measured water heat and carbon fluxes in maize fields under dm and bm during 2014 2018 in arid areas of northwest china the effects of environmental factors on gpp were quantified using the sem and the relative importance of ts vs swc and vpd vs swc to gpp were decoupled using the partial correlation coefficient and the binning method the main research results are as follows 1 the annual mean ts swc vpd and gpp in the whole growth period of the dm were higher than those under bm 2 the top three factors having the largest total effects on gpp under the two irrigation methods were ts tc and vpd among which ts had the largest total effect on gpp under dm and tc had the largest total effect on gpp under bm 3 ts and vpd had greater relative contribution to gpp than swc under dm and bm facing climate warming and increasing drought in the future both irrigation methods have the possibility to further improve photosynthesis 4 the effects of irrigation on farmland microclimate vpd and the indirect effects of environmental factors on gpp should be highlighted in future experimental analyses and accounted for in the coupled earth system models in general we quantified the effects of environmental factors on gpp and separated the independent effects of temperature and drought on gpp under the two irrigation methods however in order to better clarify the physiological and phenological responses of crops to dm and bm it is necessary to further study the response mechanism of canopy and leaf as well as stomatal level to water temperature and nutrients and carry out

9197,the wei river basin wrb is the main winter wheat producing area in northwest china and plays a pivotal role in national food security and economic development drought is the main agro meteorological disaster affecting winter wheat yield in this region and the accurate assessment of the drought impacts on crop growth and yield is an important part of maintaining food security however commonly used assessment methods such as correlation analysis and crop model simulation have some limitations in this study based on standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at multiple time scales gross primary production gpp and yield data from 1990 to 2018 sensitivity analysis pearson correlation and superposed epoch analysis sea were used to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought in the wrb and its influence on winter wheat growth and quantitatively assess the impact of drought at different levels on winter wheat yield the results were as follows 1 overall the wrb was in a dry state with a drying trend during 1990 2018 and the droughts in spring summer and winter were the main driving forces of annual drought that seriously threatened the growth and yield of winter wheat especially in spring march may which is the key growth period of winter wheat 2 the average annual gpp of winter wheat in the wrb showed a significant upward trend of 0 465 10a 1 and the central part of the wrb was the region where winter wheat gpp had higher sensitivity to drought in general winter wheat gpp during the growing season was most sensitive to spei 3 indicating that seasonal water deficits had the greatest impact on winter wheat growth 3 the yield reduction of winter wheat caused by drought presented a spatial distribution that is heavy in the north and light in the south and as the drought grade increased the winter wheat yield decreased more significantly even in irrigated areas therefore relevant government departments still need to strengthen the risk management of agricultural droughts in the wrb and formulate reasonable policies to maintain food security keywords drought impact crop growth sensitivity analysis yield reduction superposed epoch analysis data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction drought is one of the major meteorological disasters affecting crop growth and yield and has become an important cause of farmland ecosystem degradation and yield reduction lesk et al 2016 sherrod et al 2018 shi et al 2021 xia et al 2021 zhu et al 2021a the farmland ecosystem is an essential part of the terrestrial ecosystem and it not only regulates terrestrial carbon cycle deng et al 2021 but also plays a role in ensuring food production promoting economic development and maintaining social stability beerling et al 2018 lesk et al 2016 major food producing countries and regions around the world such as china the central united states europe southeast asia and southeastern south america have been threatened by drought for a long time geng et al 2016 leading to serious global and regional food security problems according to statistics ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2018 in china from 2008 to 2017 the average drought affected area of crops was 1 34 107 hm2 the average grain loss was 1 90 1010 kg and the average direct economic loss as a percentage of gdp was 0 22 therefore clarifying the drought impacts on crop growth and yield is important for mitigating drought disasters and the results will be helpful to government departments to formulate scientific agricultural drought risk management measures drought profoundly affects crop growth and yields in terms of the drought impact on crop growth normalized difference vegetation index ndvi enhanced vegetation index evi leaf area index lai and other indices have been widely used to characterize crop growth huang et al 2016 li et al 2019 shahzaman et al 2021 zhu et al 2021a however these traditional vegetation indices mainly monitor vegetation canopy structure are not sensitive to short term physiological changes caused by water heat sunlight etc and can only reflect changes in vegetation function on a long term scale damm et al 2010 dobrowski et al 2005 in contrast gross primary production gpp responds faster when crops suffer from drought stress deng et al 2021 and as a key parameter for quantifying the carbon sequestration capacity of ecosystems the amount of organic carbon fixed by crops through photosynthesis can be directly obtained which is a good reference for evaluating the drought impact on final crop yield huang et al 2016 compared the sensitivity of models in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and observations of global gpp to drought their results showed that it was more obvious in arid regions and the influence degree was closely related to the time scale of the drought index li et al 2022 estimated gpp based on solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif and combined it with palmer drought index pdsi to evaluate the response of gpp to a typical drought event in yunnan province they found that gppsif could quickly and accurately present the drought evolution and there were spatial differences in response characteristics similarly shen et al 2022 assessed the gpp loss of winter wheat caused by drought in the north china plain in different phenological stages through the sif gpp linear relationship and found that sif could precisely quantify the gpp loss caused by drought especially during the important growth period of winter wheat in terms of the drought impact on crop yield the commonly used methods include correlation analysis and crop growth models correlation analysis is used to establish a statistical model for semi quantitative evaluation by analyzing the correlation between drought index and crop yield leng and hall 2019 estimated the yield loss of four grain crops in response to drought of different intensities using standardized precipitation index spi and liu et al 2018 found that standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei could be a good indicator of drought to explain the correlation between drought and crop yield in the north china plain however these studies only described the macroscopic laws between the two sets of data and could not quantify the impact of a drought event suggesting that it has great limitations in solving practical problems in addition crop growth models have been widely used in studies on the impact assessment of drought on crop yield owing to their ability to quantitatively and dynamically describe the process of crop growth yield formation and its response to the environment tao et al 2018 wang et al 2017 quantitatively evaluated the effects of drought on winter wheat yield in the huang huai hai plain using daily spei and crop growth models yu et al 2021 used a crop growth model developed based on chlorophyll fluorescence to predict yield and they found that the prediction accuracy of crop growth was significantly improved zhu et al 2021b simulated the maize yield in china under future scenarios using a calibrated aquacrop model their results suggested that drought intensity and yield loss will increase in most areas of china in the future especially in northwest china where agricultural production is entirely dependent on irrigation in summary crop growth models can simulate the physiological processes of crops while taking human activities into consideration however a model requires many parameters and long time series data and some parameters are difficult to obtain resulting in high cost and complex operation therefore crop growth models are not universally applicable at a regional scale in recent years the superposed epoch analysis sea method has attracted the attention of researchers it could directly quantify the response of crop yield to a drought event moreover the data could be easily used and interpreted lesk et al 2016 used the sea method to establish actual occurred composited series as and control composited series cs on a global scale to separate the losses of production yield and harvested area of global cereal crops caused by drought extreme heat floods and extreme cold disasters from 1964 to 2007 they found that drought and extreme heat reduced production by 9 10 and the production damage caused by drought in developed countries was 8 11 higher than that in developing countries shi et al 2021 applied the sea method in china at a provincial scale and quantitatively separated the yield reduction of maize rice soybean and wheat caused by drought and flood from 1982 to 2012 in china and major grain producing areas northeast china the huang huai hai plain and the mid lower reaches of the yangtze river the results showed that drought significantly reduced the yield and production of the four crops by 4 5 11 6 and the yield losses caused by drought and flood varied in different major grain producing areas suggesting that drought seriously affected crop production and targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies are needed in different regions at present the sea method has only been adopted on the global and provincial scales but research on a regional scale is lacking recently many studies have explored the impact of drought on crops but most of them used traditional vegetation indices to monitor crop growth li et al 2019 shahzaman et al 2021 zhu et al 2021a and used methods such as correlation analysis and crop growth models to semi quantify the response of crop yield to drought wang et al 2017 leng and hall 2019 zhu et al 2021b nevertheless gpp data and sea method were rarely used to evaluate the response of final crop yield to drought especially studies at the regional scale were still lacking therefore in this study we aim to solve the following problems 1 what were the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought especially occurred during the growing season of winter wheat in the wrb from 1990 to 2018 2 how did winter wheat gpp change during this period and were there some differences in sensitivities of gpp to spei at different time scales 3 how much yield loss was caused by drought that occurred during the key growth period of winter wheat could irrigation completely eliminate the negative effects of drought 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wei river the longest primary tributary of the yellow river originates from the niaoshu mountain in weiyuan county gansu province it flows from west to east through longxi and tianshui in gansu province baoji xi an and weinan in shaanxi province and finally flows into the yellow river in tongguan county cai et al 2018 the wrb is the largest sub basin of the yellow river basin and is located in the southeast of the loess plateau in northwest china at 104 00 110 20 e and 33 40 37 30 n there are 12 prefecture level administrative areas in the basin they include dingxi pingliang qingyang and tianshui in gansu province guyuan in ningxia hui autonomous region and baoji yangling xianyang xi an weinan tongchuan and yan an in shaanxi province topographically the wrb is high in the west and low in the east with the highest of 3913 m and the average altitude of 1378 m the northern part of the wrb is the loess plateau the central part is the guanzhong plain and the southern part is the qinling mountains in the wrb the annual temperature difference is large the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation is uneven with large inter annual differences and the annual average temperature and total precipitation both show a decreasing trend from east to west specifically from 1990 to 2018 the average total precipitation in the growing season of winter wheat was 259 mm and that of another grain crop summer maize was 289 mm in addition the main soil type in the wrb is loess soil which is loose and soft and has poor water storage and moisture retention resulting in soil erosion and drought disasters 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 spei in this study the global monthly multi time scale spei gridded dataset speibase v 2 6 https hdl handle net 10261 202305 were used to comprehensively reflect the drought conditions of the wrb from 1990 to 2018 the drought grades are presented in table 1 this drought index constructed by vicente serrano et al 2010 introduced potential evapotranspiration which is more suitable for a climate warming background furthermore spei not only has the characteristics of multi time scales but also integrates the natural factors affecting drought making drought monitoring results more accurate xu et al 2021 yang et al 2017 therefore this dataset has been widely used in drought characteristic analyses and impact assessment studies geng et al 2022 li et al 2019 schwalm et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2013 wang et al 2018a the 0 5 spei data was resampled to 0 05 to match the spatial resolution of the gpp data using the bilinear interpolation method wei et al 2022 2 2 2 gpp and soil moisture gpp data were derived from the global long term gpp dataset based on near infrared reflectance nirv https data tpdc ac cn zh hans data d6dff40f 5dbd 4f2d ac96 55827ab93cc5 wang et al 2021 and the dataset was generated based on advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and observations from hundreds of flux sites around the world the study period was from 1990 to 2018 with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 and a temporal resolution of a month global land data assimilation system gldas noah soil surface 0 10 cm moisture product unit kg m 2 provided by nasa https giovanni gsfc nasa gov giovanni rodell et al 2004 was used to assist in explaining the relationship between gpp and drought in the wrb from 1990 to 2018 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a temporal resolution of a month the data had the advantages of stable driving field advanced land surface models and long time series which provided an opportunity to assess global and regional climate and environmental changes fang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 2 2 3 winter wheat planting area the proportion of wheat harvested area http www earthstat org harvested area yield 175 crops was selected from the harvested data of 175 crops collected in earthstat monfreda et al 2008 and with a spatial resolution of 0 083 0 083 when the proportion of the harvest area per unit pixel was greater than 5 the pixel was defined as the winter wheat planting area figs 1 and 2 moreover the spatial resolution of this data was resampled to 0 05 using the nearest neighbor method 2 2 4 irrigated areas the irrigated farmland of china in 2016 http www nesdc org cn sdo detail id 6189ebe17e2817667e3c7d97 was used in this study with a spatial resolution of 500 m fig 3 and this dataset was obtained by comparing the remote sensing vegetation canopy moisture of irrigated farmland natural forest and non irrigated farmland the results identified 87 and 59 of the irrigated farmland area at the provincial and prefectural levels respectively and the accuracy was better than that of other irrigation products xiang et al 2019 2 2 5 yield the winter wheat yield data of the major prefecture level administrative areas in the wrb from 1990 to 2018 including dingxi tianshui guyuan pingliang qingyang baoji xianyang tongchuan xi an and weinan were obtained from china economic and social big data research platform https data cnki net areas with incomplete records were imputed using the substitution method and the corrected statistical data were continuous 2 3 methods 2 3 1 standardized anomaly to better evaluate the impact of drought on winter wheat gpp the gpp data were standardized xu et al 2020 as follow 1 s i j m s i j m s i j s t d s i j m where s i j m is the standardized gpp at the i j pixel for the m th month s i j m is the original gpp at the i j pixel for the m th month s i j is the mean gpp at the i j pixel for the same period from 1990 to 2018 and s t d s i j m is the standard deviation at the i j pixel from 1990 to 2018 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity coefficient was used to quantitatively analyze the impact of drought on winter wheat gpp and the linear regression equation between gpp and spei from 1990 to 2018 was established pixel by pixel wang et al 2018b the formula used is as follow 2 y i j a i j x i j ε i j where y i j is the gpp standardized anomaly at the i j pixel x i j is the spei value at the i j pixel the regression coefficient a i j reflects the sensitivity of standardized gpp to spei at the i j pixel and ε i j is the random error the larger the regression coefficient a i j the more sensitive the gpp is to drought 2 3 3 detrending of winter wheat yield crop yield consists of trends climatic fluctuations and random negligible yields to accurately determine the yield fluctuation caused by drought the original yield data should be detrended and the detrended results of the hp filter method in recent common methods are more scientific xie and li 2019 yu et al 2018 therefore we selected the hp filter method to detrend the winter wheat yield in past years 2 3 4 correlation analysis to explore the effect of drought at different growth stages of winter wheat on final yields pearson correlation analysis was used to calculate the relationship between the spei and climatic yield of winter wheat at each growth stage and the correlation coefficient between the two was obtained and then tested for significance yu et al 2018 2 3 5 superposed epoch analysis due to the limitations of the study area short study time series and incomplete data based on the sea method in the studies of lesk et al 2016 and shi et al 2021 we selected five years as a window and the actual year of drought was positioned in the center moreover the 5 year window included the yield data of the two years preceding the drought the two years following the drought and the drought year so that the yield change rate in each drought event could be calculated for continuous droughts the window was extended that is the average yield of the drought years was taken as the data for the drought year for example for a 3 year drought the 5 year window was extended to a 7 year window and the mean yield in the three drought years was assigned as the data for the drought year value the yield change rate due to drought was used to reflect the drought impact on winter wheat yield at different levels hu et al 2021 and it is calculated as follows 3 y p y y y 100 where y p is the yield change rate y is the average yield of the two years preceding the drought and the two years following the drought in the 5 year window that is the reference yield kg mu and y is the yield of the central year in the 5 year time window that is the yield of a drought event kg mu 3 results 3 1 spatial temporal characteristics of drought to analyze the characteristics of annual seasonal and winter wheat growing season drought in the wrb spei 12 in december spei 3 in may august november and february and spei 9 in june were selected to represent the drought conditions of the year spring march may summer june august autumn september november winter december february and growing season october june respectively as shown in fig 4 the annual spei showed a slight downward trend at a rate of 0 009 10a 1 and the fluctuation was relatively gentle fig 4a indicating that the wrb might become dryer in the future the spring spei fig 4b summer spei fig 4c and winter spei fig 4e decreased by 0 236 10a 1 0 155 10a 1 and 0 122 10a 1 respectively and are consistent with the trend of annual spei similarly the spei in the winter wheat growing season also decreased by 0 016 10a 1 fig 4f revealing that the growth environment of winter wheat in the wrb was arid in the past 29 years and would continue to be so it should be noted that the spei fluctuated sharply in spring and summer and spring was an important growth period for winter wheat therefore drought at this time might seriously affect winter wheat yield furthermore the autumn spei fig 4d showed an upward trend at a rate of 0 405 10a 1 the highest spei value was 2 47 in 2011 and the lowest spei value was 2 05 in 1998 fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of annual seasonal and winter wheat growing season spei trends and their significance in the wrb it can be seen that the trends failed the significance test p 0 05 except that some areas in the autumn basin showed a significant wetting trend the area with a drying trend of annual spei accounted for 52 5 of the study area and the drying area was mainly distributed in the west of the wrb fig 5a spring spei fig 5b showed a drying trend and the areas of summer fig 5c and winter spei fig 5e with a drying trend accounted for 90 1 and 88 3 of the wrb respectively almost covering the winter wheat planting area which was unfavorable for agricultural production in the wrb it is worth noting that during the winter wheat growing season almost the entire wrb showed a drying trend fig 5f indicating that drought had seriously threatened and would continue to threaten the growth of winter wheat so it is necessary to take drought prevention measures during the growing season and focus on the artificial adjustment of water resources in addition this basin showed a wetting trend in autumn fig 5d in which 68 4 of the areas became significantly wet concentrated in the southern wrb 3 2 sensitivity of winter wheat gpp to drought gpp is an important indicator for measuring the accumulation of matter and energy during vegetation growth and winter wheat converts atmospheric carbon into gpp through photosynthesis fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the multi year average gpp during the growing season of winter wheat october june in the wrb the results showed that the average gpp was 9 203 g c m 2 d 1 with an increasing trend from north to south geographically the areas with higher values were mainly distributed in the southeastern and central parts of the wrb owing to the flat terrain good irrigation conditions and relatively sufficient water supply however the lower gpp were distributed in the west and north of the wrb where rainfed agriculture was dominant and water was limited during the growing stage resulting in low gross primary production fig 7 shows the inter annual variation of gpp standardized anomalies during the growing season of winter wheat in the wrb for the period 1990 2018 overall the standardized anomalies showed a significant upward trend with a rate of 0 465 10a 1 and fluctuated greatly in the 1990s and early 21st century after the severe drought occurred in 1997 gpp decreased significantly and showed large negative anomalies in the following years combined with annual and seasonal spei trends in fig 4 it can be seen that the gpp anomaly was negative when spei was negative indicating that the winter wheat was under stress when the wrb was in a state of drought moreover in 1990 1996 2002 2011 and 2014 the gpp standardized anomalies of winter wheat became positive when the drought was alleviated or even in a humid state suggesting that winter wheat gpp in the wrb was affected by the dry and wet climatic changes and the response had a certain hysteresis using spei at each time scale as the independent variable and the monthly gpp standardized anomalies in the critical growing stage march may hu et al 2021 shen et al 2022 yu et al 2018 and the growing season as the dependent variables the regression coefficients were calculated pixel by pixel fig 8 the larger the regression coefficient the stronger the sensitivity of gpp to drought as shown in fig 8 the spatial distribution patterns of sensitivity in march april may and the growing season were similar specifically the areas with positive values were mainly concentrated in the central and western parts of the wrb whereas the areas with negative values were concentrated in the guanzhong plain in terms of spei at different time scales the sensitivity distribution and coefficient values of winter wheat gpp in march and april to spei at different time scales varied slightly however the sensitivity and coefficient values in may differed greatly and the areas with positive coefficients accounted for 79 4 gpp spei1 85 4 gpp spei3 and 94 9 gpp spei12 of the winter wheat planting area in the wrb respectively the positive sensitivity of winter wheat gpp to drought in the growing season accounted for 68 20 gpp spei1 89 0 gpp spei3 and 83 8 gpp spei12 of the winter wheat planting area in the wrb respectively indicating that the most water requiring stage of winter wheat in the key growth period was in may especially the long term cumulative water deficit before it had a deep impact on winter wheat gpp in addition winter wheat gpp was most sensitive to spei 3 during the growing season in terms of the regression coefficient fig 9 winter wheat gpp during the growing season was the most sensitive to spei 3 and the least sensitive to spei 12 furthermore the areas with higher coefficients were mainly distributed in dingxi and qingyang suggesting that gpp during the growing season was more sensitive to short term water deficits and had the most timely and large response in summary winter wheat gpp in the central wrb was generally highly sensitive to drought and gpp during the growing season was more susceptible to short term drought stress 3 3 impact of drought on winter wheat yield the growth stages of winter wheat in the wrb were divided into seedling stage october tillering stage november december overwintering stage january february greening stage march standing jointing stage april heading flowering stage may and milk filling stage june monthly spei 1 was used to represent the water deficit of the current stage and the average value was taken for the growth stage which lasted for two months the correlation between the spei at each growth stage and climatic yield in various prefecture level administrative areas from 1990 to 2018 was statistically analyzed and the differences in the sensitivity of winter wheat to drought at different growth stages were clarified it can be seen from fig 10 that the water demand of winter wheat first peaked at the tillering stage and the water deficit at this stage reduced the winter wheat yield to some extent the water demand of winter wheat reached the second peak during the period of greening flowering and winter wheat in other prefecture level administrative areas except for the five regions in the guanzhong plain was vulnerable to drought in conclusion winter wheat in the wrb was most sensitive to drought during the tillering and greening flowering stages previous studies showed that the most critical growth stage for the water requirement of winter wheat was the greening flowering period hu et al 2021 shen et al 2022 yu et al 2018 that is from march to may each year corroborating the above conclusion thus we used the spei 3 in may to identify moderate or above drought events in the wrb from 1990 to 2018 and the results are presented in table 2 among the ten prefecture level administrative areas in the wrb where winter wheat was planted 44 drought events in total including 19 severe drought events and 15 extreme drought events occurred in 1995 2000 2001 2004 and 2007 2008 in all prefecture level administrative areas compared with other regions qingyang had the most drought years whereas dingxi had the fewest the longest drought event in the wrb was in 2004 2008 and occurred in pingliang qingyang guyuan xianyang weinan and tongchuan demonstrating that drought events had regional characteristics and that the neighboring prefecture level administrative areas might suffer from drought at the same time in general the most drought events occurred in the 2000s in the wrb the yield change rate of winter wheat yield caused by drought was obtained according to formula 3 and its spatial distribution is displayed in fig 11 it can be seen that the yield change rate caused by the drought from 1990 to 2018 was heavy in the north and light in the south and the area with severe yield reduction was mainly concentrated in the northwest of the wrb this may be because this region is located in the southern part of the loess plateau where the landform type is mainly loess tableland and the soil water holding capacity is poor and not conducive to the growth of winter wheat moreover the areas where drought had less impact on yield were mainly concentrated in the guanzhong plain and the yield change rate was greater than 10 or even greater than 0 for different drought levels the average negative change rate of winter wheat yield caused by the moderate drought events fig 11a was 6 6 with the highest value of 14 3 in guyuan there was a positive value in dingxi and no moderate drought event occurred in weinan the average negative change rate of winter wheat yield caused by severe drought events fig 11b was 7 0 and the highest was 19 3 in qingyang but the yield change rate in baoji was positive the average negative change rate of winter wheat yield caused by extreme drought events fig 11c was 12 0 the highest was 33 6 in qingyang but tongchuan had a positive value in summary the higher the drought grade in the wrb the higher the winter wheat yield reduction table 3 shows the average yield change rate for the irrigated area and rainfed area caused by drought at different levels in the wrb in moderate drought events the average yield reduction rate in the irrigated area was 4 9 lower than that in rainfed area furthermore in severe and extreme drought events the average yield reduction rates in the irrigated area were also lower than that in the rainfed area and the average value in the rainfed area affected by extreme drought was even as high as 20 3 therefore we can draw a conclusion that there was also a reduction in winter wheat yield in the irrigated area but the yield reduction rate was not higher than 10 and the reduction was less than that in the rainfed area indicating that the development of irrigated agriculture could alleviate the yield reduction effect caused by drought but may not completely alleviate the impact of drought 4 discussion 4 1 data validity in this study gpp data were generated based on avhrr nirv data and observations from hundreds of flux sites worldwide because of the feasibility of nirv as a probe for sif and gpp badgley et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 nirv data was highly correlated with sif products and had the characteristics of sif which could accurately reflect the vegetation dynamics during photosynthesis and the gpp estimation based on these data can quickly capture the loss of vegetation productivity caused by drought moreover monthly seasonal and annual variations of gpp can be presented correctly wang et al 2021 and effective data support was provided for this study in addition the root mean square error rmse of this dataset was 1 95 g c m 2 d 1 thus it has been widely applied to climate change and carbon cycle studies liu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 the harvested area and yield for 175 crops around the world developed by the university of wisconsin madison were generated from the population data at the national state and county levels compared to the crop data of the united states department of agriculture usda it was more refined had a higher spatial resolution and did not change the planting pattern and distribution of crops therefore these data have broad application prospects in food security and agricultural land use under global climate change beerling et al 2018 monfreda et al 2008 moreover winter wheat was the main wheat plant in the wrb and the growing season was from october to june of the following year in this study we used the wheat harvest area in the dataset to extract the winter wheat planting area in the wrb and the data were valid and feasible enough to meet the accuracy requirements 4 2 relationship between gpp and yield of winter wheat winter wheat gpp reflects the amount of organic carbon fixed by photosynthesis during the growing season and can be used to characterize the growing status of winter wheat when drought occurs increased temperature in the field leads to enhanced evapotranspiration and vapor pressure deficit moreover the stomata of the plant canopy are closed to prevent excessive water loss and the increasing vapor pressure deficit inhibits the carbon sequestration of winter wheat resulting in crop yield reduction shi et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to explore the relationship between gpp and yield of winter wheat as shown in the fig 12 both gpp and yield showed a significant upward trend from 1990 to 2018 and the pearson correlation coefficient between the two was calculated to be 0 77 p 0 01 indicating that gpp and yield were extremely significantly correlated furthermore we counted the gpp and yield of the irrigated areas and the rainfed areas in the wrb respectively table 4 it can be seen that the gpp yield in the irrigated areas were higher than that in the rainfed areas indicating that irrigation in the wrb could make winter wheat grow vigorously and improve the photosynthesis efficiency thereby increasing winter wheat yield in addition spei and gpp yield were positively correlated in the rainfed areas but showed a very weak positive correlation or even a negative correlation in the irrigated areas this might be because the water required for the growth of winter wheat in the irrigated areas mainly depended on artificially adjusted water resources such as irrigation which alleviated the negative effects of drought to a certain extent therefore the impact of drought on winter wheat in the irrigated areas was not as great as that in the rainfed areas 4 3 effects of drought on gpp and yield of winter wheat in recent studies drought indices especially spei have been used to characterize drought conditions and assess their impact on crops and they have been implemented in many regions it was reported that spei was highly correlated with crop yield liu et al 2018 mokhtar et al 2021 sein et al 2021 confirming that the spei we selected had good applicability the drought trend in the wrb concluded in this study was consistent with that in previous studies chen and sun 2015 wu et al 2020 zou et al 2017 and the droughts in spring summer and winter which lasted throughout the growing season of winter wheat were the main components in the study area indicating that the productivity and yield of winter wheat would be threatened in this study we found that winter wheat gpp in the wrb showed an overall increasing trend during 1990 2018 revealing the rapid development of agricultural science and technology in this basin scientific implementation of farmland management measures improvement of soil quality and improvement of farming patterns furthermore previous studies have confirmed bonal et al 2008 saleska et al 2007 that low cloud cover during droughts could lead to increased solar radiation thereby promoting carbon dioxide absorption by vegetation in space winter wheat gpp showed an increasing trend from north to south which was consistent with the spatial distribution of soil moisture fig 13 the soil type of the loess plateau in the northern part of wrb is mainly loess soil with insufficient water storage capacity which is not conducive to the growth of winter wheat in contrast the southern part of the wrb especially the guanzhong plain had a relatively humid climate and developed irrigated agriculture thus hydrothermal conditions were suitable for crop growth the sensitivity coefficients of winter wheat gpp and spei in the wrb were mainly positive and the cumulative water deficit in the 3 month time scale could better reflect the sensitivity of winter wheat gpp to drought during the growing season corroborating the report of huang et al 2016 these results suggested that the response of gpp to drought was closely related to the selected timescale of the drought index whereas the sensitivity of winter wheat gpp to spei was mainly negative in the guanzhong plain and it might be due to its favorable hydrothermal conditions and stronger resistance and resilience to drought stress compared to other regions in this study we analyzed the impact of drought at each growth stage of winter wheat on the final yield and the results showed that drought at the tillering and greening flowering stages had the highest correlation with yield this was because the water deficit at the heading stage increases the number of sterile spikelets and florets and the water deficit at the flowering stage affects pollination and fertilization and reduces the seed setting rate thereby affecting the yield however the development of irrigated agriculture in the guanzhong plain could effectively alleviate the negative effects of drought meanwhile drought at the milk filling stage may not endanger the climatic yield and even an appropriate water deficit could reduce the impact of wet damage on winter wheat and ensure the yield is up to standard in addition we used a 5 year window which could directly quantify the response of winter wheat yield to drought events compared to statistical and crop models to obtain the reference yield moreover the research on the response of winter wheat yield to drought was carried out at the regional scale and refined to each prefecture level administrative area compared with researches at national and provincial scales this study reveals the impact of drought disasters on local grain production more intensively and will help local governments to formulate targeted food security policies 4 4 uncertainty first we defined the winter wheat planting area when the proportion of winter wheat harvested area in a pixel was greater than 5 however a pixel usually contains a variety of ground features that is there was a problem of mixed pixels which might cause the extracted winter wheat gpp to deviate from the actual value in addition there would be errors in data resampling which might reduce the accuracy of the winter wheat gpp moreover the winter wheat yield data collected in this study were multi source statistical data for a long time and incomplete records were imputed by means of the substitution method which might also lead to some deviation from the actual results in the future it is expected that long term and complete statistics or long term gridded data of crop yield will be obtained using crop models besides there are many factors affecting the gpp and yield of winter wheat in addition to drought they include floods extreme heat extreme cold other agro meteorological disasters or pests and diseases nevertheless the influence of other disasters which introduces uncertainties to the research results could not be determined finally the development of irrigated agriculture in the wrb can alleviate the negative effects of drought on crops to a certain extent nevertheless owing to the inability to obtain detailed data on irrigation there were limitations in our study therefore further research is needed in the future 5 conclusions in this study we analyzed the drought characteristics in the wrb from 1990 to 2018 and quantified the sensitivity coefficient between gpp and multiscale spei thereafter we quantitatively assessed the impact of drought on winter wheat yield the conclusions are as follows 1 from 1990 2018 the overall drought in the wrb increased particularly in the western part the annual spei in the wrb decreased at a rate of 0 009 10a 1 and the droughts in spring summer and winter were the main driving forces of annual drought especially in spring march may which was the key growth period of winter wheat and might pose a serious threat to the growth and yield of winter wheat in the wrb 2 in the past 29 years the average annual gpp of winter wheat in the wrb was 9 203 g c m 2 d 1 and increased significantly at a rate of 0 465 10a 1 from a spatial perspective the annual average gpp value in the guanzhong plain reached the highest value of 53 44 g c m 2 d 1 moreover winter wheat gpp was most sensitive to spei 3 during the growing season indicating that water deficit on a seasonal scale had the greatest impact on winter wheat growth 3 the yield reduction of winter wheat in the wrb due to drought showed a high and low spatial distribution in the north and south respectively among which extreme drought even caused a 33 6 reduction in winter wheat yield in qingyang in addition as the drought grade increased the winter wheat yield decreased more significantly even in the irrigated area however reduction was less than that in the rainfed area suggesting that irrigated agriculture had a significant effect on alleviation of drought but could not fully mitigate drought stress to minimize the impact of drought on the growth and yield of winter wheat farmers need to appropriately increase the frequency and amount of irrigation and strengthen water management nevertheless irrigation cannot be completely relied upon and other actions should be taken such as supplementing fertilizers in an appropriate amount selecting drought tolerant winter wheat varieties and changing the sowing time of winter wheat based on phenology therefore the response of winter wheat phenology to drought can be further studied in the future and the sowing time can be flexibly changed to avoid the drought that may occur in the key growth period of winter wheat as much as possible declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be

9197,the wei river basin wrb is the main winter wheat producing area in northwest china and plays a pivotal role in national food security and economic development drought is the main agro meteorological disaster affecting winter wheat yield in this region and the accurate assessment of the drought impacts on crop growth and yield is an important part of maintaining food security however commonly used assessment methods such as correlation analysis and crop model simulation have some limitations in this study based on standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at multiple time scales gross primary production gpp and yield data from 1990 to 2018 sensitivity analysis pearson correlation and superposed epoch analysis sea were used to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought in the wrb and its influence on winter wheat growth and quantitatively assess the impact of drought at different levels on winter wheat yield the results were as follows 1 overall the wrb was in a dry state with a drying trend during 1990 2018 and the droughts in spring summer and winter were the main driving forces of annual drought that seriously threatened the growth and yield of winter wheat especially in spring march may which is the key growth period of winter wheat 2 the average annual gpp of winter wheat in the wrb showed a significant upward trend of 0 465 10a 1 and the central part of the wrb was the region where winter wheat gpp had higher sensitivity to drought in general winter wheat gpp during the growing season was most sensitive to spei 3 indicating that seasonal water deficits had the greatest impact on winter wheat growth 3 the yield reduction of winter wheat caused by drought presented a spatial distribution that is heavy in the north and light in the south and as the drought grade increased the winter wheat yield decreased more significantly even in irrigated areas therefore relevant government departments still need to strengthen the risk management of agricultural droughts in the wrb and formulate reasonable policies to maintain food security keywords drought impact crop growth sensitivity analysis yield reduction superposed epoch analysis data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction drought is one of the major meteorological disasters affecting crop growth and yield and has become an important cause of farmland ecosystem degradation and yield reduction lesk et al 2016 sherrod et al 2018 shi et al 2021 xia et al 2021 zhu et al 2021a the farmland ecosystem is an essential part of the terrestrial ecosystem and it not only regulates terrestrial carbon cycle deng et al 2021 but also plays a role in ensuring food production promoting economic development and maintaining social stability beerling et al 2018 lesk et al 2016 major food producing countries and regions around the world such as china the central united states europe southeast asia and southeastern south america have been threatened by drought for a long time geng et al 2016 leading to serious global and regional food security problems according to statistics ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2018 in china from 2008 to 2017 the average drought affected area of crops was 1 34 107 hm2 the average grain loss was 1 90 1010 kg and the average direct economic loss as a percentage of gdp was 0 22 therefore clarifying the drought impacts on crop growth and yield is important for mitigating drought disasters and the results will be helpful to government departments to formulate scientific agricultural drought risk management measures drought profoundly affects crop growth and yields in terms of the drought impact on crop growth normalized difference vegetation index ndvi enhanced vegetation index evi leaf area index lai and other indices have been widely used to characterize crop growth huang et al 2016 li et al 2019 shahzaman et al 2021 zhu et al 2021a however these traditional vegetation indices mainly monitor vegetation canopy structure are not sensitive to short term physiological changes caused by water heat sunlight etc and can only reflect changes in vegetation function on a long term scale damm et al 2010 dobrowski et al 2005 in contrast gross primary production gpp responds faster when crops suffer from drought stress deng et al 2021 and as a key parameter for quantifying the carbon sequestration capacity of ecosystems the amount of organic carbon fixed by crops through photosynthesis can be directly obtained which is a good reference for evaluating the drought impact on final crop yield huang et al 2016 compared the sensitivity of models in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and observations of global gpp to drought their results showed that it was more obvious in arid regions and the influence degree was closely related to the time scale of the drought index li et al 2022 estimated gpp based on solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif and combined it with palmer drought index pdsi to evaluate the response of gpp to a typical drought event in yunnan province they found that gppsif could quickly and accurately present the drought evolution and there were spatial differences in response characteristics similarly shen et al 2022 assessed the gpp loss of winter wheat caused by drought in the north china plain in different phenological stages through the sif gpp linear relationship and found that sif could precisely quantify the gpp loss caused by drought especially during the important growth period of winter wheat in terms of the drought impact on crop yield the commonly used methods include correlation analysis and crop growth models correlation analysis is used to establish a statistical model for semi quantitative evaluation by analyzing the correlation between drought index and crop yield leng and hall 2019 estimated the yield loss of four grain crops in response to drought of different intensities using standardized precipitation index spi and liu et al 2018 found that standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei could be a good indicator of drought to explain the correlation between drought and crop yield in the north china plain however these studies only described the macroscopic laws between the two sets of data and could not quantify the impact of a drought event suggesting that it has great limitations in solving practical problems in addition crop growth models have been widely used in studies on the impact assessment of drought on crop yield owing to their ability to quantitatively and dynamically describe the process of crop growth yield formation and its response to the environment tao et al 2018 wang et al 2017 quantitatively evaluated the effects of drought on winter wheat yield in the huang huai hai plain using daily spei and crop growth models yu et al 2021 used a crop growth model developed based on chlorophyll fluorescence to predict yield and they found that the prediction accuracy of crop growth was significantly improved zhu et al 2021b simulated the maize yield in china under future scenarios using a calibrated aquacrop model their results suggested that drought intensity and yield loss will increase in most areas of china in the future especially in northwest china where agricultural production is entirely dependent on irrigation in summary crop growth models can simulate the physiological processes of crops while taking human activities into consideration however a model requires many parameters and long time series data and some parameters are difficult to obtain resulting in high cost and complex operation therefore crop growth models are not universally applicable at a regional scale in recent years the superposed epoch analysis sea method has attracted the attention of researchers it could directly quantify the response of crop yield to a drought event moreover the data could be easily used and interpreted lesk et al 2016 used the sea method to establish actual occurred composited series as and control composited series cs on a global scale to separate the losses of production yield and harvested area of global cereal crops caused by drought extreme heat floods and extreme cold disasters from 1964 to 2007 they found that drought and extreme heat reduced production by 9 10 and the production damage caused by drought in developed countries was 8 11 higher than that in developing countries shi et al 2021 applied the sea method in china at a provincial scale and quantitatively separated the yield reduction of maize rice soybean and wheat caused by drought and flood from 1982 to 2012 in china and major grain producing areas northeast china the huang huai hai plain and the mid lower reaches of the yangtze river the results showed that drought significantly reduced the yield and production of the four crops by 4 5 11 6 and the yield losses caused by drought and flood varied in different major grain producing areas suggesting that drought seriously affected crop production and targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies are needed in different regions at present the sea method has only been adopted on the global and provincial scales but research on a regional scale is lacking recently many studies have explored the impact of drought on crops but most of them used traditional vegetation indices to monitor crop growth li et al 2019 shahzaman et al 2021 zhu et al 2021a and used methods such as correlation analysis and crop growth models to semi quantify the response of crop yield to drought wang et al 2017 leng and hall 2019 zhu et al 2021b nevertheless gpp data and sea method were rarely used to evaluate the response of final crop yield to drought especially studies at the regional scale were still lacking therefore in this study we aim to solve the following problems 1 what were the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought especially occurred during the growing season of winter wheat in the wrb from 1990 to 2018 2 how did winter wheat gpp change during this period and were there some differences in sensitivities of gpp to spei at different time scales 3 how much yield loss was caused by drought that occurred during the key growth period of winter wheat could irrigation completely eliminate the negative effects of drought 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wei river the longest primary tributary of the yellow river originates from the niaoshu mountain in weiyuan county gansu province it flows from west to east through longxi and tianshui in gansu province baoji xi an and weinan in shaanxi province and finally flows into the yellow river in tongguan county cai et al 2018 the wrb is the largest sub basin of the yellow river basin and is located in the southeast of the loess plateau in northwest china at 104 00 110 20 e and 33 40 37 30 n there are 12 prefecture level administrative areas in the basin they include dingxi pingliang qingyang and tianshui in gansu province guyuan in ningxia hui autonomous region and baoji yangling xianyang xi an weinan tongchuan and yan an in shaanxi province topographically the wrb is high in the west and low in the east with the highest of 3913 m and the average altitude of 1378 m the northern part of the wrb is the loess plateau the central part is the guanzhong plain and the southern part is the qinling mountains in the wrb the annual temperature difference is large the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation is uneven with large inter annual differences and the annual average temperature and total precipitation both show a decreasing trend from east to west specifically from 1990 to 2018 the average total precipitation in the growing season of winter wheat was 259 mm and that of another grain crop summer maize was 289 mm in addition the main soil type in the wrb is loess soil which is loose and soft and has poor water storage and moisture retention resulting in soil erosion and drought disasters 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 spei in this study the global monthly multi time scale spei gridded dataset speibase v 2 6 https hdl handle net 10261 202305 were used to comprehensively reflect the drought conditions of the wrb from 1990 to 2018 the drought grades are presented in table 1 this drought index constructed by vicente serrano et al 2010 introduced potential evapotranspiration which is more suitable for a climate warming background furthermore spei not only has the characteristics of multi time scales but also integrates the natural factors affecting drought making drought monitoring results more accurate xu et al 2021 yang et al 2017 therefore this dataset has been widely used in drought characteristic analyses and impact assessment studies geng et al 2022 li et al 2019 schwalm et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2013 wang et al 2018a the 0 5 spei data was resampled to 0 05 to match the spatial resolution of the gpp data using the bilinear interpolation method wei et al 2022 2 2 2 gpp and soil moisture gpp data were derived from the global long term gpp dataset based on near infrared reflectance nirv https data tpdc ac cn zh hans data d6dff40f 5dbd 4f2d ac96 55827ab93cc5 wang et al 2021 and the dataset was generated based on advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and observations from hundreds of flux sites around the world the study period was from 1990 to 2018 with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 and a temporal resolution of a month global land data assimilation system gldas noah soil surface 0 10 cm moisture product unit kg m 2 provided by nasa https giovanni gsfc nasa gov giovanni rodell et al 2004 was used to assist in explaining the relationship between gpp and drought in the wrb from 1990 to 2018 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a temporal resolution of a month the data had the advantages of stable driving field advanced land surface models and long time series which provided an opportunity to assess global and regional climate and environmental changes fang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 2 2 3 winter wheat planting area the proportion of wheat harvested area http www earthstat org harvested area yield 175 crops was selected from the harvested data of 175 crops collected in earthstat monfreda et al 2008 and with a spatial resolution of 0 083 0 083 when the proportion of the harvest area per unit pixel was greater than 5 the pixel was defined as the winter wheat planting area figs 1 and 2 moreover the spatial resolution of this data was resampled to 0 05 using the nearest neighbor method 2 2 4 irrigated areas the irrigated farmland of china in 2016 http www nesdc org cn sdo detail id 6189ebe17e2817667e3c7d97 was used in this study with a spatial resolution of 500 m fig 3 and this dataset was obtained by comparing the remote sensing vegetation canopy moisture of irrigated farmland natural forest and non irrigated farmland the results identified 87 and 59 of the irrigated farmland area at the provincial and prefectural levels respectively and the accuracy was better than that of other irrigation products xiang et al 2019 2 2 5 yield the winter wheat yield data of the major prefecture level administrative areas in the wrb from 1990 to 2018 including dingxi tianshui guyuan pingliang qingyang baoji xianyang tongchuan xi an and weinan were obtained from china economic and social big data research platform https data cnki net areas with incomplete records were imputed using the substitution method and the corrected statistical data were continuous 2 3 methods 2 3 1 standardized anomaly to better evaluate the impact of drought on winter wheat gpp the gpp data were standardized xu et al 2020 as follow 1 s i j m s i j m s i j s t d s i j m where s i j m is the standardized gpp at the i j pixel for the m th month s i j m is the original gpp at the i j pixel for the m th month s i j is the mean gpp at the i j pixel for the same period from 1990 to 2018 and s t d s i j m is the standard deviation at the i j pixel from 1990 to 2018 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity coefficient was used to quantitatively analyze the impact of drought on winter wheat gpp and the linear regression equation between gpp and spei from 1990 to 2018 was established pixel by pixel wang et al 2018b the formula used is as follow 2 y i j a i j x i j ε i j where y i j is the gpp standardized anomaly at the i j pixel x i j is the spei value at the i j pixel the regression coefficient a i j reflects the sensitivity of standardized gpp to spei at the i j pixel and ε i j is the random error the larger the regression coefficient a i j the more sensitive the gpp is to drought 2 3 3 detrending of winter wheat yield crop yield consists of trends climatic fluctuations and random negligible yields to accurately determine the yield fluctuation caused by drought the original yield data should be detrended and the detrended results of the hp filter method in recent common methods are more scientific xie and li 2019 yu et al 2018 therefore we selected the hp filter method to detrend the winter wheat yield in past years 2 3 4 correlation analysis to explore the effect of drought at different growth stages of winter wheat on final yields pearson correlation analysis was used to calculate the relationship between the spei and climatic yield of winter wheat at each growth stage and the correlation coefficient between the two was obtained and then tested for significance yu et al 2018 2 3 5 superposed epoch analysis due to the limitations of the study area short study time series and incomplete data based on the sea method in the studies of lesk et al 2016 and shi et al 2021 we selected five years as a window and the actual year of drought was positioned in the center moreover the 5 year window included the yield data of the two years preceding the drought the two years following the drought and the drought year so that the yield change rate in each drought event could be calculated for continuous droughts the window was extended that is the average yield of the drought years was taken as the data for the drought year for example for a 3 year drought the 5 year window was extended to a 7 year window and the mean yield in the three drought years was assigned as the data for the drought year value the yield change rate due to drought was used to reflect the drought impact on winter wheat yield at different levels hu et al 2021 and it is calculated as follows 3 y p y y y 100 where y p is the yield change rate y is the average yield of the two years preceding the drought and the two years following the drought in the 5 year window that is the reference yield kg mu and y is the yield of the central year in the 5 year time window that is the yield of a drought event kg mu 3 results 3 1 spatial temporal characteristics of drought to analyze the characteristics of annual seasonal and winter wheat growing season drought in the wrb spei 12 in december spei 3 in may august november and february and spei 9 in june were selected to represent the drought conditions of the year spring march may summer june august autumn september november winter december february and growing season october june respectively as shown in fig 4 the annual spei showed a slight downward trend at a rate of 0 009 10a 1 and the fluctuation was relatively gentle fig 4a indicating that the wrb might become dryer in the future the spring spei fig 4b summer spei fig 4c and winter spei fig 4e decreased by 0 236 10a 1 0 155 10a 1 and 0 122 10a 1 respectively and are consistent with the trend of annual spei similarly the spei in the winter wheat growing season also decreased by 0 016 10a 1 fig 4f revealing that the growth environment of winter wheat in the wrb was arid in the past 29 years and would continue to be so it should be noted that the spei fluctuated sharply in spring and summer and spring was an important growth period for winter wheat therefore drought at this time might seriously affect winter wheat yield furthermore the autumn spei fig 4d showed an upward trend at a rate of 0 405 10a 1 the highest spei value was 2 47 in 2011 and the lowest spei value was 2 05 in 1998 fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of annual seasonal and winter wheat growing season spei trends and their significance in the wrb it can be seen that the trends failed the significance test p 0 05 except that some areas in the autumn basin showed a significant wetting trend the area with a drying trend of annual spei accounted for 52 5 of the study area and the drying area was mainly distributed in the west of the wrb fig 5a spring spei fig 5b showed a drying trend and the areas of summer fig 5c and winter spei fig 5e with a drying trend accounted for 90 1 and 88 3 of the wrb respectively almost covering the winter wheat planting area which was unfavorable for agricultural production in the wrb it is worth noting that during the winter wheat growing season almost the entire wrb showed a drying trend fig 5f indicating that drought had seriously threatened and would continue to threaten the growth of winter wheat so it is necessary to take drought prevention measures during the growing season and focus on the artificial adjustment of water resources in addition this basin showed a wetting trend in autumn fig 5d in which 68 4 of the areas became significantly wet concentrated in the southern wrb 3 2 sensitivity of winter wheat gpp to drought gpp is an important indicator for measuring the accumulation of matter and energy during vegetation growth and winter wheat converts atmospheric carbon into gpp through photosynthesis fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the multi year average gpp during the growing season of winter wheat october june in the wrb the results showed that the average gpp was 9 203 g c m 2 d 1 with an increasing trend from north to south geographically the areas with higher values were mainly distributed in the southeastern and central parts of the wrb owing to the flat terrain good irrigation conditions and relatively sufficient water supply however the lower gpp were distributed in the west and north of the wrb where rainfed agriculture was dominant and water was limited during the growing stage resulting in low gross primary production fig 7 shows the inter annual variation of gpp standardized anomalies during the growing season of winter wheat in the wrb for the period 1990 2018 overall the standardized anomalies showed a significant upward trend with a rate of 0 465 10a 1 and fluctuated greatly in the 1990s and early 21st century after the severe drought occurred in 1997 gpp decreased significantly and showed large negative anomalies in the following years combined with annual and seasonal spei trends in fig 4 it can be seen that the gpp anomaly was negative when spei was negative indicating that the winter wheat was under stress when the wrb was in a state of drought moreover in 1990 1996 2002 2011 and 2014 the gpp standardized anomalies of winter wheat became positive when the drought was alleviated or even in a humid state suggesting that winter wheat gpp in the wrb was affected by the dry and wet climatic changes and the response had a certain hysteresis using spei at each time scale as the independent variable and the monthly gpp standardized anomalies in the critical growing stage march may hu et al 2021 shen et al 2022 yu et al 2018 and the growing season as the dependent variables the regression coefficients were calculated pixel by pixel fig 8 the larger the regression coefficient the stronger the sensitivity of gpp to drought as shown in fig 8 the spatial distribution patterns of sensitivity in march april may and the growing season were similar specifically the areas with positive values were mainly concentrated in the central and western parts of the wrb whereas the areas with negative values were concentrated in the guanzhong plain in terms of spei at different time scales the sensitivity distribution and coefficient values of winter wheat gpp in march and april to spei at different time scales varied slightly however the sensitivity and coefficient values in may differed greatly and the areas with positive coefficients accounted for 79 4 gpp spei1 85 4 gpp spei3 and 94 9 gpp spei12 of the winter wheat planting area in the wrb respectively the positive sensitivity of winter wheat gpp to drought in the growing season accounted for 68 20 gpp spei1 89 0 gpp spei3 and 83 8 gpp spei12 of the winter wheat planting area in the wrb respectively indicating that the most water requiring stage of winter wheat in the key growth period was in may especially the long term cumulative water deficit before it had a deep impact on winter wheat gpp in addition winter wheat gpp was most sensitive to spei 3 during the growing season in terms of the regression coefficient fig 9 winter wheat gpp during the growing season was the most sensitive to spei 3 and the least sensitive to spei 12 furthermore the areas with higher coefficients were mainly distributed in dingxi and qingyang suggesting that gpp during the growing season was more sensitive to short term water deficits and had the most timely and large response in summary winter wheat gpp in the central wrb was generally highly sensitive to drought and gpp during the growing season was more susceptible to short term drought stress 3 3 impact of drought on winter wheat yield the growth stages of winter wheat in the wrb were divided into seedling stage october tillering stage november december overwintering stage january february greening stage march standing jointing stage april heading flowering stage may and milk filling stage june monthly spei 1 was used to represent the water deficit of the current stage and the average value was taken for the growth stage which lasted for two months the correlation between the spei at each growth stage and climatic yield in various prefecture level administrative areas from 1990 to 2018 was statistically analyzed and the differences in the sensitivity of winter wheat to drought at different growth stages were clarified it can be seen from fig 10 that the water demand of winter wheat first peaked at the tillering stage and the water deficit at this stage reduced the winter wheat yield to some extent the water demand of winter wheat reached the second peak during the period of greening flowering and winter wheat in other prefecture level administrative areas except for the five regions in the guanzhong plain was vulnerable to drought in conclusion winter wheat in the wrb was most sensitive to drought during the tillering and greening flowering stages previous studies showed that the most critical growth stage for the water requirement of winter wheat was the greening flowering period hu et al 2021 shen et al 2022 yu et al 2018 that is from march to may each year corroborating the above conclusion thus we used the spei 3 in may to identify moderate or above drought events in the wrb from 1990 to 2018 and the results are presented in table 2 among the ten prefecture level administrative areas in the wrb where winter wheat was planted 44 drought events in total including 19 severe drought events and 15 extreme drought events occurred in 1995 2000 2001 2004 and 2007 2008 in all prefecture level administrative areas compared with other regions qingyang had the most drought years whereas dingxi had the fewest the longest drought event in the wrb was in 2004 2008 and occurred in pingliang qingyang guyuan xianyang weinan and tongchuan demonstrating that drought events had regional characteristics and that the neighboring prefecture level administrative areas might suffer from drought at the same time in general the most drought events occurred in the 2000s in the wrb the yield change rate of winter wheat yield caused by drought was obtained according to formula 3 and its spatial distribution is displayed in fig 11 it can be seen that the yield change rate caused by the drought from 1990 to 2018 was heavy in the north and light in the south and the area with severe yield reduction was mainly concentrated in the northwest of the wrb this may be because this region is located in the southern part of the loess plateau where the landform type is mainly loess tableland and the soil water holding capacity is poor and not conducive to the growth of winter wheat moreover the areas where drought had less impact on yield were mainly concentrated in the guanzhong plain and the yield change rate was greater than 10 or even greater than 0 for different drought levels the average negative change rate of winter wheat yield caused by the moderate drought events fig 11a was 6 6 with the highest value of 14 3 in guyuan there was a positive value in dingxi and no moderate drought event occurred in weinan the average negative change rate of winter wheat yield caused by severe drought events fig 11b was 7 0 and the highest was 19 3 in qingyang but the yield change rate in baoji was positive the average negative change rate of winter wheat yield caused by extreme drought events fig 11c was 12 0 the highest was 33 6 in qingyang but tongchuan had a positive value in summary the higher the drought grade in the wrb the higher the winter wheat yield reduction table 3 shows the average yield change rate for the irrigated area and rainfed area caused by drought at different levels in the wrb in moderate drought events the average yield reduction rate in the irrigated area was 4 9 lower than that in rainfed area furthermore in severe and extreme drought events the average yield reduction rates in the irrigated area were also lower than that in the rainfed area and the average value in the rainfed area affected by extreme drought was even as high as 20 3 therefore we can draw a conclusion that there was also a reduction in winter wheat yield in the irrigated area but the yield reduction rate was not higher than 10 and the reduction was less than that in the rainfed area indicating that the development of irrigated agriculture could alleviate the yield reduction effect caused by drought but may not completely alleviate the impact of drought 4 discussion 4 1 data validity in this study gpp data were generated based on avhrr nirv data and observations from hundreds of flux sites worldwide because of the feasibility of nirv as a probe for sif and gpp badgley et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 nirv data was highly correlated with sif products and had the characteristics of sif which could accurately reflect the vegetation dynamics during photosynthesis and the gpp estimation based on these data can quickly capture the loss of vegetation productivity caused by drought moreover monthly seasonal and annual variations of gpp can be presented correctly wang et al 2021 and effective data support was provided for this study in addition the root mean square error rmse of this dataset was 1 95 g c m 2 d 1 thus it has been widely applied to climate change and carbon cycle studies liu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 the harvested area and yield for 175 crops around the world developed by the university of wisconsin madison were generated from the population data at the national state and county levels compared to the crop data of the united states department of agriculture usda it was more refined had a higher spatial resolution and did not change the planting pattern and distribution of crops therefore these data have broad application prospects in food security and agricultural land use under global climate change beerling et al 2018 monfreda et al 2008 moreover winter wheat was the main wheat plant in the wrb and the growing season was from october to june of the following year in this study we used the wheat harvest area in the dataset to extract the winter wheat planting area in the wrb and the data were valid and feasible enough to meet the accuracy requirements 4 2 relationship between gpp and yield of winter wheat winter wheat gpp reflects the amount of organic carbon fixed by photosynthesis during the growing season and can be used to characterize the growing status of winter wheat when drought occurs increased temperature in the field leads to enhanced evapotranspiration and vapor pressure deficit moreover the stomata of the plant canopy are closed to prevent excessive water loss and the increasing vapor pressure deficit inhibits the carbon sequestration of winter wheat resulting in crop yield reduction shi et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to explore the relationship between gpp and yield of winter wheat as shown in the fig 12 both gpp and yield showed a significant upward trend from 1990 to 2018 and the pearson correlation coefficient between the two was calculated to be 0 77 p 0 01 indicating that gpp and yield were extremely significantly correlated furthermore we counted the gpp and yield of the irrigated areas and the rainfed areas in the wrb respectively table 4 it can be seen that the gpp yield in the irrigated areas were higher than that in the rainfed areas indicating that irrigation in the wrb could make winter wheat grow vigorously and improve the photosynthesis efficiency thereby increasing winter wheat yield in addition spei and gpp yield were positively correlated in the rainfed areas but showed a very weak positive correlation or even a negative correlation in the irrigated areas this might be because the water required for the growth of winter wheat in the irrigated areas mainly depended on artificially adjusted water resources such as irrigation which alleviated the negative effects of drought to a certain extent therefore the impact of drought on winter wheat in the irrigated areas was not as great as that in the rainfed areas 4 3 effects of drought on gpp and yield of winter wheat in recent studies drought indices especially spei have been used to characterize drought conditions and assess their impact on crops and they have been implemented in many regions it was reported that spei was highly correlated with crop yield liu et al 2018 mokhtar et al 2021 sein et al 2021 confirming that the spei we selected had good applicability the drought trend in the wrb concluded in this study was consistent with that in previous studies chen and sun 2015 wu et al 2020 zou et al 2017 and the droughts in spring summer and winter which lasted throughout the growing season of winter wheat were the main components in the study area indicating that the productivity and yield of winter wheat would be threatened in this study we found that winter wheat gpp in the wrb showed an overall increasing trend during 1990 2018 revealing the rapid development of agricultural science and technology in this basin scientific implementation of farmland management measures improvement of soil quality and improvement of farming patterns furthermore previous studies have confirmed bonal et al 2008 saleska et al 2007 that low cloud cover during droughts could lead to increased solar radiation thereby promoting carbon dioxide absorption by vegetation in space winter wheat gpp showed an increasing trend from north to south which was consistent with the spatial distribution of soil moisture fig 13 the soil type of the loess plateau in the northern part of wrb is mainly loess soil with insufficient water storage capacity which is not conducive to the growth of winter wheat in contrast the southern part of the wrb especially the guanzhong plain had a relatively humid climate and developed irrigated agriculture thus hydrothermal conditions were suitable for crop growth the sensitivity coefficients of winter wheat gpp and spei in the wrb were mainly positive and the cumulative water deficit in the 3 month time scale could better reflect the sensitivity of winter wheat gpp to drought during the growing season corroborating the report of huang et al 2016 these results suggested that the response of gpp to drought was closely related to the selected timescale of the drought index whereas the sensitivity of winter wheat gpp to spei was mainly negative in the guanzhong plain and it might be due to its favorable hydrothermal conditions and stronger resistance and resilience to drought stress compared to other regions in this study we analyzed the impact of drought at each growth stage of winter wheat on the final yield and the results showed that drought at the tillering and greening flowering stages had the highest correlation with yield this was because the water deficit at the heading stage increases the number of sterile spikelets and florets and the water deficit at the flowering stage affects pollination and fertilization and reduces the seed setting rate thereby affecting the yield however the development of irrigated agriculture in the guanzhong plain could effectively alleviate the negative effects of drought meanwhile drought at the milk filling stage may not endanger the climatic yield and even an appropriate water deficit could reduce the impact of wet damage on winter wheat and ensure the yield is up to standard in addition we used a 5 year window which could directly quantify the response of winter wheat yield to drought events compared to statistical and crop models to obtain the reference yield moreover the research on the response of winter wheat yield to drought was carried out at the regional scale and refined to each prefecture level administrative area compared with researches at national and provincial scales this study reveals the impact of drought disasters on local grain production more intensively and will help local governments to formulate targeted food security policies 4 4 uncertainty first we defined the winter wheat planting area when the proportion of winter wheat harvested area in a pixel was greater than 5 however a pixel usually contains a variety of ground features that is there was a problem of mixed pixels which might cause the extracted winter wheat gpp to deviate from the actual value in addition there would be errors in data resampling which might reduce the accuracy of the winter wheat gpp moreover the winter wheat yield data collected in this study were multi source statistical data for a long time and incomplete records were imputed by means of the substitution method which might also lead to some deviation from the actual results in the future it is expected that long term and complete statistics or long term gridded data of crop yield will be obtained using crop models besides there are many factors affecting the gpp and yield of winter wheat in addition to drought they include floods extreme heat extreme cold other agro meteorological disasters or pests and diseases nevertheless the influence of other disasters which introduces uncertainties to the research results could not be determined finally the development of irrigated agriculture in the wrb can alleviate the negative effects of drought on crops to a certain extent nevertheless owing to the inability to obtain detailed data on irrigation there were limitations in our study therefore further research is needed in the future 5 conclusions in this study we analyzed the drought characteristics in the wrb from 1990 to 2018 and quantified the sensitivity coefficient between gpp and multiscale spei thereafter we quantitatively assessed the impact of drought on winter wheat yield the conclusions are as follows 1 from 1990 2018 the overall drought in the wrb increased particularly in the western part the annual spei in the wrb decreased at a rate of 0 009 10a 1 and the droughts in spring summer and winter were the main driving forces of annual drought especially in spring march may which was the key growth period of winter wheat and might pose a serious threat to the growth and yield of winter wheat in the wrb 2 in the past 29 years the average annual gpp of winter wheat in the wrb was 9 203 g c m 2 d 1 and increased significantly at a rate of 0 465 10a 1 from a spatial perspective the annual average gpp value in the guanzhong plain reached the highest value of 53 44 g c m 2 d 1 moreover winter wheat gpp was most sensitive to spei 3 during the growing season indicating that water deficit on a seasonal scale had the greatest impact on winter wheat growth 3 the yield reduction of winter wheat in the wrb due to drought showed a high and low spatial distribution in the north and south respectively among which extreme drought even caused a 33 6 reduction in winter wheat yield in qingyang in addition as the drought grade increased the winter wheat yield decreased more significantly even in the irrigated area however reduction was less than that in the rainfed area suggesting that irrigated agriculture had a significant effect on alleviation of drought but could not fully mitigate drought stress to minimize the impact of drought on the growth and yield of winter wheat farmers need to appropriately increase the frequency and amount of irrigation and strengthen water management nevertheless irrigation cannot be completely relied upon and other actions should be taken such as supplementing fertilizers in an appropriate amount selecting drought tolerant winter wheat varieties and changing the sowing time of winter wheat based on phenology therefore the response of winter wheat phenology to drought can be further studied in the future and the sowing time can be flexibly changed to avoid the drought that may occur in the key growth period of winter wheat as much as possible declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be

9198,it is urgent to determine the crop critical irrigation period and the priority of crop water irrigation in arid and semi arid regions to cope with agricultural water shortage in this study a method combining agricultural production systems simulator apsim crop model with grey relational analysis was proposed to determine the irrigation priority of wheat maize and sunflower in the irrigation water distribution to ensure food security and applied to the hetao irrigation district hid in china crop irrigation priority was determined by crop yield water supply demand ratio sdr and water productivity wp the maximum yield maximum water productivity and minimum water stress crop growth stage were evaluated the obtained results indicate that 1 when the irrigation scenario was 100 the critical irrigation period for wheat was the first 10 days after sowing and 40 61 days after sowing the critical irrigation priority for maize was 20 30 days after sowing and 61 81 days after sowing and the critical irrigation priority for sunflower was 30 61 days after sowing 2 in early may irrigation priority was wheat priority to maize while maize was a priority to wheat in mid to late may in june sunflower priority to wheat and maize irrigation from early to middle july irrigation priority to maize and from late july to late august sunflower water irrigation priority to maize the

are under great pressure from rapidly increasing demand due to the fast growing population and climate change kourgialas 2021 agriculture uses the major share 69 of global freshwater resources wwap unesco world water assessment programme 2021 and is the first sector seriously affected by drought drought is the most important stress factor limiting crop production worldwide debaeke and aboudrare 2004a drought can reduce soil water availability decrease crop yields lead to crop failure and even threaten food security lu et al 2020 moreover in many regions of the world water used for food production is inefficient as a major agricultural country in the world water shortages had brought huge challenges to agriculture production in china and especially in the arid region of northwest china the interaction between food security and water resources necessitates the development of new approaches to better answer the question of increasing agricultural production while reducing the water demand smilovic et al 2016 effective hydrological evaluation can provide useful information on the occurrence of climate extremes abro et al 2020 drought usually occurs at the critical growth periods of the crop resulting in the inability to meet crop water requirements and crop failure heim 2002 it is an important measure to provide water to crop in time in the critical period of crop growth therefore it is necessary to properly identify the critical periods of crop water demand during the crop growth cycle if the critical growth periods of crops can be determined in agriculture production and precision irrigation can be implemented agricultural water use will be effectively saved in general identifying crop critical periods of drought stress requires collecting a large amount of field samples and data on crop growth losses under different levels of water deficit at a given stage wilhelmi and wilhite 2002 although the crop water deficit can reflect the actual crop growth characteristics it is time consuming and costly to conduct lots of experiments however biophysical models can well address this dilemma williams et al 2018 yang et al 2014 the agricultural production systems simulator apsim model is one of the representative models of predicting crop growth and yield processes by integrating the supply and demand of resources shukr et al 2021a compared to other crop models apsim emphasis on the continuous simulation of soil nutrient dynamics therefore apsim model able to analyze soil water dynamics in arid areas and has good accuracy for crop water requirement and water stress condition akponikpe et al 2010 holzworth et 2014a gaydon et al 2017a the model includes multiple modules of crops including wheat maize and sunflower et al climate soil irrigation management and field management practices making it an ideal tool for investigating the response of crop yields to irrigation practices holzworth et al 2014 shukr et al 2021b it has been widely used in simulating the effect of water stress on crop yield and extensive evaluations have been done about the apsim model for environmental and crop management in asia particularly its ability to simulate individual crops gaydon et al 2017b until now studies have been widely carried out to explore the influences of drought stress on crop growth and yield formation by setting various deficit irrigation treatments cakir 2004a dreccer et al 2018 payero et al 2009 however these studies mostly have focused on the quantitative responses of crop evapotranspiration and crop yield to different drought levels without concluding the most critical or the sequence of periods sensitive to drought stress most evaluation methods have quantified the sensitivity merely from one single index aspect such as crop yield water use efficiency and production benefit but rarely considered the index that affects the crop growth process and wp is a comprehensive performance term at different management scales and is widely used in the optimal allocation of water resources comas et al 2019 kassam et al 2007 the optimal time for wheat maize and sunflower to achieve maximum wp and maximum yield at the same time has not been determined grey relation analysis is an effective method to quantify the grey relation degree between alternative sequence and the reference sequence by considering the similarity or difference degree of each evaluation index cui et al 2019a however grey relation analysis has not been used in the identification of crop irrigation priority the reports on agricultural water irrigation priority strategies for wheat maize and sunflower crops have rarely been conducted to tackle the problems mentioned above the objectives of this study were to 1 establish a multi index evaluation method of the priority of crop irrigation 2 identify the irrigation priority critical periods of wheat maize and sunflower in the crop growth period 3 propose the irrigation priority for the three crops during the same period this study can provide general guidance for scientific irrigation management of wheat maize and sunflower mitigate drought risks and boost crop yield in the hetao irrigation district and other regions under arid climate condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 method description fig 1 shows the overall framework of identifying the crop irrigation priority method based on apsim crop model and grey relational analysis based on meteorological data soil condition crop information and field management the apsim crop model was used to simulate the growth process and soil water conditions of crops the grey relational analysis method was used to evaluate the indicators obtained under certain irrigation treatments under four irrigation scenarios and the grey correlation degree and ranking of each irrigation treatment was obtained eventually it provides solutions for the rational allocation of water resources and preparing for drought 2 1 1 apsim model the agricultural production systems simulator apsim model is a flexible framework that accommodates diversified environmental and crop modules via a plug in mechanism gao et al 2019 the apsim model simulates crop growth at daily time steps it contains a suite of modules to simulate an interactive system for crops soil climate and field management moot et al 2015 it is an effective tool to investigate the effects of water stress on crops considering climate factors and their interaction with crop growth and yield formation processes as well as crop management luo et al 2018 and apsim model has been extensively tested in the arid and semi arid areas of inner mongolia china fan et al 2018 the swim module in the apsim model is a software package developed within the csiro division of soils for simulation infiltration movement evapotranspiration and redistribution keating et al 2003 the soil module calculates deep drainage based on soil characteristics which is suitable for areas with sallow groundwater connolly et al 2002 has pointed out that swim can simulate soil conditions in more detail than most other soil crop models we used apsim version 7 9 https www apsim info to simulate the phenological development soil water supply demand ratio sdr and final yield of wheat maize and sunflower in the study area under different irrigation scenarios and different irrigation treatments different irrigation scenarios were set based on the water demand of wheat maize and sunflower during the whole growth period to determine the response of water deficit to yield wp and sdr the apsim model was run at ten day intervals under extreme drought conditions nutrients were set to a non limiting level in all scenarios therefore crop growth and development are only affected by water the swim model simulates the water supply demand ratio as a water stress index based on the plant soil water balance chauhan et al 2015 we obtained soil water stress factor from the module and simulated the effects of water stress on different growth periods of wheat maize and sunflower 2 1 2 model calibration and validation in this study apsim model was developed on a point scale crop yield and soil moisture content were used to calibrate and validate the model parameters in which the data from 2004 to 2009 were used for calibration and the data from 2010 to 2016 were used for verification after parameterizing the model it was used to simulate the water deficit during crop growth period and the impact of water deficit on maize precipitation data are crucial for hydrological models employed for water resource management and drought monitoring dehua et al 2019 shrestha et al 2011 a typical drought year was determined by meteorological conditions 2011 was selected as the baseline year xiaoxing et al 2021 and the basic data used in the study were for 2011 to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the model statistical indicators of the correlation coefficient r2 eq 1 normalized root mean square error nrmse eq 3 and consistency indicator d index eq 4 were calculated between the observed and simulated variables yaxu et al 2020a r2 and nrmse reflect the difference between the simulated and measured values where lower values indicate less residual variance the model best reproduces the experimental data when r2 is 1 the simulation was considered excellent at nrmse 10 good at 10 20 acceptable at 20 30 and poor at 30 jamieson et al 1991 d index reflects the consistency between the simulated values and the observed values with a range value of 0 1 1 means

derived using a trial and method that matched the observed phenology and grain yield cultivar parameters for yongliang4 badan3 and ld5009 were selected to represent cultivars of wheat maize and sunflower respectively in the study area the cultivars were most widely grown in the study area the cultivar parameters of wheat maize and sunflower are shown in tables 2 table 3 and table 4 respectively 2 1 3 crop growth simulation of deficit irrigation to identify the critical period of water demand of crops we ran a series of single season simulations for wheat maize and sunflower in 2011 the four deficit irrigation scenarios were 100 70 50 and 30 of full irrigation deficit irrigation every 10 days after sowing was conducted for each crop in the whole growth period there were 9 deficit irrigation treatments for wheat and sunflower and 12 deficit irrigation treatments for maize irrigation time for maize is shown in fig 2 the same treatments were done for wheat and sunflower 2 1 4 irrigation prioritization method grey system theory has been widely used in various fields because of its advantages in evaluating complex systems and establishing orderly relationships among indicators grey relational comprehensive evaluation is a system scientific theory developed based on the grey system theory deng 1989a it determines the correlation degree according to the similarity among the order curves the steps for the evaluation are five steps sequences determination data dimensionless processing evaluation matrix determination weight determination of each index and the comprehensive evaluation step 1 determine the comparison and reference sequences the comparison sequence was formed by the indicators of the sdr wp and crop yield under water deficit treatments the canonical matrix x i j of evaluation indicator was defined as 4 x i j x 11 x 12 x 1 j x 21 x 22 x 2 j x i 1 x i 2 x i j the reference sequence was composed of the minimum value of each indicator under all treatments 5 y y 1 y 2 y 3 y j where y j is the j th evaluation indicators of the reference sequence step 2 indicator dimensionless the averaging method was used for dimensionless processing the ratio of the statistical value of the evaluation indicators to its mean value 6 x i j x i j x step 3 calculate the grey relational coefficients first subtract the dimensionless value of each indicator of the ith comparison sequence by the jth reference sequence and then process to absolute values the grey correlation coefficient was calculated as cui et al 2019b 7 ξ i j min i min j δ i j k ρ max i max j δ i j k δ ij k ρ max i max j δ i j k where ξ i j is the correlation coefficient of the jth of the comparison sequence ρ is the resolution ratio selected as 0 5 for guaranteeing a good calculation stability and a moderate distinguishing ability deng 1989b singh et al 2016 step 4 calculate the indicators weight the dimensions of each indicator are different so it is difficult to compare the degree of difference directly the coefficient of variation of each indicator needs to be used to determine the weight of indicators step 5 calculate correlation degree based on the methodology of gra and the indices weight the final calculation model can be deducted as 8 r i j 1 n w j ξ i j where r i is the correlation degree of the i th comparison sequence wj is the indicator weight calculated by the coefficient of variation method 2 2 evaluation indices 2 2 1 the water supply demand radio sdr sdr was a water deficit index which is the ratio of the soil water supply w s to the water demand w d of crops it was simulated by the model in a daily step indicating the extent to which soil moisture extracted by roots meets the potential evapotranspiration demand in the study the mean sdr of deficit irrigation treatments at the whole growth period of the crops was considered as the intensity of the sdr ratio sdr value is between 0 and 1 sdr was capped at 1 when w s adequately met wd and the crops were completely free from water stress sdr dropped below 1 when the water could not meet the crop water demand when sdr is 0 it indicates that the development process of the crop under water stress is terminated the soil water supply ws was calculated as follows chauhan rachaputi 2014a 9 w s l a y e r s w l a y e r l l l a y e r k l l a y e r where sw is the volumetric soil water content mm mm 1 ll is the volumetric soil water content at the crop lower limit kl is the root distribution factor the water demand w d corresponds to the amount of water that the crop would transpire without soil water constraint it is related to the amount of water needed daily for crop growth gcr and the atmospheric water vapor pressure deficit vdp chauhan and rachaputi 2014b transpiration demand was modeled as a function of the current day s crop growth rate 10 w d g c r v d p t e where t e was a transpiration efficiency parameter in the model gcr was the amount of water needed daily mm vdp was the atmospheric water vapor pressure kpa 2 2 2 water productivity wp water productivity wp is represented as the ratio of crop yield to actual water consumption the actual water consumption eta for each crop was simulated using the apsim model the calculation is as follows eq 7 11 w p y s e t a where ys is the simulated yield of the crop kg ha ετa is the actual water consumption of the crop mm 2 2 3 yield loss due to water stress we calculated the difference between potential yields and simulated yields as the yield loss due to water stress the potential yield in this study was the simulated yield under full irrigation condition we assume that crop yield is only affected by water status during the growth period in this study other factors such as infrastructure improvement and insects were not considered yield loss was calculated as follows yaxu et al 2020b 12 r l o s s y m y s y m where r loss is the yield loss kg ha y m is potential yield kg

calibration and validation the observed yields and the corresponding simulated yields in the jfz irrigation district are displayed in fig 5 the yield r2 of the three crops were 0 92 0 98 and 0 93 respectively d index d were 0 95 0 97 and 0 93 respectively nrmse were 0 82 2 85 and 2 35 respectively these results illustrate that the apsim model is satisfactory in simulating yield the verification result of the yield during 2010 2016 is displayed in fig 6 the r2 value for the model s output of wheat maize and sunflower were 0 83 0 82 and 0 81 respectively the d index were 0 93 0 95 and 0 70 respectively the results showed that the simulated yield was in good agreement with the statistical yield the values of nrmse were all less than 10 apsim model has a good ability to simulate the wheat maize and sunflower yield in the jfz irrigation district we used 0 1 m of soil water content to evaluate apsim performance in simulating soil water dynamics for wheat maize and sunflower in 2011 the nrmse values for soil moisture content in the whole growth period of wheat maize and sunflower were 12 03 12 06 and 19 57 respectively fig 7 it showed that the models have an acceptable level of accuracy in simulating soil water dynamics processes the results demonstrated that the apsim model has good applicability in the study area and could be used to simulate the response of wheat maize and sunflower yield to water 3 2 priority of crop water irrigation 3 2 1 priority of crop water irrigation in phenology the priority of water irrigation for wheat maize and sunflower were evaluated based on apsim model and grey relational analysis the results were shown in fig 8 the higher the evaluation value shown in the figure the irrigation order takes more priority the critical irrigation periods for wheat were 1 10 days 40 50 days and 50 61 days after sowing the irrigation priority rankings for 100 and 70 deficit irrigation scenarios were similar 40 50 days 1 10 days 50 61 days after sowing the yields for these three periods decreased by 11 99 5 74 and 4 21 respectively under the 100 deficit irrigation scenario and decreased by 9 23 0 575 and 2 43 under the 70 deficit irrigation scenario no significant change in the sdr and wp was found under such two scenarios the irrigation priority rankings for 50 and 30 deficit irrigation scenarios were as follows 1 10 days 40 50 days 50 61 days after sowing when deficit irrigation was applied 1 10 days after sowing the maximum yield decreased by 5 77 and the wp decreased by 0 134 kg m3 in the 100 deficit irrigation and 70 deficit irrigation scenarios the crop yield had the highest weight which was 0 49 and 0 50 respectively in the other two irrigation deficit scenarios the weight of wp was 0 59 and 0 57 respectively the critical irrigation periods for maize were 20 30 days 50 61 days 61 71 days and 71 81 days after sowing when the deficit irrigation was 100 the irrigation priority for maize was ranked as follow 71 81 days 61 71 days 20 30 days after sowing the maize yield decreased by 5 46 and 4 29 respectively for the first two periods but increased by 2 54 for the period of 20 30 days since the water deficit at this period led to the prolonging of the growth period the weight of yield is the maximum in the evaluation process which is 0 39 therefore the 20 30 days after sowing of maize is the critical period of water demand in the other three irrigation scenarios the irrigation priority was ranked as follows 61 days to 71 days 71 days to 81 days 50 days to 61 days after sowing under the 30 deficit irrigation scenario the weight of crop yield and wp is the same with a weight of 0 45 the weight values of crop yield under100 70 and 50 deficit irrigation scenarios were the highest which were 0 39 0 422 and 0 40 respectively the critical irrigation periods period for sunflower was 20 61 days under the 100 deficit irrigation scenario the irrigation priority was rank as follow 30 40 days 40 50 days 50 61 days after sowing during the three periods of deficit irrigation treatment the yield decreased by 9 93 9 36 and 3 16 respectively and the yield has a maximum weight value of 0 56 in other irrigation scenarios the irrigation priority was rank as follow 30 40 days after sowing 40 50 days after sowing 20 30 days after sowing the crop yield is the most important factor in the process of determine irrigation priority the weight values of yield were most important which were 0 64 0 63 and 0 72 respectively 3 2 2 water irrigation priority for main crops since wheat maize and sunflower have different sensitive periods to drought it is necessary to identify the priority of water irrigation for different crops to ensure crop yields under different drought conditions we determined the irrigation priority of wheat maize and sunflower during their common growth period from may to august as shown in fig 9 the crops that grow in may are wheat and maize the crops that grow in june are wheat maize and sunflowers the crops that grow from july to august are maize and sunflowers in early may the irrigation priority under the 100 and 30 deficit irrigation scenarios was wheat maize under the 70 and 50 deficit irrigation scenarios the irrigation priority was maize wheat in mid to late may the irrigation priority under the 100 and 70 deficit irrigation scenarios was maize wheat other irrigation scenarios the irrigation scenarios in late may was maize wheat in june the irrigation priority was sunflower wheat maize in late july under the 70 50 and 30 deficit irrigation scenario was wheat sunflower maize from early july to mid july the irrigation priority was maize sunflower but from late july to late august the irrigation priority was sunflower maize 3 3 the effects of different drought levels on yield fig 10 shows the simulated yield of wheat maize and sunflower with four irrigated conditions we compared the yield among three crops under different irrigation scenarios for wheat and sunflower the median maximum yield was achieved in the 30 deficit irrigation treatment which indicated that appropriately deficit irrigation can increase production however the median yield of maize under 100 deficit irrigation and 70 deficit irrigation was the same both of which were 11 475 2 kg ha higher than the other two scenarios the median yields of wheat under 30 deficit irrigation maize under 100 and 70 deficit irrigation and sunflower under 30 deficit irrigation were 6666 7 kg ha 11 475 2 kg ha and 3388 7 kg ha respectively in conclusion yield of wheat and sunflower reached the maximum under 30 deficit irrigation scenario the maximum yield of maize was reached under 100 and 70 deficit irrigation under different irrigation scenarios the simulated yield of wheat showed greater inter annual variation while the simulated yields of maize and sunflower were concentrated none of the three crops have significantly decreased in production the deficit irrigation was only set in a certain period while other periods were still full irrigation 3 4 discussion before applying apsim model to simulate deficit irrigation practices we validated the model by comparing statistic crop yields with simulated yields fig 6 the yield verification results of wheat maize and sunflower showed that r2 was above 0 80 nrmse was below 10 and d index was greater than or equal to 0 70 the validation results showed that the apsim model accurately simulated the response of crop yield to soil moisture apsim model which has a good ability in simulating crop water stress and water dynamic was applied to simulate the wheat maize and sunflower water stress and yield the results indicated that a few days of water stress in critical growth stages could lead to serious yield loss according to the weight results of the evaluation index we selected the sdr of each irrigation treatment has the minimum weight it is why the sdr index indicates the average water stress degree of each irrigated crop during the whole growth period yield directly responds to the effect of water stress under irrigation scenarios as reflected by soil moisture stress the crop yield and wp of crop during growth period are vital indicators to identify the priority of crop water supply the combination of apsim model and grey relation analysis method could be used as a new method for comprehensive evaluation of water irrigation priorities for crops the result showed that the sensitive period of drought for wheat was 1 10 days and 40 61 days after sowing during this period wheat is at the period of seeding jointing and heading the results of our study are similar previous studies which showed that spring wheat was sensitive to water deficit at the booting to grain filling stage in arid northwest china jiang et al 2013 the drought sensitive period of maize was 71 92 days after sowing and 30 40 days after sowing the research showed that severe drought stress had the greatest negative impact on maize yield at jointing stage which is consistent with the results of this study wei et al 2019 in addition the flowering stage and the initial grain filling stage of maize were droughtsensitive periods cakir 2004b yilmaz et al 2010 the results showed that the sensitive period to drought stress for sunflower was 30 70 days after sowing kirda has shown the most critical growth stages of sunflower to water stress were late vegetative flowering and yield formation stages kirda et al 1999 moreover sunflower irrigated throughout flowering stage gives better yield response when compared those having irrigations made either earlier or later growth stages harman et al 1962 4 conclusions since the hetao irrigation district relies on diversion irrigation to develop agriculture the drought resistance ability can be improved by determining the optimum irrigation time and the lowest limit of irrigation water this study combined the apsim model with the grey relation comprehensive evaluation and proposed a method for identifying the priority of crop irrigation in this study the priority of water irrigation for wheat maize and sunflower based on the apsim model and grey relational analysis was identified through the deficit irrigation of crops at different periods the response of different crops to water moisture was explored we are more concerned about which growth stage of each crop is more critical to irrigate and which crops are given priority to irrigate when wheat maize and sunflower grow at the same time the apsim model was applied to simulate the effects of water stress on wheat maize and sunflower growth processes respectively the effects of water stress on crop growth were quantified and the priority of water irrigation was determined by the grey correlation analysis method the results indicated that the critical irrigation periods for wheat in crop growth initial period and crop development period it could effectively prevent wheat yield loss to irrigate within 10 days and 40 61 days after sowing the critical irrigation period for maize was in crop development period and middle growth period fig 2 irrigation during 50 and 81 days after sowing can effectively prevent maize yield loss and water stress between 20 and 30 days after sowing under severe water shortage can lead to yield loss the sunflower was sensitive to drought stress during crop development period and middle growth period irrigation of sunflowers 20 61 days after sowing is very important for sunflower yield the water irrigation priority of wheat maize and sunflower was maize priority to wheat in early to mid may in june the water irrigation priority was sunflower priority to wheat and maize from early july to mid july the water irrigation priority was sunflower priority to wheat and maize and from late july to late august that was sunflower priority to maize we provide irrigation guidance for the hid concerning the water irrigation priority of a single crop during the growing period and the water irrigation priority of three crops in the same period the priority of crop water irrigation results based on crop water demand can provide a basis for the rational of emergency water irrigation resources to ensure food security and mitigate drought risks moreover this methodology can be developed and expand to other areas to provide information for managers in different regions to implement precision irrigation and other counties in the hid we did not consider the influence of precipitation on irrigation decisions too much for the application of this method in other places we propose to use multivariate data to effectively assess precipitation consider the impact of rainfall on irrigation multisource rainfall products can be used to overcome the absence of gauged precipitation data and provide valuable precipitation estimates abro et al 2019 2020 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9198,it is urgent to determine the crop critical irrigation period and the priority of crop water irrigation in arid and semi arid regions to cope with agricultural water shortage in this study a method combining agricultural production systems simulator apsim crop model with grey relational analysis was proposed to determine the irrigation priority of wheat maize and sunflower in the irrigation water distribution to ensure food security and applied to the hetao irrigation district hid in china crop irrigation priority was determined by crop yield water supply demand ratio sdr and water productivity wp the maximum yield maximum water productivity and minimum water stress crop growth stage were evaluated the obtained results indicate that 1 when the irrigation scenario was 100 the critical irrigation period for wheat was the first 10 days after sowing and 40 61 days after sowing the critical irrigation priority for maize was 20 30 days after sowing and 61 81 days after sowing and the critical irrigation priority for sunflower was 30 61 days after sowing 2 in early may irrigation priority was wheat priority to maize while maize was a priority to wheat in mid to late may in june sunflower priority to wheat and maize irrigation from early to middle july irrigation priority to maize and from late july to late august sunflower water irrigation priority to maize the method of to identify irrigation priority and crop priority to provide irrigation decision for allocating agriculture water resources graphical abstract assessment methodology of water irrigation priority based of apsim model and grey relational analysis ga1 keywords irrigation priority critical irrigation periods apsim crop model grey relation analysis 1 introduction global water resources are under great pressure from rapidly increasing demand due to the fast growing population and climate change kourgialas 2021 agriculture uses the major share 69 of global freshwater resources wwap unesco world water assessment programme 2021 and is the first sector seriously affected by drought drought is the most important stress factor limiting crop production worldwide debaeke and aboudrare 2004a drought can reduce soil water availability decrease crop yields lead to crop failure and even threaten food security lu et al 2020 moreover in many regions of the world water used for food production is inefficient as a major agricultural country in the world water shortages had brought huge challenges to agriculture production in china and especially in the arid region of northwest china the interaction between food security and water resources necessitates the development of new approaches to better answer the question of increasing agricultural production while reducing the water demand smilovic et al 2016 effective hydrological evaluation can provide useful information on the occurrence of climate extremes abro et al 2020 drought usually occurs at the critical growth periods of the crop resulting in the inability to meet crop water requirements and crop failure heim 2002 it is an important measure to provide water to crop in time in the critical period of crop growth therefore it is necessary to properly identify the critical periods of crop water demand during the crop growth cycle if the critical growth periods of crops can be determined in agriculture production and precision irrigation can be implemented agricultural water use will be effectively saved in general identifying crop critical periods of drought stress requires collecting a large amount of field samples and data on crop growth losses under different levels of water deficit at a given stage wilhelmi and wilhite 2002 although the crop water deficit can reflect the actual crop growth characteristics it is time consuming and costly to conduct lots of experiments however biophysical models can well address this dilemma williams et al 2018 yang et al 2014 the agricultural production systems simulator apsim model is one of the representative models of predicting crop growth and yield processes by integrating the supply and demand of resources shukr et al 2021a compared to other crop models apsim emphasis on the continuous simulation of soil nutrient dynamics therefore apsim model able to analyze soil water dynamics in arid areas and has good accuracy for crop water requirement and water stress condition akponikpe et al 2010 holzworth et 2014a gaydon et al 2017a the model includes multiple modules of crops including wheat maize and sunflower et al climate soil irrigation management and field management practices making it an ideal tool for investigating the response of crop yields to irrigation practices holzworth et al 2014 shukr et al 2021b it has been widely used in simulating the effect of water stress on crop yield and extensive evaluations have been done about the apsim model for environmental and crop management in asia particularly its ability to simulate individual crops gaydon et al 2017b until now studies have been widely carried out to explore the influences of drought stress on crop growth and yield formation by setting various deficit irrigation treatments cakir 2004a dreccer et al 2018 payero et al 2009 however these studies mostly have focused on the quantitative responses of crop evapotranspiration and crop yield to different drought levels without concluding the most critical or the sequence of periods sensitive to drought stress most evaluation methods have quantified the sensitivity merely from one single index aspect such as crop yield water use efficiency and production benefit but rarely considered the index that affects the crop growth process and wp is a comprehensive performance term at different management scales and is widely used in the optimal allocation of water resources comas et al 2019 kassam et al 2007 the optimal time for wheat maize and sunflower to achieve maximum wp and maximum yield at the same time has not been determined grey relation analysis is an effective method to quantify the grey relation degree between alternative sequence and the reference sequence by considering the similarity or difference degree of each evaluation index cui et al 2019a however grey relation analysis has not been used in the identification of crop irrigation priority the reports on agricultural water irrigation priority strategies for wheat maize and sunflower crops have rarely been conducted to tackle the problems mentioned above the objectives of this study were to 1 establish a multi index evaluation method of the priority of crop irrigation 2 identify the irrigation priority critical periods of wheat maize and sunflower in the crop growth period 3 propose the irrigation priority for the three crops during the same period this study can provide general guidance for scientific irrigation management of wheat maize and sunflower mitigate drought risks and boost crop yield in the hetao irrigation district and other regions under arid climate condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 method description fig 1 shows the overall framework of identifying the crop irrigation priority method based on apsim crop model and grey relational analysis based on meteorological data soil condition crop information and field management the apsim crop model was used to simulate the growth process and soil water conditions of crops the grey relational analysis method was used to evaluate the indicators obtained under certain irrigation treatments under four irrigation scenarios and the grey correlation degree and ranking of each irrigation treatment was obtained eventually it provides solutions for the rational allocation of water resources and preparing for drought 2 1 1 apsim model the agricultural production systems simulator apsim model is a flexible framework that accommodates diversified environmental and crop modules via a plug in mechanism gao et al 2019 the apsim model simulates crop growth at daily time steps it contains a suite of modules to simulate an interactive system for crops soil climate and field management moot et al 2015 it is an effective tool to investigate the effects of water stress on crops considering climate factors and their interaction with crop growth and yield formation processes as well as crop management luo et al 2018 and apsim model has been extensively tested in the arid and semi arid areas of inner mongolia china fan et al 2018 the swim module in the apsim model is a software package developed within the csiro division of soils for simulation infiltration movement evapotranspiration and redistribution keating et al 2003 the soil module calculates deep drainage based on soil characteristics which is suitable for areas with sallow groundwater connolly et al 2002 has pointed out that swim can simulate soil conditions in more detail than most other soil crop models we used apsim version 7 9 https www apsim info to simulate the phenological development soil water supply demand ratio sdr and final yield of wheat maize and sunflower in the study area under different irrigation scenarios and different irrigation treatments different irrigation scenarios were set based on the water demand of wheat maize and sunflower during the whole growth period to determine the response of water deficit to yield wp and sdr the apsim model was run at ten day intervals under extreme drought conditions nutrients were set to a non limiting level in all scenarios therefore crop growth and development are only affected by water the swim model simulates the water supply demand ratio as a water stress index based on the plant soil water balance chauhan et al 2015 we obtained soil water stress factor from the module and simulated the effects of water stress on different growth periods of wheat maize and sunflower 2 1 2 model calibration and validation in this study apsim model was developed on a point scale crop yield and soil moisture content were used to calibrate and validate the model parameters in which the data from 2004 to 2009 were used for calibration and the data from 2010 to 2016 were used for verification after parameterizing the model it was used to simulate the water deficit during crop growth period and the impact of water deficit on maize precipitation data are crucial for hydrological models employed for water resource management and drought monitoring dehua et al 2019 shrestha et al 2011 a typical drought year was determined by meteorological conditions 2011 was selected as the baseline year xiaoxing et al 2021 and the basic data used in the study were for 2011 to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the model statistical indicators of the correlation coefficient r2 eq 1 normalized root mean square error nrmse eq 3 and consistency indicator d index eq 4 were calculated between the observed and simulated variables yaxu et al 2020a r2 and nrmse reflect the difference between the simulated and measured values where lower values indicate less residual variance the model best reproduces the experimental data when r2 is 1 the simulation was considered excellent at nrmse 10 good at 10 20 acceptable at 20 30 and poor at 30 jamieson et al 1991 d index reflects the consistency between the simulated values and the observed values with a range value of 0 1 1 means

derived using a trial and method that matched the observed phenology and grain yield cultivar parameters for yongliang4 badan3 and ld5009 were selected to represent cultivars of wheat maize and sunflower respectively in the study area the cultivars were most widely grown in the study area the cultivar parameters of wheat maize and sunflower are shown in tables 2 table 3 and table 4 respectively 2 1 3 crop growth simulation of deficit irrigation to identify the critical period of water demand of crops we ran a series of single season simulations for wheat maize and sunflower in 2011 the four deficit irrigation scenarios were 100 70 50 and 30 of full irrigation deficit irrigation every 10 days after sowing was conducted for each crop in the whole growth period there were 9 deficit irrigation treatments for wheat and sunflower and 12 deficit irrigation treatments for maize irrigation time for maize is shown in fig 2 the same treatments were done for wheat and sunflower 2 1 4 irrigation prioritization method grey system theory has been widely used in various fields because of its advantages in evaluating complex systems and establishing orderly relationships among indicators grey relational comprehensive evaluation is a system scientific theory developed based on the grey system theory deng 1989a it determines the correlation degree according to the similarity among the order curves the steps for the evaluation are five steps sequences determination data dimensionless processing evaluation matrix determination weight determination of each index and the comprehensive evaluation step 1 determine the comparison and reference sequences the comparison sequence was formed by the indicators of the sdr wp and crop yield under water deficit treatments the canonical matrix x i j of evaluation indicator was defined as 4 x i j x 11 x 12 x 1 j x 21 x 22 x 2 j x i 1 x i 2 x i j the reference sequence was composed of the minimum value of each indicator under all treatments 5 y y 1 y 2 y 3 y j where y j is the j th evaluation indicators of the reference sequence step 2 indicator dimensionless the averaging method was used for dimensionless processing the ratio of the statistical value of the evaluation indicators to its mean value 6 x i j x i j x step 3 calculate the grey relational coefficients first subtract the dimensionless value of each indicator of the ith comparison sequence by the jth reference sequence and then process to absolute values the grey correlation coefficient was calculated as cui et al 2019b 7 ξ i j min i min j δ i j k ρ max i max j δ i j k δ ij k ρ max i max j δ i j k where ξ i j is the correlation coefficient of the jth of the comparison sequence ρ is the resolution ratio selected as 0 5 for guaranteeing a good calculation stability and a moderate distinguishing ability deng 1989b singh et al 2016 step 4 calculate the indicators weight the dimensions of each indicator are different so it is difficult to compare the degree of difference directly the coefficient of variation of each indicator needs to be used to determine the weight of indicators step 5 calculate correlation degree based on the methodology of gra and the indices weight the final calculation model can be deducted as 8 r i j 1 n w j ξ i j where r i is the correlation degree of the i th comparison sequence wj is the indicator weight calculated by the coefficient of variation method 2 2 evaluation indices 2 2 1 the water supply demand radio sdr sdr was a water deficit index which is the ratio of the soil water supply w s to the water demand w d of crops it was simulated by the model in a daily step indicating the extent to which soil moisture extracted by roots meets the potential evapotranspiration demand in the study the mean sdr of deficit irrigation treatments at the whole growth period of the crops was considered as the intensity of the sdr ratio sdr value is between 0 and 1 sdr was capped at 1 when w s adequately met wd and the crops were completely free from water stress sdr dropped below 1 when the water could not meet the crop water demand when sdr is 0 it indicates that the development process of the crop under water stress is terminated the soil water supply ws was calculated as follows chauhan rachaputi 2014a 9 w s l a y e r s w l a y e r l l l a y e r k l l a y e r where sw is the volumetric soil water content mm mm 1 ll is the volumetric soil water content at the crop lower limit kl is the root distribution factor the water demand w d corresponds to the amount of water that the crop would transpire without soil water constraint it is related to the amount of water needed daily for crop growth gcr and the atmospheric water vapor pressure deficit vdp chauhan and rachaputi 2014b transpiration demand was modeled as a function of the current day s crop growth rate 10 w d g c r v d p t e where t e was a transpiration efficiency parameter in the model gcr was the amount of water needed daily mm vdp was the atmospheric water vapor pressure kpa 2 2 2 water productivity wp water productivity wp is represented as the ratio of crop yield to actual water consumption the actual water consumption eta for each crop was simulated using the apsim model the calculation is as follows eq 7 11 w p y s e t a where ys is the simulated yield of the crop kg ha ετa is the actual water consumption of the crop mm 2 2 3 yield loss due to water stress we calculated the difference between potential yields and simulated yields as the yield loss due to water stress the potential yield in this study was the simulated yield under full irrigation condition we assume that crop yield is only affected by water status during the growth period in this study other factors such as infrastructure improvement and insects were not considered yield loss was calculated as follows yaxu et al 2020b 12 r l o s s y m y s y m where r loss is the yield loss kg ha y m is potential yield kg

calibration and validation the observed yields and the corresponding simulated yields in the jfz irrigation district are displayed in fig 5 the yield r2 of the three crops were 0 92 0 98 and 0 93 respectively d index d were 0 95 0 97 and 0 93 respectively nrmse were 0 82 2 85 and 2 35 respectively these results illustrate that the apsim model is satisfactory in simulating yield the verification result of the yield during 2010 2016 is displayed in fig 6 the r2 value for the model s output of wheat maize and sunflower were 0 83 0 82 and 0 81 respectively the d index were 0 93 0 95 and 0 70 respectively the results showed that the simulated yield was in good agreement with the statistical yield the values of nrmse were all less than 10 apsim model has a good ability to simulate the wheat maize and sunflower yield in the jfz irrigation district we used 0 1 m of soil water content to evaluate apsim performance in simulating soil water dynamics for wheat maize and sunflower in 2011 the nrmse values for soil moisture content in the whole growth period of wheat maize and sunflower were 12 03 12 06 and 19 57 respectively fig 7 it showed that the models have an acceptable level of accuracy in simulating soil water dynamics processes the results demonstrated that the apsim model has good applicability in the study area and could be used to simulate the response of wheat maize and sunflower yield to water 3 2 priority of crop water irrigation 3 2 1 priority of crop water irrigation in phenology the priority of water irrigation for wheat maize and sunflower were evaluated based on apsim model and grey relational analysis the results were shown in fig 8 the higher the evaluation value shown in the figure the irrigation order takes more priority the critical irrigation periods for wheat were 1 10 days 40 50 days and 50 61 days after sowing the irrigation priority rankings for 100 and 70 deficit irrigation scenarios were similar 40 50 days 1 10 days 50 61 days after sowing the yields for these three periods decreased by 11 99 5 74 and 4 21 respectively under the 100 deficit irrigation scenario and decreased by 9 23 0 575 and 2 43 under the 70 deficit irrigation scenario no significant change in the sdr and wp was found under such two scenarios the irrigation priority rankings for 50 and 30 deficit irrigation scenarios were as follows 1 10 days 40 50 days 50 61 days after sowing when deficit irrigation was applied 1 10 days after sowing the maximum yield decreased by 5 77 and the wp decreased by 0 134 kg m3 in the 100 deficit irrigation and 70 deficit irrigation scenarios the crop yield had the highest weight which was 0 49 and 0 50 respectively in the other two irrigation deficit scenarios the weight of wp was 0 59 and 0 57 respectively the critical irrigation periods for maize were 20 30 days 50 61 days 61 71 days and 71 81 days after sowing when the deficit irrigation was 100 the irrigation priority for maize was ranked as follow 71 81 days 61 71 days 20 30 days after sowing the maize yield decreased by 5 46 and 4 29 respectively for the first two periods but increased by 2 54 for the period of 20 30 days since the water deficit at this period led to the prolonging of the growth period the weight of yield is the maximum in the evaluation process which is 0 39 therefore the 20 30 days after sowing of maize is the critical period of water demand in the other three irrigation scenarios the irrigation priority was ranked as follows 61 days to 71 days 71 days to 81 days 50 days to 61 days after sowing under the 30 deficit irrigation scenario the weight of crop yield and wp is the same with a weight of 0 45 the weight values of crop yield under100 70 and 50 deficit irrigation scenarios were the highest which were 0 39 0 422 and 0 40 respectively the critical irrigation periods period for sunflower was 20 61 days under the 100 deficit irrigation scenario the irrigation priority was rank as follow 30 40 days 40 50 days 50 61 days after sowing during the three periods of deficit irrigation treatment the yield decreased by 9 93 9 36 and 3 16 respectively and the yield has a maximum weight value of 0 56 in other irrigation scenarios the irrigation priority was rank as follow 30 40 days after sowing 40 50 days after sowing 20 30 days after sowing the crop yield is the most important factor in the process of determine irrigation priority the weight values of yield were most important which were 0 64 0 63 and 0 72 respectively 3 2 2 water irrigation priority for main crops since wheat maize and sunflower have different sensitive periods to drought it is necessary to identify the priority of water irrigation for different crops to ensure crop yields under different drought conditions we determined the irrigation priority of wheat maize and sunflower during their common growth period from may to august as shown in fig 9 the crops that grow in may are wheat and maize the crops that grow in june are wheat maize and sunflowers the crops that grow from july to august are maize and sunflowers in early may the irrigation priority under the 100 and 30 deficit irrigation scenarios was wheat maize under the 70 and 50 deficit irrigation scenarios the irrigation priority was maize wheat in mid to late may the irrigation priority under the 100 and 70 deficit irrigation scenarios was maize wheat other irrigation scenarios the irrigation scenarios in late may was maize wheat in june the irrigation priority was sunflower wheat maize in late july under the 70 50 and 30 deficit irrigation scenario was wheat sunflower maize from early july to mid july the irrigation priority was maize sunflower but from late july to late august the irrigation priority was sunflower maize 3 3 the effects of different drought levels on yield fig 10 shows the simulated yield of wheat maize and sunflower with four irrigated conditions we compared the yield among three crops under different irrigation scenarios for wheat and sunflower the median maximum yield was achieved in the 30 deficit irrigation treatment which indicated that appropriately deficit irrigation can increase production however the median yield of maize under 100 deficit irrigation and 70 deficit irrigation was the same both of which were 11 475 2 kg ha higher than the other two scenarios the median yields of wheat under 30 deficit irrigation maize under 100 and 70 deficit irrigation and sunflower under 30 deficit irrigation were 6666 7 kg ha 11 475 2 kg ha and 3388 7 kg ha respectively in conclusion yield of wheat and sunflower reached the maximum under 30 deficit irrigation scenario the maximum yield of maize was reached under 100 and 70 deficit irrigation under different irrigation scenarios the simulated yield of wheat showed greater inter annual variation while the simulated yields of maize and sunflower were concentrated none of the three crops have significantly decreased in production the deficit irrigation was only set in a certain period while other periods were still full irrigation 3 4 discussion before applying apsim model to simulate deficit irrigation practices we validated the model by comparing statistic crop yields with simulated yields fig 6 the yield verification results of wheat maize and sunflower showed that r2 was above 0 80 nrmse was below 10 and d index was greater than or equal to 0 70 the validation results showed that the apsim model accurately simulated the response of crop yield to soil moisture apsim model which has a good ability in simulating crop water stress and water dynamic was applied to simulate the wheat maize and sunflower water stress and yield the results indicated that a few days of water stress in critical growth stages could lead to serious yield loss according to the weight results of the evaluation index we selected the sdr of each irrigation treatment has the minimum weight it is why the sdr index indicates the average water stress degree of each irrigated crop during the whole growth period yield directly responds to the effect of water stress under irrigation scenarios as reflected by soil moisture stress the crop yield and wp of crop during growth period are vital indicators to identify the priority of crop water supply the combination of apsim model and grey relation analysis method could be used as a new method for comprehensive evaluation of water irrigation priorities for crops the result showed that the sensitive period of drought for wheat was 1 10 days and 40 61 days after sowing during this period wheat is at the period of seeding jointing and heading the results of our study are similar previous studies which showed that spring wheat was sensitive to water deficit at the booting to grain filling stage in arid northwest china jiang et al 2013 the drought sensitive period of maize was 71 92 days after sowing and 30 40 days after sowing the research showed that severe drought stress had the greatest negative impact on maize yield at jointing stage which is consistent with the results of this study wei et al 2019 in addition the flowering stage and the initial grain filling stage of maize were droughtsensitive periods cakir 2004b yilmaz et al 2010 the results showed that the sensitive period to drought stress for sunflower was 30 70 days after sowing kirda has shown the most critical growth stages of sunflower to water stress were late vegetative flowering and yield formation stages kirda et al 1999 moreover sunflower irrigated throughout flowering stage gives better yield response when compared those having irrigations made either earlier or later growth stages harman et al 1962 4 conclusions since the hetao irrigation district relies on diversion irrigation to develop agriculture the drought resistance ability can be improved by determining the optimum irrigation time and the lowest limit of irrigation water this study combined the apsim model with the grey relation comprehensive evaluation and proposed a method for identifying the priority of crop irrigation in this study the priority of water irrigation for wheat maize and sunflower based on the apsim model and grey relational analysis was identified through the deficit irrigation of crops at different periods the response of different crops to water moisture was explored we are more concerned about which growth stage of each crop is more critical to irrigate and which crops are given priority to irrigate when wheat maize and sunflower grow at the same time the apsim model was applied to simulate the effects of water stress on wheat maize and sunflower growth processes respectively the effects of water stress on crop growth were quantified and the priority of water irrigation was determined by the grey correlation analysis method the results indicated that the critical irrigation periods for wheat in crop growth initial period and crop development period it could effectively prevent wheat yield loss to irrigate within 10 days and 40 61 days after sowing the critical irrigation period for maize was in crop development period and middle growth period fig 2 irrigation during 50 and 81 days after sowing can effectively prevent maize yield loss and water stress between 20 and 30 days after sowing under severe water shortage can lead to yield loss the sunflower was sensitive to drought stress during crop development period and middle growth period irrigation of sunflowers 20 61 days after sowing is very important for sunflower yield the water irrigation priority of wheat maize and sunflower was maize priority to wheat in early to mid may in june the water irrigation priority was sunflower priority to wheat and maize from early july to mid july the water irrigation priority was sunflower priority to wheat and maize and from late july to late august that was sunflower priority to maize we provide irrigation guidance for the hid concerning the water irrigation priority of a single crop during the growing period and the water irrigation priority of three crops in the same period the priority of crop water irrigation results based on crop water demand can provide a basis for the rational of emergency water irrigation resources to ensure food security and mitigate drought risks moreover this methodology can be developed and expand to other areas to provide information for managers in different regions to implement precision irrigation and other counties in the hid we did not consider the influence of precipitation on irrigation decisions too much for the application of this method in other places we propose to use multivariate data to effectively assess precipitation consider the impact of rainfall on irrigation multisource rainfall products can be used to overcome the absence of gauged precipitation data and provide valuable precipitation estimates abro et al 2019 2020 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9199,the uneven temporal and spatial distribution of water has led to water crises in many countries the virtual water trade constitutes a means of dealing with such crises the virtual water trade uncovers the hidden flow of water in traded commodities between countries this work proposes a multi objective optimization model that maximizes the revenue and minimizes the direct and indirect water uses of producing strategic agricultural and industrial goods several water prices and levels of subsidies are accounted for in the optimization a country s agricultural and industrial independence is used to constraint the optimization problem which achieves food security and economic benefit the proposed optimization model is applied to identify the portfolio of suitable agricultural products in iran results show that wheat features the largest portion of water use in the agricultural sector while potatoes and tomatoes are more lucrative due to their relative high price and low water use of about 400 m3 per ton of produce moreover it is found that raising the water price reduces industrial imports because producing industrial goods is cost effective in offsetting the reduction of net revenue from agricultural production graphical abstract ga1 keywords virtual water trade water resources management conflict resolution multi objective optimization data availability data will be made

amount of water indirectly the latter authors recommended that developing a market based water pricing system and enhancing water systems efficiency can prevent unsustainable production and exports and redistributes water among provinces a large number of preceding virtual water studies have focused on monitoring the amount of virtual water in trades and a few of them optimized the trading system table 1 these studies have been centered round the agricultural trades but the tradeoff between economic benefits of agricultural and industrial commodities and their associated water use rates have been often neglected some of these studies have considered water pricing as one of the effective ways to manage water resources e g wang et al 2017 bae and dall erba 2018 this study proposes the joint management of agricultural and industrial production to guarantee a country s independence and the security of water resources iran is considered as the case study for this research due to its severe water stress and lack of management with respect to the virtual water trade bozorg haddad 2018 moreover iran s government subsidizes water which renders the price of water being lower than its actual cost this research addresses current gaps in virtual water trade research by offering a new method to optimize the virtual water trade that redistributes water to enhance economic development and independence this paper presents a novel multi objective optimization model that integrates agricultural and industrial virtual water trade under gradual increases of the water price by means of a production security constraint 2 methods this work presents a method to optimize virtual water trade considering two objectives the first objective is the minimization of the virtual water use and the second one is the maximization of revenue the multi objective non dominated sorting genetic nsga ii algorithm is applied for optimization in this work reed et al 2003 tang et al 2007 the nash

supplying the country s demand as specified by eq 2 and safeguarding the independency and security of production according to eqs 4 and 5 2 2 the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga goldberg 1989 proposed that multi objective optimization problems can be solved using the pareto ranking process where given the relative dominance of possible solutions each member of the population is assigned a relative rank this process known as non dominated sorting is the basis of the most of the multi objective evolutionary optimization algorithms the steps to implement the nsga ii multi objective optimization model are as follows fig 1 more information can be found in deb and zitzler 2001 1 initial random parents generation p 0 with a population of possible solutions of size of n 2 sorting the first generation of parent solutions according to the non dominated standing the sets of produced solutions are sorted using the non dominated ranking method by definition solution x 2 is dominated by x 1 if the following two conditions are satisfied x1 is not worse than x2 in all the defined objective functions x1 is better than x2 in at least in one of the objectives 3 considering a rank proportional to the level of each non dominated solution rank 1 is assigned to the best solutions set rank 2 to the second best solutions set and so on 4 generating the children population q0 of size n using selection crossover and mutation operators 5 production of the new improved generation including selected parents and their offspring chromosomes i e solutions 6 repeat step 5 until reaching a termination criterion such as a specified number of iterations the number of iterations and the size n of the population of solutions are set equal to 150 000 and 100 respectively the accuracy of the nsga ii calculated solutions of the bi objective model is verified by solving two single objective optimization models one for the minimization of virtual water use and the other for the maximization of net revenue using the software lingo the endpoints of the pareto front are compared with the single objective optimization results 2 3 the nash bargaining method solving the multi objective optimization provides a set of non dominated solutions or pareto front among the solutions located on the pareto front the most appropriate answer can be found using a conflict resolution method beygi et al 2014 here the nash bargaining method is implemented which is described briefly below the nash bargaining method assigns a utility function to each player of a game the higher the goal of a player the higher its utility function is and vice versa if the utility function of player i is represented by u i and s u 1 u 2 u 3 u n denotes the n dimensional set of utility functions each point in the set represents a solution of the conflict resolution problem in contrast to the set points of s there is a point which is referred to as the disagreement point d h d measures the degree of disagreement at the d point the pair s d represents the set position where all members of the set s are larger than d ganji et al 2007 the nash bargaining method maximizes the following function with respect to the utilities 8 m a x i 1 f u i d i where f denotes the number of objective functions more details of the nash bargaining method can be found in nash 1950 2 4 optimization scenarios this work optimizes the virtual water trade under 10 different water prices under scenarios 1 through 5 the price of water is gradually increased by five cents per scenario with scenario 1 having the lowest price up to the price of unsubsidized domestic water in iran moreover the independence constraints eq 4 and eq 5 are no applied to these scenarios this means that the country is allowed to import goods to supply the nation s demand these scenarios therefore represent different levels of water prices scenarios 6 through 10 enforce the independence and security of production constraints in addition to the gradual increase of water price this means the country must produce at least 50 of its demand internally additional information about the scenarios is presented in table 2 3 case study this study investigates international virtual water trade established by strategic agricultural and industrial products the bi objective optimization model introduced above is applied to iran almost 40 of iran s lands have agricultural potential but due to the poor land soil and water management and the condition of the water distribution networks only about 10 of iran s agricultural land have acceptable suitability for agricultural activities which accounts for about 92 of the country s water use mesgaran et al 2017 bozorg haddad 2018 six strategic agricultural products have been considered in this study wheat rice barley dates potatoes and tomatoes see table 3 iran has several active and valuable industries such as steel petrochemical and cement obviously these industries despite their low total use of country s available water compared to the agricultural sector roughly about 2 of the total water withdrawal contribute substantially to iran s economy steel aluminum copper iron ore and cement are the industrial products considered in this work see table 3 all the products considered in this study are among the so called strategic products which means that these products have at least one of the following features a large virtual water consumption and b large volumes of imports and exports iran s virtual water trade schematic for agricultural and industrial sectors is shown in fig 2 the agricultural and industrial data were provided by iran s ministry of agriculture and the ministry of industry mining and trade respectively 4 results and discussion this work identifies a set of optimal solutions that minimize the virtual water use and maximize revenue under several water pricing scenarios it should be noted that virtual water flow of trade parameters internal production import and export is calculated by multiplying the specific virtual water and trade parameters amount 4 1 nsga ii and nash equilibrium solution solving the optimization problem using the nsga ii method produces pareto fronts for scenarios 1 5 and 6 10 figs 3 and 4 it is seen in figs 3 and 4 the nash equilibrium point and two global solutions for the two single objective optimizations minimizing virtual water use and maximizing economic income which were calculated by lingo the reference points 0 0 in figs 3 and 4 represent iran s virtual water consumption and economic income in 2018 thus the negative values on the horizontal axis represent less use of virtual water use than in 2018 and the positive numbers represent more virtual water use relative to the historical values in 2018 similarly the negative and positive values on the vertical axis represent less economic and more revenue respectively than in 2018 a large increase in the water price causes dissatisfaction and tensions among users therefore the optimal trend of virtual water trade pareto front is revealed by the gradual increases in water price fig 3 under scenarios 1 through 5 the water price increases and the slope of the pareto front increases also in other words the increase of water price leads to larger water savings with a constant revenue it is evident in fig 4 that under scenarios 6 through 10 due to the independence constraint virtual water use about 65 billion cubic meters decreases compared to the first five scenarios 130 billion cubic meters furthermore the increase of water price at each stage results in a rising pareto front slope which means the increase of water price leads to saving more water with a constant revenue under scenarios 1 5 the minimization of the virtual water use objective leads to about 1 change of the global optimal solution compared to the endpoints of the pareto front similarly for maximizing economic revenue the global optimal point is 1 less than the endpoints of the pareto front which shows that the nsga ii model optimizes the virtual water trade with high accuracy compared to the single objective problem solved by lingo under scenarios 6 10 the global solutions for single objective optimizations differ by about 1 5 compared to the pareto front endpoints which demonstrates the high accuracy of the nsga ii model in optimizing the virtual water trade the next section discusses the nash equilibrium solutions and the average of all the pareto solutions 4 2 virtual water trade optimization without independence constraint scenarios 1 5 4 2 1 agricultural products fig 5 a e show the share of each agricultural products from internal production imports and exports also the average of all pareto solutions for the considered scenarios are listed in table 4 it is seen that the virtual water use increases from 0 1 to 3 8 109 m3 with increasing water price because of the higher yield of wheat production with higher water application yet even with the increase of wheat production the internal production is about 5 of the total demand for scenario 5 more than 95 of wheat demand is supplied by importing it from other countries clearly the virtual water export of this product should be equal to zero for all the scenarios according to table 4 the internal supply of wheat ranges between 95 and 569 103 tons with increasing in water price while imports decline from 12 843 to 12 447 103 tons this shows that the pricing scheme reveals the significant role of internal production for meeting the country s demand no noticeable trend is observed for rice with changes in water price and under scenarios 1 2 4 and 5 the country s rice demand is supplied by internal production and imports four of the five scenarios call for no rice exports table 4 shows the rice imports vary from 378 to 4360 103 tons and the internal production varies from 1095 to 4400 103 tons barley has a high virtual water use and relatively low price therefore the model results establish that exporting barley is not a beneficial option and so the virtual water use is equal to 0 in this instance the supply of barley to meet demand would be best accomplished by imports which implies redistributing water which has been historically used for barley toward other goods also the import amount decreases from 4409 to 1756 103 tons while internal production varies between 1575 to 2210 103 tons therefore imports have a more significant role in meeting the domestic demand scenarios 2 3 and 5 indicate exports of dates however scenarios 1 and 4 indicate that imports of dates have a high virtual water use and would play a major role providing the country s demand the results listed in table 4 establish that there are no detected trends for the trade of dates as there is a large internal production which varies from 159 to 967 103 tons two products i e potatoes and tomatoes are profitable crops and good options for export potato imports under all scenarios equal zero the results of table 4 indicate that the internal production in addition to meeting the country s demand 4592 103 tons leads to large exports about 34 000 103 tons because this crop is profitable in addition to having a low water use tomato imports equal 0 under all scenarios and internal production in addition to meeting the country s demand 4976 103 tons produces large exports which vary from 25 671 to 37 849 103 tons 4 2 2 industrial products concerning industrial production according to fig 6 a e the imports of all understudied products equal to zero and their virtual water at the nash equilibrium point is 0 therefore the country meets all its demands by internal production also in this group of industrial products cement has the largest share of virtual water and in addition to meeting domestic demand it has large exports of virtual water under some scenarios overall the experts decline with increasing water price the export of steel features an increasing trend with increasing water prices table 5 shows the average of all the pareto front solutions it is seen in table 5 that steel imports equal 0 and the country s demand 16 162 103 tons is met by internal production in addition large exports are called for which vary from 21 121 to 28 702 103 tons under all scenarios the domestic demand for aluminum is met by internal production 329 103 tons and the exports vary from 179 to 255 103 tons also the steel imports are equal to 0 under all scenarios iron imports amount to 0 internal iron production meets the domestic demand 37 113 103 tons and produces a surplus for exports about 44 000 103 tons copper imports equal zero under all scenarios copper internal production meets the domestic demand and allows exports that vary between 109 and 216 103 tons cement has the largest share in the virtual water trade and its production in addition to meeting domestic demand meeting 42 439 103 tons provides significant exports that vary between 19 057 and 30 340 103 tons it is noticeable that optimization under the increased water price condition raises the total revenue of the agriculture and industry sectors significantly scenario 1 5 produce an increase in the total revenue equal to 58 47 39 02 73 31 66 35 and 54 63 million dollars respectively compared with the revenue under actual water price condition in 2018 4 3 virtual water trade optimization with the independence constraint scenarios 6 10 the independence constraint requires that at least 50 of country s demand of the product be supplied internally 4 3 1 agricultural products it is seen in fig 7 a e that the virtual water use increases with increasing production compared to the scenarios 1 5 for wheat the export of virtual water is equal to 0 under scenarios 6 10 and the virtual water associated with internal production increases to about 50 of the total virtual water required for wheat the exported virtual water with rice barley and dates is equal to 0 for scenarios 6 10 similar to scenarios 1 5 potatoes and tomatoes have significant virtual water uses due to their large production which leads to a larger amount of virtual water export table 4 shows that the average internal production ranges between 6494 and 6539 103 tons to meet the internal wheat demand which is slightly over 50 of the total demand this production equals 50 of the when the independency constraint is enforced however due to the wheat s high virtual water use and low profitability more production is not justifiable concerning rice the export is equal to 0 under scenarios 6 10 rice imports vary between 1807 and 2157 103 tons and the domestic production ranges between 2210 and 2250 103 tons more than 50 of the barley demand is supplied domestically i e 2908 to 3960 103 tons while the barley import varies between 1485 and 2873 103 tons the barley exports equal to 0 under scenarios 6 10 all of the country s potato demand is supplied domestically 4592 103 tons and the rest of production is exported analogous to the first five scenarios higher exports of potatoes 13 968 16 801 103 tons preclude any imports of this crop similar strategy is obtained for tomatoes whose exports vary between 13 038 and 35 716 103 tons and there are no imports therefore it is clear that the country s tomato demand can be fully supplied by iran s farmers between 45 and 49 of the domestic demands for rice barley and dates are met by imports this means that the optimal solutions call for internal production of at least 50 of the domestic demand and importing the rest of the demand for these goods is much more profitable 4 3 2 industrial products fig 8 a e establish that virtual water imports for all industrial products obtained with the nash equilibrium point are equal to zero it means that the domestic demands for these products is met by internal production also increasing the water price leads to increases in the virtual water exports of steel and cement this means that by increasing the price of water the production of industrial goods increases to compensate for the reduction in agricultural trade income the results in table 5 establish that the steel imports equal zero and the country s demand 16 162 103 tons is fully met by internal production moreover the steel exports are relatively high 15 887 24 935 103 tons the domestic demand for aluminum under scenarios 6 10 is supplied by internal production 329 103 tons and its exports vary between 18 and 239 103 tons also the aluminum iron and copper imports equal zero under scenarios 6 10 the internal production of iron ore supplies the domestic demand 37 113 103 tons and in addition it allows for iron ore exports about 47 000 103 tons the internal production of copper provides excellent opportunity for exports in addition to supplying the domestic demand copper exports range from 56 to 312 103 tons cement has the largest share of the virtual water trade and total production domestic cement demand is about 42 439 103 tons which can be supplied within the country moreover the export of cement is estimated at about 2116 to 12 100 103 tons under scenarios 6 10 table 5 shows that by increasing the price of water the total export of industrial products increases by increasing the water price water is transferred from the agricultural to the industrial sector to increase revenue based on their water use the management of the virtual water trade under the increased water price condition raises the total revenue of the agricultural and industrial sectors significantly scenarios 6 10 produce increases in revenue equal to 49 17 76 13 70 12 81 55 and 82 82 million dollars respectively compared with the revenue under the actual water price condition in 2018 5 concluding remarks various studies have monitored the amount of virtual water trade by countries in this study on the other hand the virtual water trade of iran s strategic agricultural and industrial products has been investigated for year 2018 and the optimal trade portfolio is established by means of the multi objective optimization nsga ii algorithm considering a range of water prices the two objectives of the optimization model are to maximize revenue and to minimize virtual water use water price is raised from 0 to 25 cents per cubic meter which is the current water price in iran also production security is added to the optimization model as a constraint whereby at least 50 of the country s demand must be supplied domestically the results showed that among the strategic agricultural products wheat has the highest share of virtual water use about 40 109 m3 the production of agricultural and industrial commodities increases when the production security constraint is applied also it was found that on average wheat rice barley and dates imports accounted for about 45 49 of their total demands the potato and tomato exports have a significant role in total domestic production 76 and 80 respectively our results reveal that the industrial demand can be met by internal production and industrial imports equal zero by raising the water price the industrial production would increase to compensate for the reduction in agricultural revenue which means that as the water price increases its use is transferred to more profitable production in this case to industrial commodities we acknowledge the complexity of planning and managing the domestic production and international trade and for this reason this study begins to shed light on the virtual water trade involving agricultural and industrial products thus neglecting further constraints and policies was herein inevitable future research will address the complexities of managing domestic production and trade which would broaden this study to include the impact of climate change considering risk and the uncertainty analysis of trade and the development of a modern

output analysis methods jiang et al 2015 developed a multi regional input output model for china and reported that some of china s provinces despite their low water availability export a significant amount of water indirectly the latter authors recommended that developing a market based water pricing system and enhancing water systems efficiency can prevent unsustainable production and exports and redistributes water among provinces a large number of preceding virtual water studies have focused on monitoring the amount of virtual water in trades and a few of them optimized the trading system table 1 these studies have been centered round the agricultural trades but the tradeoff between economic benefits of agricultural and industrial commodities and their associated water use rates have been often neglected some of these studies have considered water pricing as one of the effective ways to manage water resources e g wang et al 2017 bae and dall erba 2018 this study proposes the joint management of agricultural and industrial production to guarantee a country s independence and the security of water resources iran is considered as the case study for this research due to its severe water stress and lack of management with respect to the virtual water trade bozorg haddad 2018 moreover iran s government subsidizes water which renders the price of water being lower than its actual cost this research addresses current gaps in virtual water trade research by offering a new method to optimize the virtual water trade that redistributes water to enhance economic development and independence this paper presents a novel multi objective optimization model that integrates agricultural and industrial virtual water trade under gradual increases of the water price by means of a production security constraint 2 methods this work presents a method to optimize virtual water trade considering two objectives the first objective is the minimization of the virtual water use and the second one is the maximization of revenue the multi objective non dominated sorting genetic nsga ii algorithm is applied for optimization in this work reed et al 2003 tang et al 2007 the nash bargaining method is implemented for choosing a solution among those in the pareto front fig 1 depicts the flowchart of this paper s methodology 2 1 optimization model the two objective optimization

to produce at least 50 of all the considered products domestic demand the cited percentage can be changed due to the country s specific conditions and in some cases satisfaction of the internal demand

supplying the country s demand as specified by eq 2 and safeguarding the independency and security of production according to eqs 4 and 5 2 2 the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga goldberg 1989 proposed that multi objective optimization problems can be solved using the pareto ranking process where given the relative dominance of possible solutions each member of the population is assigned a relative rank this process known as non dominated sorting is the basis of the most of the multi objective evolutionary optimization algorithms the steps to implement the nsga ii multi objective optimization model are as follows fig 1 more information can be found in deb and zitzler 2001 1 initial random parents generation p 0 with a population of possible solutions of size of n 2 sorting the first generation of parent solutions according to the non dominated standing the sets of produced solutions are sorted using the non dominated ranking method by definition solution x 2 is dominated by x 1 if the following two conditions are satisfied x1 is not worse than x2 in all the defined objective functions x1 is better than x2 in at least in one of the objectives 3 considering a rank proportional to the level of each non dominated solution rank 1 is assigned to the best solutions set rank 2 to the second best solutions set and so on 4 generating the children population q0 of size n using selection crossover and mutation operators 5 production of the new improved generation including selected parents and their offspring chromosomes i e solutions 6 repeat step 5 until reaching a termination criterion such as a specified number of iterations the number of iterations and the size n of the population of solutions are set equal to 150 000 and 100 respectively the accuracy of the nsga ii calculated solutions of the bi objective model is verified by solving two single objective optimization models one for the minimization of virtual water use and the other for the maximization of net revenue using the software lingo the endpoints of the pareto front are compared with the single objective optimization results 2 3 the nash bargaining method solving the multi objective optimization provides a set of non dominated solutions or pareto front among the solutions located on the pareto front the most appropriate answer can be found using a conflict resolution method beygi et al 2014 here the nash bargaining method is implemented which is described briefly below the nash bargaining method assigns a utility function to each player of a game the higher the goal of a player the higher its utility function is and vice versa if the utility function of player i is represented by u i and s u 1 u 2 u 3 u n denotes the n dimensional set of utility functions each point in the set represents a solution of the conflict resolution problem in contrast to the set points of s there is a point which is referred to as the disagreement point d h d measures the degree of disagreement at the d point the pair s d represents the set position where all members of the set s are larger than d ganji et al 2007 the nash bargaining method maximizes the following function with respect to the utilities 8 m a x i 1 f u i d i where f denotes the number of objective functions more details of the nash bargaining method can be found in nash 1950 2 4 optimization scenarios this work optimizes the virtual water trade under 10 different water prices under scenarios 1 through 5 the price of water is gradually increased by five cents per scenario with scenario 1 having the lowest price up to the price of unsubsidized domestic water in iran moreover the independence constraints eq 4 and eq 5 are no applied to these scenarios this means that the country is allowed to import goods to supply the nation s demand these scenarios therefore represent different levels of water prices scenarios 6 through 10 enforce the independence and security of production constraints in addition to the gradual increase of water price this means the country must produce at least 50 of its demand internally additional information about the scenarios is presented in table 2 3 case study this study investigates international virtual water trade established by strategic agricultural and industrial products the bi objective optimization model introduced above is applied to iran almost 40 of iran s lands have agricultural potential but due to the poor land soil and water management and the condition of the water distribution networks only about 10 of iran s agricultural land have acceptable suitability for agricultural activities which accounts for about 92 of the country s water use mesgaran et al 2017 bozorg haddad 2018 six strategic agricultural products have been considered in this study wheat rice barley dates potatoes and tomatoes see table 3 iran has several active and valuable industries such as steel petrochemical and cement obviously these industries despite their low total use of country s available water compared to the agricultural sector roughly about 2 of the total water withdrawal contribute substantially to iran s economy steel aluminum copper iron ore and cement are the industrial products considered in this work see table 3 all the products considered in this study are among the so called strategic products which means that these products have at least one of the following features a large virtual water consumption and b large volumes of imports and exports iran s virtual water trade schematic for agricultural and industrial sectors is shown in fig 2 the agricultural and industrial data were provided by iran s ministry of agriculture and the ministry of industry mining and trade respectively 4 results and discussion this work identifies a set of optimal solutions that minimize the virtual water use and maximize revenue under several water pricing scenarios it should be noted that virtual water flow of trade parameters internal production import and export is calculated by multiplying the specific virtual water and trade parameters amount 4 1 nsga ii and nash equilibrium solution solving the optimization problem using the nsga ii method produces pareto fronts for scenarios 1 5 and 6 10 figs 3 and 4 it is seen in figs 3 and 4 the nash equilibrium point and two global solutions for the two single objective optimizations minimizing virtual water use and maximizing economic income which were calculated by lingo the reference points 0 0 in figs 3 and 4 represent iran s virtual water consumption and economic income in 2018 thus the negative values on the horizontal axis represent less use of virtual water use than in 2018 and the positive numbers represent more virtual water use relative to the historical values in 2018 similarly the negative and positive values on the vertical axis represent less economic and more revenue respectively than in 2018 a large increase in the water price causes dissatisfaction and tensions among users therefore the optimal trend of virtual water trade pareto front is revealed by the gradual increases in water price fig 3 under scenarios 1 through 5 the water price increases and the slope of the pareto front increases also in other words the increase of water price leads to larger water savings with a constant revenue it is evident in fig 4 that under scenarios 6 through 10 due to the independence constraint virtual water use about 65 billion cubic meters decreases compared to the first five scenarios 130 billion cubic meters furthermore the increase of water price at each stage results in a rising pareto front slope which means the increase of water price leads to saving more water with a constant revenue under scenarios 1 5 the minimization of the virtual water use objective leads to about 1 change of the global optimal solution compared to the endpoints of the pareto front similarly for maximizing economic revenue the global optimal point is 1 less than the endpoints of the pareto front which shows that the nsga ii model optimizes the virtual water trade with high accuracy compared to the single objective problem solved by lingo under scenarios 6 10 the global solutions for single objective optimizations differ by about 1 5 compared to the pareto front endpoints which demonstrates the high accuracy of the nsga ii model in optimizing the virtual water trade the next section discusses the nash equilibrium solutions and the average of all the pareto solutions 4 2 virtual water trade optimization without independence constraint scenarios 1 5 4 2 1 agricultural products fig 5 a e show the share of each agricultural products from internal production imports and exports also the average of all pareto solutions for the considered scenarios are listed in table 4 it is seen that the virtual water use increases from 0 1 to 3 8 109 m3 with increasing water price because of the higher yield of wheat production with higher water application yet even with the increase of wheat production the internal production is about 5 of the total demand for scenario 5 more than 95 of wheat demand is supplied by importing it from other countries clearly the virtual water export of this product should be equal to zero for all the scenarios according to table 4 the internal supply of wheat ranges between 95 and 569 103 tons with increasing in water price while imports decline from 12 843 to 12 447 103 tons this shows that the pricing scheme reveals the significant role of internal production for meeting the country s demand no noticeable trend is observed for rice with changes in water price and under scenarios 1 2 4 and 5 the country s rice demand is supplied by internal production and imports four of the five scenarios call for no rice exports table 4 shows the rice imports vary from 378 to 4360 103 tons and the internal production varies from 1095 to 4400 103 tons barley has a high virtual water use and relatively low price therefore the model results establish that exporting barley is not a beneficial option and so the virtual water use is equal to 0 in this instance the supply of barley to meet demand would be best accomplished by imports which implies redistributing water which has been historically used for barley toward other goods also the import amount decreases from 4409 to 1756 103 tons while internal production varies between 1575 to 2210 103 tons therefore imports have a more significant role in meeting the domestic demand scenarios 2 3 and 5 indicate exports of dates however scenarios 1 and 4 indicate that imports of dates have a high virtual water use and would play a major role providing the country s demand the results listed in table 4 establish that there are no detected trends for the trade of dates as there is a large internal production which varies from 159 to 967 103 tons two products i e potatoes and tomatoes are profitable crops and good options for export potato imports under all scenarios equal zero the results of table 4 indicate that the internal production in addition to meeting the country s demand 4592 103 tons leads to large exports about 34 000 103 tons because this crop is profitable in addition to having a low water use tomato imports equal 0 under all scenarios and internal production in addition to meeting the country s demand 4976 103 tons produces large exports which vary from 25 671 to 37 849 103 tons 4 2 2 industrial products concerning industrial production according to fig 6 a e the imports of all understudied products equal to zero and their virtual water at the nash equilibrium point is 0 therefore the country meets all its demands by internal production also in this group of industrial products cement has the largest share of virtual water and in addition to meeting domestic demand it has large exports of virtual water under some scenarios overall the experts decline with increasing water price the export of steel features an increasing trend with increasing water prices table 5 shows the average of all the pareto front solutions it is seen in table 5 that steel imports equal 0 and the country s demand 16 162 103 tons is met by internal production in addition large exports are called for which vary from 21 121 to 28 702 103 tons under all scenarios the domestic demand for aluminum is met by internal production 329 103 tons and the exports vary from 179 to 255 103 tons also the steel imports are equal to 0 under all scenarios iron imports amount to 0 internal iron production meets the domestic demand 37 113 103 tons and produces a surplus for exports about 44 000 103 tons copper imports equal zero under all scenarios copper internal production meets the domestic demand and allows exports that vary between 109 and 216 103 tons cement has the largest share in the virtual water trade and its production in addition to meeting domestic demand meeting 42 439 103 tons provides significant exports that vary between 19 057 and 30 340 103 tons it is noticeable that optimization under the increased water price condition raises the total revenue of the agriculture and industry sectors significantly scenario 1 5 produce an increase in the total revenue equal to 58 47 39 02 73 31 66 35 and 54 63 million dollars respectively compared with the revenue under actual water price condition in 2018 4 3 virtual water trade optimization with the independence constraint scenarios 6 10 the independence constraint requires that at least 50 of country s demand of the product be supplied internally 4 3 1 agricultural products it is seen in fig 7 a e that the virtual water use increases with increasing production compared to the scenarios 1 5 for wheat the export of virtual water is equal to 0 under scenarios 6 10 and the virtual water associated with internal production increases to about 50 of the total virtual water required for wheat the exported virtual water with rice barley and dates is equal to 0 for scenarios 6 10 similar to scenarios 1 5 potatoes and tomatoes have significant virtual water uses due to their large production which leads to a larger amount of virtual water export table 4 shows that the average internal production ranges between 6494 and 6539 103 tons to meet the internal wheat demand which is slightly over 50 of the total demand this production equals 50 of the when the independency constraint is enforced however due to the wheat s high virtual water use and low profitability more production is not justifiable concerning rice the export is equal to 0 under scenarios 6 10 rice imports vary between 1807 and 2157 103 tons and the domestic production ranges between 2210 and 2250 103 tons more than 50 of the barley demand is supplied domestically i e 2908 to 3960 103 tons while the barley import varies between 1485 and 2873 103 tons the barley exports equal to 0 under scenarios 6 10 all of the country s potato demand is supplied domestically 4592 103 tons and the rest of production is exported analogous to the first five scenarios higher exports of potatoes 13 968 16 801 103 tons preclude any imports of this crop similar strategy is obtained for tomatoes whose exports vary between 13 038 and 35 716 103 tons and there are no imports therefore it is clear that the country s tomato demand can be fully supplied by iran s farmers between 45 and 49 of the domestic demands for rice barley and dates are met by imports this means that the optimal solutions call for internal production of at least 50 of the domestic demand and importing the rest of the demand for these goods is much more profitable 4 3 2 industrial products fig 8 a e establish that virtual water imports for all industrial products obtained with the nash equilibrium point are equal to zero it means that the domestic demands for these products is met by internal production also increasing the water price leads to increases in the virtual water exports of steel and cement this means that by increasing the price of water the production of industrial goods increases to compensate for the reduction in agricultural trade income the results in table 5 establish that the steel imports equal zero and the country s demand 16 162 103 tons is fully met by internal production moreover the steel exports are relatively high 15 887 24 935 103 tons the domestic demand for aluminum under scenarios 6 10 is supplied by internal production 329 103 tons and its exports vary between 18 and 239 103 tons also the aluminum iron and copper imports equal zero under scenarios 6 10 the internal production of iron ore supplies the domestic demand 37 113 103 tons and in addition it allows for iron ore exports about 47 000 103 tons the internal production of copper provides excellent opportunity for exports in addition to supplying the domestic demand copper exports range from 56 to 312 103 tons cement has the largest share of the virtual water trade and total production domestic cement demand is about 42 439 103 tons which can be supplied within the country moreover the export of cement is estimated at about 2116 to 12 100 103 tons under scenarios 6 10 table 5 shows that by increasing the price of water the total export of industrial products increases by increasing the water price water is transferred from the agricultural to the industrial sector to increase revenue based on their water use the management of the virtual water trade under the increased water price condition raises the total revenue of the agricultural and industrial sectors significantly scenarios 6 10 produce increases in revenue equal to 49 17 76 13 70 12 81 55 and 82 82 million dollars respectively compared with the revenue under the actual water price condition in 2018 5 concluding remarks various studies have monitored the amount of virtual water trade by countries in this study on the other hand the virtual water trade of iran s strategic agricultural and industrial products has been investigated for year 2018 and the optimal trade portfolio is established by means of the multi objective optimization nsga ii algorithm considering a range of water prices the two objectives of the optimization model are to maximize revenue and to minimize virtual water use water price is raised from 0 to 25 cents per cubic meter which is the current water price in iran also production security is added to the optimization model as a constraint whereby at least 50 of the country s demand must be supplied domestically the results showed that among the strategic agricultural products wheat has the highest share of virtual water use about 40 109 m3 the production of agricultural and industrial commodities increases when the production security constraint is applied also it was found that on average wheat rice barley and dates imports accounted for about 45 49 of their total demands the potato and tomato exports have a significant role in total domestic production 76 and 80 respectively our results reveal that the industrial demand can be met by internal production and industrial imports equal zero by raising the water price the industrial production would increase to compensate for the reduction in agricultural revenue which means that as the water price increases its use is transferred to more profitable production in this case to industrial commodities we acknowledge the complexity of planning and managing the domestic production and international trade and for this reason this study begins to shed light on the virtual water trade involving agricultural and industrial products thus neglecting further constraints and policies was herein inevitable future research will address the complexities of managing domestic production and trade which would broaden this study to include the impact of climate change considering risk and the uncertainty analysis of trade and the development of a modern
