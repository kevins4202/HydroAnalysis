17065,lakes are important sources of greenhouse gases ghgs to the atmosphere factors controlling co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes include eutrophication and warming but the integrated influence of climate warming driven stratification oxygen loss and resultant changes in bloom characteristics on ghgs are not well understood here we assessed the influence of contrasting meteorological conditions on stratification and phytoplankton bloom composition in a eutrophic lake and tested for associated changes in ghgs inventories in both the shallow and deep waters over three seasons 2010 2012 atmospheric heatwaves had one of the most dramatic effects on ghgs indeed cyanobacterial blooms that developed in response to heatwave events in 2012 enhanced both sedimentary ch4 concentrations reaching up to 1mm and emissions to the atmosphere up to 8 mmol m 2 d 1 that summer ch4 contributed 52 of the integrated warming potential of ghgs produced in the lake in co2 equivalents as compared to between 34 and 39 in years without cyanobacterial blooms high ch4 accumulation and subsequent emission in 2012 were preceded by co2 and n2o consumption and under saturation at the lake surface uptakes at 30 mmol m 2 d 1 and 1 6 µmol m 2 d 1 respectively fall overturn presented a large efflux of n2o and ch4 particularly from the littoral zone after the cyanobacterial bloom we provide evidence that despite cooling observed at depth during hot summers ch4 emissions increased via stronger stratification and surface warming resulting in enhanced cyanobacterial biomass deposition and intensified bottom water anoxia our results supported by recent literature reports suggests a novel interplay between climate change effects on lake hydrodynamics that impacts both bloom characteristics and ghgs production in shallow eutrophic lakes given global trends of warming and enrichment these interactive effects should be considered to more accurately predict the future global role of lakes in ghg emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words global warming phytoplankton blooms carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide cyanobacteria heatwaves anoxia introduction lakes emit relatively large amounts of greenhouse gases ghg to the atmosphere li et al 2018 contributions of co2 ch4 and n2o are influenced by temperature bartosiewicz et al 2016 productivity delsontro et al 2016 organic matter om bio lability grasset et al 2018 and water column oxygenation vachon et al 2019 among other factors however fluxes of these three gases are highly variable and often controlled by different drivers influencing the warming potential of lakes defined here by the cumulative emission in co2 equivalents considering the climate forcing potential of each gas for example while co2 supersaturation is prevalent in inland waters due to high inputs of terrestrial om cole et al 1994 lakes will at times also absorb atmospheric co2 when the photosynthetic consumption dominates over respiratory production grasset et al 2020 lakes can act as a source of n2o to the atmosphere under eutrophic conditions xiao et al 2019 but as a sink when systems are hypereutrophic and strongly stratified webb et al 2019 broader scale geological and landcover features can cause lakes of an entire region to act as n2o sinks under more oligotrophic conditions soued et al 2016 as well as influence regional patterns in co2 saturation levels lapierre et al 2017 therefore the combined relative strength of external forcing and within ecosystem responses can result in fluxes of varying strength and direction for these two ghgs while lakes are persistently oversaturated in ch4 concentrations typically increase with increasing trophic status delsontro et al 2018 most of aqueous ch4 is produced in anoxic sediments and the fraction that avoids oxidation is released to the atmosphere through diffusion and ebullition while oxidation was shown to reduce diffusive ch4 fluxes by between 20 to 95 in temperate lakes depending on the lake depth shape and stratification patterns bastviken et al 2008 large ch4 bubbles emerging almost exclusively from sediments are released directly to the atmosphere delsontro et al 2016 inputs of additional om to sediments be it through increased loading from the watershed or internal production deplete the reservoir of oxidants and stimulate methanogenesis zhou et al 2018 and as such enhance evasion of ch4 zhou et al 2019 although higher om loads generally lead to higher benthic ch4 production the addition of fresh phytoplankton biomass is thought to stimulate methanogenesis more strongly as compared to terrestrial om schwarz et al 2008 hence conditions that favor increased phytoplankton biomass production and sedimentation should also favor ch4 production accumulation and emission however while the stimulation of methanogenesis by biomass additions under anoxia was shown experimentally i e grasset et al 2019 the influence of in situ phytoplankton community structure and emergence of noxious blooms on ch4 flux as well as on associated changes in co2 and n2o fluxes are still poorly understood as climate warms and lakes become more strongly stratified internal nutrient loads can increase lau et al 2020 stimulating the emergence of phytoplankton blooms woolway merchant 2019 and enabling more persistent co2 depletion at the surface and oxygen shortages at the bottom bartosiewicz et al 2019b proliferation of blooms in more strongly stratified waters can thus have major consequences for benthic om processing yan et al 2017 and planktonic food webs briland et al 2019 for example when the phytoplankton community is mainly composed of inedible biomass i e filamentous cyanobacteria a greater proportion of om tends to reach the sediments after a bloom carey et al 2012 strongly stimulating benthic respiration and methanogenesis in fact a positive relationship between the occurrence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms and ch4 flux was recently reported from lake taihu in china yan et al 2017 furthermore surface blooms themselves may enhance thermal shielding in the upper water column leading to bottom water cooling and prolonged anoxia creating conditions that could respectively reduce om processing and stimulate methanogenesis bartosiewicz et al 2019b therefore conditions that favor noxious blooms may also favor higher net ch4 fluxes the combined effects of climate warming and eutrophication have stimulated cyanobacteria and other bloom forming phytoplankton in lakes worldwide huisman et al 2018 heatwave associated thermal stratification tends to trigger these blooms and favor buoyant cyanobacteria jöhnk et al 2008 as regional extreme heat events are increasing in frequency around the globe perkins kirkpatrick lewis 2020 and phytoplankton blooms are becoming more severe gobler 2020 their combined influence has possible cascading repercussions on ghgs here we used observational data collected in the pelagial and littoral zones of a nutrient rich lake exposed to a spectrum of meteorological conditions including heatwaves to test the effects of hydrodynamic conditions on ghg storage and emissions we specifically looked at how these conditions brought changes in the phytoplankton community structure bloom dynamics and water column oxygenation and evaluated how these changes controlled the contribution of co2 ch4 and n2o to the cumulative warming potential of stored and released gases this natural experiment by comparing three years allowed to test if buoyant cyanobacterial blooms influenced the efficiency of om processing in the food web differentially than blooms by other phytoplankton and assess the associated production accumulation and efflux of ghgs in the pelagic and littoral zones of the lake methods study site lake st augustin 46 42 n 71 22 w fig 1 is a small shallow lake 0 62 km2 max depth 6 m classified as eutrophic to hypereutrophic summertime tp 20 160 µg l 1 and chl a 10 60 µg l 1 located on the outskirts of quebec city canada during the past two centuries this lake has been subjected to anthropogenic eutrophication deshpande et al 2014 leading to persistent phytoplankton blooms from 1960 onward blooms in lake saint augustin have been defined as periods when chl a concentrations exceed 20 µg l 1 and more than 80 of biomass is produced by one of the common bloom forming species i e glenodinium sp or dolichospermum sp the growing prevalence of cyanobacteria over the last two decades is in part due to an increase in water column stability and decrease in dissolved co2 availability under changing climate bartosiewicz et al 2019a littoral and pelagial zones of the lake were defined based on the average light penetration depth estimated as two times the secchi disk depth in the littoral zones 2m deep sunlight reached the bottom in spring allowing growth of the submerged macrophytes physical chemistry and plankton dynamics the lake was sampled during the open water season from may to october monthly in 2010 and 2011 and biweekly in 2012 during these years hourly air temperature wind speed and precipitation data were obtained at the meteorological station of environment canada located 1 5 km from the lake 46 48 n 71 23 w http climate weather gc ca

collected at the surface of the littoral and pelagial sites fig 2 was also filtered onto pre combusted gf f filters for the quantification of particulate om to determine the biovolume and composition of phytoplankton communities 1 l water samples were collected at 1 m intervals from 0 to 5 m in the pelagial zone littoral communities were not assessed subsamples from each depth were preserved with lugol s iodine solution and analyzed following utermöhl 1958 using an inverted microscope zeiss axiovert 2000 for each phytoplankton species at least 20 individuals were measured and the biovolume was calculated following hillebrand et al 1999 details on the phytoplankton community structure during the open water seasons between 2010 and 2012 were presented by bartosiewicz et al 2019a zooplankton were collected with a plankton net 63 µm towed through the upper 3 m of the water column collected animals preserved in formaldehyde were identified according to haney et al 2013 the number of individuals counted per sample ranged from 150 to 600 and at least 20 individuals per identified species were measured and weighted for biomass estimations gannon 1971 greenhouse gas concentrations a total of 950 ghg samples were collected between 2010 and 2012 concentrations of dissolved co2 ch4 and n2o were collected by equilibrating 2 l of lake water with 20 ml of ambient air after equilibration the headspace was sampled into 6 ml he purged pre evacuated exetainers labco limited uk for co2 and ch4 analyses triplicate samples and the collected gas was analyzed with a gas chromatograph varian 3800 equipped with a methanizer and a flame ionization detector separate samples were taken for n2o determination also in triplicates headspace samples were injected into 9 ml pre evacuated borosilicate vials and concentrations were determined with a gas chromatograph schimatzu 2014 equipped with an electron capture detector during each sampling 10ml of air was collected into 9ml for ambient atmospheric n2o concentration measurements aqueous gas concentrations were obtained using henry s law and ambient water temperatures measured during the equilibration process global values of atmospheric partial pressures 400 ppm of co2 and 1 8 ppm of ch4 were used to determine the co2 and ch4 saturation levels while local measurements of atmospheric partial pressures were used to determine n2o saturation to assess ghg storage in the lake concentrations in the water column taken at 1 m resolution were multiplied by the volume of each respective depth interval and summed over the water column of both the littoral 0 2 m deep and the pelagial zones 2 5m deep greenhouse gas emissions diffusive flux at the air water interface was estimated by multiplying the partial pressure

in water and air and α is the ostwald solubility coefficient atmospheric gas is assumed dissolved at the top of the aqueous boundary layer piston velocity was calculated using the classic wind based equation of cole and caraco 1998 hereafter cc k600 2 07 0 215 u1 7 where u is wind speed m s 1 at 10 meters height we also used the wind based equation corrected for lake size of vachon and prairie

hoover and berkshire 1969 using ph wind speed and water temperature validation of the modeled ghg flux estimates was performed by comparison to direct co2 flux measurements done using a floating chamber in 2011 and 2012 for details on chamber design and sampling scheme see bartosiewicz et al 2019a results from both the cc and vp models strongly correlated to measured chamber co2 fluxes r2 0 68 and 0 62 respectively p 0 01 n 24 the vp model estimates better reflected the flux range obtained through direct measurements slope closer to 1 and this model was henceforth retained for analyses in the following sections ebullition rates were determined only in 2011 and 2012 by collecting gas bubbles with inverted pcv funnels coupled to a gas tight syringe in august 2011 n 6 and in june july august and september 2012 n 54 in both the littoral and pelagial zones of the lake sediment profiling of ch4 porewater samples were collected in 2012 by in situ dialysis at a 1 cm vertical sampling resolution 5 cm above and below the sediment water interface using acrylic peepers before deployment the peepers were conditioned under a n2 atmosphere with the gas renewed daily for two weeks to remove any traces of oxygen from the acrylic casting and sampling wells sampling wells were filled with anoxic ultrapure water and covered with a polysulfone membrane 0 2 μm pore size gelman ht 200 peepers in triplicates were transported in n2 filled containers and placed in the lake for two to three weeks porewater ch4 concentration profiles were modeled assuming steady state conditions and neglecting the effect of advection and bioturbation clayer et al 2020 with the general one dimensional diagenetic transport reaction equation for solutes x φ d s c x φ α c wat c r net c h 4 0 where c and cwat denote ch4 concentrations respectively in porewater and in the burrows of benthic animals assumed to be identical to that in sediment overlying water x is the depth positive downward φ is the porosity ds is the effective diffusion coefficient α is the bio irrigation coefficient and rnet is the net production rate or consumption rate if r is negative of ch4 in a given sediment volume the effective diffusion coefficient clayer et al 2020 was calculated as d s φ 2 d w where dw is the diffusion coefficient of ch4 in water the software profile berg et al 1998 was used to solve the equation for r implementing average ch4 concentration profiles n 3 measured φ values and dw values corrected for in situ temperature the effective diffusion in and from the sediments was also calculated using profile the modelled and measured concentrations of ch4 in the sediments were used to calculate the mass of this gas that accumulated in surface sediments by multiplying with respective volumes of porewater in the littoral and pelagial zones of the lake measured at 1 cm intervals results surface meteorology air temperatures over lake st augustin in 2010 and 2012 were on average warmer than in 2011 table 1 and well above the long term normal 17 9 c between 1948 and 2010 environment canada 2012 climate report the cooler summer of 2011 was also relatively wetter than those of 2010 and 2012 weather in 2010 was also characterized by mild winter 4 0 c above normal the warmest since 1948 followed by a warm spring temperatures reaching 25 c in april march to may average of 12 6 c compared to 7 7 c in 2011 average springtime temperature was also high in 2012 11 1 c and remained hot throughout the summer one of the major differences among years was the relative exposure to heatwaves when air above the lake warmed beyond the pre defined threshold of 31 c for at least 24h early in summer 2010 there were three heatwave days in june whereas during the summer of 2012 the lake was exposed to four consecutive atmospheric heatwaves for a total of 11 days in july and early august in 2011 there were no heatwaves recorded the lake warmed more at the surface in 2010 and 2012 as compared to 2011 with 2012 being the hottest on average table 1 bottom waters however remained cooler in 2010 and 2012 and coldest in 2012 calm conditions during heat events strongly enhanced stratification buoyancy frequency reaching 40 cph in surface waters and heat losses were noticeably low on calm hot nights i e 100 w m 2 during these heatwaves mixed layer deepening was suppressed and the heat retained at the surface thermally shielded its bottom the mechanistic explanation for the enhanced stratification upon warming in lake st augustin was recently provided in bartosiewicz et al 2019b oxygen conditions and nutrients the bottom waters of the lake 3 5 to 5 5 m were better ventilated in summer 2011 as compared to 2010 and 2012 table 1 figs 2 3 b likely as a function of higher precipitation and stronger nocturnal winds the oxygen concentrations in the water directly overlaying sediments dropped below 0 2 mg l 1 sensor detection limit by late july and early august in 2012 indicating that surface sediments likely became anoxic at that time in contrast to bottom waters surface oxygen concentrations were often well above saturation the highest values were measured during the phytoplankton blooms occurring in august 2010 and july 2012 reaching 150 of oxygen saturation differential stratification and oxygenation of the water column was reflected in differences between total and dissolved nutrient concentrations tn tp n no3 srp in fact total nutrient concentrations were respectively higher and dissolved were lower in the warmer years as compared to the average year except for n no3 in 2010 particularly when comparing 2012 with 2011 planktonic communities during years with heatwaves 2010 2012 cyanobacteria became more abundant in the lake as compared to the year without heatwaves 2011 fig 3a in 2010 for example an early biomass peak of buoyant filamentous cyanobacteria aphanizomenon sp occurred already in spring june accounting for as much as 72 of the total phytoplankton biomass reaching 54 mg of wet weight l 1 following this peak the phytoplankton community was dominated up to 99 by dinophytes that bloomed in mid summer and by diatoms in fall fig 3a in 2012 we observed a massive occurrence of cyanobacteria that accumulated at the surface of the lake between mid july and mid august high densities of aphanizomenon flos aquae and dolichospermum sp reaching 47 103 cells ml 1 up to 300 mg ww l 1 were moved inshore by the wind later in the summer where they likely settled to the bottom by contrast in 2011 the phytoplankton was dominated by diatoms in may 84 of 12 mg ww l 1 followed by dinophytes 97 of the 98 mg ww l 1 in june and july dinophytes together with diatoms formed an extensive bloom in the upper water column up to 400 mg ww l 1 the cumulative biomass of main phytoplankton groups bloom forming diatoms dinophytes and cyanobacteria in the euphotic zone taken throughout the studied periods as twice the secchi depth differed between years one way anova p 0 001 f 31 7 reaching up to 270 103 kgww in 2010 up to 225 103 kgww in 2011 and as much as 180 103 kgww in 2012 fig 3 in 2012 the zooplankton biomass was higher than in 2011 on average 163 vs 116 μg dw l 1 p 0 02 t test but consisted of smaller species i e ceriodaphnia sp large cladocerans i e from the genus daphnia abundant in spring 2012 disappeared completely from the lake during the harmful cyanobacterial bloom fig 3a in 2011 by contrast daphnia were detected throughout the entire summer ghg concentrations the co2 saturation level was variable between years and across the water column table 2 but remained persistently depleted during the hot and dry summer of 2012 18 6 15 5 µm n 510 as compared to wet summer of 2011 31 1 17 9 µm n 300 and the more intermediate summer of 2010 43 7 33 4 µm n 140 with significant differences among years one way anova f 10 1 p 0 001 the mean ch4 saturation level was higher in 2012 0 59 0 5 µm than either in 2010 0 50 0 38 µm or 2011 0 46 0 32 µm but the interannual differences were not significant due to strong seasonality p 0 3 n2o was highest in 2012 but also extremely variable during that year 2 8 4 2 nm spatially there was less co2 at the surface of the littoral zone as compared to the pelagial zone three year average of 16 9 and 20 7 µm respectively t test p 0 0001 in contrast littoral surface waters were richer in ch4 than those offshore 0 64 and 0 37 µm p 0 001 and this was also true for n2o 1 1 and 0 73 nm p 0 001 ghg emissions co2 was released mostly through diffusion 99 with negligible fraction emitted through ebullition 1 the highly variable fluxes of co2 were on average lower in 2010 and 2012 7 1 20 9 and 5 4 29 7 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively than in 2011 9 7 26 1 mmol m 2 d 1 table 2 thus surface waters acted as a sink for atmospheric co2 in the warmer summers fig 4 the overturn period subsequent to summertime blooms resulted in large co2 emission to the atmosphere in fact the efflux during the 2012 overturn period was 30 higher than the maximum co2 efflux measured in 2011 in contrast to the pelagial zone the littoral acted as a net co2 sink over this entire study mean of 4 9 mmol m 2 d 1 inshore as compared to 5 5 mmol m 2 d 1 offshore for the 3 years merged n 103 p 0 0001 diffusion was on average also the dominant pathway of ch4 release from both littoral and pelagial zones 75 diffusive efflux from the pelagial zone was higher in 2012 1 1 mmol m 2 d 2 n 61 than in 2010 0 75 mmol m 2 d 1 n 12 or 2011 0 85 mmol m 2 d 1 n 30 but given the large seasonal variability this difference was not significant anova p 0 09 the most striking difference among years was observed for the littoral zone where the year with cyanobacterial blooms showed an average efflux that was twice as high 2 2 mmol m 2 d 1 and significantly greater as over the two other years 1 1 mmol m 2 d 1 in 2010 and 0 9 mmol m 2 d 1 in 2011 p 0 001 methane ebullition in 2011 august only n 6 contributed about 1 0 011 mmol m 2 d 1 of the pelagial ch4 efflux and about 17 0 4 mmol m 2 d 1 of the efflux from the littoral zone for most of 2012 ebullition offshore was low mean of 0 05 mmol m 2 d 1 n 15 and contributed between 1 and 7 of the total ch4 efflux only in relation to cyanobacterial blooms did the contribution of ebullition increase to 25 ebullition was much higher in the littoral zone on average 0 53 mmol m 2 d 1 n 15 p 0 001 contributing 11 to 75 of the ch4 efflux before and after the bloom respectively ebullition was not measured in 2010 the dominant emission pathways for n2o was diffusion 99 average n2o flux from the pelagial zone of the lake was higher in 2011 2 2 μmol m 2 d 1 than in 2010 0 53 μmol m 2 d 1 or 2012 0 91 μmol m 2 d 1 p 0 05 highest offshore n2o emissions reached 8 6 μmol m 2 d 1 in september 2011 overall however n2o emissions were highest from the littoral zone 2 0 μmol m 2 d 1 as compared to 1 4 μmol m 2 d 1 offshore p 0 03 t test water column inventory of ghgs carbon dioxide was the dominant ghg accumulating in lake waters in 2010 and 2011 accounting for as much as 59 and 66 of the total ecosystem scale efflux in co2 equivalents respectively with most of the remaining balance attributed to ch4 fig 3 in 2012 however it was ch4 that contributed most to the warming potential of the lake averaging 52 of the ecosystem scale efflux in co2 eq with the contribution from dissolved co2 decreasing to 46 the contribution from n2o albeit always small increased to 2 of total emissions during the hot summer of 2012 compared to less than 1 in 2010 and 2011 and was particularly high in the littoral zone the accumulation of ghgs in the water column of the littoral zone 2 m deep was proportional to its surface area 10 of the total lake area in 2010 i e up to 11 of co2 and ch4 up to 5 of n2o and 2011 up to 4 of co2 and up to 14 of ch4 by comparison shallow waters accumulated up to 20 of the total ch4 and 18 of the total n2o in 2012 the littoral zone contributed only about 6 of the warming potential of the lake over the three years of study despite the relatively high concentrations of ch4 and n2o measured there this relatively low contribution by the littoral zone during the hot summer was caused by the persistent co2 depletion that occurred there effects of cyanobacterial biomass on benthic ch4 the ch4 cumulating in surface sediments down to 0 05 m sampled only in 2012 increased by 2 to 5 times in the littoral and pelagial sediments respectively after the cyanobacterial bloom collapsed in late august fig 5 after the overturn period september the littoral sediments still stored considerable amounts of ch4 0 2 105 moles integrated over the entire zone but mainly in the subsurface 4 5 cm on the other hand the autumnal decrease of ch4 observed in the offshore sediments implies that at this time most of the accumulated gas in this section of the lake was already released or oxidized the average ch4 fluxes at the sediment water interface were 20 higher after the cyanobacterial bloom than before it occurred 3 2 and 2 7 mmol m 2 d 1 in september and july p 0 01 one way anova and almost three times higher in the littoral than in the pelagial sediments 2 9 and 1 0 mmol m 2 d 1 environmental controls on phytoplankton and relationship with ghgs the biomass of dinophytes correlated to bottom and surface temperatures as well as to surface ph and o2 levels but was inversely correlated to wind speeds and bottom o2 the biomass of diatoms was correlated to wind speeds and bottom o2 but was inversely correlated to surface temperatures the cyanobacterial biomass was correlated to surface temperatures and inversely to bottom o2 fig 6 table s1 the accumulation of co2 in the water column was correlated to bottom o2 concentrations to wind speeds and to diatom biomass fig 6a but inversely to surface o2 ph temperatures surface and bottom chl a and dinophyte biomass ch4 was positively correlated with water temperatures bottom and surface chl a and cyanobacterial biomass and negatively with bottom o2 n2o correlated to water temperatures surface and bottom the stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the combined effect of water temperatures and phytoplankton bloom composition explained a large fraction of the variability in ghgs accumulation fig 6 table 3 indeed the regression model which included stratification strength as the difference between surface and bottom water temperature and biomass of non cyanobacterial bloom formers diatoms and dinophytes explained 65 of the variability in water column co2 levels p 0 0001 in contrast 54 of the variability in ch4 accumulation was a function of surface water temperature and cyanobacterial biomass p 0 001 while changes in biomass of non cyanobacterial bloom formers did not improve the regression finally water temperature and stratification strength explained 43 of the variability in n2o p 0 005 discussion changes in phytoplankton bloom composition and timing influenced the warming potential of ghgs stored and released from lake st augustin thermal shielding during hot years resulted in cooler bottoms which likely diminished benthic processing through thermodynamic effects however the increase in ch4 efflux observed after the heatwaves i e enhanced by up to 10 times resulted from the large inputs of cyanobacterial biomass to sediments this higher deposition was also related to changes in the zooplankton community structure during the emergence of buoyant cyanobacteria with small zooplankters being apparently unable to efficiently graze the accumulated biomass in years with heatwaves the lake was warmer at the surface and persistently more strongly stratified in 2012 which resulted in a faster and sustained depletion of oxygen at the lake bottom as compared to 2011 these persistent low oxygen conditions set the stage for increased benthic ch4 production rates additionally enhanced due to freshly deposited biomass in 2012 the biomass production was also associated to a sustained uptake of atmospheric co2 by buoyant cyanobacteria accumulating at the surface these results imply that under eutrophic conditions the increased growth of buoyant filamentous cyanobacteria can stimulate benthic methanogenesis more than blooms of other phytoplankton specifically more edible dinophytes and diatoms through direct pulse inputs of om to anoxic sediments effects of surface meteorology on phytoplankton blooms and consequences for ghgs phytoplankton phenology and community structure in lake st augustin differed across studied years springtime warming in 2010 resulted in an early peak of cyanobacteria followed by dinophytes and diatoms emerging when the lake was mixing relatively frequently during that summer wet and cool spring to summer transition in 2011 resulted in a community dominated by dinophytes with emergence of abundant diatoms later in the season hot and dry conditions in 2012 resulted in an early peak of dinophytes that were then replaced by cyanobacteria when the lake remained stratified for relatively long periods of time interannual differences in phytoplankton community structure and biomass patterns despite sustained elevated nutrient concentrations among years table 1 suggest that eutrophication alone will not necessarily stimulate cyanobacterial blooms huang et al 2020 our observations in lake st augustin suggest that it is the combined influence of eutrophication and stronger stratification as a function of warming that triggers cyanobacterial blooms in shallow eutrophic lakes this influence is expected to become even stronger under the future climate bartosiewicz et al 2019a consequences of eutrophication were suggested to enhance the warming potential of gases emitted from temperate lakes through stimulated ch4 and n2o fluxes delsontro et al 2018 here we provide evidence that such effects are influenced by phytoplankton community structure as well as the timing and composition of seasonal blooms since cyanobacterial blooms are likely to proliferate as climate warms huisman et al 2018 faster heat absorption within their buoyant biomass may stimulate stratification and reduce downward oxygen transport kumagai et al 2000 the onset of anoxia favors om processing towards ch4 vachon et al 2019 thus the carbon absorbed from the atmosphere by cyanobacteria i e uptake of up to 30 mmol co2 m 2 d 1 in lake st augustin may later fuel methanogenesis at the bottom this results from the inefficient processing i e impaired grazing bednarska and dawidowicz 2007 of filamentous cyanobacteria by zooplankton in lake st augustin the large and efficient zooplankters i e from the genus daphnia sp disappeared during and after the heatwaves when filamentous cyanobacteria became abundant it follows that in the absence of grazing cyanobacterial biomass was largely deposited to the sediments and increased benthic ch4 fluxes and storage fig 5 while in many lakes ch4 is known to be released mostly through ebullition aben et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 the compact and clayed pelagial sediments in lake st augustin apparently did not catalyze intense ch4 bubbling in fact ebullition became important only in association to cyanobacterial blooms up to 25 of total ch4 efflux in the pelagic zone while our sampling design does not account for all possible point source ebullition events wik et al 2013 detection of higher ebullition rates up to 75 of the total efflux in the organic rich littoral sediments oc 20 supports that ch4 bubbling in this lake is controlled by sediment characteristics indeed while warming catalyzed persistently high ch4 efflux from shallow sediments it was the combination of strong stratification and input of cyanobacterial biomass that triggered high ch4 ebullition in the pelagial zone after the bloom had collapsed the synergy between warming and eutrophication that may stimulate ch4 ebullition aben et al 2017 davidson et al 2018 appears as strongly variable in nature and as implied by our observations depends on the patterns of biomass re distribution after blooms these patterns will be particularly critical for buoyant biomass of filamentous bloom formers that is often moved inshore by winds and deposited to sediments in the littoral zone warming was also shown to influence activation energies during om degradation and enhance the proportion of primary production released as ch4 durocher et al 2011 2014 however and counterintuitively bottom waters and offshore sediments of lake st augustin remained relatively cold during summer with heatwaves the enhanced water column stratification leading to this cooling bartosiewicz et al 2019b was also conductive to co2 depletion at the surface and expansion of anoxia at the bottom arguably the exact outcome of such opposing effects on net ch4 efflux where bottom cooling slows down om processing on the one hand and higher om inputs enhance benthic methanogenesis on the other will vary with lake morphometry and food web structure our study however provides a first line of support for the importance of phytoplankton bloom composition as a driver of ch4 production with cyanobacterial dominance increasing its contribution to the overall warming potential of ghgs produced and emitted by a shallow lake ecosystem spatiotemporally variable effects of phytoplankton blooms on ghgs ecosystem scale effects of heatwaves in 2012 generated about 28 103 moles co2 equivalent as compared to 31 103 moles co2 equivalent in 2011 this relatively small difference results mostly from the negative contribution of co2 up taken by buoyant cyanobacteria in 2012 despite high uptake rates at the surface co2 still remained important ghg stored and released from the water column during both years however while the massive dinophyte bloom was not conducive to persistent co2 depletion in 2011 the combination of strong stratification and emergent buoyant cyanobacterial bloom in 2012 lead to a persistent co2 undersaturation throughout the upper waters this was not simply an effect of scale as the dinophyte bloom in 2011 lasted longer and produced higher biomass than the cyanobacterial bloom in the following summer noticeably shallow littoral zones of the lake represented larger and mostly continuous sink for co2 as compared to the less consistent uptake in the pelagial zones this may have resulted from the wind driven concentration of buoyant cyanobacteria in the nearshore areas and from sustained co2 consumption by submerged macrophytes i e myriophyllum sp vallisneria americana in support of our initial idea when co2 was depleted ch4 became the most important ghg in terms of co2 eq during summer with heatwaves and after the collapse of cyanobacterial blooms however while pelagial ch4 flux increased by only 20 littoral emissions did so by 50 this raises the need to closely consider the spatiotemporal nature of phytoplankton productivity effects on ghgs emissions in lakes observed differences between pelagial and littoral zones may have emerged through stimulation of specific methanogens in near shore sediments or from the relatively stronger vertical mixing in the shallows that limited the time window available for methane oxidation mayr et al 2020 the globally increasing frequency of heatwaves perkins kirkpatrick and lewis 2020 will influence hydrodynamics differently in deep and shallow waters periods of intense warming and water column stabilization will apparently enhance rates of atmospheric co2 uptake but can also strongly stimulate ch4 and n2o emissions in the shallows to improve future predictions and upscaled calculations particular attention should be paid on where and what type of biomass is processed to ghgs during and after phytoplankton blooms lake morphometry thus becomes an important characteristic to factor in when estimating emissions at the scale of a lake rates of ch4 release from the pelagial sediments were lower than diffusion at the water surface in early summer 2012 i e 0 5 mmol m 2 d 1 as compared to 1 8 mmol m 2 d 1 this difference may be indicative of ch4 production within the well oxygenated upper water column delsontro et al 2018 and or transport of ch4 rich waters from the littoral zone encinas fernández et al 2016 the difference between benthic and surface ch4 effluxes later in summer 2 6 mmol m 2 d 1 compared to 1 3 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively suggests that ch4 oxidation in the water column was responsible for removal of about 50 of ch4 from the pelagial zone and 40 from the littoral zone sediment profiles reveal surficial decreases in ch4 concentrations particularly important in the littoral sediments fig 5 lower panels this may indicate zone of anaerobic ch4 oxidation in surface sediments martinez cruz et al 2018 noticeably the ch4 concentrations decreased by 90 to 95 from 3 to 1 cm below the sediment surface in the pelagial and littoral zone respectively the efficiency of this ch4 consumption was reduced after the cyanobacterial bloom collapsed as ch4 concentrations decreased respectively only by 45 to 72 speculatively this may indicate a reduction in rates of anaerobic methanotrophy under om enriched conditions when fermenting bacteria become relatively more active yang et al 2019 our study reveals large interannual seasonal and spatial variability in n2o concentrations and fluxes in contrast to ch4 and despite relatively large amounts of n2o accumulated over the hot summer 2012 table 1 the mean efflux of this potent ghg was higher during the rainy year 2011 indeed the largest n2o release was observed in the littoral zone following strong autumnal rainfall suggesting the potentially important role of allochthonous inputs and or water intrusions in the production and release of n2o while the overall contribution from n2o in co2 eq can be considered negligible in this lake its production was strongly enhanced in the shallow zones and correlated to the deposition of bloom biomass into littoral sediments while ch4 and co2 fluxes appeared as coupled with ch4 increasing and co2 decreasing respectively during and after each phytoplankton bloom event n2o fluxes were rather decoupled from these other ghgs and related to allochthonous processes i e rainfall in the catchment fig 6b interestingly during winter 2011 and 2012 data not shown we have recorded peaks in n2o concentrations with integrated mass reaching twice as much as during the summertime maximum such wintertime accumulation with potentially rapid release upon ice breakups has also been reported from multiple boreal lakes in canada soued et al 2016 this indicates the need for better resolved studies on n2o dynamic in aquatic systems aiming to identify hot emission moments of this potent ghg that can be apparently distinct from those reported for ch4 and co2 there has been an exponential increase in the number of studies reporting ghg emission rates from lakes over the last two decades see selected recent work in table 4 this rapidly growing literature unequivocally supports that lakes are important sources of co2 ch4 and n2o to the atmosphere and that both warming and eutrophication strongly influence fluxes of these gases from sediments and throughout the water column most recent work has focused on determining environmental controls on ch4 and n2o the two more potent ghgs rather than on co2 a number of field experimental and modelling efforts established further that warming enhances ch4 flux more strongly than co2 flux likely as a consequence of more favorable conditions for methanogens arising under warmer ambient temperature table 4 when assessed in combination eutrophication and warming was suggested to act synergistically to change the magnitude of ghgs effluxes from lakes table 4 in light of this literature survey and our own work we argue that understanding the effects of phytoplankton bloom characteristics and resulting food web changes directly controlled by eutrophication and warming is needed to fully appreciate and predict ghg fluxes in freshwaters our work provides the first comprehensive assessment of how phytoplankton bloom composition and phenology influenced by local climate and eutrophication affects ghgs furthermore the novel mechanism of enhanced ch4 production mediated through the sedimentation of cyanobacterial bloom potentially represents a positive climate cyanobacteria methane feedback that has important implications for future predictions on global ghgs budget indeed if warming and eutrophication lead to further proliferation of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes proportionally higher ch4 production even if from recently fixed co2 may lead to an accelerated atmospheric warming through enhanced emissions from lakes conclusions spatiotemporal variability in ghg production accumulation and release from a small nutrient rich lake was shown to depend on the type and phenology of phytoplankton blooms our novel results suggest that proliferation of buoyant filamentous blooms stimulated by warming and water column stability can result in enhanced ch4 production and fluxes at the expense of co2 if correct we expect a positive feedback amplifying both processes i e climate warming and noxious blooms through globally raising ch4 levels we also evidence that despite the cooling occurring at depth benthic ch4 emissions increased through a synergy between anoxia and higher pulse biomass deposition this effect boosted ch4 fluxes both at the sediment water and at the water atmosphere interfaces effects of eutrophication and higher production on ch4 flux are not however necessarily linear as increasing biomass produced under nutrient rich conditions can be processed efficiently to co2 through trophic transfer and respiration such as for lake st augustin in 2011 for future climate warming projections it will be important to consider the emerging synergies between effects on water temperatures stratification strength and oxygenation bloom phenology and composition as well as patterns of carbon transfer in the food web understanding interactive effects between phytoplankton production and consumption as well as planktonic om redistribution into different carbon pools including ch4 from sediments into the overlaying waters appears crucial to accurately predict the role of lakes in the

17065,lakes are important sources of greenhouse gases ghgs to the atmosphere factors controlling co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes include eutrophication and warming but the integrated influence of climate warming driven stratification oxygen loss and resultant changes in bloom characteristics on ghgs are not well understood here we assessed the influence of contrasting meteorological conditions on stratification and phytoplankton bloom composition in a eutrophic lake and tested for associated changes in ghgs inventories in both the shallow and deep waters over three seasons 2010 2012 atmospheric heatwaves had one of the most dramatic effects on ghgs indeed cyanobacterial blooms that developed in response to heatwave events in 2012 enhanced both sedimentary ch4 concentrations reaching up to 1mm and emissions to the atmosphere up to 8 mmol m 2 d 1 that summer ch4 contributed 52 of the integrated warming potential of ghgs produced in the lake in co2 equivalents as compared to between 34 and 39 in years without cyanobacterial blooms high ch4 accumulation and subsequent emission in 2012 were preceded by co2 and n2o consumption and under saturation at the lake surface uptakes at 30 mmol m 2 d 1 and 1 6 µmol m 2 d 1 respectively fall overturn presented a large efflux of n2o and ch4 particularly from the littoral zone after the cyanobacterial bloom we provide evidence that despite cooling observed at depth during hot summers ch4 emissions increased via stronger stratification and surface warming resulting in enhanced cyanobacterial biomass deposition and intensified bottom water anoxia our results supported by recent literature reports suggests a novel interplay between climate change effects on lake hydrodynamics that impacts both bloom characteristics and ghgs production in shallow eutrophic lakes given global trends of warming and enrichment these interactive effects should be considered to more accurately predict the future global role of lakes in ghg emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words global warming phytoplankton blooms carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide cyanobacteria heatwaves anoxia introduction lakes emit relatively large amounts of greenhouse gases ghg to the atmosphere li et al 2018 contributions of co2 ch4 and n2o are influenced by temperature bartosiewicz et al 2016 productivity delsontro et al 2016 organic matter om bio lability grasset et al 2018 and water column oxygenation vachon et al 2019 among other factors however fluxes of these three gases are highly variable and often controlled by different drivers influencing the warming potential of lakes defined here by the cumulative emission in co2 equivalents considering the climate forcing potential of each gas for example while co2 supersaturation is prevalent in inland waters due to high inputs of terrestrial om cole et al 1994 lakes will at times also absorb atmospheric co2 when the photosynthetic consumption dominates over respiratory production grasset et al 2020 lakes can act as a source of n2o to the atmosphere under eutrophic conditions xiao et al 2019 but as a sink when systems are hypereutrophic and strongly stratified webb et al 2019 broader scale geological and landcover features can cause lakes of an entire region to act as n2o sinks under more oligotrophic conditions soued et al 2016 as well as influence regional patterns in co2 saturation levels lapierre et al 2017 therefore the combined relative strength of external forcing and within ecosystem responses can result in fluxes of varying strength and direction for these two ghgs while lakes are persistently oversaturated in ch4 concentrations typically increase with increasing trophic status delsontro et al 2018 most of aqueous ch4 is produced in anoxic sediments and the fraction that avoids oxidation is released to the atmosphere through diffusion and ebullition while oxidation was shown to reduce diffusive ch4 fluxes by between 20 to 95 in temperate lakes depending on the lake depth shape and stratification patterns bastviken et al 2008 large ch4 bubbles emerging almost exclusively from sediments are released directly to the atmosphere delsontro et al 2016 inputs of additional om to sediments be it through increased loading from the watershed or internal production deplete the reservoir of oxidants and stimulate methanogenesis zhou et al 2018 and as such enhance evasion of ch4 zhou et al 2019 although higher om loads generally lead to higher benthic ch4 production the addition of fresh phytoplankton biomass is thought to stimulate methanogenesis more strongly as compared to terrestrial om schwarz et al 2008 hence conditions that favor increased phytoplankton biomass production and sedimentation should also favor ch4 production accumulation and emission however while the stimulation of methanogenesis by biomass additions under anoxia was shown experimentally i e grasset et al 2019 the influence of in situ phytoplankton community structure and emergence of noxious blooms on ch4 flux as well as on associated changes in co2 and n2o fluxes are still poorly understood as climate warms and lakes become more strongly stratified internal nutrient loads can increase lau et al 2020 stimulating the emergence of phytoplankton blooms woolway merchant 2019 and enabling more persistent co2 depletion at the surface and oxygen shortages at the bottom bartosiewicz et al 2019b proliferation of blooms in more strongly stratified waters can thus have major consequences for benthic om processing yan et al 2017 and planktonic food webs briland et al 2019 for example when the phytoplankton community is mainly composed of inedible biomass i e filamentous cyanobacteria a greater proportion of om tends to reach the sediments after a bloom carey et al 2012 strongly stimulating benthic respiration and methanogenesis in fact a positive relationship between the occurrence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms and ch4 flux was recently reported from lake taihu in china yan et al 2017 furthermore surface blooms themselves may enhance thermal shielding in the upper water column leading to bottom water cooling and prolonged anoxia creating conditions that could respectively reduce om processing and stimulate methanogenesis bartosiewicz et al 2019b therefore conditions that favor noxious blooms may also favor higher net ch4 fluxes the combined effects of climate warming and eutrophication have stimulated cyanobacteria and other bloom forming phytoplankton in lakes worldwide huisman et al 2018 heatwave associated thermal stratification tends to trigger these blooms and favor buoyant cyanobacteria jöhnk et al 2008 as regional extreme heat events are increasing in frequency around the globe perkins kirkpatrick lewis 2020 and phytoplankton blooms are becoming more severe gobler 2020 their combined influence has possible cascading repercussions on ghgs here we used observational data collected in the pelagial and littoral zones of a nutrient rich lake exposed to a spectrum of meteorological conditions including heatwaves to test the effects of hydrodynamic conditions on ghg storage and emissions we specifically looked at how these conditions brought changes in the phytoplankton community structure bloom dynamics and water column oxygenation and evaluated how these changes controlled the contribution of co2 ch4 and n2o to the cumulative warming potential of stored and released gases this natural experiment by comparing three years allowed to test if buoyant cyanobacterial blooms influenced the efficiency of om processing in the food web differentially than blooms by other phytoplankton and assess the associated production accumulation and efflux of ghgs in the pelagic and littoral zones of the lake methods study site lake st augustin 46 42 n 71 22 w fig 1 is a small shallow lake 0 62 km2 max depth 6 m classified as eutrophic to hypereutrophic summertime tp 20 160 µg l 1 and chl a 10 60 µg l 1 located on the outskirts of quebec city canada during the past two centuries this lake has been subjected to anthropogenic eutrophication deshpande et al 2014 leading to persistent phytoplankton blooms from 1960 onward blooms in lake saint augustin have been defined as periods when chl a concentrations exceed 20 µg l 1 and more than 80 of biomass is produced by one of the common bloom forming species i e glenodinium sp or dolichospermum sp the growing prevalence of cyanobacteria over the last two decades is in part due to an increase in water column stability and decrease in dissolved co2 availability under changing climate bartosiewicz et al 2019a littoral and pelagial zones

total of 950 ghg samples were collected between 2010 and 2012 concentrations of dissolved co2 ch4 and n2o were collected by equilibrating 2 l of lake water with 20 ml of ambient air after equilibration the headspace was sampled into 6 ml he purged pre evacuated exetainers labco limited uk for co2 and ch4 analyses triplicate samples and the collected gas was analyzed with a gas chromatograph varian 3800 equipped with a methanizer and a flame ionization detector separate samples were taken for n2o determination also in triplicates headspace samples were injected into 9 ml pre

9ml for ambient atmospheric n2o concentration measurements aqueous gas concentrations were obtained using henry s law and ambient water temperatures measured during the equilibration process global values of atmospheric partial pressures 400 ppm of co2 and 1 8 ppm of ch4 were used to determine the co2 and ch4 saturation levels while local measurements of atmospheric partial pressures were used

august and september 2012 n 54 in both the littoral and pelagial zones of the lake sediment profiling of ch4 porewater samples were collected in 2012 by in situ dialysis at a 1 cm vertical sampling

calculated using profile the modelled and measured concentrations of ch4 in the sediments were used to calculate the mass of this gas that accumulated in surface sediments by multiplying with respective volumes of porewater in the littoral and pelagial zones of the lake measured at 1 cm intervals results surface meteorology air temperatures over lake st augustin in 2010 and 2012 were on average warmer than in 2011 table 1 and well above the long term normal 17 9 c between 1948 and 2010 environment canada 2012 climate report the cooler summer of 2011 was also relatively wetter than those of 2010 and 2012 weather in 2010 was also characterized by mild winter 4 0 c above normal the warmest since 1948 followed by a warm spring temperatures reaching 25 c in april march to may average of 12 6 c compared to 7 7 c in 2011 average springtime temperature was also high in 2012 11 1 c and remained hot throughout the summer one of the major differences among years was the relative exposure to heatwaves when air above the lake warmed beyond the pre defined threshold of 31 c for at least 24h early in summer 2010 there were three heatwave days in june whereas during the summer of 2012 the lake was exposed to four consecutive atmospheric heatwaves for a total of 11 days in july and early august in 2011 there were no heatwaves recorded the lake warmed more at the surface in 2010 and 2012 as compared to 2011 with 2012 being the hottest on average table 1 bottom waters however remained cooler in 2010 and 2012 and coldest in 2012 calm conditions during heat events strongly enhanced stratification buoyancy frequency reaching 40 cph in surface waters and heat losses were noticeably low on calm hot nights i e 100 w m 2 during these heatwaves mixed layer deepening was suppressed and the heat retained at the surface thermally shielded its bottom the mechanistic explanation for the enhanced stratification upon warming in lake st augustin was recently provided in bartosiewicz et al 2019b oxygen conditions and nutrients the bottom waters of the lake 3 5 to 5 5 m were better ventilated in summer 2011 as compared to 2010 and 2012 table 1 figs 2 3 b likely as a function of higher precipitation and stronger nocturnal winds the oxygen concentrations in the water directly overlaying sediments dropped below 0 2 mg l 1 sensor detection limit by late july and early august in 2012 indicating that surface sediments likely became anoxic at that time in contrast to bottom waters surface oxygen concentrations were often well above saturation the highest values were measured during the phytoplankton blooms occurring in august 2010 and july 2012 reaching 150 of oxygen saturation differential stratification and oxygenation of the water column was reflected in differences between total and dissolved nutrient concentrations tn tp n no3 srp in fact total nutrient concentrations were respectively higher and dissolved were lower in the warmer years as compared to the average year except for n no3 in 2010 particularly when comparing 2012 with 2011 planktonic communities during years with heatwaves 2010 2012 cyanobacteria became more abundant in the lake as compared to the year without heatwaves 2011 fig 3a in 2010 for example an early biomass peak of buoyant filamentous cyanobacteria aphanizomenon sp occurred already in spring june accounting for as much as 72 of the total phytoplankton biomass reaching 54 mg of wet weight l 1 following this peak the phytoplankton community was dominated up to 99 by dinophytes that bloomed in mid summer and by diatoms in fall fig 3a in 2012 we observed a massive occurrence of cyanobacteria that accumulated at the surface of the lake between mid july and mid august high densities of aphanizomenon flos aquae and dolichospermum sp reaching 47 103 cells ml 1 up to 300 mg ww l 1 were moved inshore by the wind later in the summer where they likely settled to the bottom by contrast in 2011 the phytoplankton was dominated by diatoms in may 84 of 12 mg ww l 1 followed by dinophytes 97 of the 98 mg ww l 1 in june and july dinophytes together with diatoms formed an extensive bloom in the upper water column

surface waters were richer in ch4 than those offshore 0 64 and 0 37 µm p 0 001 and this was also true for n2o 1 1 and 0 73 nm p 0 001 ghg emissions co2 was released mostly through diffusion 99 with

d 1 table 2 thus surface waters acted as a sink for atmospheric co2 in the warmer summers fig 4 the overturn period subsequent to summertime blooms resulted in large co2 emission to the atmosphere in fact the efflux during the 2012 overturn period was 30 higher than the maximum co2 efflux measured in 2011 in contrast to the pelagial zone the littoral acted as a net co2 sink over this entire study

variability this difference was not significant anova p 0 09 the most striking difference among years was observed for the littoral zone where the year with cyanobacterial blooms showed an average

offshore n2o emissions reached 8 6 μmol m 2 d 1 in september 2011 overall however n2o emissions were highest from the littoral zone 2 0 μmol m 2 d 1 as compared to 1 4 μmol m 2 d 1 offshore p 0 03 t test water column inventory of ghgs carbon dioxide was the dominant ghg accumulating in lake waters in 2010 and 2011 accounting for as much as 59 and 66 of the total ecosystem scale efflux in co2 equivalents respectively with most of the remaining balance attributed to ch4 fig 3 in 2012 however it was ch4 that contributed most to the warming potential of the lake averaging 52 of the ecosystem scale efflux in co2 eq with the contribution from dissolved co2 decreasing to 46 the contribution from n2o albeit always small increased to 2 of total emissions during the hot summer of 2012 compared to less than 1 in 2010 and 2011 and was particularly high in the littoral zone the accumulation of ghgs in the water column of the littoral zone 2 m deep was proportional to its surface area 10 of the total lake area in 2010 i e up to 11 of co2 and ch4 up to 5 of n2o and 2011 up to 4 of co2 and up to 14 of ch4 by comparison shallow waters accumulated up to 20 of the total ch4 and 18 of the total n2o in 2012 the littoral zone contributed only about 6 of the warming potential of the lake over the three years of study despite the relatively high concentrations of ch4 and n2o measured there this relatively low contribution by the littoral zone during the hot summer was caused by the persistent co2 depletion that occurred there effects of cyanobacterial biomass on benthic ch4 the ch4 cumulating in surface sediments down to 0 05 m sampled only in 2012 increased by 2 to 5 times in the littoral and pelagial sediments respectively after the cyanobacterial bloom collapsed in late august fig 5 after the overturn period september the littoral sediments still stored considerable amounts of ch4 0 2 105 moles integrated over the entire zone but mainly in the subsurface 4 5 cm on the other hand the autumnal decrease of ch4 observed in the offshore sediments implies that at this time most of the accumulated gas in this section of the lake was already released or oxidized the average ch4 fluxes at the sediment water interface were 20 higher after the cyanobacterial bloom than before it occurred 3 2 and 2 7 mmol m 2 d 1 in september and july p 0 01 one way anova and almost three times higher in the littoral than in the pelagial sediments 2 9 and 1 0 mmol m 2 d 1 environmental controls on phytoplankton and relationship with ghgs the biomass of dinophytes correlated to bottom and surface temperatures as well as to surface ph and o2 levels but was inversely correlated to wind speeds and bottom o2 the biomass of diatoms was correlated to wind speeds and bottom o2 but was inversely correlated to surface temperatures the cyanobacterial biomass was correlated to surface temperatures and inversely to bottom o2 fig 6 table s1 the accumulation of co2 in the water column was correlated to bottom o2 concentrations to wind speeds and to diatom biomass fig 6a but inversely to surface o2 ph temperatures surface and bottom chl a and dinophyte biomass ch4 was positively correlated with water temperatures bottom and surface chl a and cyanobacterial biomass and negatively with bottom o2 n2o correlated to water temperatures surface and bottom the stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the combined effect of water temperatures and phytoplankton bloom composition explained a large fraction of the variability in ghgs accumulation fig 6 table 3 indeed the regression model which included stratification strength as the difference between surface and bottom water temperature and biomass of non cyanobacterial bloom formers diatoms and dinophytes explained 65 of the variability in water column co2 levels p 0 0001 in contrast 54 of the variability in ch4 accumulation was a function of surface water temperature and cyanobacterial biomass p 0 001 while changes in biomass of non cyanobacterial bloom formers did not improve the regression finally water temperature and stratification strength explained 43 of the variability in n2o p 0 005 discussion changes in phytoplankton bloom composition and timing influenced the warming potential of ghgs stored and released from lake st augustin thermal shielding during hot years resulted in cooler bottoms which likely diminished benthic processing through thermodynamic effects however the increase in ch4 efflux observed after the heatwaves i e enhanced by up to 10 times resulted from the large inputs of cyanobacterial biomass to sediments this higher deposition was also related to changes in the zooplankton community structure during the emergence of buoyant cyanobacteria with small zooplankters being apparently unable to efficiently graze the accumulated biomass in years with heatwaves the lake was warmer at the surface and persistently more strongly stratified in 2012 which resulted in a faster and sustained depletion of oxygen at the lake bottom as compared to 2011 these persistent low oxygen conditions set the stage for increased benthic ch4 production rates additionally enhanced due to freshly deposited biomass in 2012 the biomass production was also associated to a sustained uptake of atmospheric co2 by buoyant cyanobacteria accumulating at the surface these results imply that under eutrophic conditions the increased growth of buoyant filamentous cyanobacteria can stimulate benthic methanogenesis more than blooms of other phytoplankton specifically more edible dinophytes and diatoms through direct pulse inputs of om to anoxic sediments effects of surface meteorology on phytoplankton blooms and consequences for ghgs phytoplankton phenology and community structure in lake st augustin differed across studied years springtime warming in 2010 resulted in an early peak of cyanobacteria followed by dinophytes and diatoms emerging when the lake was mixing relatively frequently during that summer wet and cool spring to summer transition in 2011 resulted in a community dominated by dinophytes with emergence of abundant diatoms later in the season hot and dry conditions in 2012 resulted in an early peak of dinophytes that were then replaced by cyanobacteria when the lake remained stratified for relatively long periods of time interannual differences in phytoplankton community structure and biomass patterns despite sustained elevated nutrient concentrations among years table 1 suggest that eutrophication alone will not necessarily stimulate cyanobacterial blooms huang et al 2020 our observations in lake st augustin suggest that it is the combined influence of eutrophication and stronger stratification as a function of warming that triggers cyanobacterial blooms in shallow eutrophic lakes this influence is expected to become even stronger under the future climate bartosiewicz et al 2019a consequences of eutrophication were suggested to enhance the warming potential of gases emitted from temperate lakes through stimulated ch4 and n2o fluxes delsontro et al 2018 here we provide evidence that such effects are influenced by phytoplankton community structure as well as the timing and composition of seasonal blooms since cyanobacterial blooms are likely to proliferate as climate warms huisman et al 2018 faster heat absorption within their buoyant biomass may stimulate stratification and reduce downward oxygen transport kumagai et al 2000 the onset of anoxia favors om processing towards ch4 vachon et al 2019 thus the carbon absorbed from the atmosphere by cyanobacteria i e uptake of up to 30 mmol co2 m 2 d 1 in lake st augustin may later fuel methanogenesis at the bottom this results from the inefficient processing i e impaired grazing bednarska and dawidowicz 2007 of filamentous cyanobacteria by zooplankton in lake st augustin the large and efficient zooplankters i e from the genus daphnia sp disappeared during and after the heatwaves when filamentous cyanobacteria became abundant it follows that in the absence of grazing cyanobacterial biomass was largely deposited to the sediments and increased benthic ch4 fluxes and storage fig 5 while in many lakes ch4 is known to be released mostly through ebullition aben et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 the compact and clayed pelagial sediments in lake st augustin apparently did not catalyze intense ch4 bubbling in fact ebullition became important only in association to cyanobacterial blooms up to 25 of total ch4 efflux in the pelagic zone while our sampling design does not account for all possible point source ebullition events wik et al 2013 detection of higher ebullition rates up to 75 of the total efflux in the organic rich littoral sediments oc 20 supports that ch4 bubbling in this lake is controlled by sediment characteristics indeed while warming catalyzed persistently high ch4 efflux from shallow sediments it was the combination of strong stratification and input of cyanobacterial biomass that triggered high ch4 ebullition in the pelagial zone after the bloom had collapsed the synergy between warming and eutrophication that may stimulate ch4 ebullition aben et al 2017 davidson et al 2018 appears as strongly variable in nature and as implied by our observations depends on the patterns of biomass re distribution after blooms these patterns will be particularly critical for buoyant biomass of filamentous bloom formers that is often moved inshore by winds and deposited to sediments in the littoral zone warming was also shown to influence activation energies during om degradation and enhance the proportion of primary production released as ch4 durocher et al 2011 2014 however and counterintuitively bottom waters and offshore sediments of lake st augustin remained relatively cold during summer with heatwaves the enhanced water column stratification leading to this cooling bartosiewicz et al 2019b was also conductive to co2 depletion at the surface and expansion of anoxia at the bottom arguably the exact outcome of such opposing effects on net ch4 efflux where bottom cooling slows down om processing on the one hand and higher om inputs enhance benthic methanogenesis on the other will vary with lake morphometry and food web structure our study however provides a first line of support for the importance of phytoplankton bloom composition as a driver of ch4 production with cyanobacterial dominance increasing its contribution to the overall warming potential of ghgs produced and emitted by a shallow lake ecosystem spatiotemporally variable effects of phytoplankton blooms on ghgs ecosystem scale effects of heatwaves in 2012 generated about 28 103 moles co2 equivalent as compared to 31 103 moles co2 equivalent in 2011 this relatively small difference results mostly from the negative contribution of co2 up taken by buoyant cyanobacteria in 2012 despite high uptake rates at the surface co2 still remained important ghg stored and released from the water column during both years however while the massive dinophyte bloom was not conducive to persistent co2 depletion in 2011 the combination of strong stratification and emergent buoyant cyanobacterial bloom in 2012 lead to a persistent co2 undersaturation throughout the upper waters this was not simply an effect of scale as the dinophyte bloom in 2011 lasted longer and produced higher biomass than the cyanobacterial bloom in the following summer noticeably shallow littoral zones of the lake represented larger and mostly continuous sink for co2 as compared to the less consistent uptake in the pelagial zones this may have resulted from the wind driven concentration of buoyant cyanobacteria in the nearshore areas and from sustained co2 consumption by submerged macrophytes i e myriophyllum sp vallisneria americana in support of our initial idea when co2 was depleted ch4 became the most important ghg in terms of co2 eq during summer with heatwaves and after the collapse of cyanobacterial blooms however while pelagial ch4 flux increased by only 20 littoral emissions did so by 50 this raises the need to closely consider the spatiotemporal nature of phytoplankton productivity effects on ghgs emissions in lakes observed differences between pelagial and littoral zones may have emerged through stimulation of specific methanogens in near shore sediments or from the relatively stronger vertical mixing in the shallows that limited the time window available for methane oxidation mayr et al 2020 the globally increasing frequency of heatwaves perkins kirkpatrick and lewis 2020 will influence hydrodynamics differently in deep and shallow waters periods of intense warming and water column stabilization will apparently enhance rates of atmospheric co2 uptake but can also strongly stimulate ch4 and n2o emissions in the shallows to improve future predictions and upscaled calculations particular attention should be paid on where and what type of biomass is processed to ghgs during and after phytoplankton blooms lake morphometry thus becomes an important characteristic to factor in when estimating emissions at the scale of a lake rates of ch4 release from the pelagial sediments were lower than diffusion at the water surface in early summer 2012 i e 0 5 mmol m 2 d 1 as compared to 1 8 mmol m 2 d 1 this difference may be indicative of ch4 production within the well oxygenated upper water column delsontro et al 2018 and or transport of ch4 rich waters from the littoral zone encinas fernández et al 2016 the difference between benthic and surface ch4 effluxes later in summer 2 6 mmol m 2 d 1 compared to 1 3 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively suggests that ch4 oxidation in the water column was responsible for removal of about 50 of ch4 from the pelagial zone and 40 from the littoral zone sediment profiles reveal surficial decreases in ch4 concentrations particularly important in the littoral sediments fig 5 lower panels this may indicate zone of anaerobic ch4 oxidation in surface sediments martinez cruz et al 2018 noticeably the ch4 concentrations decreased by 90 to 95 from 3 to 1 cm below the sediment surface in the pelagial and littoral zone respectively the efficiency of this ch4 consumption was reduced after the cyanobacterial bloom collapsed as ch4 concentrations decreased respectively only by 45 to 72 speculatively this may indicate a reduction in rates of anaerobic methanotrophy under om enriched conditions when fermenting bacteria become relatively more active yang et al 2019 our study reveals large interannual seasonal and spatial variability in n2o concentrations and fluxes in contrast to ch4 and despite relatively large amounts of n2o accumulated over the hot summer 2012 table 1 the mean efflux of this potent ghg was higher during the rainy year 2011 indeed the largest n2o release was observed in the littoral zone following strong autumnal rainfall suggesting the potentially important role of allochthonous inputs and or water intrusions in the production and release of n2o while the overall contribution from n2o in co2 eq can be considered negligible in this lake its production was strongly enhanced in the shallow zones and correlated to the deposition of bloom biomass into littoral sediments while ch4 and co2 fluxes appeared as coupled with ch4 increasing and co2 decreasing respectively during and after each phytoplankton bloom event n2o fluxes were rather decoupled from these other ghgs and related to allochthonous processes i e rainfall in the catchment fig 6b interestingly during winter 2011 and 2012 data not shown we have recorded peaks in n2o concentrations with integrated mass reaching twice as much as during the summertime maximum such wintertime accumulation with potentially rapid release upon ice breakups has also been reported from multiple boreal lakes in canada soued et al 2016 this indicates the need for better resolved studies on n2o dynamic in aquatic systems aiming to identify hot emission moments of this potent ghg that can be apparently distinct from those reported for ch4 and co2 there has been an exponential increase in the number of studies reporting ghg emission rates from lakes over the last two decades see selected recent work in table 4 this rapidly growing literature unequivocally supports that lakes are important sources of co2 ch4 and n2o to the atmosphere and that both warming and eutrophication strongly influence fluxes of these gases from sediments and throughout the water column most recent work has focused on determining environmental controls on ch4 and n2o the two more potent ghgs rather than on co2 a number of field experimental and modelling efforts established further that warming enhances ch4 flux more strongly than co2 flux likely as a consequence of more favorable conditions for methanogens arising under warmer ambient temperature table 4 when assessed in combination eutrophication and warming was suggested to act synergistically to change the magnitude of ghgs effluxes from lakes table 4 in light of this literature survey and our own work we argue that understanding the effects of phytoplankton bloom characteristics and resulting food web changes directly controlled by eutrophication and warming is needed to fully appreciate and predict ghg fluxes in freshwaters our work provides the first comprehensive assessment of how phytoplankton bloom composition and phenology influenced by local climate and eutrophication affects ghgs furthermore the novel mechanism of enhanced ch4 production mediated through the sedimentation of cyanobacterial bloom potentially represents a positive climate cyanobacteria methane feedback that has important implications for future predictions on global ghgs budget indeed if warming and eutrophication lead to further proliferation of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes proportionally higher ch4 production even if from recently fixed co2 may lead to an accelerated atmospheric warming through enhanced emissions from lakes conclusions spatiotemporal variability in ghg production accumulation and release from a small nutrient rich lake was shown to depend on the type and phenology of phytoplankton blooms our novel results suggest that proliferation of buoyant filamentous blooms stimulated by warming and water column stability can result in enhanced ch4 production and fluxes at the expense of co2 if correct we expect a positive feedback amplifying both processes i e climate warming and noxious blooms through globally raising ch4 levels we also evidence that despite the cooling occurring at depth benthic ch4 emissions increased through a synergy between anoxia and higher pulse biomass deposition this effect boosted ch4 fluxes both at the sediment water and at the water atmosphere interfaces effects of eutrophication and higher production on ch4 flux are not however necessarily linear as increasing biomass produced under nutrient rich conditions can be processed efficiently to co2 through trophic transfer and respiration such as for lake st augustin in 2011 for future climate warming projections it will be important to consider the emerging synergies between effects on water temperatures stratification strength and oxygenation bloom phenology and composition as well as patterns of carbon transfer in the food web understanding interactive effects between phytoplankton production and consumption as well as planktonic om redistribution into different carbon pools including ch4 from sediments into the overlaying waters appears crucial to accurately predict the role of lakes in the

17066,livestock wastewater lw typically contains a substantial amount of nh4 that can potentially be recovered and used in fertilizers or chemicals in an attempt to recover nh4 from lw a novel electrochemical approach using a gas diffusion electrode gde was developed and its efficacy was demonstrated in this study the gde based electrochemical device when operated at an air flow rate of 20 ml min was free of back diffusion flux which is a fatal drawback of any membrane based nh4 separation approach continuous operation resulted in a nitrogen flux of 890 g n m2d with synthetic lw and 770 g n m2d with real lw at a current density of 10 ma cm2 the electrochemical energy input was 7 42 kwh kg n with synthetic lw and 9 44 kwh kg n with real lw compared with the traditional stripping method the gde based electrochemical system has a certain potential to be competitive in terms of energy consumption for instance a rough cost estimate based only on operating costs regarding chemical usage air blowing and water pumping revealed that the system consumed 13 44 kwh kg n whereas the conventional stripper required 27 6 kwh kg n this analysis showed that an electrochemical approach such as our gde based method can recover nh3 particularly in gaseous form from lw in addition with the future development of a smart operation method as proposed and demonstrated in this study the cost effective implementation of a gde based method is feasible graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemical system gas diffusion electrode ammonia recovery livestock wastewater ammonia stripping 1 introduction ammonia nh3 an essential nutrient for biological metabolism is also considered a future carbon free energy carrier it is produced primarily through the energy intensive haber bosch process 35 50 mj kg n which consumes as much as 2 of the world s total energy and is responsible for approximately 1 6 of global co2 emissions hou et al 2018 xie et al 2016 the major commercial application of total ammonia nitrogen tan is as a nitrogen based fertilizer and approximately 30 of applied fertilizer is eventually transported into a wastewater stream bartels 2008 verstraete et al 2009 such dramatic tan runoff not only adversely affects the bioactivity of microorganisms involved in anaerobic digestion but also causes eutrophication and other environmental problems chen et al 2008 hou et al 2018 mainstream technologies for treating tan rely ultimately on converting it to n2 from a treatment standpoint these methods are highly effective and mature however from the perspective of resource recovery these technologies are inadequate furthermore they do not address the potentially fatal issue of releasing n2o a greenhouse gas recovery instead of removal is a better and necessary approach it can be and has been carried out using physical and chemical approaches such as nh3 stripping ion exchange and precipitation booker et al 1999 deng et al 2014 uludag demirer et al 2008 yuan et al 2016 these methods however are associated with critical caveats such as large energy requirements and high costs associated with the consumption or regeneration of chemicals ion exchange though selective in a general sense can also absorb unwanted cations present in wastewater resulting in effluents that do not meet product quality standards for downstream applications hou et al 2018 precipitation products especially struvite often require the addition of other components which themselves are also pollutants yuan et al 2016 nh3 stripping is a superior approach in many aspects yet lacks economic competitiveness blowing heated air and supplying alkaline chemicals are expensive operations deng et al 2016 the aforementioned issues can be avoided if an electrochemical method is adopted for recovery desloover et al 2015 2012 lee et al 2020 luther et al 2015 with the electrochemical approach an external dc voltage applied to a simple electrochemical cell such as a cation exchange membrane cem based two chamber electrochemical cell induces water electrolysis producing protons on the anode and hydroxyl ions on the cathode the protonated tan molecules i e ammonium ions nh4 which act as a proton shuttle cord ruwisch et al 2011 are transported from the anode compartment to the cathode through the cem because of the electrochemical field and the concentration gradient in the cathode compartment the nh4 ions are deprotonated to nh3 which can be rather easily recovered using an existing method such as stripping lee et al 2020 utilized this electrodialysis ed system for continuous tan separation and accumulation from livestock wastewater lw at high current density fed batch operation using real lw resulted in a very high degree of tan accumulation up to 17 704 mg n l pilot scale tan recovery using an ed was also tested by ward et al 2018 the maximum achievable total nh3 concentration was approximately 7100 mg n l however this approach requires an additional tan separation process in the catholyte one such technology that stands out is direct separation by transmembrane chemisorption tmcs in this approach nh3 generated from nh4 that has migrated to and been deprotonated at the cathode is recovered in pure form in an acidic solution via a gas permeable hydrophobic tubular membrane recently tan has successfully been recovered by a combination of the ed with tmcs daguerre martini et al 2018 kuntke et al 2016 rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 tarpeh et al 2018 tarpeh et al 2018 achieved 92 7 tan recovery from real urine using an electrochemical approach with tmcs moreover kuntke et al 2017 investigated a hydrogen recycling electrochemical system hres with h2 recycled as an anodic reactant enabling energy efficient tan recovery moreover this system was further improved kuntke et al 2018a in other recent work bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed was adopted for this purpose rodrigues et al 2020 van linden et al 2020 yan et al 2020 2018 the bipolar membrane is known to enhance the splitting of water into h and oh and thus ion migration without extraneous addition ran et al 2017 reported that the theoretical energy consumption for water dissociation in bmed is 79 9 kj mol which is far lower than that of the electrolysis process this system was recently applied for tan recovery in connection with tmcs and achieved recovery of 70 rodrigues et al 2020 yan et al 2020 proposed a chemical free method for nh3 recovery by way of coupling bmed with a hollow fiber membrane contactor yan et al 2020 2018 in this system the dissociated h ions and oh ions from the bipolar membrane are referred to as input chemicals for the absorption solution and tan they reported that without any addition of chemicals 99 of tan was recovered in the form of nh4 2so4 however all these membrane based approaches are prone to back diffusion dykstra et al 2014 tarpeh et al 2018 whereas nh3 may well diffuse through the gas permeable hydrophobic membrane but at the same time it can back diffuse through cem limiting tan accumulation in the acidic solution although the use of highly concentrated nh3 can substantially lessen the burden of energy intensive stripping it also accelerates back diffusion therefore the key to success using this system is to remove nh3 from the cathode compartment as soon as it is produced as a solution to the aforementioned problem we herein propose a new electrochemical system es based on a gas diffusion electrode gde or gde es and examine its capacity for tan removal using lw the unique feature of this system lies in the carbon based gde through which o2 which functions as an electron acceptor is effectively supplied in the form of flowing air and on which redox reactions occur in addition the physically and chemically isolated cathodic compartment which is a very narrow space between the cem and gde allows a highly alkaline condition to be maintained so that the transported nh4 is immediately converted to nh3 and thus stripped by the supplied airflow without requiring an independent stripping step because of the thin and porous nature of the gde and the extremely short distance from it to the cem the reaction is sufficiently fast to enable effective nh3 stripping the use of air is an additional advantage in that the molecular o2 in air serves as an electron acceptor and thereby lowers the total cell voltage when o2 is adopted as an electron acceptor i e the oxygen reduction reaction orr is induced the theoretically required standard cell potential is estimated to be only 0 828 v according to the following redox half reactions anode oer o2 4h 4e 2h2o 1 229 v vs she cathode orr o2 2h2o 4e 4oh 0 401 v vs she on the other hand the cell potential on the basis of the hydrogen evolution reaction her is substantially higher 2 06 v according to the following reactions anode oer o2 4h 4e 2h2o 1 229 v vs she cathode her 2h2o 2e h2 2oh 0 828 v vs she it is therefore theoretically plausible that the use of air as a cathodic reactant lowers total cell voltage and hence save energy in addition to this advantage regarding energy the air flow serves as an nh3 stripper the specific objectives of the present study were to explore an underlying tan recovery mechanism and in so doing investigate the determining factors for optimal operation particular attention was devoted to the effects of the air supply on tan migration and the energy requirement the advantageous use of air was initially demonstrated with synthetic lw in a batch setup and afterward with real lw in continuous mode finally an overall evaluation of operating costs including chemicals heating spraying and air blowing was carried out to highlight the economic competitiveness of the gde es 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrochemical cell and operations as presented in fig 1 a gde es was constructed for tan separation from waste sources pt and a gde were used as the counter and working electrodes respectively the effective area of each electrode was 1 cm2 each compartment was separated by a cem nafion 117 dupont for nh4 migration the anodic compartment was situated between the anode and cem but the cathodic one was continuously emptied so as to maintain a highly nh3 concentrated condition to minimize any possible resistance to the transport of nh4 through the cem the nafion 117 membrane was immersed in a 3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 solution at 80 c for 1 h to eliminate impurities then it was rinsed in deionized water diw and incubated at 80 c in diw for 2 h the treated membrane was subsequently rinsed in diw incubated at 80 c in 0 5 m h2so4 for 1 h and immersed in a 30 wt nh3 aqueous solution for 1

waste sources in a direct effective manner we developed a novel gde es and confirmed its efficacy isotope analysis was conducted with synthetic lw in batch mode which allowed confirmation that electrochemistry was the real driver of the tan recovery figure s1 the gas to liquid ratio is a determining factor with respect to nh3 stripping this is because a sufficiently high air flow rate ensures that an adequate nh3 concentration gradient is maintained between the head and liquid spaces arogo et al 1999 gustin and marinsek logar 2011 quan et al 2009 to determine if the gas to liquid ratio was also a determining factor in the case of the gde es the air flow rate was varied from 5 to 20 ml min when tan was electrochemically transported and its concentration in the anolyte was lowered we expected it to accumulate in the h2so4 absorbent solution in a quantitative manner however this result was not observed experimentally the electro oxidation of tan also did not likely occur given that it tends to take place at ph levels higher than 8 figure s2 as shown in fig 2 at an air flow rate of 20 ml min most of the tan transported from the anolyte was recovered in the h2so4 solution after 4 h only 1 3 remained in the cell in contrast 31 26 7 and 6 6 of the tan remained in the cell at an air flow rate of 5 10 and 15 ml min respectively this result was reflected in the recovery efficiency 56 64 91 and 98 at the air flow rate of 5 10 15 and 20 ml min respectively fig 3 a equation s1 a similar behavior was observed with respect to current density where the amount of tan in the anolyte decreased by 0 3 0 31 0 32 and 0 34 mmol at air flow rates of 5 10 15 and 20 ml min fig 3b at low air flows the supplied air might be insufficient to reach all of the regions of the gde resulting in a substantial portion of the tan not being stripped in particular among ones deprotonated upon being transported fig 3c for instance at the air flow rates of 5 and 10 ml min a certain amount of nh3 remained in the cell fig 2 fig 3c this incomplete stripping appeared to affect adversely the overall efficiency in a way that gave rise to back diffusion as with any electrochemical system the current density was an important factor affecting performance as evident in fig 4 the nitrogen flux from the anolyte to h2so4 j ah was directly proportional to the current density at different air flow rates 10 15 or 20 ml min the exception was a nonlinear curve corresponding to the lowest air flow rate 5 ml min which might be too low to remove all of the tan from the cell as shown in fig 2 an increase of tan in the h2so4 solution was initially delayed for the first hour indicating that it was accumulating inside the cell to a certain level under each airflow condition after which it was stripped out however as shown in fig 4 migration and diffusion flux were maximally facilitated at a low current density 10 ma cm2 possibly due to a relatively constant tan level in the feed anolyte because of this tan was detected within 30 min this phenomenon gave rise to the linear increase of jah with respect to current density because an identical amount of tan was rapidly accumulated in the cell at a high current density 40 ma cm2 tan rapidly migrated to the cathode side to the full extent that could be readily stripped out because of this general linear trend between jah and current density the final flux showed dramatic differences especially at 40 ma cm2 where j ah was 586 828 1325 and 1766 g n m2d at the air flow rate of 5 10 15 and 20 ml min respectively the nonlinear behavior of j ah with respect to current density at the air flow rate of 5 ml min might be caused by back diffusion this is when nh3 moves back to the anode side because of the rapid formation of a steep concentration gradient at such a low air flow rate this phenomenon became more prominent at high current densities 3 2 effect of air supply as an electron acceptor air played a dual role in our system as an nh3 stripping gas and an electron acceptor the latter was particularly advantageous from the perspective of energy consumption given that the system is electrochemical electrochemical methods of tan recovery have long been considered a promising option and the production of hydroxyl ions via cathodic water electrolysis i e the hydrogen evolution reaction her has typically been the goal with such systems under similar conditions the orr is more energetically favorable than the her for instance under alkaline conditions the theoretical her redox potential is 0 8277 v vs a standard hydrogen electrode she whereas the orr redox potential is 0 401 v vs she to determine if this theoretical but seemingly substantial benefit was indeed realized in practice we conducted a series of experiments using air as an electron acceptor because of the aforementioned technical difficulty of tan being trapped between the cem and gde the nitrogen flux from the anolyte to the catholyte j ac was used as an indirect performance indicator instead of being a direct indicator of flux from the anolyte to h2so4 j ah fig 5 a shows the nitrogen flux and electrochemical energy requirements with various gasses n2 air and o2 the j ah was almost identical in all cases n2 902 4 g n m2d air 883 2 g n m2d and o2 907 2 g n m2d even though the o2 concentration in n2 air and o2 gasses varied 0 21 and 100 respectively the rate of tan migration and diffusion remained similar because the operation was conducted at the same current density electrochemical energy consumption however was meaningfully different 9 56 7 47 and 7 23 kwh kg n for n2 air and o2 respectively under the anoxic condition with n2 only the her appeared to have priority at the cathode resulting in a higher cell potential than those achieved with air and o2 lsv experiments supported this finding the onset potential was 0 4 v when air or o2 was supplied orr but 1 3 v when n2 her was supplied fig 5b when air was used similar overall cell overpotentials were observed during cell operation figs 5b 5c even though the o2 concentration was only 21 3 3 back diffusion during gde based electrochemical operation we found that the gde es for tan recovery was prone to back diffusion j ca j ac that is there was nh3 flux from the catholyte back into the anolyte when a dc voltage was applied between the two electrodes tan could be transported desirably to the cathode side via migration and diffusion but and also undesirably back to the anolyte via back diffusion the j ac with a two chambered es was 1170 g n m2d which is higher than those achieved using the gde es 605 641 670 and 773 g n m2d at the air flow rate of 5 10 15 and 20 ml min respectively fig 6 c according to fick s law the diffusion flux is proportional to the diffusion coefficient and the concentration gradient in the gde es nh3 likely accumulated in the small space on the cathode side as soon as it passed through the cem fig 6a therefore the back diffusion flux might be worsened if nh3 to air contact is less effective such as at a low gas flow rate however the two chambered es was constantly filled with catholyte and the concentration gradient remained low even with nh3 migration from the anolyte thus the back diffusion flux was less prominent fig 6b the largest back diffusion flux j ca was measured under open circuit conditions using the gde when the air flow rate was 5 ml min the j ca was 398 g n m2d j ac 398 g n m2d however the j ca gradually decreased with increasing air flow rate 235 192 and 163 g n m2d at the air flow rate of 10 15 and 20 ml min respectively fig 6c a high airflow appeared to limit back diffusion because of the fast stripping of nh3 from the system the back diffusion of nh3 was unavoidable especially if a very high concentration of nh3 remained as was the case under alkaline conditions yet air stripping requires this very condition the apparent advantage of a two chambered system without the presence of gde to limit back diffusion pales in comparison with the supplementary cost of a post treatment process such as nh3 stripping 3 4 continuous tan recovery via the gde based system tan recovery was continuously monitored with either synthetic or real lw at an air flow rate of 20 ml min for 24 h as shown in fig 7 a the final concentration of tan was 8960 and 7570 mg l with the synthetic and real lw respectively when nh3 n was recovered by gde es from the real lw the nitrogen flux to h2so4 j ah decreased the j ah was 890 g n m2d with the synthetic lw and 770 g n m2d with the real lw this discrepancy might arise from the intrinsic differences of the two solutions rather than from back diffusion when the batch operation was conducted for 30 min the transference number of nh4 with the synthetic lw was 0 7 whereas that with the real lw was 0 58 these results well reflect the j ac values of 883 2 g n m2d with synthetic lw and 736 8 g n m2d with real lw fig 7b in the real lw various monovalent and multivalent ions such as k na ca2 and mg2 typically coexisted in large concentrations although nh4 was the primary charge carrier these cations could also act as major charge carriers in our case k na and ca2 were predominant in the real lw table s1 and the concentrations of multivalent ions decreased after the cell was operated in this experiment k was found to be one of the most influential ions its transference number was 0 15 this undesirable ionic migration might lead to a decrease in the nitrogen flux and to a lower transference number of nh4 the migration of other cations also affected the gde es overpotential as shown in figure s3 a constant overpotential was maintained with the synthetic lw 2 75 v for 24 h whereas it increased from 2 8 to 4 09 v after 12 h of operation with the real lw this change was attributed to ions precipitating on the surface of the gde when the real lw was used this interpretation is supported by the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy mapping images in fig 8 unlike the pt c catalyst in the electrode used for 24 h with the synthetic lw the catalyst in the electrode used with the real lw was coated with k and ca2 deposits k is regarded as being an ion that competes with nh4 particularly because of its comparatively high concentration in the real lw ca2 though present at a low concentration easily precipitated as ca oh 2 under alkaline conditions both processes contributed to the increased cell overpotential the electrochemical energy input for the real lw was 9 44 kwh kg n whereas that for the synthetic lw was 7 42 kwh kg n equation s5 3 5 comparison of energy consumption to find out possible sources of the energy loss voltage was analyzed during the electrochemical operation in a detailed way theoretical thermodynamic cell voltage ethermo a potential difference between the cathodic and anodic reactions is constant if the anodic and cathodic phs are 7 and 14 respectively the two chambered es with oer at the anode and her at the cathode has 1 65 v whereas gde es with oer at anode and orr at the cathode has 0 41 v table s2 equations s7 s11 total cell voltage etotal actually measured however was found to be quite different from them mainly due to overpotentials associated with the internal potential losses fig 9 a at the current density of 10 ma cm2 the 2 chambered es ended in etotal of 4 25 v and the gde es of 2 72 v though this difference was considerable the internal potential loss remained similar and high for the two overpotential was 2 61 v with the 2 chambered es and 2 31 v with the gde es this kind of energy loss is known to be a lump sum result of anodic overpotential ηanode cathodic overpotential ηcathode ionic potential loss eionic and transport potential loss through the membrane emembrane kuntke et al 2017 kuntke et al 2018a b nguyen and dinh 2020 equations s12 s17 as shown in fig 9b an overpotential that singularly stood out while all the others had similar values for both configurations had to do with sort of the cathodic reaction her in 2 chambered es and orr in gde es the anode overpotential which is linked with oer was a main contributor to the voltage loss in both cases 1 33 v in 2 chambered es and 1 32 v in gde es and the cathode overpotential ionic and transport potential loss were all relatively small the main voltage loss taking place in the anode was usually associated with deactivation and diffusion losses at the catalyst kuntke et al 2017 this is often exacerbated in using lw as anolyte as it is highly likely to contain a great deal of oxidative reaction potential the anodic energy lost in the gde es amounted to 3 56 kwh kg n which was substantially greater than that in the 2 chambered es 2 67 kwh kg n fig 9c this was caused by the back diffusion which lowered nitrogen flux resulting in an electro energy disadvantage energy consumption for tan recovery via gde es was also compared with that of recovery via the nh3 stripping method fig 9d which is the most well developed recovery approach limoli et al 2016 the gde es requires energy for 1 air supply 2 electricity for tan separation with ph control 3 h2so4 supply and 4 water pumping nh3 stripping requires energy for 1 air supply 2 ph control 3 h2so4 supply 4 heating and 5 nozzle spraying maurer et al 2003 reported that the energy required for the nh3 stripping process is 7 3 kwh kg n for air supply 3 87 kwh kg n for ph control and 2 14 kwh kg n for h2so4 consumption the minimum heating energy for the nh3 stripping process was calculated to be 10 4 kwh kg n on the basis of experimental data gustin and marinsek logar 2011 equation s18 s21 joseph and beachler 1998 reported that the liquid inlet pressure for a nozzle spray tower typically ranges between 0 7 to 28 bar assuming the nozzle spray was operated at a midpoint pressure of 13 7 bar the energy requirement was calculated to be 3 9 kwh kg n with a range from 0 01 kwh kg n 0 7 bar to 16 33 kwh kg n 28 bar equation s22 29 as a result the total energy consumption for tan recovery with the stripping method was estimated to be 27 6 kwh kg n with the midpoint pressure 23 71 kwh kg n with nozzle pressure of 0 7 bar and 40 03 kwh kg n with 28 bar the gde es consumed the most energy for ph control 9 44 kwh kg n along with 1 72 kwh kg n for air supply 2 14 kwh kg n for h2so4 and 0 14 kwh kg n for water pumping the total energy consumption was estimated to be 13 44 kwh kg n equation s5 s29 s33 maurer et al 2003 this rather rough estimation shows that the application of the gde es could potentially reduce energy consumption at least on a lab scale by 43 to 66 compared with conventional technology as shown in table s3 various studies related to electrochemical tan recovery have been conducted and its applicability was demonstrated at a pilot scale as well tan recovery was successfully investigated at pilot scale by ward et al 2018 nitrogen flux was 1008 g n m2d with an electrochemical energy input of 4 8 kwh kg n however it requires an additional cost intensive separation process for the recovery of pure nh3 more recently van linden et al 2020 adopted bmed and demonstrated efficient tan recovery with lower electrochemical energy consumption 5 28 kwh kg n a recent trend for tan recovery is to use electrochemistry in combination with a series of membranes further studies using bmed in combination with a hollow fiber membrane contactor hfmc showed pure tan recovery in the form of nh4 2so4 yan et al 2020 2018 for efficient recovery however wastewater had to be utilized as a catholyte so that its ph always maintained up to 9 on the other hand rodrigues et al 2020 positively recovered solely separated nh3 from feed to catholyte 819 1 g n m2d using a hybrid bmed tmcs system with less electrochemical energy 5 08 kwh kg n a result with the es tmcs approach was also reported by tarpeh et al 2018 although our gde es was inferior in terms of j ah 770 vs 1010 g n m2d it was indeed substantially superior in terms of energy consumption 9 44 vs 30 6 kwh kg n all these current technologies facilitated the best performance for liquid phase of nh3 in addition concerning the recovery of pure nh3 the tmcs based technology can function without requiring additional energy at least in the electrochemical part of the method however the captured species are ions nh4 rather than charge neutral molecules nh3 and thus require an additional and normally costly stripping step by contrast in the case of gde es a simple air supply which has to be implemented in the stripping step enables the nitrogen flux to be controlled as well in a concomitant manner 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrated gde es to be an effective method for the selective recovery of active nitrogen from waste sources especially with respect to cost effectiveness a very narrow space between the cem and gde which serves to concentrate nh3 to a great extent and the supplied air which acts both as a cell potential lowering electron acceptor and as ammonia stripping flow makes it possible to recover gaseous ammonia from wastewaters effectively hence electrochemical energy input was 9 56 kwh kg n with synthetic lw under an anaerobic condition but was lower 7 47 kwh kg n under an aerobic condition the continuous operation resulted in a nitrogen flux of 770 g n m2d with real lw at a current density of 10 ma cm2 and with electrochemical energy of 9 44 kwh kg n this otherwise promising technology however was found to be prone to have penalties 1 back diffusion caused by highly concentrated nh3 and 2 precipitate formation e g ca oh 2 on the cathode which occurred due to co migration of cations under the same electrochemical force although the concept demonstrated in this study can be regarded as a promising option for the future many more studies are needed to develop appropriate methods to either prevent or eliminate back diffusion and fouling an equally important and challenging issue namely the scaling up of the gde es also needs to be addressed if and only if these issues are resolved the innovative system proposed in this

17066,livestock wastewater lw typically contains a substantial amount of nh4 that can potentially be recovered and used in fertilizers or chemicals in an attempt to recover nh4 from lw a novel electrochemical approach using a gas diffusion electrode gde was developed and its efficacy was demonstrated in this study the gde based electrochemical device when operated at an air flow rate of 20 ml min was free of back diffusion flux which is a fatal drawback of any membrane based nh4 separation approach continuous operation resulted in a nitrogen flux of 890 g n m2d with synthetic lw and 770 g n m2d with real lw at a current density of 10 ma cm2 the electrochemical energy input was 7 42 kwh kg n with synthetic lw and 9 44 kwh kg n with real lw compared with the traditional stripping method the gde based electrochemical system has a certain potential to be competitive in terms of energy consumption for instance a rough cost estimate based only on operating costs regarding chemical usage air blowing and water pumping revealed that the system consumed 13 44 kwh kg n whereas the conventional stripper required 27 6 kwh kg n this analysis showed that an electrochemical approach such as our gde based method can recover nh3 particularly in gaseous form from lw in addition with the future development of a smart operation method as proposed and demonstrated in this study the cost effective implementation of a gde based method is feasible graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemical system gas diffusion electrode ammonia recovery livestock wastewater ammonia stripping 1 introduction ammonia nh3 an essential nutrient for biological metabolism is also considered a future carbon free energy carrier it is produced primarily through the energy intensive haber bosch process 35 50 mj kg n which consumes as much as 2 of the world s total energy and is responsible for approximately 1 6 of global co2 emissions hou et al 2018 xie et al 2016 the major commercial application of total ammonia nitrogen tan is as a nitrogen based fertilizer and approximately 30 of applied fertilizer is eventually transported into a wastewater stream bartels 2008 verstraete et al 2009 such dramatic tan runoff not only adversely affects the bioactivity of microorganisms involved in anaerobic digestion but also causes eutrophication and other environmental problems chen et al 2008 hou et al 2018 mainstream technologies for treating tan rely ultimately on converting it to n2 from a treatment standpoint these methods are highly effective and mature however from the perspective of resource recovery these technologies are inadequate furthermore they do not address the potentially fatal issue of releasing n2o a greenhouse gas recovery instead of removal is a better and necessary approach it can be and has been carried out using physical and chemical approaches such as nh3 stripping ion exchange and precipitation booker et al 1999 deng et al 2014 uludag demirer et al 2008 yuan et al 2016 these methods however are associated with critical caveats such as large energy requirements and high costs associated with the consumption or regeneration of chemicals ion exchange though selective in a general sense can also absorb unwanted cations present in wastewater resulting in effluents that do not meet product quality standards for downstream applications hou et al 2018 precipitation products especially struvite often require the addition of other components which themselves are also pollutants yuan et al 2016 nh3 stripping is a superior approach in many aspects yet lacks economic competitiveness blowing heated air and supplying alkaline chemicals are expensive operations deng et al 2016 the aforementioned issues can be avoided if an electrochemical method is adopted for recovery desloover et al 2015 2012 lee et al 2020 luther et al 2015 with the electrochemical approach an external dc voltage applied to a simple electrochemical cell such as a cation exchange membrane cem based two chamber electrochemical cell induces water electrolysis producing protons on the anode and hydroxyl ions on the cathode the protonated tan molecules i e ammonium ions nh4 which act as a proton shuttle cord ruwisch et al 2011 are transported from the anode compartment to the cathode through the cem because of the electrochemical field and the concentration gradient in the cathode compartment the nh4 ions are deprotonated to nh3 which can be rather easily recovered using an existing method such as stripping lee et al 2020 utilized this electrodialysis ed system for continuous tan separation and accumulation from livestock wastewater lw at high current density fed batch operation using real lw resulted in a very high degree of tan accumulation up to 17 704 mg n l pilot scale tan recovery using an ed was also tested by ward et al 2018 the maximum achievable total nh3 concentration was approximately 7100 mg n l however this approach requires an additional tan separation process in the catholyte one such technology that stands out is direct separation by transmembrane chemisorption tmcs in this approach nh3 generated from nh4 that has migrated to and been deprotonated at the cathode is recovered in pure form in an acidic solution via a gas permeable hydrophobic tubular membrane recently tan has successfully been recovered by a combination of the ed with tmcs daguerre martini et al 2018 kuntke et al 2016 rodríguez arredondo et al 2017 tarpeh et al 2018 tarpeh et al 2018 achieved 92 7 tan recovery from real urine using an electrochemical approach with tmcs moreover kuntke et al 2017 investigated a hydrogen recycling electrochemical system hres with h2 recycled as an anodic reactant enabling energy efficient tan recovery moreover this system was further improved kuntke et al 2018a in other recent work bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed was adopted for this purpose rodrigues et al 2020 van linden et al 2020 yan et al 2020 2018 the bipolar membrane is known to enhance the splitting of water into h and oh and thus ion migration without extraneous addition ran et al 2017 reported that the theoretical energy consumption for water dissociation in bmed is 79 9 kj mol which is far lower than that of the electrolysis process this system was recently applied for tan recovery in connection with tmcs and achieved recovery of 70 rodrigues et al 2020 yan et al 2020 proposed a chemical free method for nh3 recovery by way of coupling bmed with a hollow fiber membrane contactor yan et al 2020 2018 in this system the dissociated h ions and oh ions from the bipolar membrane are referred to as input chemicals for the absorption solution and tan they reported that without any addition of chemicals 99 of tan was recovered in the form of nh4 2so4 however all these membrane based approaches are prone to back diffusion dykstra et al 2014 tarpeh et al 2018 whereas nh3 may well diffuse through the gas permeable hydrophobic membrane but at the same time it can back diffuse through cem limiting tan accumulation in the acidic solution although the use of highly concentrated nh3 can substantially lessen the burden of energy intensive stripping it also accelerates back diffusion therefore the key to success using this system is to remove nh3 from the cathode compartment as soon as it is produced as a solution to the aforementioned problem we herein propose a new electrochemical system es based on a gas diffusion electrode gde or gde es and examine its capacity for tan removal using lw the unique feature of this system lies in the carbon based gde through which o2 which functions as an electron acceptor is effectively supplied in the form of flowing air and on which redox reactions occur in addition the physically and chemically isolated cathodic compartment which is a very narrow space between the cem and gde allows a highly alkaline condition to be maintained so that the transported nh4 is immediately converted to nh3 and thus stripped by the supplied airflow without requiring an independent stripping step because of the thin and porous nature of the gde and the extremely short distance from it to the cem the reaction is sufficiently fast to enable effective nh3 stripping the use of air is an additional advantage in that the molecular o2 in air serves as an electron acceptor and thereby lowers the total cell voltage when o2 is adopted as an electron acceptor i e the oxygen reduction reaction orr is induced the theoretically required standard cell potential is estimated to be only 0 828 v according to the following redox half reactions anode oer o2 4h 4e 2h2o 1 229 v vs she cathode orr o2 2h2o 4e 4oh 0 401 v vs she on the other hand the cell potential on the basis of the hydrogen evolution reaction her is substantially higher 2 06 v according to the following reactions anode oer o2 4h 4e 2h2o 1 229 v vs she cathode her 2h2o 2e h2 2oh 0 828 v vs she it is therefore theoretically plausible that the use of air as a cathodic reactant lowers total cell voltage and hence save energy in addition to this advantage regarding energy the air flow serves as an nh3 stripper the specific objectives of the present study were to explore an underlying tan recovery mechanism and in so doing investigate the determining factors for optimal operation particular attention was devoted to the effects of the air supply on tan migration and the energy requirement the advantageous use of air was initially demonstrated with synthetic lw in a batch setup and afterward with real lw in continuous mode finally an overall evaluation of operating costs including chemicals heating spraying and air blowing was carried out to highlight the economic competitiveness of the gde es 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrochemical cell and operations as presented in fig 1 a gde es was constructed for tan separation from waste sources pt and a gde were used as the counter and working electrodes respectively the effective area of each electrode was 1 cm2 each compartment was separated by a cem nafion 117 dupont for nh4 migration the anodic compartment was situated between the anode and cem but the cathodic one was continuously emptied so as to maintain a highly nh3 concentrated condition to minimize any possible resistance to the transport of nh4 through the cem the nafion 117 membrane was immersed in a 3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 solution at 80 c for 1 h to eliminate impurities then it was rinsed in deionized water diw and incubated at 80 c in diw for 2 h the treated membrane was subsequently rinsed in diw incubated at 80 c in 0 5 m h2so4 for 1 h and immersed in a 30 wt nh3 aqueous solution for 1 d to convert the h form nafion to nh4 form nafion after the pretreatment the membrane was rinsed again in diw and stored in diw until use lan et al 2013 synthetic or real lw was used as an anodic tan source and air was supplied to the cathode stripped nh3 from the electrochemical cell was collected in a 0 2 m sulfuric acid h2so4 solution the flow rate of the air which was used for dual purposes of

batch operations were carried out at an air flow rate of 5 to 20 ml min for 4 h the total working volume of the anolyte and of the 0 2 m h2so4 absorbent solution in the batch operation was 2 and 4 ml respectively after each test the concentrations of tan in the anolyte and in the h2so4 solution were measured however the remaining tan in the cell was indirectly estimated by the difference between the tan in the anolyte and that in the h2so4 solution the nitrogen flux was also compared at different current densities 10 20 30 and 40 ma cm2 with air flow rates of 5 10 15 and 20 ml min in these experiments the total working volume of the anolyte was increased to 1 l to maintain the anolyte ionic strength for an extended period of time 2 3 2 air as electron acceptor to confirm that molecular

nh3 solution for 1 d to ensure that it was fully saturated with nh3 the air flow rate was maintained at 5 20 ml min 2 3 4 continuous operation for tan recovery for continuous operation an excess of the synthetic or real lw was supplied to the anode side via a peristaltic pump green tech korea at 20 rpm 20 ml min for 24 h the air flow rate for the orr was fixed at 20 ml min and the stripped nh3 was absorbed in a 0 2 m h2so4 10 ml solution 2 3 5 isotope analysis to see if the recovered tan originated from the waste anolyte isotopic labeling experiments were conducted at a current density of 10 ma cm2 under a gas flow rate of 20 ml min for 1 h the tan in the anolyte was 15nh4 and its total working volume was 2 ml the absorbent was 0 2 mm h2so4 4 ml the standard solutions contained 900 mm 900 ppm of 15nh4 or 14nh4 in the anodic compartment after tan transport an nmr sample was prepared by mixing 0 2 ml d6 dmso and 0 8 ml of the product solution obtained in a 0 2 m h2so4 absorbent the solution ph was adjusted by adding 4 m h2so4 and then the nmr spectra of the prepared sample were compared with that of 15nh4 and 14nh4 standards to specify the tan source 2 4 chemical analysis

to transfer 1 kg of tan equations for the aforementioned parameters are given in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of air supply as a nh3 stripper to recover tan from waste sources in a direct effective manner we developed a novel gde es and confirmed its efficacy isotope analysis was conducted with synthetic lw in batch mode which allowed confirmation that electrochemistry was the real driver of the tan recovery figure s1 the gas to liquid ratio is a determining factor with respect to nh3 stripping this is because a sufficiently high air flow rate ensures that an adequate nh3 concentration gradient is maintained between the head and liquid spaces arogo et al 1999 gustin and marinsek logar 2011 quan et al 2009 to determine if the gas to liquid ratio was also a determining factor in the case of the gde es the air flow rate was varied from 5 to 20 ml min when tan was electrochemically transported and its concentration in the anolyte was lowered we expected it to accumulate in the h2so4 absorbent solution in a quantitative manner however this result was not observed experimentally the electro oxidation of tan also did not likely occur given that it tends to take place at ph levels higher than 8 figure s2 as shown in fig 2 at an air flow rate of 20 ml min most of the tan transported from the anolyte was recovered in the h2so4 solution after 4 h only 1 3 remained in the cell in contrast 31 26 7 and 6 6 of the tan remained in the cell at an air flow rate of 5 10 and 15 ml min respectively this result was reflected in the recovery efficiency 56 64 91 and 98 at the air flow rate of 5 10 15 and 20 ml min respectively fig 3 a equation s1 a similar behavior was observed with respect to current density where the amount of tan in the anolyte decreased by 0 3 0 31 0 32 and 0 34 mmol at air flow rates of 5 10 15 and 20 ml min fig 3b at low air flows the supplied air might be insufficient to reach all of the regions of the gde resulting in a substantial portion of the tan not being stripped in particular among ones deprotonated upon being transported fig 3c for instance at the air flow rates of 5 and 10 ml min a certain amount of nh3 remained in the cell fig 2 fig 3c this incomplete stripping appeared to affect adversely the overall efficiency in a way that gave rise to back diffusion as with any electrochemical system the current density was an important factor affecting performance as evident in fig 4 the nitrogen flux from the anolyte to h2so4 j ah was directly proportional to the current density at different air flow rates 10 15 or 20 ml min the exception was a nonlinear curve corresponding to the lowest air flow rate 5 ml min which might be too low to remove all of the tan from the cell as shown in fig 2 an increase of tan in the h2so4 solution was initially delayed for the first hour indicating that it was accumulating inside the cell to a certain level under each airflow condition after which it was stripped out however as shown in fig 4 migration and diffusion flux were maximally facilitated at a low current density 10 ma cm2 possibly due to a relatively constant tan level in the feed anolyte because of this tan was detected within 30 min this phenomenon gave rise to the linear increase of jah with respect to current density because an identical amount of tan was rapidly accumulated in the cell at a high current density 40 ma cm2 tan rapidly migrated to the cathode side to the full extent that could be readily stripped out because of this general linear trend between jah and current density the final flux showed dramatic differences especially at 40 ma cm2 where j ah was 586 828 1325 and 1766 g n m2d at the air flow rate of 5 10 15 and 20 ml min respectively the nonlinear behavior of j ah with respect to current density at the air flow rate of 5 ml min might be caused by back diffusion this is when nh3 moves back to the anode side because of the rapid formation of a steep concentration gradient at such a low air flow rate this phenomenon became more prominent at high current densities 3 2 effect of air supply as an electron acceptor air played a dual role in our system as an nh3 stripping gas and an electron acceptor the latter was particularly advantageous from the perspective of energy consumption given that the system is electrochemical electrochemical methods of tan recovery have long been considered a promising option and the production of hydroxyl ions via cathodic water electrolysis i e the hydrogen evolution reaction her has typically been the goal with such systems under similar conditions the orr is more energetically favorable than the her for instance under alkaline conditions the theoretical her redox potential is 0 8277 v vs a standard hydrogen electrode she whereas the orr redox potential is 0 401 v vs she to determine if this theoretical but seemingly substantial benefit was indeed realized in practice we conducted a series of experiments using air as an electron acceptor because of the aforementioned technical difficulty of tan being trapped between the cem and gde the nitrogen flux from the anolyte to the catholyte j ac was used as an indirect performance indicator instead of being a direct indicator of flux from the anolyte to h2so4 j ah fig 5 a shows the nitrogen flux and electrochemical energy requirements with various gasses n2 air and o2 the j ah was almost identical in all cases n2 902 4 g n m2d air 883 2 g n m2d and o2 907 2 g n m2d even though the o2 concentration in n2 air and o2 gasses varied 0 21 and 100 respectively the rate of tan migration and diffusion remained similar because the operation was conducted at the same current density electrochemical energy consumption however was meaningfully different 9 56 7 47 and 7 23 kwh kg n for n2 air and o2 respectively under the anoxic condition with n2 only the her appeared to have priority at the cathode resulting in a higher cell potential than those achieved with air and o2 lsv experiments supported this finding the onset potential was 0 4 v when air or o2 was supplied orr but 1 3 v when n2 her was supplied fig 5b when air was used similar overall cell overpotentials were observed during cell operation figs 5b 5c even though the o2 concentration was only 21 3 3 back diffusion during gde based electrochemical operation we found that the gde es for tan recovery was prone to back diffusion j ca j ac that is there was nh3 flux from the catholyte back into the anolyte when a dc voltage was applied between the two electrodes tan could be transported desirably to the cathode side via migration and diffusion but and also undesirably back to the anolyte via back diffusion the j ac with a two chambered es was 1170 g n m2d which is higher than those achieved using the gde es 605 641 670 and 773 g n m2d at the air flow rate of 5 10 15 and 20 ml min respectively fig 6 c according to fick s law the diffusion flux is proportional to the diffusion coefficient and the concentration gradient in the gde es nh3 likely accumulated in the small space on the cathode side as soon as it passed through the cem fig 6a therefore the back diffusion flux might be worsened if nh3 to air contact is less effective such as at a low gas flow rate however the two chambered es was constantly filled with catholyte and the concentration gradient remained low even with nh3 migration from the anolyte thus the back diffusion flux was less prominent fig 6b the largest back diffusion flux j ca was measured under open circuit conditions using the gde when the air flow rate was 5 ml min the j ca was 398 g n m2d j ac 398 g n m2d however the j ca gradually decreased with increasing air flow rate 235 192 and 163 g n m2d at the air flow rate of 10 15 and 20 ml min respectively fig 6c a high airflow appeared to limit back diffusion because of the fast stripping of nh3 from the system the back diffusion of nh3 was unavoidable especially if a very high concentration of nh3 remained as was the case under alkaline conditions yet air stripping requires this very condition the apparent advantage of a two chambered system without the presence of gde to limit back diffusion pales in comparison with the supplementary cost of a post treatment process such as nh3 stripping 3 4 continuous tan recovery via the gde based system tan recovery was continuously monitored with either synthetic or real lw at an air flow rate of 20 ml min for 24 h as shown in fig 7 a the final concentration of tan was 8960 and 7570 mg l with the synthetic and real lw respectively when nh3 n was recovered by gde es from the real lw the nitrogen flux to h2so4 j ah decreased the j ah was 890 g n m2d with the synthetic lw and 770 g n m2d with the real lw this discrepancy might arise from the intrinsic differences of the two solutions rather than from back diffusion when the batch operation was conducted for 30 min the transference number of nh4 with the synthetic lw was 0 7 whereas that with the real lw was 0 58 these results well reflect the j ac values of 883 2 g n m2d with synthetic lw and 736 8 g n m2d with real lw fig 7b in the real lw various monovalent and multivalent ions such as k na ca2 and mg2 typically coexisted in large concentrations although nh4 was the primary charge carrier these cations could also act as major charge carriers in our case k na and ca2 were predominant in the real lw table s1 and the concentrations of multivalent ions decreased after the cell was operated in this experiment k was found to be one of the most influential ions its transference number was 0 15 this undesirable ionic migration might lead to a decrease in the nitrogen flux and to a lower transference number of nh4 the migration of other cations also affected the gde es overpotential as shown in figure s3 a constant overpotential was maintained with the synthetic lw 2 75 v for 24 h whereas it increased from 2 8 to 4 09 v after 12 h of operation with the real lw this change was attributed to ions precipitating on the surface of the gde when the real lw was used this interpretation is supported by the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy mapping images in fig 8 unlike the pt c catalyst in the electrode used for 24 h with the synthetic lw the catalyst in the electrode used with the real lw was coated with k and ca2 deposits k is regarded as being an ion that competes with nh4 particularly because of its comparatively high concentration in the real lw ca2 though present at a low concentration easily precipitated as ca oh 2 under alkaline conditions both processes contributed to the increased cell overpotential the electrochemical energy input for the real lw was 9 44 kwh kg n whereas that for the synthetic lw was 7 42 kwh kg n equation s5 3 5 comparison of energy consumption to find out possible sources of the energy loss voltage was analyzed during the electrochemical operation in a detailed way theoretical thermodynamic cell voltage ethermo a potential difference between the cathodic and anodic reactions is constant if the anodic and cathodic phs are 7 and 14 respectively the two chambered es with oer at the anode and her at the cathode has 1 65 v whereas gde es with oer at anode and orr at the cathode has 0 41 v table s2 equations s7 s11 total cell voltage etotal actually measured however was found to be quite different from them mainly due to overpotentials associated with the internal potential losses fig 9 a at the current density of 10 ma cm2 the 2 chambered es ended in etotal of 4 25 v and the gde es of 2 72 v though this difference was considerable the internal potential loss remained similar and high for the two overpotential was 2 61 v with the 2 chambered es and 2 31 v with the gde es this kind of energy loss is known to be a lump sum result of anodic overpotential ηanode cathodic overpotential ηcathode ionic potential loss eionic and transport potential loss through the membrane emembrane kuntke et al 2017 kuntke et al 2018a b nguyen and dinh 2020 equations s12 s17 as shown in fig 9b an overpotential that singularly stood out while all the others had similar values for both configurations had to do with sort of the cathodic reaction her in 2 chambered es and orr in gde es the anode overpotential which is linked with oer was a main contributor to the voltage loss in both cases 1 33 v in 2 chambered es and 1 32 v in gde es and the cathode overpotential ionic and transport potential loss were all relatively small the main voltage loss taking place in the anode was usually associated with deactivation and diffusion losses at the catalyst kuntke et al 2017 this is often exacerbated in using lw as anolyte as it is highly likely to contain a great deal of oxidative reaction potential the anodic energy lost in the gde es amounted to 3 56 kwh kg n which was substantially greater than that in the 2 chambered es 2 67 kwh kg n fig 9c this was caused by the back diffusion which lowered nitrogen flux resulting in an electro energy disadvantage energy consumption for tan recovery via gde es was also compared with that of recovery via the nh3 stripping method fig 9d which is the most well developed recovery approach limoli et al 2016 the gde es requires energy for 1 air supply 2 electricity for tan separation with ph control 3 h2so4 supply and 4 water pumping nh3 stripping requires energy for 1 air supply 2 ph control 3 h2so4 supply 4 heating and 5 nozzle spraying maurer et al 2003 reported that the energy required for the nh3 stripping process is 7 3 kwh kg n for air supply 3 87 kwh kg n for ph control and 2 14 kwh kg n for h2so4 consumption the minimum heating energy for the nh3 stripping process was calculated to be 10 4 kwh kg n on the basis of experimental data gustin and marinsek logar 2011 equation s18 s21 joseph and beachler 1998 reported that the liquid inlet pressure for a nozzle spray tower typically ranges between 0 7 to 28 bar assuming the nozzle spray was operated at a midpoint pressure of 13 7 bar the energy requirement was calculated to be 3 9 kwh kg n with a range from 0 01 kwh kg n 0 7 bar to 16 33 kwh kg n 28 bar equation s22 29 as a result the total energy consumption for tan recovery with the stripping method was estimated to be 27 6 kwh kg n with the midpoint pressure 23 71 kwh kg n with nozzle pressure of 0 7 bar and 40 03 kwh kg n with 28 bar the gde es consumed the most energy for ph control 9 44 kwh kg n along with 1 72 kwh kg n for air supply 2 14 kwh kg n for h2so4 and 0 14 kwh kg n for water pumping the total energy consumption was estimated to be 13 44 kwh kg n equation s5 s29 s33 maurer et al 2003 this rather rough estimation shows that the application of the gde es could potentially reduce energy consumption at least on a lab scale by 43 to 66 compared with conventional technology as shown in table s3 various studies related to electrochemical tan recovery have been conducted and its applicability was demonstrated at a pilot scale as well tan recovery was successfully investigated at pilot scale by ward et al 2018 nitrogen flux was 1008 g n m2d with an electrochemical energy input of 4 8 kwh kg n however it requires an additional cost intensive separation process for the recovery of pure nh3 more recently van linden et al 2020 adopted bmed and demonstrated efficient tan recovery with lower electrochemical energy consumption 5 28 kwh kg n a recent trend for tan recovery is to use electrochemistry in combination with a series of membranes further studies using bmed in combination with a hollow fiber membrane contactor hfmc showed pure tan recovery in the form of nh4 2so4 yan et al 2020 2018 for efficient recovery however wastewater had to be utilized as a catholyte so that its ph always maintained up to 9 on the other hand rodrigues et al 2020 positively recovered solely separated nh3 from feed to catholyte 819 1 g n m2d using a hybrid bmed tmcs system with less electrochemical energy 5 08 kwh kg n a result with the es tmcs approach was also reported by tarpeh et al 2018 although our gde es was inferior in terms of j ah 770 vs 1010 g n m2d it was indeed substantially superior in terms of energy consumption 9 44 vs 30 6 kwh kg n all these current technologies facilitated the best performance for liquid phase of nh3 in addition concerning the recovery of pure nh3 the tmcs based technology can function without requiring additional energy at least in the electrochemical part of the method however the captured species are ions nh4 rather than charge neutral molecules nh3 and thus require an additional and normally costly stripping step by contrast in the case of gde es a simple air supply which has to be implemented in the stripping step enables the nitrogen flux to be controlled as well in a concomitant manner 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrated gde es to be an effective method for the selective recovery of active nitrogen from waste sources especially with respect to cost effectiveness a very narrow space between the cem and gde which serves to concentrate nh3 to a great extent and the supplied air which acts both as a cell potential lowering electron acceptor and as ammonia stripping flow makes it possible to recover gaseous ammonia from wastewaters effectively hence electrochemical energy input was 9 56 kwh kg n with synthetic lw under an anaerobic condition but was lower 7 47 kwh kg n under an aerobic condition the continuous operation resulted in a nitrogen flux of 770 g n m2d with real lw at a current density of 10 ma cm2 and with electrochemical energy of 9 44 kwh kg n this otherwise promising technology however was found to be prone to have penalties 1 back diffusion caused by highly concentrated nh3 and 2 precipitate formation e g ca oh 2 on the cathode which occurred due to co migration of cations under the same electrochemical force although the concept demonstrated in this study can be regarded as a promising option for the future many more studies are needed to develop appropriate methods to either prevent or eliminate back diffusion and fouling an equally important and challenging issue namely the scaling up of the gde es also needs to be addressed if and only if these issues are resolved the innovative system proposed in this

17067,the characteristics of fecal sludge delivered to treatment plants are highly variable adapting treatment process operations accordingly is challenging due to a lack of analytical capacity for characterization and monitoring at many treatment plants cost efficient and simple field measurements such as photographs and probe readings could be proxies for process control parameters that normally require laboratory analysis to investigate this we evaluated questionnaire data expert assessments and simple analytical measurements for fecal sludge collected from 421 onsite containments this data served as inputs to models of varying complexity random forest and linear regression models were able to predict physical chemical characteristics including total solids ts and ammonium nh4 n concentrations and solid liquid separation performance including settling efficiency and filtration time r2 from 0 51 0 66 based on image analysis of photographs sludge color supernatant color and texture and probe readings conductivity ec and ph supernatant color was the best predictor of settling efficiency and filtration time ec was the best predictor of nh4 n and texture was the best predictor of ts predictive models have the potential to be applied for real time monitoring and process control if a database of measurements is developed and models are validated in other cities simple decision tree models based on the single classifier of containment type can also be used to make predictions about citywide planning where a lower degree of accuracy is required graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords random forest machine learning image analysis sanitation wash fecal sludge 1 introduction the sanitation needs of 1 3 of the world s population are met by non sewered sanitation technologies which can only provide protection of human and environmental health if the accumulated fecal sludge is adequately managed who 2017 2018 to achieve this characterization of process control parameters at treatment plants is required to ensure safe and efficient treatment bassan and robbins 2014 von sperling et al 2020b this includes projections for quantities and qualities of influent when designing a treatment plant and routine monitoring for process control and compliance of effluent standards during operation although there has been considerable research focused on improving characterization and monitoring for centralized sewer based wastewater treatment in high income countries this is still lacking for fecal sludge treatment corominas et al 2018 klinger et al 2019 who 2017 yoo et al 2008 a key obstacle is the lack of accessible analytical capacity as there are few fecal sludge treatment plants fstps with onsite laboratories and supply chains for procurement of chemicals are often complex and unreliable bassan et al 2015 bousek et al 2018 klinger et al 2019 solid liquid separation is a key step in fecal sludge treatment and fstps are designed for settling and dewatering which typically precede subsequent treatment of liquid and solid fractions and is most commonly achieved by settling thickening tanks and or drying beds but could also entail mechanical dewatering geotextiles or new innovative technologies the characteristics of fecal sludge are highly variable resulting in correspondingly inconsistent settling and dewatering performance cofie et al 2006 gold et al 2016 without methods to predict the variable characteristics of sludge arriving for treatment adjustments cannot be made to plant operations the results are clogged drying beds or filter membranes wasted space and decreased treatment capacity klinger et al 2019 to address these problems real time monitoring for adaptive process control is required ward et al 2021 parameters relevant for citywide planning and optimized process control at fstps include physical chemical characteristics of influent e g total solids ts chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n bassan and robbins 2014 research is being conducted into alternatives to laboratory based analysis for fecal sludge but these alternatives are not yet well established and little quantitative research has been done bousek et al 2018 however several interesting correlations between field measurements and laboratory based measurements have been reported for example electrical conductivity ec and ph have been correlated with settling performance and dewatering time of fecal sludge suggesting that these might be possible field measurements to use as indicators of expected solid liquid separation performance gold et al 2018 junglen et al 2020 ward et al 2019 data gathered by questionnaire including containment type i e pit latrine or septic tank presence of household water connection source i e household or commercial and household income have been linked to physical chemical characteristics such as ts and cod in several cities however these correlations are empirical and may differ between cities englund et al 2020 strande et al 2021a strande et al 2018 tembo 2019 expert assessments of color and odor are informally used as indicators of level of sludge stabilization and it is generally believed that perceptible differences in color and odor are linked to different physical chemical properties and dewatering performance hartenstein 1981 schoebitz et al 2016 however the capacity of color and odor to monitor fecal sludge characteristics has to our knowledge never before been quantified and is not well documented in the literature quantifying relationships between possible field measurements and laboratory based measurements is the first step in establishing alternative field based methods but in order get the most utility out of field based measurements predictive models can be employed based on experience using software sensors in the wastewater treatment sector it should be possible to develop predictive models for fecal sludge using the types of field measurements previously discussed dürrenmatt and gujer 2012 tyralis et al 2019 currently operators at fstps do not use predictive models but may use expert knowledge or data collected from emptiers to make decisions about operation process control and maintenance for example mixing sludge from households and public toilets in a pre determined ratio to achieve more consistent settling behavior cofie et al 2006 or varying the dose of polymer flocculant for pit latrine sludge and septic tank sludge based on observations of the differences in their solids contents ward et al 2021 very little research has been published on predicting fecal sludge characteristics however it has been proposed that questionnaire data can be used to model estimated loadings for planning new fstps strande et al 2021a a combination of data driven and mechanistic models based on questionnaire data have demonstrated the ability to predict ts in fecal sludge with the goal of improved citywide planning englund et al 2020 in order for predictive models to reduce dependence on laboratory based characterization of fecal sludge they must be accurate enough for routine monitoring and or process control at fstps however so far no such models have been reported in the literature in this study we use a large dataset that incorporates a combination of analytical field measurements questionnaire data and expert assessments to assess the suitability of predictive models for optimizing fecal sludge treatment the objective of this study was to investigate to what extent predictive models using field measurements can be used as a proxy for laboratory based methods based on a dataset of samples taken from 421 onsite containments in lusaka zambia we present results of field and laboratory data collection and the predictive performance of the models and discuss which models and field measurements would be appropriate for characterizing and monitoring fecal sludge in different scenarios including citywide planning routine fstp operations and real time process control of treatment technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection 465 fecal sludge samples were collected in situ from 421 onsite containments septic tanks and pit latrines throughout the city of lusaka zambia from september to december of 2019 sampling replicates were taken at 8 of containments a sampling plan was developed according to the method described in strande et al 2021a household sampling sites were selected based on a modified version of stratified random sampling including equal proportions of strata based on geological and demographic characteristics in the non sewered part of the city using arcmap software version 10 6 non household sampling sites public toilets offices schools and malls were selected throughout the city based on local expert knowledge questionnaires were administered to the owner tenant or person in charge of operating and maintaining the system at each sampling site questionnaires included questions about designation of containment type toilet type water connection and a number of other factors questions available in si answers were recorded with the kobo toolbox mobile phone app because of the range of sludge consistencies present in lusaka different sampling devices were used to sample from pit latrines and septic tanks a conical metal pit sampler adapted from the design developed by james tembo presented in koottatep et al 2021 was used to sample pit latrines a composite sample was produced using three 1 l samples collected from the bottom or the maximum reach of the sampler 3 m middle and top of the pit after homogenizing the composite sample in a bucket a 0 9 l sample was taken for analysis for septic tanks a 3 m long core sampler adapted from the design from cdd society presented in kootatep et al 2021 was used a composite sample was produced by emptying the contents of the core sampler into a bucket homogenizing the contents and taking a 0 9 l sample for analysis samples were transferred to a cooler for transport to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 c until analysis detailed information about the sampling process along with photographs of the sampling devices is provided in kootatep et al 2021 2 2 sample analysis 2 2 1 sample processing incoming samples were homogenized thoroughly by shaking stirring and were divided into two portions one to be blended before physical chemical characterization and the other to be analyzed for solid liquid separation performance avoiding blending in this case so as to not disrupt any flocs or structure of the sludge which would influence settling and dewatering behavior 2 2 2 physical chemical characterization samples were homogenized in a blender 3 minutes medium setting foam height was measured immediately after blending using a ruler held to the wall of the blender ph ec ts and volatile solids vs were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 2017 density was measured by determining the mass of 25 ml of sample cod was measured using the closed reflux titrimetric method

dried solids were analyzed by an external laboratory unza department of soil science tocsolids was measured using the walkely black procedure with the endpoint determined by titrimetric method sparks et al 2020 tknsolids was measured using standard methods cottenie et al 1982 a certified reference material ise 952 clay was used as a quality control standard 2 2 3 qualitative assessment of odor and color odor was assessed during sample processing after stirring before blending samples were allowed to reach room temperature at which point the lid of the sample container was removed and the laboratory technician used standard chemical wafting technique nrc 2010 odors were classified into three categories fresh smells like fresh excreta urine or feces stabilized smells like compost soil or well biodegraded anaerobic digester sludge or middle sample odor falls somewhere between these categories to keep the expert classifications as consistent as possible the same laboratory technician was responsible for all odor classifications color was grouped into three qualitative categories light brown black and medium brown when sample falls somewhere between these categories one laboratory assistant was responsible for all color classifications for consistency 2 2 4 solid liquid separation performance supernatant turbidity was quantified as a metric of settling efficiency following centrifugation at 3 300 g for 20 minutes supernatant was decanted and turbidity was measured using a hach 2100n turbidity meter and reported in ntu adapted from the method described in mikkelsen and keiding 2002 this was intended to represent the maximum possible reduction in suspended solids due to prolonged settling or mechanical solid liquid separation capillary suction time cst was quantified as a metric of filtration time cst was measured using a triton 319 multi cst apparatus with 18 mm funnel according to method 2710 g apha 2017 as adapted in velkushanova et al 2021a cst values are reported in seconds and have been standardized by subtracting the cst of deionized water ts in the dewatered sludge cake was quantified as a metric of maximum solids content achievable by dewatering and was defined as the dry solids content in the dewatered sludge cake after dewatering via centrifugation at 3 300 g for 20 minutes gold et al 2018 supernatant was decanted for turbidity measurement and centrifuge tubes were left standing upside down on an absorbent cloth for 5 minutes to completely remove any free water before transferring solids out of the centrifuge tube for ts characterization samples were screened for consistency and only liquid and slurry samples 225 samples were analyzed for solid liquid separation performance according to designations of sludge consistency presented in velkushanova and strande 2021 2 2 5 color and texture quantification color and texture measurements were taken by analyzing photographs of 10 ml aliquots of sludge to our knowledge this is a novel method developed as an alternative to the standard colorimetric photometric method of color detection it is intended to be used as a field measurement shown in fig 1 10 ml samples of unblended sludge and supernatant after centrifugation when available were poured into 10 ml petri dishes and placed on a white background next to a color checker chart datacolor spydercheckr 24 see figures s1 and s2 in si for additional photographs of the setup samples were photographed in a designated location with consistent led lighting 3 6w led lamps 3000 k warm white color using a panasonic dmc tz70 camera in jpeg format jpeg format was selected over raw in order to enable the broader application of color and texture assessment to photographs collected with smartphone cameras in the future photographs were post processed for color correction using the color checker chart s standard rgb values and assuming cie standard illuminant d65 schanda 2007 the color correction was performed using the python colour library version 0 1 5 using the transformation presented in cheung et al 2004 sludge and supernatant color swatches were manually isolated from the color corrected photographs and the average rgb color was calculated by taking the independent averages of the r g and b values in the swatch the average sludge and supernatant color values were then converted to hue saturation and value hsv texture analysis was performed using texture measures derived from a grey level co occurrence matrix glcm with the python scikit image library version 0 17 2 van der walt et al 2014 six common texture measures were calculated for each photograph contrast dissimilarity homogeneity correlation angular second momentum asm and energy the mathematical descriptions of the texture measures are described in haralick 1979 and hall beyer 2017 all code related to color correction and texture analysis is provided along with the open dataset for this paper link in si 2 2 6 qa qc according to qa qc procedures triplicate laboratory analyses were made for every 10th measurement for cod nh4 n and supernatant turbidity and every 5th measurement for ts vs and

category were considered to be significantly different from one another if the 95 confidence intervals around the medians did not overlap chambers et al 1983 confidence intervals ci were calculated using the formula c i m e d i a n 1 57 i q r n where iqr is the interquartile range and n is the number of data points in the category chambers et al 1983 confidence intervals around the median are represented as notches on boxplots figures s3 and s4 in si 2 4 predictive models cost efficient and simple to execute field measurements were evaluated in this study to determine whether they could be used to predict more costly laboratory based analytical measurements field measurements evaluated as inputs to predictive models are detailed in table 1 questionnaire data is categorical and quantitative expert assessments are categorical qualitative and were assigned by trained laboratory technicians simple analytical measurements are quantitative continuous valued measurements collected using a probe a ruler or a camera although simple analytical measurements were performed in a laboratory as part of this study they are all able to be measured in the field without laboratory equipment and thus are labeled field measurements the laboratory based measurements that are desired outputs of the predictive models target parameters are outlined in table 2 data analysis modelling and visualization was performed using python 3 van rossum and drake 2009 models were implemented in scikit learn version 0 23 2 and statsmodels version 0 12 1 packages in python 3 models along with the complete dataset are available open source with this publication link in si three types of models were evaluated in this study i a simple decision tree model ii a linear regression model and iii a random forest model these models were chosen as they represent a range of complexities and unique advantages and disadvantages simple decision tree models are based on the decision tree presented in strande et al 2021a which uses the median value of the target parameter in a category e g median ts in septic tanks to predict future values in that category simple decision tree models are reflective of the way that operational decisions may currently be made at treatment plants cofie et al 2006 ward et al 2021 they have the advantage of easy interpretation and visualization but predictive capabilities are often poor linear regression models can also be easily interpreted and are good descriptions of systems with linear behavior in contrast random forest models are a widely applied black box machine learning algorithm that can deal with non linearities and interactions but cannot be interpreted directly hastie et al 2009 a thorough description of the specifics for each model type is provided in the si model evaluation took part in two steps a the identification of relevant field measurement inputs for predicting each target laboratory based measurement using a reduced dataset and b the final assessment of the performance of the three model types for each target using expanded datasets model inputs were evaluated using a reduced dataset n 244 comprising all inputs included in table 1 with samples with missing input data removed supernatant color was included as an input for models predicting solid liquid separation performance but not for models predicting physical chemical characteristics as supernatant color data was collected only for the subset of samples that were evaluated for solid liquid separation performance for each target parameter models were generated for every possible combination of maximal four inputs and the performance of each model was evaluated using cross validated r2 and root mean squared error rmse 5 fold cross validation repeated 20 times the input combination with the highest cross validated r2 was considered the best preference was given to models with fewer inputs so if inputs could be removed from the model without a relevant decrease in r2 at two decimal places those inputs were not included in the best model relative importance of inputs was evaluated by comparing the r2 of models built with and without the input the relative strengths of the inputs included in the best models were evaluated by comparing the r2 of single input models the input with the largest r2 was labeled the strongest predictor if the r2 of that model was at least 75 of the r2 of the best multi input model supporting predictors were defined as inputs that are included in the best model and increase the model r2 when included as model inputs along with the strongest predictor detailed information about model performance and input importance are included in the si tables s3 s9 input selection was also dictated by model type the simple decision tree model as defined in strande et al 2021a was designed to use only categorical data so only questionnaire data and expert assessments were used as inputs to this model the linear regression model was evaluated for all inputs questionnaire data expert assessments and simple analytical measurements except the texture parameters dissimilarity and asm these were removed after pre screening for collinearity with other inputs pearson coefficient 0 85 as they were strongly correlated with other texture parameters the random forest model was evaluated for all inputs after the relevant inputs for predicting each target had been identified final model performance was determined for each target the dataset for the final evaluation included only the relevant inputs that were used in the best models of each model type for predicting a specific target in order to maximize the number of data points used to train and evaluate each model this allows the performance of the three model types in predicting a specific target to be compared cross validated r2 and rmse were used in the final performance evaluation 3 results discussion data collected with cost efficient and simple to execute field measurements were used to develop predictive models of the more expensive laboratory based analysis i e physical chemical characteristics and solid liquid separation performance in order to evaluate whether the less expensive methods could be used as proxies or partial replacements in data collection the results and discussion are presented in the order of 1 presentation of the collected field and laboratory based data 2 a comparison of the developed models and best predictors and 3 implications for use in characterization of fecal sludge for different fecal sludge management scenarios including citywide planning routine fstp operations and real time process control of treatment technologies 3 1 overview of characteristics and trends in collected data results of the characterization of fecal sludge from septic tanks and pit latrines are presented in tables 3 and 4 overall the values were highly variable and did not follow a normal distribution which is consistent with other studies strande et al 2021b median and mean field measurements physical chemical characteristics and solid liquid separation performance metrics measured in this study are within the expected range based on reported median and mean values in the literature for sludge from septic tanks and pit latrines in lusaka tembo 2019 tembo et al 2019 kampala uganda englund et al 2020 gold et al 2018 semiyaga et al 2017 dakar senegal gold et al 2016 ward et al 2019 dar es salaam tanzania ward et al 2019 durban south africa radford et al 2015 ouagadougou burkina faso bassan et al 2013 accra ghana heinss et al 1999 bangkok thailand heinss et al 1999 manila philippines heinss et al 1999 and hanoi vietnam englund et al 2020 gold et al 2018 the complete dataset for this study is available open source with this publication https doi org 10 25678 00037x as a first step in developing the predictive models correlations and trends within the data were investigated values for ec foam height color saturation supernatant color saturation texture contrast dissimilarity homogeneity asm energy and correlation supernatant turbidity cst cod nh4 n ts and tocsolids were significantly different for pit latrine and septic tank sludge whereas ph tknsolids and ts in the dewatered cake were not significantly different based on 95 confidence intervals around the medians dependencies between questionnaire categories of containment type toilet type water connection and source exist illustrated in fig 2 there is a dependency between containment type i e pit latrine or septic tank and toilet type i e dry or wet as water is used to convey excreta from toilets to septic tanks whereas water is not required for conveyance to pit latrines in a similar fashion sites that had water connections were also more likely to have septic tanks 55 of households had pit latrines and 45 septic tanks whereas non household establishments had a majority of septic tanks 80 it was surprising that 2 5 of septic tanks were associated with dry toilets and 12 with no water connection this calls into question what people actually mean when they report septic tank and brings attention to the apparent disparity between common assumed definitions of septic tanks and how they are actually defined in the field in the future instead of septic tank and pit latrine descriptors of the actual containment technology for example lined unlined baffled presence of overflow are likely to provide more accurate and globally comparable descriptions johnston and slaymaker 2020 questionnaire results for categories of containment type toilet type water connection and source were related to laboratory based measurements pit latrines dry toilets and sites with no water connection yielded correspondingly less diluted sludge significantly higher median cod nh4 n and ts with poorer settling and filtration performance higher supernatant turbidity and cst septic tanks wet toilets either pour flush or cistern flush and sites with a water connection yielded correspondingly more diluted sludge significantly lower median cod nh4 n and ts with better settling and filtration performance lower supernatant turbidity and cst because of the strong correlations between containment type and toilet type only containment type is further included as a potential model input sludge from households was less diluted higher median cod nh4 n and ts and had poorer settling and filtration performance higher supernatant turbidity and cst compared with sludge from non household sources figures s2 and s3 these results contrast with observations in earlier studies in dakar and dar es salaam where sludge from public toilets non household had poorer settling and dewatering performance than sludge from households ward et al 2019 but agree with observations in kampala that there was a difference between physical chemical properties cod ts of sludge from household and non household sources strande et al 2018 this suggests that source i e household or non household may sometimes be a useful predictor of sludge characteristics but the predictive relationships are different in different cities the expert assessment categories of color and odor show dependencies with each other and with questionnaire categories 98 of fresh smelling samples were light or medium brown while 74 of stabilized smelling samples were black see fig s5 the majority of pit latrine sludge had a fresh or middle odor 79 and was medium or light brown 74 while the majority of septic tank sludge had a stabilized odor 75 and was black 74 see fig s6 the expert assessment categories color and odor were associated with laboratory based measurements there were significant differences in the median supernatant turbidity cst nh4 n ts cod vs and tocsolids between fresh light brown and stabilized black samples figures s2 and s3 interestingly our results support common practitioner wisdom that has to our knowledge not been quantified in the literature fecal sludge with higher organic matter content cod toc vs was associated by odor and color as fresh sludge whereas sludge labeled stabilized had correspondingly significantly lower organic matter fresh sludge also took significantly longer to dewater and had poorer settling performance this corroborates practitioner observations from the field that fresh sludge dewaters and settles more poorly than more stabilized sludge cofie et al 2006 heinss et al 1999 ward et al 2019 this finding is interesting because it offers insight into the transformation of organic matter in sludge as it stabilizes the specific shift from the fresh feces odor to the more stabilized barnyard or manure odor during stabilization is a result of bacterial metabolism of organic acids which produce the smells associated with fresh feces leaving behind phenolic and sulfur containing compounds which are associated with the odor of stabilized feces lin et al 2013 starkenmann 2017 these results can direct future research into the transformation of organic matter in the sludge during stabilization and its effect on fundamental mechanisms controlling dewatering relationships to simple analytical measurements are discussed in detail in section 3 2 2 3 2 comparison of model input combinations and performance the collected data were evaluated to see if field measurements table 1 could be used to predict laboratory based measurements table 2 a range of field measurements were evaluated as inputs in the predictive models including questionnaire data such as containment type i e pit latrine or septic tank source i e household or non household expert assessments such as odor and color qualitative and simple analytical measurements such as ec ph foam height color quantitative texture and supernatant color table 5 summarizes the combinations of field measurements that were selected as relevant inputs in every model type for each target parameter the strongest predictor for each model is shown in black and supporting predictors which increase the model performance when included as model inputs are shown in grey model inputs included in poorly performing models r2 0 2 are shown in light grey the model performance metrics on the right of the figure are cross validated r2 and rmse for models using the highlighted field measurements as inputs since simple decision tree models are based on single inputs the input associated with the highest performing model for each target was designated as the strongest predictor tables showing model prediction accuracy and error depending on the inclusion of different predictors are included in the si tables s3 s9 3 2 1 model performance as seen in table 5 in predicting a given target simple decision tree models did not perform as well while linear regression models and random forest models generally improved model fit and reduced error decision tree models were able to account for 21 51 of the variance in supernatant turbidity cst nh4 n and ts linear models improved on the predictions made by decision tree models for supernatant turbidity cst nh4 n ts and cod with 195 38 178 29 and 112 increases in model fit r2 and 32 15 10 17 and 22 reductions in prediction error rmse respectively random forest models improved on the predictions made by decision tree models for supernatant turbidity cst nh4 n ts and cod with 214 73 200 27 and 112 increases in model fit r2 respectively and 36 30 11 17 and 22 reductions in prediction error rmse respectively random forest models outperformed linear models only in predicting the solid liquid separation performance metrics supernatant turbidity and cst random forest models improved on the predictions made by linear models for supernatant turbidity and cst with 6 and 25 increases in r2 and 5 and 18 reductions in rmse respectively it was unexpected that random forest models did not provide higher accuracy predictions than linear models for most parameters as random forest models are able to capture nonlinear interactions between predictors hastie et al 2009 and nonlinear relationships have been observed in models of nutrients in wastewater effluent castrillo and garcía 2020 it is possible that given access to a larger training dataset random forest model performance could exceed that of linear models something to consider when selecting a predictive model is the trade off between increased predictive power and interpretability of the model simple decision tree models and linear regression models tend to be less flexible and provide less robust predictions for complex nonlinear datasets but it is relatively easy to understand the relationships between a field measurement and the target parameter in contrast nonlinear methods such as random forest models are more flexible and may produce better predictions but at the expense of model interpretability hastie et al 2009 in cases where linear models and random forest models provide comparable predictions linear models may be preferred for their relative simplicity in cases where data will be collected routinely and a dataset will continue to grow in size and complexity random forest models may be preferred for their ability to extract nonlinear relationships from larger datasets 3 2 2 suitability of field predictors although questionnaire data and expert assessments were useful inputs for the decision tree models they were only incrementally helpful to include in the linear and random forest models containment type was the strongest predictor for decision tree models explaining 21 51 of the variance in supernatant turbidity cst nh4 n and ts for all linear and random forest regression models with r2 higher than 0 5 a single field measurement the strongest predictor was responsible for at least 75 of the prediction accuracy black in table 5 although the inclusion of questionnaire data containment type and source did contribute to increased fit for some linear and random forest models the simple analytical parameters were always the strongest predictors for these types of models this indicates that the predictive detail represented by the separation into septic tank and pit latrine or household and non household is largely captured by the differences in the physical chemical compositions of sludge from septic tanks and pit latrines or household and non household sources the simple analytical field measurements may be better model inputs than questionnaire data or expert assessments because they are continuous instead of categorical and are thus able to provide higher resolution information supernatant turbidity and cst were predicted primarily by supernatant color supernatant color contributed 86 and 87 of the linear and random forest model fits respectively in predictions of supernatant turbidity and 75 and 90 of linear and random forest model fits respectively for predictions of cst including texture as an input further improved random forest model predictions of both supernatant turbidity and cst our results support and quantify previous observations of a relationship between qualitatively measured supernatant color and settling and filtration performance in fecal sludge from dakar and dar es salaam ward et al 2019 this relationship is hypothesized to be a result of high concentrations of suspended and soluble organic matter which also contribute to high supernatant turbidity and filter clogging during dewatering ward et al 2019 field measurements can be selected to suit available technical and financial resources although supernatant color was the strongest predictor of supernatant turbidity and cst it may not be an ideal field predictor in every case as it requires settling prior to measurement however settling tests are also simple analytical tests that can be performed in the field with low cost equipment in less than an hour e g imhoff cones or settling columns junglen et al 2020 it is not surprising that supernatant turbidity is strongly related to supernatant color now that this relationship has been quantified for fecal sludge in lusaka it seems promising for estimations of effluent turbidity using color in photographs as a proxy and could replace turbidity measurements where spectrophotometers are not available nh4 n was predicted primarily by ec which contributed 91 and 82 of the linear and random forest model fits respectively the linear model is simple ec ms cm 0 2 nh4 n g l see fig s7 the inclusion of texture and ph in the models further improved predictions there is precedent in the literature for the use of ec as a predictor of ammonia in manure and fecal sludge onsite measurement of ec has been suggested as a good proxy for predicting nutrient concentrations including ammonia nitrogen r2 0 91 in swine manure suresh et al 2009 for fecal sludge from pit latrines and septic tanks in uganda vietnam and japan gold et al 2018 observed a linear correlation r2 0 6 between nh4 n and ec based on these results onsite measurement of ec using a conductivity probe is a promising option for cheaper and less resource intensive monitoring of nh4 n ts was predicted primarily by texture which contributed 81 and 86 of the linear and random forest model fits respectively the inclusion of color quantitative further improved both model types and including containment type additionally improved linear model predictions these results make sense based on scientific knowledge that sludge surfaces gain texture as they dry changing from a smooth liquid to a lumpy slurry to a rough semi solid or solid the physical transformation of sludge as it dries following dewatering has been well characterized for sediment sludges on drying beds and ts has been shown to be predictable to a high level of accuracy r2 0 92 using machine learning based on texture analysis bodun et al 2000 our results indicate that using texture measurements extracted from photographs for prediction of ts could be useful in eliminating the time and equipment intensive laboratory analysis of ts for fecal sludge the target parameters vs tocsolids tknsolids and ts in the dewatered cake were not able to be predicted using any of the models these parameters along with cod for which models were only able to account for 25 of the variation in the data are all associated with the sludge organic matter it appears that the field parameters evaluated in this study are not sufficient to fully characterize and predict the organic components in fecal sludge this is consistent with our previous observations that it was difficult to predict variation in dewatered cake solids and vs in fecal sludge from dakar and dar es salaam ward et al 2019 this was hypothesized to be partly due to the influence of soil and solid waste on measured vs and sludge dewatering behavior a rapid field measurement to predict silica content as a proxy for soil could be a possible solution miller et al 2012 proposed the use of field portable infrared spectrometers to predict silica content in coal dust another possibility could be monitoring organic matter composition using in situ fluorescent sensors this has been demonstrated in the field where cod and soluble cod in the effluent of decentralized wastewater treatment systems were able to be monitored using fluorescence as a proxy measurement mladenov et al 2018 fluorescent sensing may also be able to provide better predictions of the composition and transformation of organic matter in sludge during stabilization fluorescent peaks have been associated with the concentrations of high molecular weight humic substances and other organic matter and thus may be a promising method for monitoring level of stabilization mladenov et al 2018 yao et al 2016 further fundamental understanding of the mechanisms controlling fecal sludge stabilization and dewatering will likely be instructional in identifying possible field predictors models can also be adapted to incorporate new field measurements especially in cases when practitioners have identified them to be operationally relevant for example we found that including density as an input can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the ts model random forest model prediction improves to r2 0 70 rmse 4 8 ds for practitioners who have access to a penetrometer for field density measurements as described in radford and sugden 2014 this could be a valuable field predictor to incorporate 3 3 implications for the field in this study we evaluated three types of models with increasing levels of complexity the selection of the best model for different applications will depend on the required level of accuracy and on the available resources here we explore where and how each model type could be relevant considering several situations where predictive models could be useful for characterization and monitoring as summarized in fig 3 scenario 1 community to citywide planning information provided by simple decision tree models may be adequate for the level of detail required for community to citywide planning incorporating questionnaire data such as containment type into simple decision tree models can already provide a moderate amount of information about sludge characteristics and solid liquid separation performance siting decisions and designs for new fstps are often based on citywide averages of loadings and volumes klinger et al 2019 but it has recently been suggested that incorporating decision tree models to estimate quantities and qualities of fecal sludge accumulating on a neighborhood level would greatly improve projections of loadings for planning of fstps transfer stations and regularly scheduled empting programs strande et al 2021a our study confirms that such an approach would provide an improvement over citywide averages a simple decision tree model based on containment type accounts for 26 of the variance in ts because this application does not require a high resolution prediction decision tree models providing low accuracy predictions r2 of 0 26 for ts maybe be adequate as they are easy to understand conceptually and are in many cases based on information that city planners might already have access to this can include information collected in a shit flow diagram sfd for example prevalence of pit latrines and septic tanks by neighborhood location of water taps or data on housing density or residential commercial land use peal et al 2020 scenario 2 periodic process control of fecal sludge treatment technologies operating a fecal sludge treatment plant requires more refined predictions than citywide planning combining cost efficient and simple field measurements with linear or machine learning models contributes a further improvement in prediction accuracy providing moderate accuracy predictions of ts nh4 n and settling and filtration performance r2 of 0 51 0 66 operators routinely make decisions about how much sludge to load on drying beds and when to remove dewatered dried sludge improvements in consistency of solids loading and shorter more consistent residence times could substantially increase treatment plant capacity and performance klinger et al 2019 seck et al 2015 currently the drying beds at most fstps are operated at constant hydraulic loadings and residence times with no monitoring of influent sludge characteristics klinger et al 2019 as a result of not being able to monitor influent sludge common operational problems due to the variability in influent ts arise these problems include overloaded drying beds clogging and dewatering too slowly and underloaded beds wasting space and decreasing treatment capacity klinger et al 2019 being able to adjust the loading of drying beds based on ts concentrations and dewatering time together with monitoring of ts on the drying beds would increase treatment performance and treatment plant capacity this could be done by incorporation of linear or machine learning models into a smartphone app so that pictures taken with the smartphone would provide estimates of ts concentrations and dewatering time a more simple application could be employed with printed cards with example colors and textures for comparison and decision making von sperling et al 2020a scenario 3 real time continuous process control of fecal sludge treatment technologies the capacity to make rapid predictions based on photos and probe measurements could be a serious game changer for processes requiring real time monitoring online conditioner dosing for advanced settling and dewatering is one example ward et al 2021 the current state of the art in fsm is to adjust polymer dosing flowrates based on containment type pit latrine sludge is dosed at a higher flowrate than septic tank sludge to account for the differences in average ts of sludge in each category ward et al 2021 this method provides insufficient resolution for predictions and it is very difficult to avoid over and under dosing conditioner due to the high variability in sludge characteristics in this case a smartphone app with photo and probe inputs obtained at the treatment facility could be used to monitor ts if the ts value of the influent sludge is 2 ds the random forest model should predict within a range of 0 7 3 3 ds this may be sufficiently high resolution depending on the propensity of the selected conditioner to overdosing for example using a 2000 l mixing tank at a transfer station rhodes dicker et al 2020 and a target polymer conditioner dose of 2 ml g ts an actual dose between 0 7 and 3 3 ml g ts could be achieved see si for calculation this is comparable to the observed optimal dosing window for the conditioner 1 3 ml g ts these models are a proof of concept they will also need to be refined depending on the technology and validated prior to use in other cities currently there is a significant lack of information on fecal sludge characterization to drive the development of predictive models the development of a global database of fecal sludge field measurements uploaded together with laboratory results using standardized methods velkushanova et al 2021b will allow for the continuous improvement of models and global applications of these predictions such an approach has significant potential to provide reliable characterization data and enable real time monitoring and process control for fecal sludge treatment in cities all over the world 4 conclusions based on the findings in this study the key conclusions are cost efficient and simple field measurements from photos color texture and probes ec ph can be used as predictors of fecal sludge characteristics and solid liquid separation performance ts nh4 n settling efficiency and filtration time when combined with linear regression and machine learning models containment type is a good predictor of fecal sludge characteristics and solid liquid separation performance ts nh4 n settling efficiency and filtration time and can be especially helpful for making low resolution predictions when combined with simple decision tree models e g for projecting loadings for fstp design laboratory based measurements associated with the organic matter in the sludge solids cod vs tocsolids tknsolids ts in the dewatered cake could not be predicted using the methods we evaluated a better understanding of the organic matter in fecal sludge and how it relates to solid liquid separation performance is needed to identify good predictors based on this proof of concept which indicates that predictions of characteristics using photographs and probe measurements are possible focus should be placed on validating this approach in other cities the collection of worldwide datasets would allow for global implementation and continuously improving machine learning models our ongoing research includes development of an app for field practitioners that can predict fecal sludge characteristics based on

17067,the characteristics of fecal sludge delivered to treatment plants are highly variable adapting treatment process operations accordingly is challenging due to a lack of analytical capacity for characterization and monitoring at many treatment plants cost efficient and simple field measurements such as photographs and probe readings could be proxies for process control parameters that normally require laboratory analysis to investigate this we evaluated questionnaire data expert assessments and simple analytical measurements for fecal sludge collected from 421 onsite containments this data served as inputs to models of varying complexity random forest and linear regression models were able to predict physical chemical characteristics including total solids ts and ammonium nh4 n concentrations and solid liquid separation performance including settling efficiency and filtration time r2 from 0 51 0 66 based on image analysis of photographs sludge color supernatant color and texture and probe readings conductivity ec and ph supernatant color was the best predictor of settling efficiency and filtration time ec was the best predictor of nh4 n and texture was the best predictor of ts predictive models have the potential to be applied for real time monitoring and process control if a database of measurements is developed and models are validated in other cities simple decision tree models based on the single classifier of containment type can also be used to make predictions about citywide planning where a lower degree of accuracy is required graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords random forest machine learning image analysis sanitation wash fecal sludge 1 introduction the sanitation needs of 1 3 of the world s population are met by non sewered sanitation technologies which can only provide protection of human and environmental health if the accumulated fecal sludge is adequately managed who 2017 2018 to achieve this characterization of process control parameters at treatment plants is required to ensure safe and efficient treatment bassan and robbins 2014 von sperling et al 2020b this includes projections for quantities and qualities of influent when designing a treatment plant and routine monitoring for process control and compliance of effluent standards during operation although there has been considerable research focused on improving characterization and monitoring for centralized sewer based wastewater treatment in high income countries this is still lacking for fecal sludge treatment corominas et al 2018 klinger et al 2019 who 2017 yoo et al 2008 a key obstacle is the lack of accessible analytical capacity as there are few fecal sludge treatment plants fstps with onsite laboratories and supply chains for procurement of chemicals are often complex and unreliable bassan et al 2015 bousek et al 2018 klinger et al 2019 solid liquid separation is a key step in fecal sludge treatment and fstps are designed for settling and dewatering which typically precede subsequent treatment of liquid and solid fractions and is most commonly achieved by settling thickening tanks and or drying beds but could also entail mechanical dewatering geotextiles or new innovative technologies the characteristics of fecal sludge are highly variable resulting in correspondingly inconsistent settling and dewatering performance cofie et al 2006 gold et al 2016 without methods to predict the variable characteristics of sludge arriving for treatment adjustments cannot be made to plant operations the results are clogged drying beds or filter membranes wasted space and decreased treatment capacity klinger et al 2019 to address these problems real time monitoring for adaptive process control is required ward et al 2021 parameters relevant for citywide planning and optimized process control at fstps include physical chemical characteristics of influent e g total solids ts chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n bassan and robbins 2014 research is being conducted into alternatives to laboratory based analysis for fecal sludge but these alternatives are not yet well established and little quantitative research has been done bousek et al 2018 however several interesting correlations between field measurements and laboratory based measurements have been reported for example electrical conductivity ec and ph have been correlated with settling performance and dewatering time of fecal sludge suggesting that these might be possible field measurements to use as indicators of expected solid liquid separation performance gold et al 2018 junglen et al 2020 ward et al 2019 data gathered by questionnaire including containment type i e pit latrine or septic tank presence of household water connection source i e household or commercial and household income have been linked to physical chemical characteristics such as ts and cod in several cities however these correlations are empirical and may differ between cities englund et al 2020 strande et al 2021a strande et al 2018 tembo 2019 expert assessments of color and odor are informally used as indicators of level of sludge stabilization and it is generally believed that perceptible differences in color and odor are linked to different physical chemical properties and dewatering performance hartenstein 1981 schoebitz et al 2016 however the capacity of color and odor to monitor fecal sludge characteristics has to our knowledge never before been quantified and is not well documented in the literature quantifying relationships between possible field measurements and laboratory based measurements is the first step in establishing alternative field based methods but in order get the most utility out of field based measurements predictive models can be employed based on experience using software sensors in the wastewater treatment sector it should be possible to develop predictive models for fecal sludge using the types of field measurements previously discussed dürrenmatt and gujer 2012 tyralis et al 2019 currently operators at fstps do not use predictive models but may use expert knowledge or data collected from emptiers to make decisions about operation process control and maintenance for example mixing sludge from households and public toilets in a pre determined ratio to achieve more consistent settling behavior cofie et al 2006 or varying the dose of polymer flocculant for pit latrine sludge and septic tank sludge based on observations of the differences in their solids contents ward et al 2021 very little research has been published on predicting fecal sludge characteristics however it has been proposed that questionnaire data can be used to model estimated loadings for planning new fstps strande et al 2021a a combination of data driven and mechanistic models based on questionnaire data have demonstrated the ability to predict ts in fecal sludge with the goal of improved citywide planning englund et al 2020 in order for predictive models to reduce dependence on laboratory based characterization of fecal sludge they must be accurate enough for routine monitoring and or process control at fstps however so far no such models have been reported in the literature in this study we use a large dataset that incorporates a combination of analytical field measurements questionnaire data and expert assessments to assess the suitability of predictive models for optimizing fecal sludge treatment the objective of this study was to investigate to what extent predictive models using field measurements can be used as a proxy for laboratory based methods based on a dataset of samples taken from 421 onsite containments in lusaka zambia we present results of field and laboratory data collection and the predictive performance of the models and discuss which models and field measurements would be appropriate for characterizing and monitoring fecal sludge in different scenarios including citywide planning routine fstp operations and real time process control of treatment technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection 465 fecal sludge samples were collected in situ from 421 onsite containments septic tanks and pit latrines throughout the city of lusaka zambia from september to december of 2019 sampling replicates were taken at 8 of containments a sampling plan was developed according to the method described in strande et al 2021a household sampling sites were selected based on a modified version of stratified random sampling including equal proportions of strata based on geological and demographic characteristics in the non sewered part of the city using arcmap software version 10 6 non household sampling sites public toilets offices schools and malls were selected throughout the city based on local expert knowledge questionnaires were administered to the owner tenant or person in charge of operating and maintaining the system at each sampling site questionnaires included questions about designation of containment type toilet type water connection and a number of other factors questions available in si answers were recorded with the kobo toolbox mobile phone app because of the range of sludge consistencies present in lusaka different sampling devices were used to sample from pit latrines and septic tanks a conical metal pit sampler adapted from the design developed by james tembo presented in koottatep et al 2021 was used to sample pit latrines a composite sample was produced using three 1 l samples collected from the bottom or the maximum reach of the sampler 3 m middle and top of the pit after homogenizing the composite sample in a bucket a 0 9 l sample was taken for analysis for septic tanks a 3 m long core sampler adapted from the design from cdd society presented in kootatep et al 2021 was used a composite sample was produced by emptying the contents of the core sampler into a bucket homogenizing the contents and taking a 0 9 l sample for analysis samples were transferred to a cooler for transport to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 c until analysis detailed information about the sampling process along with photographs of the sampling devices is provided in kootatep et al 2021 2 2 sample analysis 2 2 1 sample processing incoming samples were homogenized thoroughly by shaking stirring and were divided into two portions one to be blended before physical chemical characterization and the other to be analyzed for solid liquid separation performance avoiding blending in this case so as to not disrupt any flocs or structure of the sludge which would influence settling and dewatering behavior 2 2 2 physical chemical characterization samples were homogenized in a blender 3 minutes medium setting foam height was measured immediately after blending using a ruler held to the wall of the blender ph ec ts and volatile solids vs were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 2017 density was measured by determining the mass of 25 ml of sample cod was measured using the closed reflux titrimetric method apha 2017 samples that could not be analyzed immediately were preserved by acidifying to ph 2 using h2so4 nh4 n was measured using the phenate method following swirling with activated charcoal and filtration to remove filtrate color and residual turbidity apha 2017 total organic carbon tocsolids and total kjeldahl nitrogen tknsolids were measured on the dried solids as indicators of the potential for resource recovery of the solids e g as a feedstock for composting al muyeed et al 2017 or larvae production gold et al 2020 blended sludge was dried in a 105 c oven for 48 hours and dried solids were analyzed by an external laboratory unza department of soil science tocsolids was measured using the walkely black procedure with the endpoint determined by titrimetric method sparks et al 2020 tknsolids was measured using standard methods cottenie et al 1982 a certified reference material ise 952 clay was used as a quality control standard 2 2 3 qualitative assessment of odor and color odor was assessed during sample processing after stirring before blending samples were allowed to reach room temperature at which point the lid of the sample container was removed and the laboratory technician used standard chemical wafting technique nrc 2010 odors were classified into three categories fresh smells like fresh excreta urine or feces stabilized smells like compost soil or well biodegraded anaerobic digester sludge or middle sample odor falls somewhere between these categories to keep the expert classifications as consistent as possible the same laboratory technician was responsible for all odor classifications color was grouped into three qualitative categories light brown black and medium brown when sample falls somewhere between these categories one laboratory assistant was responsible for all color classifications for consistency 2 2 4 solid liquid separation performance supernatant turbidity was quantified as a metric of settling efficiency following centrifugation at 3 300 g for 20 minutes supernatant was decanted and turbidity was measured using a hach 2100n turbidity meter and reported in ntu adapted from the method described in mikkelsen and keiding 2002 this was intended to represent the maximum possible reduction in suspended solids due to prolonged settling or mechanical solid liquid separation capillary suction time cst was quantified as a metric of filtration time cst was measured using a triton 319 multi cst apparatus with 18 mm funnel according to method 2710 g apha 2017 as adapted in velkushanova et al 2021a cst values are reported in seconds and have been standardized by subtracting the cst of deionized water ts in the dewatered sludge cake was quantified as a metric of maximum solids content achievable by dewatering and was defined as the dry solids content in the dewatered sludge cake after dewatering via centrifugation at 3 300 g for 20 minutes gold et al 2018 supernatant was decanted for turbidity measurement and centrifuge tubes were left standing upside down on an absorbent cloth for 5 minutes to completely remove any free water before transferring solids out of the centrifuge tube for ts characterization samples were screened for consistency and only liquid and slurry samples 225 samples were analyzed for solid liquid separation performance according to designations of sludge consistency presented in velkushanova and strande 2021 2 2 5 color and texture quantification color and texture measurements were taken by analyzing photographs of 10 ml aliquots of sludge to our knowledge this is a novel method developed as an alternative to the standard colorimetric photometric method of color detection it is intended to be used as a field measurement shown in fig 1 10 ml samples of unblended sludge and supernatant after centrifugation when available were poured into 10 ml petri dishes and placed on a white background next to a color checker chart datacolor spydercheckr 24 see figures s1 and s2 in si for additional photographs of the setup samples were photographed in a designated location with consistent led lighting 3 6w led lamps 3000 k warm white color using a panasonic dmc tz70 camera in jpeg format jpeg format was selected over raw in order to enable the broader application of color and texture assessment to photographs collected with smartphone cameras in the future photographs were post processed for color correction using the color checker chart s standard rgb values and assuming cie standard illuminant d65 schanda 2007 the color correction was performed using the python colour library version 0 1 5 using the transformation presented in cheung et al 2004 sludge and supernatant color swatches were manually isolated from the color corrected photographs and the average rgb color was calculated by taking the independent averages of the r g and b values in the swatch the average sludge and supernatant color values were then converted to hue saturation and value hsv texture analysis was performed using texture measures derived from a grey level co occurrence matrix glcm with the python scikit image library version 0 17 2 van der walt et al 2014 six common texture measures were calculated for each photograph contrast dissimilarity homogeneity correlation angular second momentum asm and energy the mathematical descriptions of the texture measures are described in haralick 1979 and hall beyer 2017 all code related to color correction and texture analysis is provided along with the open dataset for this paper link in si 2 2 6 qa qc according to qa qc procedures triplicate laboratory analyses were made for every 10th measurement for cod nh4 n and supernatant turbidity and every 5th measurement for ts vs and ts in the dewatered cake for tocsolids and tknsolids duplicate measurements were made every 7th measurement every cst measurement was replicated four times relative standard error on the replicates

category were considered to be significantly different from one another if the 95 confidence intervals around the medians did not overlap chambers et al 1983 confidence intervals ci were calculated using the formula c i m e d i a n 1 57 i q r n where iqr is the interquartile range and n is the number of data points in the category chambers et al 1983 confidence intervals around the median are represented as notches on boxplots figures s3 and s4 in si 2 4 predictive models cost efficient and simple to execute field measurements were evaluated in this study to determine whether they could be used to predict more costly laboratory based analytical measurements field measurements evaluated as inputs to predictive models are detailed in table 1 questionnaire data is categorical and quantitative expert assessments are categorical qualitative and were assigned by trained laboratory technicians simple analytical measurements are quantitative continuous valued measurements collected using a probe a ruler or a camera although simple analytical measurements were performed in a laboratory as part of this study they are all able to be measured in the field without laboratory equipment and thus are labeled field measurements the laboratory based measurements that are desired outputs of the predictive models target parameters are outlined in table 2 data analysis modelling and visualization was performed using python 3 van rossum and drake 2009 models were implemented in scikit learn version 0 23 2 and statsmodels version 0 12 1 packages in python 3 models along with the complete dataset are available open source with this publication link in si three types of models were evaluated in this study i a simple decision tree model ii a linear regression model and iii a random forest model these models were chosen as they represent a range of complexities and unique advantages and disadvantages simple decision tree models are based on the decision tree presented in strande et al 2021a which uses the median value of the target parameter in a category e g median ts in septic tanks to predict future values in that category simple decision tree models are reflective of the way that operational decisions may currently be made at treatment plants cofie et al 2006 ward et al 2021 they have the advantage of easy interpretation and visualization but predictive capabilities are often poor linear regression models can also be easily interpreted and are good descriptions of systems with linear behavior in contrast random forest models are a widely applied black box machine learning algorithm that can deal with non linearities and interactions but cannot be interpreted directly hastie et al 2009 a thorough description of the specifics for each model type is provided in the si model evaluation took part in two steps a the identification of relevant field measurement inputs for predicting each target laboratory based measurement using a reduced dataset and b the final assessment of the performance of the three model types for each target using expanded datasets model inputs were evaluated using a reduced dataset n 244 comprising all inputs included in table 1 with samples with missing input data removed supernatant color was included as an input for models predicting solid liquid separation performance but not for models predicting physical chemical characteristics as supernatant color data was collected only for the subset of samples that were evaluated for solid liquid separation performance for each target parameter models were generated for every possible combination of maximal four inputs and the performance of each model was evaluated using cross validated r2 and root mean squared error rmse 5 fold cross validation repeated 20 times the input combination with the highest cross validated r2 was considered the best preference was given to models with fewer inputs so if inputs could be removed from the model without a relevant decrease in r2 at two decimal places those inputs were not included in the best model relative importance of inputs was evaluated by comparing the r2 of models built with and without the input the relative strengths of the inputs included in the best models were evaluated by comparing the r2 of single input models the input with the largest r2 was labeled the strongest predictor if the r2 of that model was at least 75 of the r2 of the best multi input model supporting predictors were defined as inputs that are included in the best model and increase the model r2 when included as model inputs along with the strongest predictor detailed information about model performance and input importance are included in the si tables s3 s9 input selection was also dictated by model type the simple decision tree model as defined in strande et al 2021a was designed to use only categorical data so only questionnaire data and expert assessments were used as inputs to this model the linear regression model was evaluated for all inputs questionnaire data expert assessments and simple analytical measurements except the texture parameters dissimilarity and asm these were removed after pre screening for collinearity with other inputs pearson coefficient 0 85 as they were strongly correlated with other texture parameters the random forest model was evaluated for all inputs after the relevant inputs for predicting each target had been identified final model performance was determined for each target the dataset for the final evaluation included only the relevant inputs that were used in the best models of each model type for predicting a specific target in order to maximize the number of data points used to train and evaluate each model this allows the performance of the three model types in predicting a specific target to be compared cross validated r2 and rmse were used in the final performance evaluation 3 results discussion data collected with cost efficient and simple to execute field measurements were used to develop predictive models of the more expensive laboratory based analysis i e physical chemical characteristics and solid liquid separation performance in order to evaluate whether the less expensive methods could be used as proxies or partial replacements in data collection the results and discussion are presented in the order of 1 presentation of the collected field and laboratory based data 2 a comparison of the developed models and best predictors and 3 implications for use in characterization of fecal sludge for different fecal sludge management scenarios including citywide planning routine fstp operations and real time process control of treatment technologies 3 1 overview of characteristics and trends in collected data results of the characterization of fecal sludge from septic tanks and pit latrines are presented in tables 3 and 4 overall the values were highly variable and did not follow a normal distribution which is consistent with other studies strande et al 2021b median and mean field measurements physical chemical characteristics and solid liquid separation performance metrics measured in this study are within the expected range based on reported median and mean values in the literature for sludge from septic tanks and pit latrines in lusaka tembo 2019 tembo et al 2019 kampala uganda englund et al 2020 gold et al 2018 semiyaga et al 2017 dakar senegal gold et al 2016 ward et al 2019 dar es salaam tanzania ward et al 2019 durban south africa radford et al 2015 ouagadougou burkina faso bassan et al 2013 accra ghana heinss et al 1999 bangkok thailand heinss et al 1999 manila philippines heinss et al 1999 and hanoi vietnam englund et al 2020 gold et al 2018 the complete dataset for this study is available open source with this publication https doi org 10 25678 00037x as a first step in developing the predictive models correlations and trends within the data were investigated values for ec foam height color saturation supernatant color saturation texture contrast dissimilarity homogeneity asm energy and correlation supernatant turbidity cst cod nh4 n ts and tocsolids were significantly different for pit latrine and septic tank sludge whereas ph tknsolids and ts in the dewatered cake were not significantly different based on 95 confidence intervals around the medians dependencies between questionnaire categories of containment type toilet type water connection and source exist illustrated in fig 2 there is a dependency between containment type i e pit latrine or septic tank and toilet type i e dry or wet as water is used to convey excreta from toilets to septic tanks whereas water is not required for conveyance to pit latrines in a similar fashion sites that had water connections were also more likely to have septic tanks 55 of households had pit latrines and 45 septic tanks whereas non household establishments had a majority of septic tanks 80 it was surprising that 2 5 of septic tanks were associated with dry toilets and 12 with no water connection this calls into question what people actually mean when they report septic tank and brings attention to the apparent disparity between common assumed definitions of septic tanks and how they are actually defined in the field in the future instead of septic tank and pit latrine descriptors of the actual containment technology for example lined unlined baffled presence of overflow are likely to provide more accurate and globally comparable descriptions johnston and slaymaker 2020 questionnaire results for categories of containment type toilet type water connection and source were related to laboratory based measurements pit latrines dry toilets and sites with no water connection yielded correspondingly less diluted sludge significantly higher median cod nh4 n and ts with poorer settling and filtration performance higher supernatant turbidity and cst septic tanks wet toilets either pour flush or cistern flush and sites with a water connection yielded correspondingly more diluted sludge significantly lower median cod nh4 n and ts with better settling and filtration performance lower supernatant turbidity and cst because of the strong correlations between containment type and toilet type only containment type is further included as a potential model input sludge from households was less diluted higher median cod nh4 n and ts and had poorer settling and filtration performance higher supernatant turbidity and cst compared with sludge from non household sources figures s2 and s3 these results contrast with observations in earlier studies in dakar and dar es salaam where sludge from public toilets non household had poorer settling and dewatering performance than sludge from households ward et al 2019 but agree with observations in kampala that there was a difference between physical chemical properties cod ts of sludge from household and non household sources strande et al 2018 this suggests that source i e household or non household may sometimes be a useful predictor of sludge characteristics but the predictive relationships are different in different cities the expert assessment categories of color and odor show dependencies with each other and with questionnaire categories 98 of fresh smelling samples were light or medium brown while 74 of stabilized smelling samples were black see fig s5 the majority of pit latrine sludge had a fresh or middle odor 79 and was medium or light brown 74 while the majority of septic tank sludge had a stabilized odor 75 and was black 74 see fig s6 the expert assessment categories color and odor were associated with laboratory based measurements there were significant differences in the median supernatant turbidity cst nh4 n ts cod vs and tocsolids between fresh light brown and stabilized black samples figures s2 and s3 interestingly our results support common practitioner wisdom that has to our knowledge not been quantified in the literature fecal sludge with higher organic matter content cod toc vs was associated by odor and color as fresh sludge whereas sludge labeled stabilized had correspondingly significantly lower organic matter fresh sludge also took significantly longer to dewater and had poorer settling performance this corroborates practitioner observations from the field that fresh sludge dewaters and settles more poorly than more stabilized sludge cofie et al 2006 heinss et al 1999 ward et al 2019 this finding is interesting because it offers insight into the transformation of organic matter in sludge as it stabilizes the specific shift from the fresh feces odor to the more stabilized barnyard or manure odor during stabilization is a result of bacterial metabolism of organic acids which produce the smells associated with fresh feces leaving behind phenolic and sulfur containing compounds which are associated with the odor of stabilized feces lin et al 2013 starkenmann 2017 these results can direct future research into the transformation of organic matter in the sludge during stabilization and its effect on fundamental mechanisms controlling dewatering relationships to simple analytical measurements are discussed in detail in section 3 2 2 3 2 comparison of model input combinations and performance the collected data were evaluated to see if field measurements table 1 could be used to predict laboratory based measurements table 2 a range of field measurements were evaluated as inputs in the predictive models including questionnaire data such as containment type i e pit latrine or septic tank source i e household or non household expert assessments such as odor and color qualitative and simple analytical measurements such as ec ph foam height color quantitative texture and supernatant color table 5 summarizes the combinations of field measurements that were selected as relevant inputs in every model type for each target parameter the strongest predictor for each model is shown in black and supporting predictors which increase the model performance when included as model inputs are shown in grey model inputs included in poorly performing models r2 0 2 are shown in light grey the model performance metrics on the right of the figure are cross validated r2 and rmse for models using the highlighted field measurements as inputs since simple decision tree models are based on single inputs the input associated with the highest performing model for each target was designated as the strongest predictor tables showing model prediction accuracy and error depending on the inclusion of different predictors are included in the si tables s3 s9 3 2 1 model performance as seen in table 5 in predicting a given target simple decision tree models did not perform as well while linear regression models and random forest models generally improved model fit and reduced error decision tree models were able to account for 21 51 of the variance in supernatant turbidity cst nh4 n and ts linear models improved on the predictions made by decision tree models for supernatant turbidity cst nh4 n ts and cod with 195 38 178 29 and 112 increases in model fit r2 and 32 15 10 17 and 22 reductions in prediction error rmse respectively random forest models improved on the predictions made by decision tree models for supernatant turbidity cst nh4 n ts and cod with 214 73 200 27 and 112 increases in model fit r2 respectively and 36 30 11 17 and 22 reductions in prediction error rmse respectively random forest models outperformed linear models only in predicting the solid liquid separation performance metrics supernatant turbidity and cst random forest models improved on the predictions made by linear models for supernatant turbidity and cst with 6 and 25 increases in r2 and 5 and 18 reductions in rmse respectively it was unexpected that random forest models did not provide higher accuracy predictions than linear models for most parameters as random forest models are able to capture nonlinear interactions between predictors hastie et al 2009 and nonlinear relationships have been observed in models of nutrients in wastewater effluent castrillo and garcía 2020 it is possible that given access to a larger training dataset random forest model performance could exceed that of linear models something to consider when selecting a predictive model is the trade off between increased predictive power and interpretability of the model simple decision tree models and linear regression models tend to be less flexible and provide less robust predictions for complex nonlinear datasets but it is relatively easy to understand the relationships between a field measurement and the target parameter in contrast nonlinear methods such as random forest models are more flexible and may produce better predictions but at the expense of model interpretability hastie et al 2009 in cases where linear models and random forest models provide comparable predictions linear models may be preferred for their relative simplicity in cases where data will be collected routinely and a dataset will continue to grow in size and complexity random forest models may be preferred for their ability to extract nonlinear relationships from larger datasets 3 2 2 suitability of field predictors although questionnaire data and expert assessments were useful inputs for the decision tree models they were only incrementally helpful to include in the linear and random forest models containment type was the strongest predictor for decision tree models explaining 21 51 of the variance in supernatant turbidity cst nh4 n and ts for all linear and random forest regression models with r2 higher than 0 5 a single field measurement the strongest predictor was responsible for at least 75 of the prediction accuracy black in table 5 although the inclusion of questionnaire data containment type and source did contribute to increased fit for some linear and random forest models the simple analytical parameters were always the strongest predictors for these types of models this indicates that the predictive detail represented by the separation into septic tank and pit latrine or household and non household is largely captured by the differences in the physical chemical compositions of sludge from septic tanks and pit latrines or household and non household sources the simple analytical field measurements may be better model inputs than questionnaire data or expert assessments because they are continuous instead of categorical and are thus able to provide higher resolution information supernatant turbidity and cst were predicted primarily by supernatant color supernatant color contributed 86 and 87 of the linear and random forest model fits respectively in predictions of supernatant turbidity and 75 and 90 of linear and random forest model fits respectively for predictions of cst including texture as an input further improved random forest model predictions of both supernatant turbidity and cst our results support and quantify previous observations of a relationship between qualitatively measured supernatant color and settling and filtration performance in fecal sludge from dakar and dar es salaam ward et al 2019 this relationship is hypothesized to be a result of high concentrations of suspended and soluble organic matter which also contribute to high supernatant turbidity and filter clogging during dewatering ward et al 2019 field measurements can be selected to suit available technical and financial resources although supernatant color was the strongest predictor of supernatant turbidity and cst it may not be an ideal field predictor in every case as it requires settling prior to measurement however settling tests are also simple analytical tests that can be performed in the field with low cost equipment in less than an hour e g imhoff cones or settling columns junglen et al 2020 it is not surprising that supernatant turbidity is strongly related to supernatant color now that this relationship has been quantified for fecal sludge in lusaka it seems promising for estimations of effluent turbidity using color in photographs as a proxy and could replace turbidity measurements where spectrophotometers are not available nh4 n was predicted primarily by ec which contributed 91 and 82 of the linear and random forest model fits respectively the linear model is simple ec ms cm 0 2 nh4 n g l see fig s7 the inclusion of texture and ph in the models further improved predictions there is precedent in the literature for the use of ec as a predictor of ammonia in manure and fecal sludge onsite measurement of ec has been suggested as a good proxy for predicting nutrient concentrations including ammonia nitrogen r2 0 91 in swine manure suresh et al 2009 for fecal sludge from pit latrines and septic tanks in uganda vietnam and japan gold et al 2018 observed a linear correlation r2 0 6 between nh4 n and ec based on these results onsite measurement of ec using a conductivity probe is a promising option for cheaper and less resource intensive monitoring of nh4 n ts was predicted primarily by texture which contributed 81 and 86 of the linear and random forest model fits respectively the inclusion of color quantitative further improved both model types and including containment type additionally improved linear model predictions these results make sense based on scientific knowledge that sludge surfaces gain texture as they dry changing from a smooth liquid to a lumpy slurry to a rough semi solid or solid the physical transformation of sludge as it dries following dewatering has been well characterized for sediment sludges on drying beds and ts has been shown to be predictable to a high level of accuracy r2 0 92 using machine learning based on texture analysis bodun et al 2000 our results indicate that using texture measurements extracted from photographs for prediction of ts could be useful in eliminating the time and equipment intensive laboratory analysis of ts for fecal sludge the target parameters vs tocsolids tknsolids and ts in the dewatered cake were not able to be predicted using any of the models these parameters along with cod for which models were only able to account for 25 of the variation in the data are all associated with the sludge organic matter it appears that the field parameters evaluated in this study are not sufficient to fully characterize and predict the organic components in fecal sludge this is consistent with our previous observations that it was difficult to predict variation in dewatered cake solids and vs in fecal sludge from dakar and dar es salaam ward et al 2019 this was hypothesized to be partly due to the influence of soil and solid waste on measured vs and sludge dewatering behavior a rapid field measurement to predict silica content as a proxy for soil could be a possible solution miller et al 2012 proposed the use of field portable infrared spectrometers to predict silica content in coal dust another possibility could be monitoring organic matter composition using in situ fluorescent sensors this has been demonstrated in the field where cod and soluble cod in the effluent of decentralized wastewater treatment systems were able to be monitored using fluorescence as a proxy measurement mladenov et al 2018 fluorescent sensing may also be able to provide better predictions of the composition and transformation of organic matter in sludge during stabilization fluorescent peaks have been associated with the concentrations of high molecular weight humic substances and other organic matter and thus may be a promising method for monitoring level of stabilization mladenov et al 2018 yao et al 2016 further fundamental understanding of the mechanisms controlling fecal sludge stabilization and dewatering will likely be instructional in identifying possible field predictors models can also be adapted to incorporate new field measurements especially in cases when practitioners have identified them to be operationally relevant for example we found that including density as an input can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the ts model random forest model prediction improves to r2 0 70 rmse 4 8 ds for practitioners who have access to a penetrometer for field density measurements as described in radford and sugden 2014 this could be a valuable field predictor to incorporate 3 3 implications for the field in this study we evaluated three types of models with increasing levels of complexity the selection of the best model for different applications will depend on the required level of accuracy and on the available resources here we explore where and how each model type could be relevant considering several situations where predictive models could be useful for characterization and monitoring as summarized in fig 3 scenario 1 community to citywide planning information provided by simple decision tree models may be adequate for the level of detail required for community to citywide planning incorporating questionnaire data such as containment type into simple decision tree models can already provide a moderate amount of information about sludge characteristics and solid liquid separation performance siting decisions and designs for new fstps are often based on citywide averages of loadings and volumes klinger et al 2019 but it has recently been suggested that incorporating decision tree models to estimate quantities and qualities of fecal sludge accumulating on a neighborhood level would greatly improve projections of loadings for planning of fstps transfer stations and regularly scheduled empting programs strande et al 2021a our study confirms that such an approach would provide an improvement over citywide averages a simple decision tree model based on containment type accounts for 26 of the variance in ts because this application does not require a high resolution prediction decision tree models providing low accuracy predictions r2 of 0 26 for ts maybe be adequate as they are easy to understand conceptually and are in many cases based on information that city planners might already have access to this can include information collected in a shit flow diagram sfd for example prevalence of pit latrines and septic tanks by neighborhood location of water taps or data on housing density or residential commercial land use peal et al 2020 scenario 2 periodic process control of fecal sludge treatment technologies operating a fecal sludge treatment plant requires more refined predictions than citywide planning combining cost efficient and simple field measurements with linear or machine learning models contributes a further improvement in prediction accuracy providing moderate accuracy predictions of ts nh4 n and settling and filtration performance r2 of 0 51 0 66 operators routinely make decisions about how much sludge to load on drying beds and when to remove dewatered dried sludge improvements in consistency of solids loading and shorter more consistent residence times could substantially increase treatment plant capacity and performance klinger et al 2019 seck et al 2015 currently the drying beds at most fstps are operated at constant hydraulic loadings and residence times with no monitoring of influent sludge characteristics klinger et al 2019 as a result of not being able to monitor influent sludge common operational problems due to the variability in influent ts arise these problems include overloaded drying beds clogging and dewatering too slowly and underloaded beds wasting space and decreasing treatment capacity klinger et al 2019 being able to adjust the loading of drying beds based on ts concentrations and dewatering time together with monitoring of ts on the drying beds would increase treatment performance and treatment plant capacity this could be done by incorporation of linear or machine learning models into a smartphone app so that pictures taken with the smartphone would provide estimates of ts concentrations and dewatering time a more simple application could be employed with printed cards with example colors and textures for comparison and decision making von sperling et al 2020a scenario 3 real time continuous process control of fecal sludge treatment technologies the capacity to make rapid predictions based on photos and probe measurements could be a serious game changer for processes requiring real time monitoring online conditioner dosing for advanced settling and dewatering is one example ward et al 2021 the current state of the art in fsm is to adjust polymer dosing flowrates based on containment type pit latrine sludge is dosed at a higher flowrate than septic tank sludge to account for the differences in average ts of sludge in each category ward et al 2021 this method provides insufficient resolution for predictions and it is very difficult to avoid over and under dosing conditioner due to the high variability in sludge characteristics in this case a smartphone app with photo and probe inputs obtained at the treatment facility could be used to monitor ts if the ts value of the influent sludge is 2 ds the random forest model should predict within a range of 0 7 3 3 ds this may be sufficiently high resolution depending on the propensity of the selected conditioner to overdosing for example using a 2000 l mixing tank at a transfer station rhodes dicker et al 2020 and a target polymer conditioner dose of 2 ml g ts an actual dose between 0 7 and 3 3 ml g ts could be achieved see si for calculation this is comparable to the observed optimal dosing window for the conditioner 1 3 ml g ts these models are a proof of concept they will also need to be refined depending on the technology and validated prior to use in other cities currently there is a significant lack of information on fecal sludge characterization to drive the development of predictive models the development of a global database of fecal sludge field measurements uploaded together with laboratory results using standardized methods velkushanova et al 2021b will allow for the continuous improvement of models and global applications of these predictions such an approach has significant potential to provide reliable characterization data and enable real time monitoring

photos color texture and probes ec ph can be used as predictors of fecal sludge characteristics and solid liquid separation performance ts nh4 n settling efficiency and filtration time when combined with linear regression and machine learning models containment type is a good predictor of fecal sludge characteristics and solid liquid separation performance ts nh4 n settling efficiency and filtration time and can be especially helpful for making low resolution predictions when combined with simple decision tree models e g for projecting loadings for fstp design laboratory based measurements associated with the organic matter in the sludge solids cod vs tocsolids tknsolids ts in the dewatered cake could not be predicted using the methods we evaluated a better understanding of the organic matter in fecal sludge and how it relates to solid liquid separation performance is needed to identify good predictors based on this proof of concept which indicates that predictions of characteristics using photographs and probe measurements are possible focus should be placed on validating this approach in other cities the collection of worldwide datasets would allow for global implementation and continuously improving machine learning models our ongoing research includes development of an app for field practitioners that can predict fecal sludge characteristics based on

17068,the impacts of human activities on hydrological connectivity disturb the network topology of transport paths which has gradually evolved from natural terrain features to dual natural artificial features in this study a new framework is proposed to extract information from natural artificial transport paths and related hydrological connectivity dominated by agricultural practices and ditch networks graph theory and connectivity indexes are integrated for the comprehensive classification and the parallel processing of potential flow transport networks and their upstream drainage areas based on high resolution remote sensing data and detailed field investigations this new framework which combines graph theory and connectivity indexes is applied to a typical agriculture intensive catchment in china the results show that artificial factors greatly influence the transport paths and the related drainage areas with the development of ditch construction the hydrological transport paths become shorter and more fragmented in addition key ditch segments are identified by connectivity indexes and recommendations are given for future planning this new framework offers an approach

determination coefficient 1 introduction hydrological connectivity is defined as the degree to water mediated transfer of matter energy and organisms within landscape elements in a system pringle c 2003 bennett 2004 for a specific catchment hydrological connectivity generally refers to the degree to the longitudinal transfer of sediment pollutants and aquatic fauna in the landscapes from upstream to downstream which is related to the confluence process of the catchment ward and stanford 1989a benda et al 2004 meanwhile hydrological connectivity plays a key role in the basin functions such as water allocation basic biogeochemical and nutrient cycling processes and their responses to the disturbance czuba and georgiou 2014 to date this concept has been widely concerned and applied different purposes and emphases have been raised at different temporal spatial scales bondeau et al 2007 smith et al 2010 wada et al 2017 specifically hydrological connectivity of a small scale catchment often focuses on spatial changes in the cascading transport processes of water sediment and pollutants buchanan et al 2013 schmitt et al 2016 assessing hydrological connectivity is crucial to improve our understanding of the spatial heterogeneities in hydrodynamic and geomorphologic processes and enhance the sustainable management and protective construction of catchment nanda et al 2019 sytsma et al 2020 however the phenomenal growth of human activities has significantly modified hydrological connectivity in various ways especially at the small scales benda et al 2004 gurjar and tare 2019 wada et al 2016 over recent decades agricultural water conservancy projects built to satisfy the needs of irrigation and drinking water for rural areas such as channels ponds and ditches greatly alter natural stream flows and natural hydrological connectivity pereira et al 2012 optimal construction of these projects would benefit the regulation of water resources and the prevention of floods knox et al 2012 therein ditches are a traditional and common type of water conservancy projects in the southern china which are interconnected linear features and have shown to impact the function of agrarian watersheds by changing water flow paths in the landscape buchanan et al 2013 wang et al 2020 ditch construction changes natural flow paths or even replaces river network confluence in agriculture intensive catchments liu et al 2020 yeo et al 2019 deng et al 2020 ezzati et al 2020 meanwhile agricultural practices e g tillage that influence preferential pathways for the overland confluence into transport path network should also be considered which can alter drainage processes by rerouting and concentrating landscape derived runoff fressard and cossart 2019 thus traditional transport paths and related hydrological connectivity have gradually evolved from natural features i e topographic characteristics into naturally artificially driven features i e ditch network distribution and tillage patterns combining with topographic characteristics smith and owens 2014 however no approach has been explicitly developed for accurate quantification of natural artificial transport networks and their drainage areas which leads to the limitation of our understanding of hydrological connectivity in this complex network structure mahoney et al 2020a xie et al 2020 in most studies the impacts of artificial factors are often neglected during hydrological connectivity analysis and watershed modeling due to their complexity and hard to quantify properties fressard and cossart 2019 shen et al 2015 xie et al 2020 recent advances in high resolution remote sensing data and geospatial data enable finer spatial illustration of natural artificial elements and several recent studies have utilized the graph theory combined with connectivity indexes a valuable and common mathematical tool to study network topology and the evaluation of corresponding hydrological connectivity affected by artificial factors bolla pittaluga et al 2003 tejedor et al 2015b for instance deng et al 2018 used functional connectivity indexes to explore the contribution of a water gate construction in the taihu plain shao et al 2020 developed a new stream continuity oriented connectivity index to analyze the impacts of dam construction on the change in hydrological connectivity in the pearl river overall most studies have focused on the selection of connectivity indexes to explore the effect of artificial constructions on different river segment riverine landscapes or the overall river network basin liu et al 2019 zheng et al 2013 as far as we know no comprehensive studies have focused on the drainage variations dominated by actual ditch network and their contributions to hydrological connectivity at the small catchment scale thus these knowledge gaps need to be filled to improve future construction and make optimal management decisions in agriculture intensive catchments the main objectives of this paper are to 1 establish a new framework to assessing natural artificial transport paths and hydrological connectivity and 2 explore the effects of ditch networks on transport paths in a typical agriculture intensive catchment the new framework combines graph theory hydrological connectivity indexes and statistical techniques this new framework is utilized to demonstrate the spatiotemporal connectivity distributions at the network scales and to identify the key ditch or river segments in this catchment with valuable management implications moreover future development and other applications of this framework are discussed in this case 2 development of new analysis framework 2 1 framework descriptions and basic assumptions the proposed assessment framework shown in fig 1 integrates the concept of hydrological connectivity by considering the confluence of natural artificial transport paths in a catchment as a spatial network and describing the spatially explicit drainage areas and the linkages between these areas first flow direction in the natural and artificial scenarios and the discriminating factors are recorded based on the acquired data then specific drainage areas of natural artificial transport paths are determined by the comprehensive classification and parallel processing of flow direction next graph theory is applied to abstract the network structure as nodes drainage areas separated by reaches or ditches and edges linkage by upstream and downstream relationships finally hydrological connectivity is analyzed using connectivity indexes to clarify basic definitions are proposed natural transport paths river networks with topographic characteristics that transfer runoff from upstream to downstream artificial transport paths ditch networks with artificial characteristics that transfer runoff from upstream to downstream natural artificial transport paths both river and ditch networks then several assumptions are made assumption 1 main transport paths are ditches and rivers in the agriculture intensive areas and the areas without ditches respectively so the natural artificial networks can be defined as river ditch networks assumption 2 the tillage direction in dry land and the drainage direction in paddy field are both considered as the tillage patterns affected by artificial factors 2 2 detailed steps of the new framework step 1 determination of transport path networks and upstream drainage areas in the natural scenario river networks represent the only transport paths in the whole catchment drainage areas can be defined by variations in hillslope and valley morphology whereas river reaches can be divided by the landscape cross section channel relief and surrounding terrain chen et al 2014 the river network is extracted from a digital elevation map dem using the hydrology module of arcgis the basic principle of this approach is commonly referred as the eight direction d8 flow model as presented in jensen and domingue 1988 the flow direction for the central grid is towards the lowest elevation of eight adjacent grids then the grid is connected by a line and used as river network according to the principle that water always flows downslope however human activities alter natural flow pathways by rerouting and concentrating landscape derived runoff in most agricultural catchments e g ditch construction and tillage patterns robert et al 1998 ditch networks in particular are drainage paths and act as main transport paths in small catchments due to the development of remote sensing techniques and unmanned aerial vehicle high resolution ditch networks can be delineated and the flow direction can be obtained by field investigations another critical issue is the preferential pathways of flow direction affected by tillage patterns as it determines the drainage areas of each transport path many studies have only considered local topography and calculated flow direction according to the slope aspect mahoney et al 2020b however previous observations in souchere et al 1998 showed that the pathways could be influenced by man made factors e g ditch construction and tillage direction especially in the areas with gentle slopes the actual runoff direction was recorded in fifty observation plots the angle between two directions was measured with a compass and the slope was measured with an abney level in this study based on these data an analysis of variance and a discriminant analysis were carried out using the two variables slope intensity and the angle between aspects and tillage directions in order to produce a suitable function for automatically determining runoff direction as shown in the eq 1 the discriminating factor d which uses terrain and tillage direction as parameters enables us to decide whether flow direction is imposed by slope direction or tillage direction 1 d 0 6646 a 0 6669 s where a is the standardized angle between slope aspect and tillage direction and s is the standardized slope d 0 12 indicates that the effect of topography on runoff is greater than that of tillage direction d 0 12 indicates that the effect of tillage direction is greater than that of topography souchere et al 1998 the normalization formula is shown as follows 2 x n x i x m e a n s where xn is the standardized variable of angle or slope xmean is the average value of the variable and s is the standard deviation of the variable flow direction in the natural situation is generated from the d8 algorithm using the hydrology module of arcgis o callaghan and mark 1984 tillage direction in each field is obtained by field investigation and can be converted to raster file using arcgis software based on the flow direction under the natural scenario the area where d values are greater than 0 12 are replaced by the tillage direction in the raster file the final drainage area for each transport path is determined in the hydrology module of arcgis step 2 mathematic construction of a network based on graph theory graph theory is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the network topology newman 2003 which has a long history going back to euler 1736 in solving the konigsberg bridges problem a network is a system that can be abstractly and mathematically represented as a graph whose nodes identify the elements of the system and in which the set of connecting links edges represents the presence of a relation or interaction among the elements barrat et al 2008 cohen and havlin 2010 zheng et al 2013 in this study drainage areas and the linkages between these areas represent the network structure from several upstream nodes to a single downstream outlet via natural artificial paths zheng et al 2013 river segments in the catchment are regarded as natural flow paths in the baseline scenario which only considers topographic features therefore under the natural scenario drainage areas separated by river segments are designed as the nodes and the upstream and downstream relationships between these areas are the edges under the artificial scenario ditch networks become the main artificial paths so flow direction in the ditch networks and drainage areas separated by these ditch segments are designed as edges and nodes respectively fig 2 in general a graph g n e is a collection of nodes n ni i 1 n and edges e uv u v e with the notation uv signifying that the edge connects the nodes u and v tejedor et al 2015a a graph is called a digraph or a directed graph if its edges have directions so the edge pairs uv are ordered tejedor et al 2015a a digraph g can be uniquely specified by an n n adjacency matrix a g describing the specific relationship between nodes which is the basis for the calculation of connectivity indexes 3 a u v 1 i f t h e r e e x i s t s e d g e u v 0 o t h e r w i s e step 3 calculation of hydrological connectivity indexes after constructing the network four indexes network circuitry α edge node ratio β integral index of connectivity iic and node importance index for connectivity diic are determined to represent the complex topology structure of transport paths for the natural and artificial scenarios cases illustrating these four connectivity indexes are shown in the fig 3 the reason for choosing α and β is to show the internal complexity of the transport paths network selecting iic is to represent the overall connectivity of the transport paths network and selecting diic is to identify the key river or ditch segments of this network α is known as the formation ratio of actual loops that is described as the extent to which loops are present in the network cook 2002 deng et al 2018 loops of transport path network are important for hydrological connectivity because they provide alternative flow routes in the catchment that may avoid ponding and overflow the equation of α is shown as follows 4 α m n 1 2 n 5 where α is the network circuitry m is the number of edges in the whole network and n is the number of nodes in the whole network α ranges from 0 to 1 α 0 indicates that there is no closed loop in the transport path network i e no alternative flow route and α 1 indicates that the number of closed loops in the transport path network is maximum i e all the transport paths may have alternative flow routes cook 2002 β is the average quantity of edges connecting each node in the network represents the degree of complex relationship between each drainage area and upstream transport paths in this study deng et al 2018 pedersen et al 1971 it is calculated as follows 5 β m n where β is the edge node ratio m is the number of edges in the whole network and n is the number of nodes in the whole network β 0 3 a larger β value indicates that the number of transport paths joined at the drainage area is greater that is the degree of internal complexity of the transport path network is greater iic is used to assess the overall connectivity of landscape elements in the transport paths network eros et al 2011 pascual hortal and saura 2006 the index ranges from 0 to 1 and increases with improved connectivity this index is sensitive to both landscape area or quality weighted area and connectivity the general equation of the index is as follows 6 i i c i 1 n j 1 n a i a j 1 n l i j a l 2 where n is the total number of nodes ai and aj are the attributes of nodes i and j respectively e g the drainage areas separated by transport paths nlij is the number of links in the shortest path between nodes i and j and al is the maximum landscape attribute e g the total area of the catchment although the iic index provides an estimation of overall degree of connectivity in the landscape it does not provide information about the value of individual elements ribeiro et al 2011 to fill this gap the relative ranking of landscapes by their contribution to the overall value is the useful to aid decision support in future management to calculate the importance of each particular node each particular node is systematically removed and the iic index is recalculated eros et al 2011 diic is the percentage of iic value loss measures delta value namely the contribution of each node to the overall iic value the equation is as follows 7 d i i c i i c i i c i i c 10 where iic and i i c correspond to the iic value before and after the loss of a certain node respectively 3 application to the agriculture intensive catchment 3 1 study area this new framework is tested in the jinglinxi catchment 31 186 31 273 n 108 335 108 375 e which is a typical hilly and agrarian catchment located the north of the three gorges reservoir region tgrr china fig 4 the catchment area is 8 87 km2 and the main land uses are forest 39 2 dry cropland 29 97 paddy land 24 8 and residential land 10 0 elevations in the catchment range from 197 m to 1128 m although the elevation difference is large the central part of this catchment is relatively flat and is ideal for agricultural cultivation lu et al 2019 the catchment is mostly terraced with dry land mainly corn on the upslope and paddy fields in the valley due to the large area of paddy fields many artificial ponds and ditches are constructed for irrigation lu et al 2019 the average annual precipitation in the catchment is 1293 mm and approximately 66 of the annual precipitation occurs between may and september 3 2 data collection and field investigation basic data of this study are as follows dem remote sensing data tillage direction data and the ditch network distribution based on the field investigations dem with 30 m 30 m resolution is obtained from the chinese academy of sciences data http www resdc cn remote sensing data 1 5000 from both 2009 and 2019 are derived from google maps http maps google com land use are based on local information and visual interpretation of the remote sensing data and a land use map with 2 m 2 m resolution a field investigation was carried out in june 2020 and the ovital map tool https www ovital com was used to record the tillage direction in each field and the ditch distribution in the whole catchment finally the distribution map of ditch networks and the tillage direction map in the field were made with arcgis after the investigation roadside ditches are composed of sidewalks and drainage ditches which can effectively prevent the collapse of fertile fields caused by landslides and floods in the catchment as shown in fig 2 roadside ditches are distributed throughout the catchment especially in the lower reaches where there are more farmlands they are approximately 0 4 m deep and 0 35 m wide the tillage direction of dry land is generally perpendicular to the ridge in this study area paddy fields in the catchment are mostly in the form of terraces and outfalls are often established in the middle or on both sides of the ridge for drainage thus the flow direction is assumed to be the tillage direction 3 3 establishment of three scenarios to discuss the impact of human activities on the drainage process three scenarios are established natural scenario s1 only river networks are considered extensive artificial scenario s2 both river and ditch networks are taken as transport paths the remote sensing data from 2009 are used to interpret the network intensive artificial scenario s3 the remote sensing data from 2019 are used and ditch construction in this year can represent the current intensive artificial drainage scenario years of 2009 and 2019 are selected to establish the different scenarios in order to represent the difference of ditch network distribution in this study area ditch network was not widespread in 2009 and become dense in 2019 after reconstruction regarding remote sensing data with high resolution in historical and current images rice fields and dry land are the main land use therefore in this study it is assumed that the dem and land use map do not change and the main change in artificial construction lies in ditch network distributions 3 4 statistical methods regression analysis was done in origin 8 5 to determine the quantitative relationships between diic and ditch density first the outliers are removed which more than three times the standard deviation away from the mean with the test of normality bhandary 1992 then the correlation between these two variables can be analyzed by the coefficient of determination r2 4 results 4 1 results of transport paths and drainage areas in this study the transport paths for the three scenarios were first determined as shown in fig 5 a the natural river network of this study area is dominated by one main stream with several tributaries from the east fig 5b and c further shows the changes in geometry imposed by the ditch networks based on the remote sensing data there are a total of 37 ditch segments 26 13 km with two main ditches in the eastern and western catchments for s2 this ditch network extends southward along the catchment boundary from the intersection in the north in addition there are two auxiliary ditches in the central region for s3 the ditch segments have increased to 89 segments and 34 18 km in the eastern agriculture intensive areas the construction of new ditches follows a typical interlaced pattern of three horizontal and three vertical segments the results indicate significant impacts of artificial factors on the transport path network table 1 based on the d value the areas affected by tillage patterns d 0 12 are 23 95 of the total catchment while the areas affected by both artificial tillage patterns and ditch construction represent 32 1 and 33 59 of the catchment area for s2 and s3 respectively the areas affected by artificial factors have slightly increased with the construction of regional ditches in addition the areas of farmland affected by tillage patterns d 0 12 account for 47 25 of the total farmland area which is located in the southeastern part of the study catchment fig 5 in this sense artificial impacted transport paths are mainly constructed among intensive agricultural areas that are relatively flat with the combined influence of natural and artificial factors the changes in drainage areas under these three scenarios are shown in fig 5 overall the drainage areas of each transport path have ranged from 0 01 2 49 km2 0 01 1 08 km2 and 0 01 1 08 km2 under s1 s2 and s3 respectively indicating that drainage areas have become fragmented with the development of agricultural activities in addition with ditch construction the natural drainage areas have decreased to 27 03 while the artificial drainage areas have increased to 72 97 it is also observed that no large variation in artificial drainage areas exists under s2 and s3 because the additional ditches under s3 are mainly developed from the major ditches under s2 meanwhile the spatial heterogeneity of drainage areas separated by transport paths river or ditch network are significantly different for these three scenarios for s1 the main drainage areas greater than 0 40 km2 are nos 1 3 9 and 19 with the largest drainage area being 2 49 km2 these major natural drainage areas account for 28 07 of the total area indicating that the main stream receives most runoff from the same upstream catchments under the natural scenario however to manage the drainage of those natural catchments the drainage water of original no 3 under the s1 has been split into drainage area no 4 0 46 km2 and no 5 0 66 km2 under the s2 and s3 because more ditches exist in the south of the catchment drainage areas larger than 0 40 km2 nos 15 and 27 under the s2 became smaller with drainage areas smaller than 0 10 km2 under the s3 these results illustrate that drainage areas have generally become fragmented and short distance linear paths have become the main pathways in agriculture intensive catchments as indicated in fig 5 the proportion of farmland in most drainage areas is more than 50 while the proportion of d values greater than 0 12 changed from 0 to 7 under the s2 to 0 93 75 under the s3 indicating that artificial factors have had a greater effect on natural drainages from farmlands drainage area nos 25 35 and 45 have been identified as key drainage areas affected by artificial factors in the s2 and dense ditch regions such as no 62 to no 83 have been identified in the s3 4 2 identification of key nodes for hydrological connectivity the results of integral connectivity are shown in table 1 with graph theory 25 48 and 100 nodes and 24 51 and 136 edges are used for these three scenarios the α index is estimated as 0 under s1 indicating that there is no closed hydrological loop in the natural network the α indexes increase to 0 19 under the s2 and then to 0 44 under the s3 demonstrating that ditch construction increases the closed loops of the transport path network moreover the β indexes are 0 96 1 06 and 1 36 for these three scenarios indicating that the internal complexity of the transport path network increases with the development of ditches in general these results indicate that with more nodes and edges the complexity of transport path networks and related connectivity both increased in addition the iic index is 0 042 0 044 and 0 036 showing no significant change for three scenarios these low values may result from more intensive ditches with unidirectional flow small segments with intensive ditches in the whole network have indirect connectivity with downstream ditch segments for a better comparison nodes are divided into five classes based on the diic values with the ranges of 1 1 5 5 10 10 15 and 15 fig 6 nodes with higher diic values over 10 are considered as key nodes the diic values vary greatly among the transport path segments for these three scenarios generally the diic of nodes located on the edge are lower than those of the central nodes that connect the upstream and downstream under these three scenarios the key nodes with diic values over 15 are nos 7 11 and 8 which comprise 45 94 47 40 and 35 28 of the drainage areas of the total catchment this result indicates that the key nodes increase with proper locations of ditches which can be used as an important implication for ditch construction additionally the diic values show a certain correlation with drainage areas but this relationship is not fully proportional under the s1 the nodes with higher diic values node nos 1 3 9 10 11 14 and 17 are located in the main channels because they receive water from upstream tributaries under the s2 and s3 key nodes are located in the two main top down ditch segments nos 4 and 5 and the central ditch network that connects the boundary of the study catchment nos 17 19 and 23 compared to s2 the integral diic values changed under the s3 due to the additional ditch segments for instance the diic of node no 27 is greater than 15 under the s2 but its importance has decreased under the s3 this indicates that adding new ditches to the previous networks will change the hydrological connectivity meanwhile the diic of node nos 12 13 and 14 decreased under the s3 as the reconstruction of ditch segments in the eastern catchment shifted the centroid in addition the diic of node nos 16 has increased from the s2 to s3 because it is the intermediate node between the upstream and new ditches typically most nodes in the downstream areas have higher diic values above 10 most of new ditch segments under the s3 have lower diic values because of the dense ditches and small drainage areas therefore the balance between ditch density and diic should be considered in future designs 5 discussions 5 1 advantages of the new framework the concept of connectivity describes multiple spatiotemporal scales with a potential nexus between transport and attenuation processes network topology schmitt et al 2016 human activities such as ditches and tillage affect hydrological connectivity and disturb the structure and function of agriculture intensive catchments for example ditches can satisfy irrigation and flood control by altering flow pathways previous studies have highlighted the importance of the role of ditches or plant hedges in arable lands on the interception of runoff reulier et al 2019 with the development of ditches natural drainage and hydrological connectivity have changed to natural artificial drainage for the study catchment the proportion of drainage areas affected by both artificial tillage and ditches is over 32 and the farmland areas affected by tillage patterns account for 47 25 of total farmland areas these results indicate that the final transport paths and drainage areas are significantly influenced by ditches and tillage direction and should be more focused with the fragmentation of the ditch construction however this complex hydrology analysis as well as the following watershed simulation are only based on the d8 algorithm in the most of studies liu et al 2019 zheng et al 2013 therefore the process based hydrological models may have errors in the simulation of runoff and pollutants transportation in the agricultural intensive catchment especially on a small scale to our knowledge there are currently few frameworks that consider both natural and artificial factors for hydrological connectivity analysis koci et al 2020 our proposed framework aims to fill this gap and offers an effective tool for extracting information and indexes from complex natural artificial networks based on this new framework the catchment can be divided into natural artificial transport paths while the classification and parallel processing of potential flow can then be applied in this study in addition to graph theory and hydrological indexes the ditch direction and d value were introduced to judge whether the potential runoff from farmlands is affected by natural topography or artificial factors tillage direction this is the key step in determining the related drainage area of different transport paths the d value was proposed in souchere et al 1998 and was a discriminating factor fitted by the measured data of over 50 plots the diversity in roughness slope and tillage angles was considered for the selection of study plots souchere et al 1998 farmland sites are then observed for a long time with multiple rainfall events and transport paths are then determined by the d values thus the introduction of d promotes the operability of this framework the tillage direction ditch network and related up downstream relationship depend on high precision remote sensing data and detailed field investigations with recent development of advanced remote sensing techniques the accuracy of data supports further depiction of complex networks in this framework chen and zhao 2011 meanwhile arcgis software is utilized to visualize the spatial distribution of transport path network which is easy to operate in general this framework can be applied to the agricultural intensive catchment and extract the connectivity information using very limited input data meanwhile these analysis results provide some indication for complex runoff or pollutants transport processes and connectivity on the network and provide the basic information for the model simulation foltête et al 2016 combined with indexes analysis the key node information has been provided which can support hydrological science and agricultural management otherwise the overall analytical framework with comprehensive classification and parallel processing is also applicable to other network systems such as transportation systems or water distribution systems in other fields if detailed network systems are available 5 2 management implications the proposed framework in this study aims to offer a valuable tool for the analysis and design of transport path networks two categories of human activities are considered in this study one is the tillage direction which affects 23 95 of drainage areas however the tillage direction in arable land is undisciplinable because the opinions of residents must be coordinated lane et al 2009 the other is the ditch network more often ditches are designed to minimize flooding risk by conveying runoff to downstream water bodies buchanan et al 2013 therefore the future planning of ditch construction is mainly carried out in this study from the connectivity analysis ditch construction can be improved from two aspects one alternative is to modify the existing ditch segments from a spatial perspective diic can be utilized to choose the segments for modification based on the joint consideration of connectivity and the functions of ditch networks the higher diic is the more important this segment would be in transport path networks thus these ditch segments should not be truncated to maintain the network structures after the identification of key nodes various modifications can be adopted depending on their location or practicality over the upstream catchments the key river segments nos 1 3 and 7 can be regularly artificial dredging to increase their capacity of mitigating floods key segments nos 18 and 27 located around the arable lands can be modified as ecological segments to manage agricultural flood and nonpoint source pollution another alternative is to adjust the spatial distribution of ditch segments wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 ditch density a type of landscape index that is estimated as the ratio of the surface area of ditches to their drainage areas can be introduced for the optimal design of ditch networks levavasseur et al 2012 for the study area the spatial distribution of ditch density for each segment is shown in fig 7 new ditches should be added in those areas with less ditch density such as drainage area nos 2 and 15 meanwhile fig 7 shows that ditch density is correlated with diic but they are not fully proportional in fact the correlation between these two items is observed as a power function based on the results when ditch densities change from 0 02 to 1 25 diic ranges from 0 05 32 31 meanwhile if the ditch densities are between 0 and 0 20 diic mostly concentrates at 0 10 this indicates that the connectivity can be maintained if the ditch density is set within this range the proper ditch density proposed in this section provides a comprehensive adjustment of spatial distribution and a more cost effective placement of ditches in general the corresponding measures and suggestions about future ditch construction should be implemented dominated by the government sectors and should be carried out considering the wishes of the residents on the one hand the government sectors need to pay more attention to the key river and ditch segments where measures imposed with regular dredging and maintenance to prevent them from being damaged by agricultural activities or being filled up during land consolidation schmitt et al 2016 on the other hand long term monitoring of key ditch segments should be implemented rationally by local farmers who given incentives which are beneficial to improve measures in order to deal with and prevent seasonal changes and extreme flood risks in this catchment deng et al 2018 shao et al 2020 6 conclusion and future suggestions in this study a new assessment framework has been developed to explore the hydrological connectivity of a complex natural artificial transport path network this framework is applied in a typical agricultural intensive catchment of the southern china the results highlight that the impact of artificial factors on drainage processes which become more significant with the development of ditch constructions meanwhile connectivity indexes analysis reveals the fragmentation of natural artificial transport path network and identifies the central ditch segments and the major river segments as the key nodes in this catchment this application demonstrates that this framework is applicable as a valuable assessment method of hydrological connectivity for this study case furthermore graph theory and discriminating factors are suitable for any system of transport path networks notably this framework can be extended to other agriculture intensive catchments based on its comprehensive classification and parallel processing of potential flow affected by natural or artificial factors the structure of the drainage process is not only the basis of watershed delineation in many hydrological models but also has a critical impact on the simulation of the watershed function such as the prevention of nonpoint source pollution a better understanding of natural artificial water transport paths and drainage process would contribute to better simulation and management of agricultural regions this study can be seen as the beginning of hydrological connectivity of complex transport path network in agriculture intensive catchments future works are suggested as follows first dual numerical simulation should be created as a tool of parallel processing in agriculture intensive landscapes second the related landscape indexes and spatial optimization algorithm should be introduced to the design of ditch networks third the function of ditches such as flood control and water quality protection are suggested to be introduced as components of hydrological connectivity declaration of competing interest all the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

17068,the impacts of human activities on hydrological connectivity disturb the network topology of transport paths which has gradually evolved from natural terrain features to dual natural artificial features in this study a new framework is proposed to extract information from natural artificial transport paths and related hydrological connectivity dominated by agricultural practices and ditch networks graph theory and connectivity indexes are integrated for the comprehensive classification and the parallel processing of potential flow transport networks and their upstream drainage areas based on high resolution remote sensing data and detailed field investigations this new framework which combines graph theory and connectivity indexes is applied to a typical agriculture intensive catchment in china the results show that artificial factors greatly influence the transport paths and the related drainage areas with the development of ditch construction the hydrological transport paths become shorter and more fragmented in addition key ditch segments are identified by connectivity indexes and recommendations are given for future planning this new framework offers an approach for the hydrological connectivity analysis of complex networks and provides effective strategies for agricultural development graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrological

determination coefficient 1 introduction hydrological connectivity is defined as the degree to water mediated transfer of matter energy and organisms within landscape elements in a system pringle c 2003 bennett 2004 for a specific catchment hydrological connectivity generally refers to the degree to the longitudinal transfer of sediment pollutants and aquatic fauna in the landscapes from upstream to downstream which is related to the confluence process of the catchment ward and stanford 1989a benda et al 2004 meanwhile hydrological connectivity plays a key role in the basin functions such as water allocation basic biogeochemical and nutrient cycling processes and their responses to the disturbance czuba and georgiou 2014 to date this concept has been widely concerned and applied different purposes and emphases have been raised at different temporal spatial scales bondeau et al 2007 smith et al 2010 wada et al 2017 specifically hydrological connectivity of a small scale catchment often focuses on spatial changes in the cascading transport processes of water sediment and pollutants buchanan et al 2013 schmitt et al 2016 assessing hydrological connectivity is crucial to improve our understanding of the spatial heterogeneities in hydrodynamic and geomorphologic processes and enhance the sustainable management and protective construction of catchment nanda et al 2019 sytsma et al 2020 however the phenomenal growth of human activities has significantly modified hydrological connectivity in various ways especially at the small scales benda et al 2004 gurjar and tare 2019 wada et al 2016 over recent decades agricultural water conservancy projects built to satisfy the needs of irrigation and drinking water for rural areas such as channels ponds and ditches greatly alter natural stream flows and natural hydrological connectivity pereira et al 2012 optimal construction of these projects would benefit the regulation of water resources and the prevention of floods knox et al 2012 therein ditches are a traditional and common type of water conservancy projects in the southern china which are interconnected linear features and have shown to impact the function of agrarian watersheds by changing water flow paths in the landscape buchanan et al 2013 wang et al 2020 ditch construction changes natural flow paths or even replaces river network confluence in agriculture intensive catchments liu et al 2020 yeo et al 2019 deng et al 2020 ezzati et al 2020 meanwhile agricultural practices e g tillage that influence preferential pathways for the overland confluence into transport path network should also be considered which can alter drainage processes by rerouting and concentrating landscape derived runoff fressard and cossart 2019 thus traditional transport paths and related hydrological connectivity have gradually evolved from natural features i e topographic characteristics into naturally artificially driven features i e ditch network distribution and tillage patterns combining with topographic characteristics smith and owens 2014 however no approach has been explicitly developed for accurate quantification of natural artificial transport networks and their drainage areas which leads to the limitation of our understanding of hydrological connectivity in this complex network structure mahoney et al 2020a xie et al 2020 in most studies the impacts of artificial factors are often neglected during hydrological connectivity analysis and watershed modeling due to their complexity and hard to quantify properties fressard and cossart 2019 shen et al 2015 xie et al 2020 recent advances in high resolution remote sensing data and geospatial data enable finer spatial illustration of natural artificial elements and several recent studies have utilized the graph theory combined with connectivity indexes a valuable and common mathematical tool to study network topology and the evaluation of corresponding hydrological connectivity affected by artificial factors bolla pittaluga et al 2003 tejedor et al 2015b for instance deng et al 2018 used functional connectivity indexes to explore the contribution of a water gate construction in the taihu plain shao et al 2020 developed a new stream continuity oriented connectivity index to analyze the impacts of dam construction on the change in hydrological connectivity in the pearl river overall most studies have focused on the selection of connectivity indexes to explore the effect of artificial constructions on different river segment riverine landscapes or the overall river network basin liu et al 2019 zheng et al 2013 as far as we know no comprehensive studies have focused on the drainage variations dominated by actual ditch network and their contributions to hydrological connectivity at the small catchment scale thus these knowledge gaps need to be filled to improve future construction and make optimal management decisions in agriculture intensive catchments the main objectives of this paper are to 1 establish a new framework to assessing natural artificial transport paths and hydrological connectivity and 2 explore the effects of ditch networks on transport paths in a typical agriculture intensive catchment the new framework combines graph theory hydrological connectivity indexes and statistical techniques this new framework is utilized to demonstrate the spatiotemporal connectivity distributions at the network scales and to identify the key ditch or river segments in this catchment with valuable management implications moreover future development and other applications of this framework are discussed in this case 2 development of new analysis framework 2 1 framework descriptions and basic assumptions the proposed assessment framework shown in fig 1 integrates the concept of hydrological connectivity by considering the confluence of natural artificial transport paths in a catchment as a spatial network and describing the spatially explicit drainage areas and the linkages between these areas first flow direction in the natural and artificial scenarios and the discriminating factors are recorded based on the acquired data then specific drainage areas of natural artificial transport paths are determined by the comprehensive classification and parallel processing of flow direction next graph theory is applied to abstract the network structure as nodes drainage areas separated by reaches or ditches and edges linkage by upstream and downstream relationships finally hydrological connectivity is analyzed using connectivity indexes to clarify basic definitions are proposed natural transport paths river networks with topographic characteristics that transfer runoff from upstream to downstream artificial transport paths ditch networks with artificial characteristics that transfer runoff from upstream to downstream natural artificial transport paths both river and ditch networks then several assumptions are made assumption 1 main transport paths are ditches and rivers in the agriculture intensive areas and the areas without ditches respectively so the natural artificial networks can be defined as river ditch networks assumption 2 the tillage direction in dry land and the drainage direction in paddy field are both considered as the tillage patterns affected by artificial factors 2 2 detailed steps of the new framework step 1 determination of transport path networks and upstream drainage areas in the natural scenario river networks represent the only transport paths in the whole catchment drainage areas can be defined by variations in hillslope and valley morphology whereas river reaches can be divided by the landscape cross section channel relief and surrounding terrain chen et al 2014 the river network is extracted from a digital elevation map dem using the hydrology module of arcgis the basic principle of this approach is commonly referred as the eight direction d8 flow model as presented in jensen and domingue 1988 the flow direction for the central grid is towards the lowest elevation of eight adjacent grids then the grid is connected by a line and used as river network according to the principle that water always flows downslope however human activities alter natural flow pathways by rerouting and concentrating landscape derived runoff in most agricultural catchments e g ditch construction and tillage patterns robert et al 1998 ditch networks in particular are drainage paths and act as main transport paths in small catchments due to the development of remote sensing techniques and unmanned aerial vehicle high resolution ditch networks can be delineated and the flow direction can be obtained by field investigations another critical issue is the preferential pathways of flow direction affected by tillage patterns as it determines the drainage areas of each transport path many studies have only considered local topography and calculated flow direction according to the slope aspect mahoney et al 2020b however previous observations in souchere et al 1998 showed that the pathways could be influenced by man made factors e g ditch construction and tillage direction especially in the areas with gentle slopes the actual runoff direction was recorded in fifty observation plots the angle between two directions was measured with a compass and the slope was measured with an abney level in this study based on these data an analysis of variance and a discriminant analysis were carried out using the two variables slope intensity and the angle between aspects and tillage directions in order to produce a suitable function for automatically determining runoff direction as shown in the eq 1 the discriminating factor d which uses terrain and tillage direction as parameters enables us to decide whether flow direction is imposed by slope direction or tillage direction 1 d 0 6646 a 0 6669 s where a is the standardized angle between slope aspect and tillage direction and s is the standardized slope d 0 12 indicates that the effect of topography on runoff is greater than that of tillage direction d 0 12 indicates that the effect of tillage direction is greater than that of topography souchere et al 1998 the normalization formula is shown as follows 2 x n x i x m e a n s where xn is the standardized variable of angle or slope xmean is the average value of the variable and s is the standard deviation of the variable flow direction in the natural situation is generated from the d8 algorithm using the hydrology module of arcgis o callaghan and mark 1984 tillage direction in each field is obtained by field investigation and can be converted to raster file using arcgis software based on the flow direction under the natural scenario the area where d values are greater than 0 12 are replaced by the tillage direction in the raster file the final drainage area for each transport path is determined in the hydrology module of arcgis step 2 mathematic construction of a network based on graph theory graph theory is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the network topology newman 2003 which has a long history going back to euler 1736 in solving the konigsberg bridges problem a network is a system that can be abstractly and mathematically represented as a graph whose nodes identify the elements of the system and in which the set of connecting links edges represents the presence of a relation or interaction among the elements barrat et al 2008 cohen and havlin 2010 zheng et al 2013 in this study drainage areas and the linkages between these areas represent the network structure from several upstream nodes to a single downstream outlet via natural artificial paths zheng et al 2013 river segments in the catchment are regarded as natural flow paths in the baseline scenario which only considers topographic features therefore under the natural scenario drainage areas separated by river segments are designed as the nodes and the upstream and downstream relationships between these areas are the edges under the artificial scenario ditch networks become the main artificial paths so flow direction in the ditch networks and drainage areas separated by these ditch segments are designed as edges and nodes respectively fig 2 in general a graph g n e is a collection of nodes n ni i 1 n and edges e uv u v e with the notation uv signifying that the edge connects the nodes u and v tejedor et al 2015a a graph is called a digraph or a directed graph if its edges have directions so the edge pairs uv are ordered tejedor et al 2015a a digraph g can be uniquely specified by an n n adjacency matrix a g describing the specific relationship between nodes which is the basis for the calculation of connectivity indexes 3 a u v 1 i f t h e r e e x i s t s e d g e u v 0 o t h e r w i s e step 3 calculation of hydrological connectivity indexes after constructing the network four indexes network circuitry α edge node ratio β integral index of connectivity iic and node importance index for connectivity diic are determined to represent the complex topology structure of transport paths for the natural and artificial scenarios cases illustrating these four connectivity indexes are shown in the fig 3 the reason for choosing α and β is to show the internal complexity of the transport paths network selecting iic is to represent the overall connectivity of the transport paths network and selecting diic is to identify the key river or ditch segments of this network α is known as the formation ratio of actual loops that is described as the extent to which loops are present in the network cook 2002 deng et al 2018 loops of transport path network are important for hydrological connectivity because they provide alternative flow routes in the catchment that may avoid ponding and overflow the equation of α is shown as follows 4 α m n 1 2 n 5 where α is the network circuitry m is the number of edges in the whole network and n is the number of nodes in the whole network α ranges from 0 to 1 α 0 indicates that there is no closed loop in the transport path network i e no alternative flow route and α 1 indicates that the number of closed loops in the transport path network is maximum i e all the transport paths may have alternative flow routes cook 2002 β is the average quantity of edges connecting each node in the network represents the degree of complex relationship between each drainage area and upstream transport paths in this study deng et al 2018 pedersen et al 1971 it is calculated as follows 5 β m n where β is the edge node ratio m is the number of edges in the whole network and n is the number of nodes in the whole network β 0 3 a larger β value indicates that the number of transport paths joined at the drainage area is greater that is the degree of internal complexity of the transport path network is greater iic is used to assess the overall connectivity of landscape elements in the transport paths network eros et al 2011 pascual hortal and saura 2006 the index ranges from 0 to 1 and increases with improved connectivity this index is sensitive to both landscape area or quality weighted area and connectivity the general equation of the index is as follows 6 i i c i 1 n j 1 n a i a j 1 n l i j a l 2 where n is the total number of nodes ai and aj are the attributes of nodes i and j respectively e g the drainage areas separated by transport paths nlij is the number of links in the shortest path between nodes i and j and al is the maximum landscape attribute e g the total area of the catchment although the iic index provides an estimation of overall degree of connectivity in the landscape it does not provide information about the value of individual elements ribeiro et al 2011 to fill this gap the relative ranking of landscapes by their contribution to the overall value is the useful to aid decision support in future management to calculate the importance of each particular node each particular node is systematically removed and the iic index is recalculated eros et al 2011 diic is the percentage of iic value loss measures delta value namely the contribution of each node to the overall iic value the equation is as follows 7 d i i c i i c i i c i i c 10 where iic and i i c correspond to the iic value before and after the loss of a certain node respectively 3 application to the agriculture intensive catchment 3 1 study area this new framework is tested in the jinglinxi catchment 31 186 31 273 n 108 335 108 375 e which is a typical hilly and agrarian catchment located the north of the three gorges reservoir region tgrr china fig 4 the catchment area is 8 87 km2 and the main land uses are forest 39 2 dry cropland 29 97 paddy land 24 8 and residential land 10 0 elevations in the catchment range from 197 m to 1128 m although the elevation difference is large the central part of this catchment is relatively flat and is ideal for agricultural cultivation lu et al 2019 the catchment is mostly terraced with dry land mainly corn on the upslope and paddy fields in the valley due to the large area of paddy fields many artificial ponds and ditches are constructed for irrigation lu et al 2019 the average annual precipitation in the catchment is 1293 mm and approximately 66 of the annual precipitation occurs between may and september 3 2 data collection and field investigation basic data of this study are as follows dem remote sensing data tillage direction data and the ditch network distribution based on the field investigations dem with 30 m 30 m resolution is obtained from the chinese academy of sciences data http www resdc cn remote sensing data 1 5000 from both 2009 and 2019 are derived from google maps http maps google com land use are based on local information and visual interpretation of the remote sensing data and a land use map with 2 m 2 m resolution a field investigation was carried out in june 2020 and the ovital map tool https www ovital com was used to record the tillage direction in each field and the ditch distribution in the whole catchment finally the distribution map of ditch networks and the tillage direction map in the field were made with arcgis after the investigation roadside ditches are composed of sidewalks and drainage ditches which can effectively prevent the collapse of fertile fields caused by landslides and floods in the catchment as shown in fig 2 roadside ditches are distributed throughout the catchment especially in the lower reaches where there are more farmlands they are approximately 0 4 m deep and 0 35 m wide the tillage direction of dry land is generally perpendicular to the ridge in this study area paddy fields in the catchment are mostly in the form of terraces and outfalls are often established in the middle or on both sides of the ridge for drainage thus the flow direction is assumed to be the tillage direction 3 3 establishment of three scenarios to discuss the impact of human activities on the drainage process three scenarios are established natural scenario s1 only river networks are considered extensive artificial scenario s2 both river and ditch networks are taken as transport paths the remote sensing data from 2009 are used to interpret the network intensive artificial scenario s3 the remote sensing data from 2019 are used and ditch construction in this year can represent the current intensive artificial drainage scenario years of 2009 and 2019 are selected to establish the different scenarios in order to represent the difference of ditch network distribution in this study area ditch network was not widespread in 2009 and become dense in 2019 after reconstruction regarding remote sensing data with high resolution in historical and current images rice fields and dry land are the main land use therefore in this study it is assumed that the dem and land use map do not change and the main change in artificial construction lies in ditch network distributions 3 4 statistical methods regression analysis was done in origin 8 5 to determine the quantitative relationships between diic and ditch density first the outliers are removed which more than three times the standard deviation away from the mean with the test of normality bhandary 1992 then the correlation between these two variables can be analyzed by the coefficient of determination r2 4 results 4 1 results of transport paths and drainage areas in this study the transport paths for the three scenarios were first determined as shown in fig 5 a the natural river network of this study area is dominated by one main stream with several tributaries from the east fig 5b and c further shows the changes in geometry imposed by the ditch networks based on the remote sensing data there are a total of 37 ditch segments 26 13 km with two main ditches in the eastern and western catchments for s2 this ditch network extends southward along the catchment boundary from the intersection in the north in addition there are two auxiliary ditches in the central region for s3 the ditch segments have increased to 89 segments and 34 18 km in the eastern agriculture intensive areas the construction of new ditches follows a typical interlaced pattern of three horizontal and three vertical segments the results indicate significant impacts of artificial factors on the transport path network table 1 based on the d value the areas affected by tillage patterns d 0 12 are 23 95 of the total catchment while the areas affected by both artificial tillage patterns and ditch construction represent 32 1 and 33 59 of the catchment area for s2 and s3 respectively the areas affected by artificial factors have slightly increased with the construction of regional ditches in addition the areas of farmland affected by tillage patterns d 0 12 account for 47 25 of the total farmland area which is located in the southeastern part of the study catchment fig 5 in this sense artificial impacted transport paths are mainly constructed among intensive agricultural areas that are relatively flat with the combined influence of natural and artificial factors the changes in drainage areas under these three scenarios are shown in fig 5 overall the drainage areas of each transport path have ranged from 0 01 2 49 km2 0 01 1 08 km2 and 0 01 1 08 km2 under s1 s2 and s3 respectively indicating that drainage areas have become fragmented with the development of agricultural activities in addition with ditch construction the natural drainage areas have decreased to 27 03 while the artificial drainage areas have increased to 72 97 it is also observed that no large variation in artificial drainage areas exists under s2 and s3 because the additional ditches under s3 are mainly developed from the major ditches under s2 meanwhile the spatial heterogeneity of drainage areas separated by transport paths river or ditch network are significantly different for these three scenarios for s1 the main drainage areas greater than 0 40 km2 are nos 1 3 9 and 19 with the largest drainage area being 2 49 km2 these major natural drainage areas account for 28 07 of the total area indicating that the main stream receives most runoff from the same upstream catchments under the natural scenario however to manage the drainage of those natural catchments the drainage water of original no 3 under the s1 has been split into drainage area no 4 0 46 km2 and no 5 0 66 km2 under the s2 and s3 because more ditches exist in the south of the catchment drainage areas larger than 0 40 km2 nos 15 and 27 under the s2 became smaller with drainage areas smaller than 0 10 km2 under the s3 these results illustrate that drainage areas have generally become fragmented and short distance linear paths have become the main pathways in agriculture intensive catchments as indicated in fig 5 the proportion of farmland in most drainage areas is more than 50 while the proportion of d values greater than 0 12 changed from 0 to 7 under the s2 to 0 93 75 under the s3 indicating that artificial factors have had a greater effect on natural drainages from farmlands drainage area nos 25 35 and 45 have been identified as key drainage areas affected by artificial factors in the s2 and dense ditch regions such as no 62 to no 83 have been identified in the s3 4 2 identification of key nodes for hydrological connectivity the results of integral connectivity are shown in table 1 with graph theory 25 48 and 100 nodes and 24 51 and 136 edges are used for these three scenarios the α index is estimated as 0 under s1 indicating that there is no closed hydrological loop in the natural network the α indexes increase to 0 19 under the s2 and then to 0 44 under the s3 demonstrating that ditch construction increases the closed loops of the transport path network moreover the β indexes are 0 96 1 06 and 1 36 for these three scenarios indicating that the internal complexity of the transport path network increases with the development of ditches in general these results indicate that with more nodes and edges the complexity of transport path networks and related connectivity both increased in addition the iic index is 0 042 0 044 and 0 036 showing no significant change for three scenarios these low values may result from more intensive ditches with unidirectional flow small segments with intensive ditches in the whole network have indirect connectivity with downstream ditch segments for a better comparison nodes are divided into five classes based on the diic values with the ranges of 1 1 5 5 10 10 15 and 15 fig 6 nodes with higher diic values over 10 are considered as key nodes the diic values vary greatly among the transport path segments for these three scenarios generally the diic of nodes located on the edge are lower than those of the central nodes that connect the upstream and downstream under these three scenarios the key nodes with diic values over 15 are nos 7 11 and 8 which comprise 45 94 47 40 and 35 28 of the drainage areas of the total catchment this result indicates that the key nodes increase with proper locations of ditches which can be used as an important implication for ditch construction additionally the diic values show a certain correlation with drainage areas but this relationship is not fully proportional under the s1 the nodes with higher diic values node nos 1 3 9 10 11 14 and 17 are located in the main channels because they receive water from upstream tributaries under the s2 and s3 key nodes are located in the two main top down ditch segments nos 4 and 5 and the central ditch network that connects the boundary of the study catchment nos 17 19 and 23 compared to s2 the integral diic values changed under the s3 due to the additional ditch segments for instance the diic of node no 27 is greater than 15 under the s2 but its importance has decreased under the s3 this indicates that adding new ditches to the previous networks will change the hydrological connectivity meanwhile the diic of node nos 12 13 and 14 decreased under the s3 as the reconstruction of ditch segments in the eastern catchment shifted the centroid in addition the diic of node nos 16 has increased from the s2 to s3 because it is the intermediate node between the upstream and new ditches typically most nodes in the downstream areas have higher diic values above 10 most of new ditch segments under the s3 have lower diic values because of the dense ditches and small drainage areas therefore the balance between ditch density and diic should be considered in future designs 5 discussions 5 1 advantages of the new framework the concept of connectivity describes multiple spatiotemporal scales with a potential nexus between transport and attenuation processes network topology schmitt et al 2016 human activities such as ditches and tillage affect hydrological connectivity and disturb the structure and function of agriculture intensive catchments for example ditches can satisfy irrigation and flood control by altering flow pathways previous studies have highlighted the importance of the role of ditches or plant hedges in arable lands on the interception of runoff reulier et al 2019 with the development of ditches natural drainage and hydrological connectivity have changed to natural artificial drainage for the study catchment the proportion of drainage areas affected by both artificial tillage and ditches is over 32 and the farmland areas affected by tillage patterns account for 47 25 of total farmland areas these results indicate that the final transport paths and drainage areas are significantly influenced by ditches and tillage direction and should be more focused with the fragmentation of the ditch construction however this complex hydrology analysis as well as the following watershed simulation are only based on the d8 algorithm in the most of studies liu et al 2019 zheng et al 2013 therefore the process based hydrological models may have errors in the simulation of runoff and pollutants transportation in the agricultural intensive catchment especially on a small scale to our knowledge there are currently few frameworks that consider both natural and artificial factors for hydrological connectivity analysis koci et al 2020 our proposed framework aims to fill this gap and offers an effective tool for extracting information and indexes from complex natural artificial networks based on this new framework the catchment can be divided into natural artificial transport paths while the classification and parallel processing of potential flow can then be applied in this study in addition to graph theory and hydrological indexes the ditch direction and d value were introduced to judge whether the potential runoff from farmlands is affected by natural topography or artificial factors tillage direction this is the key step in determining the related drainage area of different transport paths the d value was proposed in souchere et al 1998 and was a discriminating factor fitted by the measured data of over 50 plots the diversity in roughness slope and tillage angles was considered for the selection of study plots souchere et al 1998 farmland sites are then observed for a long time with multiple rainfall events and transport paths are then determined by the d values thus the introduction of d promotes the operability of this framework the tillage direction ditch network and related up downstream relationship depend on high precision remote sensing data and detailed field investigations with recent development of advanced remote sensing techniques the accuracy of data supports further depiction of complex networks in this framework chen and zhao 2011 meanwhile arcgis software is utilized to visualize the spatial distribution of transport path network which is easy to operate in general this framework can be applied to the agricultural intensive catchment and extract the connectivity information using very limited input data meanwhile these analysis results provide some indication for complex runoff or pollutants transport processes and connectivity on the network and provide the basic information for the model simulation foltête et al 2016 combined with indexes analysis the key node information has been provided which can support hydrological science and agricultural management otherwise the overall analytical framework with comprehensive classification and parallel processing is also applicable to other network systems such as transportation systems or water distribution systems in other fields if detailed network systems are available 5 2 management implications the proposed framework in this study aims to offer a valuable tool for the analysis and design of transport path networks two categories of human activities are considered in this study one is the tillage direction which affects 23 95 of drainage areas however the tillage direction in arable land is undisciplinable because the opinions of residents must be coordinated lane et al 2009 the other is the ditch network more often ditches are designed to minimize flooding risk by conveying runoff to downstream water bodies buchanan et al 2013 therefore the future planning of ditch construction is mainly carried out in this study from the connectivity analysis ditch construction can be improved from two aspects one alternative is to modify the existing ditch segments from a spatial perspective diic can be utilized to choose the segments for modification based on the joint consideration of connectivity and the functions of ditch networks the higher diic is the more important this segment would be in transport path networks thus these ditch segments should not be truncated to maintain the network structures after the identification of key nodes various modifications can be adopted depending on their location or practicality over the upstream catchments the key river segments nos 1 3 and 7 can be regularly artificial dredging to increase their capacity of mitigating floods key segments nos 18 and 27 located around the arable lands can be modified as ecological segments to manage agricultural flood and nonpoint source pollution another alternative is to adjust the spatial distribution of ditch segments wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 ditch density a type of landscape index that is estimated as the ratio of the surface area of ditches to their drainage areas can be introduced for the optimal design of ditch networks levavasseur et al 2012 for the study area the spatial distribution of ditch density for each segment is shown in fig 7 new ditches should be added in those areas with less ditch density such as drainage area nos 2 and 15 meanwhile fig 7 shows that ditch density is correlated with diic but they are not fully proportional in fact the correlation between these two items is observed as a power function based on the results when ditch densities change from 0 02 to 1 25 diic ranges from 0 05 32 31 meanwhile if the ditch densities are between 0 and 0 20 diic mostly concentrates at 0 10 this indicates that the connectivity can be maintained if the ditch density is set within this range the proper ditch density proposed in this section provides a comprehensive adjustment of spatial distribution and a more cost effective placement of ditches in general the corresponding measures and suggestions about future ditch construction should be implemented dominated by the government sectors and should be carried out considering the wishes of the residents on the one hand the government sectors need to pay more attention to the key river and ditch segments where measures imposed with regular dredging and maintenance to prevent them from being damaged by agricultural activities or being filled up during land consolidation schmitt et al 2016 on the other hand long term monitoring of key ditch segments should be implemented rationally by local farmers who given incentives which are beneficial to improve measures in order to deal with and prevent seasonal changes and extreme flood risks in this catchment deng et al 2018 shao et al 2020 6 conclusion and future suggestions in this study a new assessment framework has been developed to explore the hydrological connectivity of a complex natural artificial transport path network this framework is applied in a typical agricultural intensive catchment of the southern china the results highlight that the impact of artificial factors on drainage processes which become more significant with the development of ditch constructions meanwhile connectivity indexes analysis reveals the fragmentation of natural artificial transport path network and identifies the central ditch segments and the major river segments as the key nodes in this catchment this application demonstrates that this framework is applicable as a valuable assessment method of hydrological connectivity for this study case furthermore graph theory and discriminating factors are suitable for any system of transport path networks notably this framework can be extended to other agriculture intensive catchments based on its comprehensive classification and parallel processing of potential flow affected by natural or artificial factors the structure of the drainage process is not only the basis of watershed delineation in many hydrological models but also has a critical impact on the simulation of the watershed function such as the prevention of nonpoint source pollution a better understanding of natural artificial water transport paths and drainage process would contribute to better simulation and management of agricultural regions this study can be seen as the beginning of hydrological connectivity of complex transport path network in agriculture intensive catchments future works are suggested as follows first dual numerical simulation should be created as a tool of parallel processing in agriculture intensive landscapes second the related landscape indexes and spatial optimization algorithm should be introduced to the design of ditch networks third the function of ditches such as flood control and water quality protection are suggested

17069,the transport of microplastics in porous media is attracting increasing attention however to date research is limited to polystyrene microplastics meanwhile surfactants can promote solid dispersion to form a stable suspension possibly allowing microplastics to migrate when attached to a surfactant which would increase the scope and degree of microplastic pollution further endangering human health and the stability of the ecological environment therefore in this study the transport behavior of microplastics in porous media was explored in the presence of surfactants herein polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp were evaluated while dispersed by two ionic surfactants cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs the influence of different factors surfactant concentration ionic strength ph flow rate and multivalent cations on the transport of microplastics in porous media was explored via quartz sand packed column experiments our experimental results show that the transport abilities of pe and pp increased with increasing surfactant concentration when the surfactant concentration was less than the critical micelle concentration cmc in the presence of ctab and sdbs physicochemical factors had different effects on the transport of microplastics mainly by controlling zeta potential advection diffusion and cmc the mobility of pe and pp decreased with increasing ionic strength cation valence and ph and decreasing flow rate however the mobility of pe and pp under ctab is much greater than that of pe and pp under sdbs because quartz sand can absorb more ctab molecules through electrostatic attraction to weaken the collision between microplastics and quartz sand further the transport ability of pp was greater than that of pe under all conditions considered notably the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory formed by adding osmotic elastic and hydrophobic force could well described the migration behavior of microplastics in ctab and sdbs well this research highlights that surfactant has a significant impact on the transport ability of microplastics and provides a comprehensive understanding of the migration and fate behaviors of microplastics affected by surfactants which is necessary to prevent and reduce the environmental hazards of microplastics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polyethylene polypropylene surfactant transport 1 introduction plastics are an important basic material that offer great convenience to human production and life derraik 2002 unfortunately plastics in the environment are broken into very small pieces through photothermal degradation biodegradation mechanical wear and other methods their small size and relatively large surface area make them easy to attach water soluble organic pollutants and plasticizer leaching is considered toxic teuten et al 2009 therefore there is growing concern regarding plastic fragments smaller than 5 mm in diameter defined as microplastics numerous studies over the past decade have shown that these microplastics are widespread and ubiquitous in the environment for example plastic particles have been found in 233 marine organisms worldwide sutherland et al 2010 the pollution of microplastics in land especially soil are also of growing concern some researchers have pointed out that the abundance of microplastics present on land may be 4 23 times that of the oceans and the annual input of microplastics in farmland soil far exceeds the input into the global ocean guo et al 2020 horton et al 2017 qi et al 2020 therefore the transport and fate of microplastics in underground environment has received more and more attention however to best of our knowledge almost all current researches are limited to exploring the transport of polystyrene ps microplastics a plastic microsphere with a specific spherical structure and suspension characteristics huang et al 2021 studies have shown that the transport behavior of ps in porous media is the same as that of other colloids and has a higher mobility in porous media with higher ph flow rate and water content but lower is valence and particle size huang et al 2021 johnson 2020 sadri et al 2017 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2020 however there is no research on polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp plastics used in daily life pe and pp plastic particles are insoluble in water and float on the surface because of their low density and strong hydrophobicity even when broken into microplastics they do not easily migrate in mediums with water flow therefore researchers tend to ignore the migration behavior of pe and pp microplastics that may occur with water flow in the medium surfactants are amphiphilic compounds that contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties microplastics as a kind of hydrophobic material easily combine with the hydrophobic chains of surfactant molecules then the hydrophilic moieties of the surfactant are exposed to the outside making the microplastic more hydrophilic for example a small amount of surfactant was added during the preparation of a polystyrene plastic suspension to improve its suspendability kaewtatip and tanrattanakul 2008 some reports have stated that surfactants promote the dispersion of solids to form a stable suspension which increases the suspension performance of solid particles through the steric hindrance and surface covering especially water insoluble nanoparticles such as silica titanium dioxide and aluminum oxide hu et al 2020 zareei et al 2018 other studies have shown that surfactants can also play a role in enhancing the transport of carbon nanotubes lu et al 2013 titanium dioxide godinez et al 2013 silver nanoparticles hedberg et al 2012 and hydroxyapatite nanoparticles wang et al 2014 in porous media therefore the presence of surfactants in the environment is most likely to cause the transport of pe and pp microplastics thereby aggravating the environmental hazards of microplastics to date however the effect of surfactants on pe and pp microplastic transport in porous media has not studied the concentrations of various surfactants that exist in urban wastewater and freshwater are generally in the range of 20 70 mg l 1 and ionic surfactants are the most common kume et al 2008 wang et al 2014 however the concentrations of surfactants in industrial wastewater ranges from mg l 1 to g l 1 narkis and ben david 1985 the long term application of this industrial wastewater can improve the concentration of surfactants in the soil water system surfactants can exist stably in the environment for 7 to 22 days petrović and barceló 2004 therefore the surfactant concentration in the environment may be high enough to suspend the microplastics and promote the migration of microplastics in this study we selected pe and pp microplastics as the research objects studying their transport behavior of microplastics in porous media in the presence of ionic surfactants cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab representing a positively charged surfactant and anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs representing a negatively charged surfactant herein the specific objectives are as follows 1 explore the effect of surfactant on the transport of pe and pp microplastics in porous media 2 reveal the influence of surfactant concentration ph ionic strength is flow rate and cation valence on the transport behavior of pe and pp microplastics in the presence of surfactants and 3 clarify the difference between the effects of cationic surfactants and anionic surfactants on the transport of pe and pp microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials herein pe and pp microplastics 2000 mesh were purchased from china united plastics co ltd and the densities of pe and pp were 0 96 g cm3 and 0 91 g cm3 respectively the microplastic suspension was prepared by adding 300 mg of pe or pp powder to 1 l of distilled water at the desired sdbs or ctab concentrations 100 mg l 1 200 mg l 1 300 mg l 1 500 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 followed by stirring for 5 min and sonicating for 30 min using an ultrasonic cleaner kq 500de kunshan ultrasonic instrument company china to ensure a homogeneous suspension as previous reports have determined that the surfactant concentration in wastewater is 20 70 mg l 1 kume et al 2008 wang et al 2014 we used a surfactant concentration of 20 mg l 1 in our preliminary experiments with a microplastic content the range of 0 25 mg l 1 the microplastics concentration was determined by turbidimetry 350 nm wavelength using a linear correlation between absorbance and the microplastics concentration figure s1 yin et al 2010 however as the absorbance value was small inevitable impurities in the quartz sand column affected the absorbance value determination in addition when the concentration of microplastics was greater than 50 mg l 1 the suspension performance of microplastics began to decrease figure s2 therefore 300 mg l 1 was selected as the concentration of the microplastics after various repeated trials and the concentration of the surfactant was increased accordingly to obtain a microplastic surfactant mixed suspension suitable for subsequent transportation sdbs and ctab were purchased from guangdong guanghua technology co ltd china the molecular weights of sdbs and ctab are 348 g mol 1 and 364 g mol 1 respectively and their critical micelle concentrations cmc are 490 and 330 mg l 1 respectively cifuentes et al 1997 jiao et al 2018 microplastic suspensions under different conditions were prepared using 300 mg l 1 surfactant and 300 mg l 1 microplastics microplastic suspensions of varying iss of 0 1 m kcl 0 01 m kcl 0 001 m kcl were created wherein each suspension s initial ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 conversely microplastic suspensions with different ph values 4 7 and 9 were produced using hcl or naoh in addition microplastic suspensions with different multivalent cations mgcl2 cacl2 and alcl3 were prepared wherein each had an is of 0 001 m the background solution was prepared with surfactant solutions of different concentrations iss ph values and multivalent cations the zeta potential and particle size of the microplastics in the solutions with different iss ph values and multivalent cations were measured using a zeta plus analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk their particle size range was found to be 3000 nm 6000 nm under different conditions table s1 the surface morphology and surface elements of the microplastic were examined using a scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds s 4800 hitachi japan the sem image figure s3 clearly shows that pe and pp are granular and the surface of pe is flatter than pp further based on the energy spectrum the surface of the microplastics was over 98 5 carbon revealing that no oxidation occurred based on the brunner emmet teller bet method the specific surface area of the microplastics was measured using a surface pore size analyzer tristar ii micromeritics co usa the specific surface areas of pe and pp were found to be 0 31 m2 g 1 and 3 3 m2 g 1 respectively 2 2 column experiment the quartz sand 10 20 mesh used in transport tests was supplied by zhouzhi county quartz sand ltd china it was washed with distilled water treated with 0 1 m hcl for 24 h then treated with 0 1 m naoh for another 24 h washed with distilled water again and oven dried at 105 c the zeta potential of the quartz sand was measured using a zeta plus analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk using the method described by johnson et al 1996 as shown in table 1 the zeta potential of quartz sand is negative in a solution without surfactants it is positive in ctab and negative in sdbs a column with an inner diameter of 3 cm and a height of 15 cm was packed with quartz sand and used for the column experiments the quartz sand was wet packed using distilled water with a glass stirring rod to minimize layering and to remove air entrapments in the column sun et al 2010 the porosity of the packed column was determined to be 0 45 and the pore volume pv was 48 ml prior to the column experiment the quartz sand column was flushed with distilled water at a maximum flow rate 4 ml min 1 until the effluent did not contain any visible impurities next the flow rate was adjusted to 2 ml min 1 via a constant flow pump and continuously flushed for 2 h then the distilled water was replaced with the background solution with the appropriate corresponding surfactant concentrations 100 mg l 1 200 mg l 1 300 mg l 1 500 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 iss 0 1 m 0 01 m and 0 001 m kcl ph 4 7 and 9 and multivalent cations mg2 ca2 and al3 to stabilize the experimental conditions next the background solution was quickly exchanged to a 1 2 pv microplastic suspension with the same surfactant concentrations iss phs and multivalent cations finally the background solution was used and rinsed until the microplastic suspension in the effluent was zero similarly the microplastics transport tests at different flow rates were conducted according to the aforementioned steps the microplastic suspension 300 mg l 1 surfactant and 300 mg l 1 microplastics was injected into the column for a pv of 1 2 at different flow rates 1 ml min 1 2 ml min 1 and 3 ml min 1 in these experiments the microplastic suspensions were injected into the quartz sand column while stirring the effluent from the column was continuously collected in test tubes using an automatic fraction collector bs 16a lcd shanghai huxi analysis instrument factory co ltd china the microplastic concentration was determined by measuring the light absorption at a wavelength of 350 nm via turbidimetry yin et al 2010 the calibration curve was used to quantify the relationship between the concentration of pe or pp 0 to 350 mg l 1 and absorbance and the r2 value from the standard curve of pe ctab pp ctab pe sdbs and pp sdbs were 0 9998 0 9996 0 9994 and 0 9995 respectively figure s4 the absorbance of sdbs and ctab at 350 nm was zero all column experiments were performed in parallel in duplicate 2 3 mathematical model the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory was used to explain the transport and deposition behavior of microplastics adsorbing surfactants in porous media under various experimental conditions the xdlvo energy etot was

discussion 3 1 effect of surfactants concentration on the transport of microplastics in porous media the breakthrough curves of the pe and pp microplastics with different concentrations of surfactants ctab and sdbs are shown in fig 1 pure pe and pp microplastics are extremely difficult to migrate due to their strong hydrophobicity it can be seen from fig 1 that pe and pp have a certain migration ability in the presence of surfactants the zeta potential table 1 of pe and pp microplastics is positive in the presence of ctab and negative in sdbs indicating that pe and pp microplastics have positive charges under ctab and negative charges under sdbs this is consistent with the charge of the hydrophilic groups of ctab and sdbs this is because that surfactants are amphiphilic molecules and microplastics are hydrophobic substances thus the hydrophobic tail chains of the surfactants are attached to the hydrophobic surface of the microplastic due to the hydrophobic effect while the hydrophilic head groups of the surfactants are connected to the water phase lu et al 2014 therefore microplastics are enveloped by surfactant molecules so that the surface of the microplastics has a certain degree of hydrophilicity and can be suspended in the solution thereby promoting the migration of the microplastics previous studies have also shown that the surfactant adsorbed on the surface of the colloid will increase the electrostatic and steric repulsion forces to improve the stability and transport of the colloid wang et al 2014 the breakthrough curves of the pe and pp microplastics under different ctab concentrations are displayed in fig 1a 1b the transport ability of pe and pp at high surfactant concentrations is higher than that at low concentrations the effluent recovery of pe at surfactant concentrations of 100 200 300 500 and 1000 mg l 1 are 5 6 5 5 50 91 49 01 and 43 89 respectively and the effluent recovery of pp were 35 35 47 36 69 08 62 82 and 61 35 respectively table 2 the transport ability of pe and pp is not significantly improved when the concentration of surfactant exceeds 300 mg l 1 further increasing the concentration of the surfactant did not promote the transport of the microplastics but slightly inhibited it it can be found from table 1 that the zeta potential of pe at ctab concentrations of 100 200 300 500 and 1000 mg l 1 are 45 78 53 41 68 65 69 21 and 68 03 mv respectively while those of pp were 47 69 63 15 79 48 78 22 and 78 98 mv respectively and the zeta potential on the surface of quartz sand is also positive studies have pointed out that the zeta potential on the colloidal surface is related to the stability of the colloidal particles in the porous medium wang et al 2016 the large absolute value of zeta potential will not only strengthen the repulsive force between colloid and colloid but also strengthen the electrostatic repulsion between colloid and quartz sand resulting in a strong migration ability of colloidal particles in the porous medium liang et al 2013 in addition the particle size of the microplastics does not change significantly under the ctab concentration of 300 1000 mg l 1 table s1 the particle size and zeta potential suggest that the migration ability of microplastics is basically the same after ctab is greater than 300 mg l 1 according to previous studies the surfactant forms an ordinary monolayer on the hydrophobic solid surface similar to those observed at the air water interface and the surfactant become increasingly erect at the surface with the surfactant concentration increasing until the adsorption is stabilized around the cmc tiberg et al 1999 this indicates that the surface of microplastics cannot be completely covered by surfactants when the concentration of the surfactant is less than that of the cmc the cmc of ctab is 330 mg l 1 the ctab molecules attached to pe and pp microplastics have reached saturation when ctab is greater than 300 mg l 1 jiao et al 2018 tiberg et al 1999 thus the zeta potential and particle size of the microplastics both reach a stable range even if the ctab concentration increases it will not promote the migration of the microplastics meanwhile ctab molecules will spontaneously form micelles in the solution when ctab is greater than 300 mg l 1 and the micelles existing in the solution may hinder the migration of microplastics hedberg et al 2012 shen et al 2021 the breakthrough curves of pe and pp under different sdbs concentrations are shown in figs 1c and d respectively the transport behavior of pe and pp is similar to that of those under ctab increasing the concentration of sdbs in the solution cannot improve the migration ability of pe and pp microplastics especially when the concentration is greater than 300 mg l 1 it will inhibit its migration the reason is also similar to the effect of ctab on pe and pp after the sdbs concentration is greater than 300 mg l 1 the zeta potential of pe and pp does not change significantly so the stability of pe and pp microplastics in solution and the electrostatic repulsion between microplastics and quartz sand are no longer significantly different liang et al 2013 while the cmc of sdbs is 490 mg l 1 cifuentes et al 1997 and micelles are also formed in the solution to inhibit the migration of microplastics hedberg et al 2012 shen et al 2021 simultaneously it can be found that pp s migration ability in porous media is greater than that of pe in the presence of different types of surfactants this is mainly related to the specific surface areas of pe and pp of which specific surface area of pp 3 3 m2 g 1 is much larger than that of pe 0 31 m2 g 1 in addition as shown in the sem analysis figure s3 that the surface of pp is rougher than that of pe and there are more recessed structures this greater area and recessed structures allow for relatively many sites for surfactant binding on pp therefore the absolute value of the zeta potential of pp is greater than that of pe table 1 and the stability of pp in solution is higher than that of pe so that the migration ability of pp is stronger than that of pe 3 2 effect of ctab on the transport of microplastics in porous media according to the experimental results of different surfactant concentrations on the transport of microplastics in porous media we selected a surfactant concentration of 300 mg l 1 to carry out the effects of different physical and chemical factors on the transport of microplastics in porous media the breakthrough curves of pe and pp in a saturated quartz sand column affected by iss flow rates ph and cation valences are shown in fig 2 the transport abilities of pe and pp gradually decrease with increasing is in the presence of ctab especially when the is is 0 1 m which makes their outflow almost zero according to the mass balance calculations the effluent recovery of pe with iss of 0 001 m 0 01 m and 0 1 m were 36 04 22 46 and 1 80 respectively table 2 and the effluent recovery of pp were 56 16 39 78 and 12 95 respectively as summarized in tables 1 the zeta potentials of the pe and pp microplastics and quartz sand surfaces decrease with increasing is which indicates that the stability of pe and pp microplastics in solution has decreased then the weakening of the electrostatic repulsion on the surfaces of the microplastics and quartz sand also reduces the migration ability of the microplastics in the medium liang et al 2013 the combination of microplastics and surfactant molecules is similar to micelles in which the hydrophobic long chain is located inside and the hydrophilic group is located outside lu et al 2014 and the micelle also has an electric double layer in the solution fernandez pena et al 2020 therefore the electric double layer formed by the surfactant molecules on the microplastic surface is compressed as the ionic strength in the solution increases resulting in a decrease in the microplastic zeta potential fernandez pena et al 2020 furthermore another reason why the migration ability of microplastics decreases with the increase of is may be that the increase of the counter ion in the solution will reduce the cmc of the surfactant yekeen et al 2017 making the surfactant molecules easily form micelles after detaching from the surface of microplastics and quartz sand during the transport of microplastics thereby lowering the transport ability of microplastics this possibility will lead to a decrease in the surfactant molecules attached to the surface of the pe and quartz sand and causes the zeta potential of pe or pp microplastics to decrease therefore the suspension of pe or pp in the solution during the migration process not only becomes worse but also makes it easier for pe or pp to deposit on the surface of quartz sand the presence of common cations ca2 mg2 and al3 reduces the migration ability of pe and pp fig 2c 2d which decreases as the cation valence increases as shown in table 1 the absolute value of the zeta potential of the microplastics in ca2 mg2 and al3 solutions decreases with the increase of the cation valence indicating that the stability of microplastics decreases with increasing valence the effluent recovery of pe at ca2 mg2 and al3 were 25 06 33 77 and 18 07 respectively while those of pp were 37 15 44 55 and 33 61 respectively the effect of different cations on the migration behavior of microplastics is similar to that of other colloids and the multivalent cations are more capable of inhibiting the mobility of colloids in porous media than monovalent cations zhang et al 2017 however most studies use negatively charged colloids as the valence of the cation increases the stability of the colloid decreases and the migration ability decreases wang et al 2016 the microplastics have a positive charge under ctab in other words this will make the zeta potential of the microplastics surface should increase with the increase of the cation valence but the zeta potential of the microplastics should decrease with the increase of the cation valence the positive charge on the surface of the pe or pp microplastics and quartz sand is derived from the charge carried by the surfactant it is speculated that the surfactant molecules may be separated from the surface of the microplastics previous studies have pointed out that the micelles aggregation behavior in high valent cation solutions conforms to the schulze hardy rule and cations with higher valence have higher colloidal coagulation capabilities which means the critical micelle concentration of surfactants decreases and micelles are more easily formed under higher cations wang et al 2018 yekeen et al 2017 therefore the absolute value of the zeta potential of the microplastics in the trivalent aluminum solution is the smallest it may also be because that the surfactant molecules form more micelles in the solution so that the number of surfactant molecules bound to the surface is minimal resulting in the worst migration ability of pe and pp microplastics in addition some studies have shown that multivalent and monovalent cations deposited on the surface of quartz sand will cause differences in colloidal transport behavior attributed to bridging effects wang et al 2018 in the high valence state the bridging effect is more obvious to hinder the migration of colloidal in the porous medium fan et al 2015 wang et al 2018 ca2 and mg2 which have the same valence have different effects on the migration of pe and pp the inhibition of pe and pp transport by ca2 is stronger than that of mg2 this is mainly because ca2 not only has stronger flocculation ability than mg2 yang et al 2016 and the bridging effect is stronger than mg2 xia et al 2019 under the same conditions the transport capacity of pp is greater than that of pe as previously mentioned pp has a larger specific surface area than pe allowing it to attach more surfactant molecules as listed in table 2 the zeta potential of pe is significantly greater than that of pp indicating the electrostatic repulsion of the quartz sand surface on pe microplastics is weaker than that of pp which is also one of the reasons why pp more easily migrates in porous media the cationic surfactant ctab is a quaternary ammonium salt that is relatively stable in acid and alkali solutions therefore change in ph will not affect the activity of the surfactant gao et al 2016 however as can be seen in fig 2e 2f as ph increases the migration capacity of pe and pp in porous media gradually decreases and the effluent recovery of pe at ph values of 4 7 and 9 are 54 42 50 37 and 39 79 respectively while those of pp are 73 39 69 08 and 59 67 respectively from the comparison of the zeta potentials of microplastics and quartz sand tables 1 it was found that the zeta potentials of the microplastic and quartz sand surfaces decrease with increasing ph indicating that the repulsive force between microplastics and quartz sand is reduced making microplastics more likely to deposit on the surface of quartz sand under alkaline conditions in addition the stability of pp in a surfactant solution is greater than that of pe due to the difference in structure and pp has a stronger migration ability than pe at different ph values the breakthrough curves of pe and pp affected by the flow rate in porous media are shown in fig 2g 2h the migration ability of pe and pp increase with increasing flow rate which is consistent with the migration behavior of most colloids affected by the flow rate the migration ability of the colloid also increases as the flow rate increases wang et al 2016 the recoveries of pe at flow rate of 1 2 3 ml min 1 are 15 99 50 91 and 52 79 respectively and the recoveries of pp were 16 66 69 08 and 91 21 respectively table 2 the advection diffusion increases the contact collision efficiency between the microplastics and the quartz sand as the flow rate decreases thereby inhibiting the mobility of the microplastics taghavy et al 2013 the mobility of pe and pp at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 is significantly weaker than that of 2 and 3 ml min 1 this indicates that the collision efficiency between the moving microplastics and the medium may be more important than expected under relatively low flow rates similarly to other factors pp has a stronger migration ability than pe under different flow rates because the stability of pp in the surfactant solution is greater than that of pe the ade model was used to simulate the transport breakthrough curves of pe and pp microplastic transport in the presence of ctab the results fit our experimental data very well indicating that the migration of microplastics in porous media is consistent with the migration characteristics of colloids in the presence of ctab liu et al 2013 the best fit values for the fitting parameters i e k and smax and r2 are summarized in table s2 the change trends of the optimal fitted smax values for the microplastics are also consistent with the experimental results for example the best smax and k values of the microplastics with high iss were higher than those of microplastics with low iss moreover insignificant changes in the smax and k values after ctab concentrations exceeded 300 mg l 1 indicated that the microplastics were relatively insensitive to changes in the ctab concentration at high concentrations 3 3 effect of sdbs on the transport of microplastics in porous media in the presence of sdbs the transport behaviors of pe and pp affected by different iss flow rates ph values and cationic valences are similar to that of ctab fig 3 for instance the migration capacity decreases with increasing is wherein pp is affected less than pe the pe and pp can both be well suspended in the presence of sdbs and the zeta potentials of pe pp and quartz sand are all negative table 1 according to the classic dlvo theory pe and pp should also have better migration ability however pe and pp show very low migration abilities under the experimental conditions compared with ctab c c0 0 2 and the fitting result of the ade model to the experimental data of pe or pp microplastic transport in the presence of sdbs is not very good compared to ctab table s2 the osmotic and elastic properties of the surfactant should also be considered when the surfactant is adsorbed on the surface of the medium due to the long chain structure of the surfactant molecule li et al 2018 therefore pe and pp microplastics are not only subjected to electrostatic force but also subjected to elastic repulsive force and membrane force during the process of approaching the quartz sand surface meanwhile the hydrophobic attraction generated by the quartz sand and microplastics must be considered when the distance between the microplastics and the surface of the quartz sand is less than the thickness of the attached surfactants molecular layer the hydrophilic group of ctab is positively charged in the solution while the quartz sand is generally negatively charged therefore under the electrostatic force the positively charged hydrophilic group binds to the negatively charged quartz sand surface exposing the hydrophobic group to the solution and binding the hydrophobic group of the surfactant in the solution to this hydrophobic group via hydrophobic interactions thus the quartz sand surface is covered with 2 layers of surfactant one layer developed by electrostatic attraction and the other by hydrophobic effects sun et al 2015 this can be confirmed by the data listed in table 1 wherein it is clear that the zeta potential of the quartz sand surface is positive in the presence of ctab this means that there are three layers of surfactant molecules between the microplastics and the quartz sand to prevent their collisions including one layer on the surface of the microplastic and two layers on the surface of the quartz sand for sdbs it cannot be adsorbed on the surface of quartz sand due to electrostatic repulsion only the surface of the microplastic is covered with a single layer of surfactant molecules in addition the spatial structure of sdbs is much more complex than that of ctab sdbs is not packed as tightly as ctab on the surface of microplastics due to the existence of a benzene ring lu et al 2014 thus the collision process between microplastics and quartz sand not only reduces the elastic repulsion and membrane force but also makes it easier for sdbs molecules to escape from the surface of microplastics the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory is used to explain the migration and deposition behavior of microplastics adsorbing surfactants in porous media in the presence of surfactants the interaction energy between the microplastics and quartz sand is calculated using the xdlvo theory as illustrated in fig 4 the results show that the xdlvo interaction energy matches the experimental data well in the presence of sdbs the interaction energy between microplastics and quartz sand is basically negative indicating that the pe and pp microplastics are extremely unstable in the quartz sand column and that brownian motion is sufficient to overcome the energy barrier to permanently deposit on the surface of the quartz sand chrysikopoulos et al 2017 in the presence of ctab the interaction energy between the microplastics and quartz sand is positive and the energy barrier value is high indicating the microplastics in the quartz sand column have high stability and are not easily deposited on the surface of quartz sand in addition the transport behavior of microplastics under different factors is consistent with the interaction energy of xdlvo these observations indicate that the osmotic and elastic forces generated by ctab are much greater than those of sdbs which makes the migration of microplastics in ctab stronger 4 conclusions in this study the common microplastics pe and pp were used as research objects and the influence of different factors surfactant concentration is ph flow rate and cation valence on the migration of microplastics in saturated media was explored it was found that two surfactants had a notable influence on the transport ability of microplastics the mobilities of pe and pp under ctab were much greater than those under sdbs in the presence of ctab and sdbs the transport behaviors of pe and pp affected by different iss flow rates ph values and cation valences all showed similar patterns in particular the migration ability decreased as the is valence and ph increased and the flow rate decreased the transport ability of microplastics in ctab was much greater than that in sdbs and the xdlvo theory describes this phenomenon well pp has a greater migration ability than pe under all experimental conditions which is mainly attributable to its rougher and larger specific surface area which adsorbs more surfactant molecules this study found that applying surfactants can greatly enhance the suspension and mobility of pe and pp although the concentrations of surfactants and microplastics used in this study are far greater than those in the actual environment the migration behavior of microplastics herein has certain reference significance for example different surfactant types have different effects on the surface properties of microplastics which significantly impact the retention and transportation of microplastics especially cationic surfactants ctab not only harms soil quality but also has a much greater ability to promote migration of microplastics than sbds in the future further research is needed to explore that microplastics accelerate the capture of pollutants in groundwater and increase their environmental

17069,the transport of microplastics in porous media is attracting increasing attention however to date research is limited to polystyrene microplastics meanwhile surfactants can promote solid dispersion to form a stable suspension possibly allowing microplastics to migrate when attached to a surfactant which would increase the scope and degree of microplastic pollution further endangering human health and the stability of the ecological environment therefore in this study the transport behavior of microplastics in porous media was explored in the presence of surfactants herein polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp were evaluated while dispersed by two ionic surfactants cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs the influence of different factors surfactant concentration ionic strength ph flow rate and multivalent cations on the transport of microplastics in porous media was explored via quartz sand packed column experiments our experimental results show that the transport abilities of pe and pp increased with increasing surfactant concentration when the surfactant concentration was less than the critical micelle concentration cmc in the presence of ctab and sdbs physicochemical factors had different effects on the transport of microplastics mainly by controlling zeta potential advection diffusion and cmc the mobility of pe and pp decreased with increasing ionic strength cation valence and ph and decreasing flow rate however the mobility of pe and pp under ctab is much greater than that of pe and pp under sdbs because quartz sand can absorb more ctab molecules through electrostatic attraction to weaken the collision between microplastics and quartz sand further the transport ability of pp was greater than that of pe under all conditions considered notably the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory formed by adding osmotic elastic and hydrophobic force could well described the migration behavior of microplastics in ctab and sdbs well this research highlights that surfactant has a significant impact on the transport ability of microplastics and provides a comprehensive understanding of the migration and fate behaviors of microplastics affected by surfactants which is necessary to prevent and reduce the environmental hazards of microplastics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polyethylene polypropylene surfactant transport 1 introduction plastics are an important basic material that offer great convenience to human production and life derraik 2002 unfortunately plastics in the environment are broken into very small pieces through photothermal degradation biodegradation mechanical wear and other methods their small size and relatively large surface area make them easy to attach water soluble organic pollutants and plasticizer leaching is considered toxic teuten et al 2009 therefore there is growing concern regarding plastic fragments smaller than 5 mm in diameter defined as microplastics numerous studies over the past decade have shown that these microplastics are widespread and ubiquitous in the environment for example plastic particles have been found in 233 marine organisms worldwide sutherland et al 2010 the pollution of microplastics in land especially soil are also of growing concern some researchers have pointed out that the abundance of microplastics present on land may be 4 23 times that of the oceans and the annual input of microplastics in farmland soil far exceeds the input into the global ocean guo et al 2020 horton et al 2017 qi et al 2020 therefore the transport and fate of microplastics in underground environment has received more and more attention however to best of our knowledge almost all current researches are limited to exploring the transport of polystyrene ps microplastics a plastic microsphere with a specific spherical structure and suspension characteristics huang et al 2021 studies have shown that the transport behavior of ps in porous media is the same as that of other colloids and has a higher mobility in porous media with higher ph flow rate and water content but lower is valence and particle size huang et al 2021 johnson 2020 sadri et al 2017 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2020 however there is no research on polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp plastics used in daily life pe and pp plastic particles are insoluble in water and float on the surface because of their low density and strong hydrophobicity even when broken into microplastics they do not easily migrate in mediums with water flow therefore researchers tend to ignore the migration behavior of pe and pp microplastics that may occur with water flow in the medium surfactants are amphiphilic compounds that contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties microplastics as a kind of hydrophobic material easily combine with the hydrophobic chains of surfactant molecules then the hydrophilic moieties of the surfactant are exposed to the outside making the microplastic more hydrophilic for example a small amount of surfactant was added during the preparation of a polystyrene plastic suspension to improve its suspendability kaewtatip and tanrattanakul 2008 some reports have stated that surfactants promote the dispersion of solids to form a stable suspension which increases the suspension performance of solid particles through the steric hindrance and surface covering especially water insoluble nanoparticles such as silica titanium dioxide and aluminum oxide hu et al 2020 zareei et al 2018 other studies have shown that surfactants can also play a role in enhancing the transport of carbon nanotubes lu et al 2013 titanium dioxide godinez et al 2013 silver nanoparticles hedberg et al 2012 and hydroxyapatite nanoparticles wang et al 2014 in porous media therefore the presence of surfactants in the environment is most likely to cause the transport of pe and pp microplastics thereby aggravating the environmental hazards of microplastics to date however the effect of surfactants on pe and pp microplastic transport in porous media has not studied the concentrations of various surfactants that exist in urban wastewater and freshwater are generally in the range of 20 70 mg l 1 and ionic surfactants are the most common kume et al 2008 wang et al 2014 however the concentrations of surfactants in industrial wastewater ranges from mg l 1 to g l 1 narkis and ben david 1985 the long term application of this industrial wastewater can improve the concentration of surfactants in the soil water system surfactants can exist stably in the environment for 7 to 22 days petrović and barceló 2004 therefore the surfactant concentration in the environment may be high enough to suspend the microplastics and promote the migration of microplastics in this study we selected pe and pp microplastics as the research objects studying their transport behavior of microplastics in porous media in the presence of ionic surfactants cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab representing a positively charged surfactant and anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs representing a negatively charged surfactant herein the specific objectives are as follows 1 explore the effect of surfactant on the transport of pe and pp microplastics in porous media 2 reveal the influence of surfactant concentration ph ionic strength is flow rate and cation valence on the transport behavior of pe and pp microplastics in the presence of surfactants and 3 clarify the difference between the effects of cationic surfactants and anionic surfactants on the transport of pe and pp microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials herein pe and pp microplastics 2000 mesh were purchased from china united plastics co ltd and the densities of pe and pp were 0 96 g cm3 and 0 91 g cm3 respectively the microplastic suspension was prepared by adding 300 mg of pe or pp powder to 1 l of distilled water at the desired sdbs or ctab concentrations 100 mg l 1 200 mg l 1 300 mg l 1 500 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 followed by stirring for 5 min and sonicating for 30 min using an ultrasonic cleaner kq 500de kunshan ultrasonic instrument company china to ensure a homogeneous suspension as previous reports have determined that the surfactant concentration in wastewater is 20 70 mg l 1 kume et al 2008 wang et al 2014 we used a surfactant concentration of 20 mg l 1 in our preliminary experiments with a microplastic content the range of 0 25 mg l 1 the microplastics concentration was determined by turbidimetry 350 nm wavelength using a linear correlation between absorbance and the microplastics concentration figure s1 yin et al 2010 however as the absorbance value was small inevitable impurities in the quartz sand column affected the absorbance value determination in addition when the concentration of microplastics was greater than 50 mg l 1 the suspension performance of microplastics began to decrease figure s2 therefore 300 mg l 1 was selected as the concentration of the microplastics after various repeated trials and the concentration of the surfactant was increased accordingly to obtain a microplastic surfactant mixed suspension suitable for subsequent transportation sdbs and ctab were purchased from guangdong guanghua technology co ltd china the molecular weights of sdbs and ctab are 348 g mol 1 and 364 g mol 1 respectively and their critical micelle concentrations cmc are 490 and 330 mg l 1 respectively cifuentes et al 1997 jiao et al 2018 microplastic suspensions under different conditions were prepared using 300 mg l 1 surfactant and 300 mg l 1 microplastics microplastic suspensions of varying iss of 0 1 m kcl 0 01 m kcl 0 001 m kcl were created wherein each suspension s initial ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 conversely microplastic suspensions with different ph values 4 7 and 9 were produced using hcl or naoh in addition microplastic suspensions with different multivalent cations mgcl2 cacl2 and alcl3 were prepared wherein each had an is of 0 001 m the background solution was prepared with surfactant solutions of different concentrations iss ph values and multivalent cations the zeta potential and particle size of the microplastics in the solutions with different iss ph values and multivalent cations were measured using a zeta plus analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk their particle size range was found to be 3000 nm 6000 nm under different conditions table s1 the surface morphology and surface elements of the microplastic were examined using a scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds s 4800 hitachi japan the sem image figure s3 clearly shows that pe and pp are granular and the surface of pe is flatter than pp further based on the energy spectrum the surface of the microplastics was over 98 5 carbon revealing that no oxidation occurred based on the brunner emmet teller bet method the specific surface area of the microplastics was measured using a surface pore size analyzer tristar ii micromeritics co usa the specific surface areas of pe and pp were found to be 0 31 m2 g 1 and 3 3 m2 g 1 respectively 2 2 column experiment the quartz sand 10 20 mesh used in transport tests was supplied by zhouzhi county quartz sand ltd china it was washed with distilled water treated with 0 1 m hcl for 24 h then treated with 0 1 m naoh for another 24 h washed with distilled water again and oven dried at 105 c the zeta potential of the quartz sand was measured using a zeta plus analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk using the method described by johnson et al 1996 as shown in table 1 the zeta potential of quartz sand is negative in a solution without surfactants it is positive in ctab and negative in sdbs a column with an inner diameter of 3 cm and a height of 15 cm was packed with quartz sand and used for the column experiments the quartz sand was wet packed using distilled water with a glass stirring rod to minimize layering and to remove air entrapments in the column sun et al 2010 the porosity of the packed column was determined to be 0 45 and the pore volume pv was 48 ml prior to the column experiment the quartz sand column was flushed with distilled water at a maximum flow rate 4 ml min 1 until the effluent did not contain any visible impurities next the flow rate was adjusted to 2 ml min 1 via a constant flow pump and continuously flushed for 2 h then the distilled water was replaced with the background solution with the appropriate corresponding surfactant concentrations 100 mg l 1 200 mg l 1 300 mg l 1 500 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 iss 0 1 m 0 01 m and 0 001 m kcl ph 4 7 and 9 and multivalent cations mg2 ca2 and al3 to stabilize the experimental conditions next the background solution was quickly exchanged to a 1 2 pv microplastic suspension with the same surfactant concentrations iss phs and multivalent cations finally the background solution was used and rinsed until the microplastic suspension in the effluent was zero similarly the microplastics transport tests at different flow rates were conducted according to the aforementioned steps the microplastic suspension 300 mg l 1 surfactant and 300 mg l 1 microplastics was injected into the column for a pv of 1 2 at different flow rates 1 ml min 1 2 ml min 1 and 3 ml min 1 in these experiments the microplastic suspensions were injected into the quartz sand column while stirring the effluent from the column was continuously collected in test tubes using an automatic fraction collector bs 16a lcd shanghai huxi analysis instrument factory co ltd china the microplastic concentration was determined by measuring the light absorption at a wavelength of 350 nm via turbidimetry yin et al 2010 the calibration curve was used to quantify the relationship between the concentration of pe or pp 0 to 350 mg l 1 and absorbance and the r2 value from the standard curve of pe ctab pp ctab pe sdbs and pp sdbs were 0 9998 0 9996 0 9994 and 0 9995 respectively figure s4 the absorbance of sdbs and ctab at 350 nm was zero all column experiments were performed in parallel in duplicate 2 3 mathematical model the extended derjaguin landau verwey

discussion 3 1 effect of surfactants concentration on the transport of microplastics in porous media the breakthrough curves of the pe and pp microplastics with different concentrations of surfactants ctab and sdbs are shown in fig 1 pure pe and pp microplastics are extremely difficult to migrate due to their strong hydrophobicity it can be seen from fig 1 that pe and pp have a certain migration ability in the presence of surfactants the zeta potential table 1 of pe and pp microplastics is positive in the presence of ctab and negative in sdbs indicating that pe and pp microplastics have positive charges under ctab and negative charges under sdbs this is consistent with the charge of the hydrophilic groups of ctab and sdbs this is because that surfactants are amphiphilic molecules and microplastics are hydrophobic substances thus the hydrophobic tail chains of the surfactants are attached to the hydrophobic surface of the microplastic due to the hydrophobic effect while the hydrophilic head groups of the surfactants are connected to the water phase lu et al 2014 therefore microplastics are enveloped by surfactant molecules so that the surface of the microplastics has a certain degree of hydrophilicity and can be suspended in the solution thereby promoting the migration of the microplastics previous studies have also shown that the surfactant adsorbed on the surface of the colloid will increase the electrostatic and steric repulsion forces to improve the stability and transport of the colloid wang et al 2014 the breakthrough curves of the pe and pp microplastics under different ctab concentrations are displayed in fig 1a 1b the transport ability of pe and pp at high surfactant concentrations is higher than that at low concentrations the effluent recovery of pe at surfactant concentrations of 100 200 300 500 and 1000 mg l 1 are 5 6 5 5 50 91 49 01 and 43 89 respectively and the effluent recovery of pp were 35 35 47 36 69 08 62 82 and 61 35 respectively table 2 the transport ability of pe and pp is not significantly improved when the concentration of surfactant exceeds 300 mg l 1 further increasing the concentration of the surfactant did not promote the transport of the microplastics but slightly inhibited it it can be found from table 1 that the zeta potential of pe at ctab concentrations of 100 200 300 500 and 1000 mg l 1 are 45 78 53 41 68 65 69 21 and 68 03 mv respectively while those of pp were 47 69 63 15 79 48 78 22 and 78 98 mv respectively and the zeta potential on the surface of quartz sand is also positive studies have pointed out that the zeta potential on the colloidal surface is related to the stability of the colloidal particles in the porous medium wang et al 2016 the large absolute value of zeta potential will not only strengthen the repulsive force between colloid and colloid but also strengthen the electrostatic repulsion between colloid and quartz sand resulting in a strong migration ability of colloidal particles in the porous medium liang et al 2013 in addition the particle size of the microplastics does not change significantly under the ctab concentration of 300 1000 mg l 1 table s1 the particle size and zeta potential suggest that the migration ability of microplastics is basically the same after ctab is greater than 300 mg l 1 according to previous studies the surfactant forms an ordinary monolayer on the hydrophobic solid surface similar to those observed at the air water interface and the surfactant become increasingly erect at the surface with the surfactant concentration increasing until the adsorption is stabilized around the cmc tiberg et al 1999 this indicates that the surface of microplastics cannot be completely covered by surfactants when the concentration of the surfactant is less than that of the cmc the cmc of ctab is 330 mg l 1 the ctab molecules attached to pe and pp microplastics have reached saturation when ctab is greater than 300 mg l 1 jiao et al 2018 tiberg et al 1999 thus the zeta potential and particle size of the microplastics both reach a stable range even if the ctab concentration increases it will not promote the migration of the microplastics meanwhile ctab molecules will spontaneously form micelles in the solution when ctab is greater than 300 mg l 1 and the micelles existing in the solution may hinder the migration of microplastics hedberg et al 2012 shen et al 2021 the breakthrough curves of pe and pp under different sdbs concentrations are shown in figs 1c and d respectively the transport behavior of pe and pp is similar to that of those under ctab increasing the concentration of sdbs in the solution cannot improve the migration ability of pe and pp microplastics especially when the concentration is greater than 300 mg l 1 it will inhibit its migration the reason is also similar to the effect of ctab on pe and pp after the sdbs concentration is greater than 300 mg l 1 the zeta potential of pe and pp does not change significantly so the stability of pe and pp microplastics in solution and the electrostatic repulsion between microplastics and quartz sand are no longer significantly different liang et al 2013 while the cmc of sdbs is 490 mg l 1 cifuentes et al 1997 and micelles are also formed in the solution to inhibit the migration of microplastics hedberg et al 2012 shen et al 2021 simultaneously it can be found that pp s migration ability in porous media is greater than that of pe in the presence of different types of surfactants this is mainly related to the specific surface areas of pe and pp of which specific surface area of pp 3 3 m2 g 1 is much larger than that of pe 0 31 m2 g 1 in addition as shown in the sem analysis figure s3 that the surface of pp is rougher than that of pe and there are more recessed structures this greater area and recessed structures allow for relatively many sites for surfactant binding on pp therefore the absolute value of the zeta potential of pp is greater than that of pe table 1 and the stability of pp in solution is higher than that of pe so that the migration ability of pp is stronger than that of pe 3 2 effect of ctab on the transport of microplastics in porous media according to the experimental results of different surfactant concentrations on the transport of microplastics in porous media we selected a surfactant concentration of 300 mg l 1 to carry out the effects of different physical and chemical factors on the transport of microplastics in porous media the breakthrough curves of pe and pp in a saturated quartz sand column affected by iss flow rates ph and cation valences are shown in fig 2 the transport abilities of pe and pp gradually decrease with increasing is in the presence of ctab especially when the is is 0 1 m which makes their outflow almost zero according to the mass balance calculations the effluent recovery of pe with iss of 0 001 m 0 01 m and 0 1 m were 36 04 22 46 and 1 80 respectively table 2 and the effluent recovery of pp were 56 16 39 78 and 12 95 respectively as summarized in tables 1 the zeta potentials of the pe and pp microplastics and quartz sand surfaces decrease with increasing is which indicates that the stability of pe and pp microplastics in solution has decreased then the weakening of the electrostatic repulsion on the surfaces of the microplastics and quartz sand also reduces the migration ability of the microplastics in the medium liang et al 2013 the combination of microplastics and surfactant molecules is similar to micelles in which the hydrophobic long chain is located inside and the hydrophilic group is located outside lu et al 2014 and the micelle also has an electric double layer in the solution fernandez pena et al 2020 therefore the electric double layer formed by the surfactant molecules on the microplastic surface is compressed as the ionic strength in the solution increases resulting in a decrease in the microplastic zeta potential fernandez pena et al 2020 furthermore another reason why the migration ability of microplastics decreases with the increase of is may be that the increase of the counter ion in the solution will reduce the cmc of the surfactant yekeen et al 2017 making the surfactant molecules easily form micelles after detaching from the surface of microplastics and quartz sand during the transport of microplastics thereby lowering the transport ability of microplastics this possibility will lead to a decrease in the surfactant molecules attached to the surface of the pe and quartz sand and causes the zeta potential of pe or pp microplastics to decrease therefore the suspension of pe or pp in the solution during the migration process not only becomes worse but also makes it easier for pe or pp to deposit on the surface of quartz sand the presence of common cations ca2 mg2 and al3 reduces the migration ability of pe and pp fig 2c 2d which decreases as the cation valence increases as shown in table 1 the absolute value of the zeta potential of the microplastics in ca2 mg2 and al3 solutions decreases with the increase of the cation valence indicating that the stability of microplastics decreases with increasing valence the effluent recovery of pe at ca2 mg2 and al3 were 25 06 33 77 and 18 07 respectively while those of pp were 37 15 44 55 and 33 61 respectively the effect of different cations on the migration behavior of microplastics is similar to that of other colloids and the multivalent cations are more capable of inhibiting the mobility of colloids in porous media than monovalent cations zhang et al 2017 however most studies use negatively charged colloids as the valence of the cation increases the stability of the colloid decreases and the migration ability decreases wang et al 2016 the microplastics have a positive charge under ctab in other words this will make the zeta potential of the microplastics surface should increase with the increase of the cation valence but the zeta potential of the microplastics should decrease with the increase of the cation valence the positive charge on the surface of the pe or pp microplastics and quartz sand is derived from the charge carried by the surfactant it is speculated that the surfactant molecules may be separated from the surface of the microplastics previous studies have pointed out that the micelles aggregation behavior in high valent cation solutions conforms to the schulze hardy rule and cations with higher valence have higher colloidal coagulation capabilities which means the critical micelle concentration of surfactants decreases and micelles are more easily formed under higher cations wang et al 2018 yekeen et al 2017 therefore the absolute value of the zeta potential of the microplastics in the trivalent aluminum solution is the smallest it may also be because that the surfactant molecules form more micelles in the solution so that the number of surfactant molecules bound to the surface is minimal resulting in the worst migration ability of pe and pp microplastics in addition some studies have shown that multivalent and monovalent cations deposited on the surface of quartz sand will cause differences in colloidal transport behavior attributed to bridging effects wang et al 2018 in the high valence state the bridging effect is more obvious to hinder the migration of colloidal in the porous medium fan et al 2015 wang et al 2018 ca2 and mg2 which have the same valence have different effects on the migration of pe and pp the inhibition of pe and pp transport by ca2 is stronger than that of mg2 this is mainly because ca2 not only has stronger flocculation ability than mg2 yang et al 2016 and the bridging effect is stronger than mg2 xia et al 2019 under the same conditions the transport capacity of pp is greater than that of pe as previously mentioned pp has a larger specific surface area than pe allowing it to attach more surfactant molecules as listed in table 2 the zeta potential of pe is significantly greater than that of pp indicating the electrostatic repulsion of the quartz sand surface on pe microplastics is weaker than that of pp which is also one of the reasons why pp more easily migrates in porous media the cationic surfactant ctab is a quaternary ammonium salt that is relatively stable in acid and alkali solutions therefore change in ph will not affect the activity of the surfactant gao et al 2016 however as can be seen in fig 2e 2f as ph increases the migration capacity of pe and pp in porous media gradually decreases and the effluent recovery of pe at ph values of 4 7 and 9 are 54 42 50 37 and 39 79 respectively while those of pp are 73 39 69 08 and 59 67 respectively from the comparison of the zeta potentials of microplastics and quartz sand tables 1 it was found that the zeta potentials of the microplastic and quartz sand surfaces decrease with increasing ph indicating that the repulsive force between microplastics and quartz sand is reduced making microplastics more likely to deposit on the surface of quartz sand under alkaline conditions in addition the stability of pp in a surfactant solution is greater than that of pe due to the difference in structure and pp has a stronger migration ability than pe at different ph values the breakthrough curves of pe and pp affected by the flow rate in porous media are shown in fig 2g 2h the migration ability of pe and pp increase with increasing flow rate which is consistent with the migration behavior of most colloids affected by the flow rate the migration ability of the colloid also increases as the flow rate increases wang et al 2016 the recoveries of pe at flow rate of 1 2 3 ml min 1 are 15 99 50 91 and 52 79 respectively and the recoveries of pp were 16 66 69 08 and 91 21 respectively table 2 the advection diffusion increases the contact collision efficiency between the microplastics and the quartz sand as the flow rate decreases thereby inhibiting the mobility of the microplastics taghavy et al 2013 the mobility of pe and pp at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 is significantly weaker than that of 2 and 3 ml min 1 this indicates that the collision efficiency between the moving microplastics and the medium may be more important than expected under relatively low flow rates similarly to other factors pp has a stronger migration ability than pe under different flow rates because the stability of pp in the surfactant solution is greater than that of pe the ade model was used to simulate the transport breakthrough curves of pe and pp microplastic transport in the presence of ctab the results fit our experimental data very well indicating that the migration of microplastics in porous media is consistent with the migration characteristics of colloids in the presence of ctab liu et al 2013 the best fit values for the fitting parameters i e k and smax and r2 are summarized in table s2 the change trends of the optimal fitted smax values for the microplastics are also consistent with the experimental results for example the best smax and k values of the microplastics with high iss were higher than those of microplastics with low iss moreover insignificant changes in the smax and k values after ctab concentrations exceeded 300 mg l 1 indicated that the microplastics were relatively insensitive to changes in the ctab concentration at high concentrations 3 3 effect of sdbs on the transport of microplastics in porous media in the presence of sdbs the transport behaviors of pe and pp affected by different iss flow rates ph values and cationic valences are similar to that of ctab fig 3 for instance the migration capacity decreases with increasing is wherein pp is affected less than pe the pe and pp can both be well suspended in the presence of sdbs and the zeta potentials of pe pp and quartz sand are all negative table 1 according to the classic dlvo theory pe and pp should also have better migration ability however pe and pp show very low migration abilities under the experimental conditions compared with ctab c c0 0 2 and the fitting result of the ade model to the experimental data of pe or pp microplastic transport in the presence of sdbs is not very good compared to ctab table s2 the osmotic and elastic properties of the surfactant should also be considered when the surfactant is adsorbed on the surface of the medium due to the long chain structure of the surfactant molecule li et al 2018 therefore pe and pp microplastics are not only subjected to electrostatic force but also subjected to elastic repulsive force and membrane force during the process of approaching the quartz sand surface meanwhile the hydrophobic attraction generated by the quartz sand and microplastics must be considered when the distance between the microplastics and the surface of the quartz sand is less than the thickness of the attached surfactants molecular layer the hydrophilic group of ctab is positively charged in the solution while the quartz sand is generally negatively charged therefore under the electrostatic force the positively charged hydrophilic group binds to the negatively charged quartz sand surface exposing the hydrophobic group to the solution and binding the hydrophobic group of the surfactant in the solution to this hydrophobic group via hydrophobic interactions thus the quartz sand surface is covered with 2 layers of surfactant one layer developed by electrostatic attraction and the other by hydrophobic effects sun et al 2015 this can be confirmed by the data listed in table 1 wherein it is clear that the zeta potential of the quartz sand surface is positive in the presence of ctab this means that there are three layers of surfactant molecules between the microplastics and the quartz sand to prevent their collisions including one layer on the surface of the microplastic and two layers on the surface of the quartz sand for sdbs it cannot be adsorbed on the surface of quartz sand due to electrostatic repulsion only the surface of the microplastic is covered with a single layer of surfactant molecules in addition the spatial structure of sdbs is much more complex than that of ctab sdbs is not packed as tightly as ctab on the surface of microplastics due to the existence of a benzene ring lu et al 2014 thus the collision process between microplastics and quartz sand not only reduces the elastic repulsion and membrane force but also makes it easier for sdbs molecules to escape from the surface of microplastics the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory is used to explain the migration and deposition behavior of microplastics adsorbing surfactants in porous media in the presence of surfactants the interaction energy between the microplastics and quartz sand is calculated using the xdlvo theory as illustrated in fig 4 the results show that the xdlvo interaction energy matches the experimental data well in the presence of sdbs the interaction energy between microplastics and quartz sand is basically negative indicating that the pe and pp microplastics are extremely unstable in the quartz sand column and that brownian motion is sufficient to overcome the energy barrier to permanently deposit on the surface of the quartz sand chrysikopoulos et al 2017 in the presence of ctab the interaction energy between the microplastics and quartz sand is positive and the energy barrier value is high indicating the microplastics in the quartz sand column have high stability and are not easily deposited on the surface of quartz sand in addition the transport behavior of microplastics under different factors is consistent with the interaction energy of xdlvo these observations indicate that the osmotic and elastic forces generated by ctab are much greater than those of sdbs which makes the migration of microplastics in ctab stronger 4 conclusions in this study the common microplastics pe and pp were used as research objects and the influence of different factors surfactant concentration is ph flow rate and cation valence on the migration of microplastics in saturated media was explored it was found that two surfactants had a notable influence on the transport ability of microplastics the mobilities of pe and pp under ctab were much greater than those under sdbs in the presence of ctab and sdbs the transport behaviors of pe and pp affected by different iss flow rates ph values and cation valences all showed similar patterns in particular the migration ability decreased as the is valence and ph increased and the flow rate decreased the transport ability of microplastics in ctab was much greater than that in sdbs and the xdlvo theory describes this phenomenon well pp has a greater migration ability than pe under all experimental conditions which is mainly attributable to its rougher and larger specific surface area which adsorbs more surfactant molecules this study found that applying surfactants can greatly enhance the suspension and mobility of pe and pp although the concentrations of surfactants and microplastics used in this study are far greater than those in the actual environment the migration behavior of microplastics herein has certain reference significance for example different surfactant types have different effects on the surface properties of microplastics which significantly impact the retention and transportation of microplastics especially cationic surfactants ctab not only harms soil quality but also has a much greater ability to promote migration of microplastics than sbds in the future further research is needed to explore that microplastics accelerate the capture of pollutants in groundwater and increase their environmental
