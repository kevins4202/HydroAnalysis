16020,aquatic environments in industrial and e waste recycling areas might undergo severe contamination however there are few studies comprehensively assessing the pollution status of organophosphate esters opes in these two areas here we applied both atmospheric pressure chemical ionization apci and electron spray ionization esi sources in our target suspect and functional group dependent screening strategy which enhanced the confidence for confirmation on precursor ions of opes then n 53 sediment samples 30 from the industrial area and 23 from the e waste recycling area were analyzed twenty three out of 30 target opes were quantifiable in these analyzed samples total ope concentrations σ30opes in samples from e waste recycling area range from 12 8 to 9250 ng g dry weight dw that are statistically significantly greater t test p 0 001 than those from industrial area 25 1 5520 ng g dw σ30opes in the sediments from industrial or e waste recycling area are statistically significantly greater one way anova p 0 001 as compared to those 32 0 369 ng g dw from taihu lake in our previous study in sediment from three areas suspect and non target analysis fully or tentatively identified other 20 opes four of them have not been recorded or registered in any of online chemical databases and they are tentatively named as methoxy phenoxy phosphoryl oxy phenyl diphenyl phosphate mppodp tert butyl phenyl ethyne oxidane bis 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate tpbdtp bis dichlorophenyl propane 1 3 diyl bis hexylated phosphate bdcbhp and bis 2 hexadecoxyethyl ethyl phosphate bhepp overall this study provided new insights regarding both analytical methodology and pollution status of opes and highlights that elevated concentrations and high diversity of opes exist in sediments from industrial and e waste recycling areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organophosphate esters functional group dependent screening strategy electron spray ionization industrial area e waste recycling area non target analysis 1 introduction organophosphate esters opes refer to a class of organic additives extensively applied in industrial consumer products with high production and application volumes van der veen and de boer 2012 huang et al 2022 the global consumption of opes increased from 186 000 tons in 2001 to 680 000 tons in 2015 responsible for 30 of total fr consumption in 2015 pantelaki and voutsa 2019 shi et al 2020 an urgent market demand for alternative flame retardants frs after the phase out of traditional brominated frs such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes accelerates the production and usage of opes simultaneously arousing concerns on the environmental and health risk following exposure to opes li et al 2019a according to toxicological and epidemiological studies exposure to opes would cause various adverse effects in organisms blum et al 2019 haines et al 2017 noyes et al 2015 liu et al 2012 for instance tris 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate tcipp has been reported to affect the hormone balance in both in vivo zebrafish danio rerio and in vitro h295r cells liu et al 2012 triphenyl phosphate tphp was found to be responsible for the serum hypertriglyceridemia in mice morris et al 2014 thus some traditional opes were gradually substituted by emerging ope alternatives i e bisphenol a bis diphenylphosphate bpabdp resorcinol bis diphenyl phosphate rdp trisnonylphenol phosphate tnpp van der veen and de boer 2012 meanwhile there is an increasing number of reports on discoveries of emerging opes with novel structures and these emerging opes were proposed as impurity byproducts of traditional opes or transformation products from organophosphite antioxidants meng et al 2020 liu and mabury 2019 liu et al 2020 for instance meng et al recently discovered a novel ope named as bis 2 ethylhexyl phenyl phosphate behpp in indoor dust and behpp was also detectable in the 2 ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate ehdpp standard meng et al 2020 liu et al reported that triisodecyl phosphate tidep could be generated from the oxidation of organophosphite antioxidants liu and mabury 2019 liu et al 2020 given the high diversity of ope structures it is a great challenge to comprehensively recognize traditional emerging and unknown opes in environmental samples rapid advancement of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms provides an opportunity on fully identification of novel or emerging pollutants offering high accuracy high resolution and a wide mass range hrms enables the sensitive scan and data acquisition for thousands of chemicals hollender et al 2017 meanwhile hrms has been applied in identifying emerging or unknown opes showing promising potentials on discovery and analysis of novel opes or ope like chemicals in environmental samples for instance by use of functional group dependent screening strategy meng et al reported the occurrence of six unknown opes in indoor dust from nanjing city china and fully identified one novel ope named as behpp meng et al 2020 wang et al applied nontarget screening based on hrms for identification of potential opes in house dust from beijing china and discovered 11 unknown aryl opes as well as 3 novel chloroalkyl opes wang et al 2020a wang et al 2021 thus based on hrms suspect and nontarget screening could serve as robust analysis strategies in supplement of target analysis for comprehensive assessment of ope pollution very recently we developed a functional group dependent screening method based on hrms that was successfully applied for identification and analysis of potential opes in taihu lake ye et al 2021 however there were still some disadvantages regarding this previous strategy i e 1 ope concentrations could be diluted in combined extract resulting in few discoveries of novel opes 2 hrms was equipped with positive atmospheric pressure chemical ionization apci source which was weak in determination on precursor ion of unknown opes thus the strategy requires further optimization for conquering these issues most of opes serve as physical additives and are not chemically bonded to the products causing easy release of opes into the environment through volatilization abrasion or leaching during the process of production or disposal van der veen and de boer 2012 cao et al 2017 in fact industrial and e waste recycling areas have become important sources of opes in environment du et al 2020 xu et al 2019 wang et al 2018a kurt karakus et al 2018 thus comprehensively understanding and comparing the occurrence of opes among different areas can help explaining the regional ope pollution however limitation on species of opes or single target screening strategy led to one sided analysis of all potential opes in these two areas in previous studies du et al 2020 matsukami et al 2015 liang et al 2018 sediment is a layer of solid particles under water and considered as carrier destination and sink of organic pollutants thus sediment could reflect the occurrence and level of local pollutants and also represent the historical record of local pollutants ye et al 2021 su et al 2021 more importantly chemicals sorbed by sediment may be released into environment again through allocation among different mediums and become potential pollution source numata et al 2007 hence it is urgent to determine the content of potential opes especially emerging or unknown opes in sediment of two typical areas with an aim to comprehensively assess the environmental effects of opes based on background mentioned above we optimized the functional group dependent screening strategy and then this enhanced strategy was applied for comprehensive analysis of opes in n 53 surface sediment samples from rivers and lakes around industrial or e waste recycling area the specific objectives of our present study are as follows 1 to optimize and innovate the functional group dependent screening strategy 2 to characterize the levels as well as compositions of target opes in two typical areas and compare with that in natural taihu lake and 3 to discover all potential opes that could potentially exist in the environment but we have not recognized yet 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the information of 30 target opes are performed in table s1 the purities of these ope standards are all higher than 95 detailed information on opes standards and reagents is provided in the supporting information si 2 2 sample collection and preparation detailed information on sampling sites can be found in our previous study su et al 2021 and also provided in table s2 and fig 1 in brief 30 surface sediment samples were collected from rivers around electronic product manufacturers and 23 ones were collected from an e waste recycling area sampling sites locate in yangtze river delta region one of the most economically and industrialized areas in china wang et al 2018b the sample collection and preparation methods are provided in si 2 3 instrumental analysis herein ultimate 3000 ultra high performance liquid chromatograph coupled with q exactive hybrid quadrupole orbitrap hrms uhplc q orbitrap hrms thermo fisher scientific usa was used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of opes besides a comprehensive screening strategy developed in our previous study including target suspect and functional group based nontarget screening was performed for comprehensive identification and evaluation of opes the mass spectrometer was operated in apci selected ion monitoring sim mode was applied for target screening and full mass aif all ion fragmentation mode was performed for both suspect and nontarget screening respectively the lc hrms parameters for screening strategy are performed in si the screening strategy followed our previous study with some modifications ye et al 2021 target and suspect screening methods are provided in si the functional group based nontarget screening was performed with six feature fragment ions of opes i e triphenyl phosphate ion c18h16o4p diphenyl phosphate ion c12h12o4p monophenyl phosphate ion c6h8o4p phosphate ion h4o4p diphenyl phosphate dehydrated form ion c12h10o3p and phosphonate dianion ion h2o3p the structures of these feature fragment ions are provided in table s4 compared to previous study procedures of nontarget screening were optimized fig s1 thus samples collected from taihu lake were re analyzed using the optimized nontarget screening method for better explanation of unknown opes in surface sediment from taihu lake briefly each chromatographic peak in the extracted ion chromatograms eics of the six feature fragment ions was confirmed and unknown peaks would be picked out for determination of precursor ions the specific workflow of determination on potential precursor ions is provided in fig s2 to promote the confidence parent ions were subsequently re detected under positive electron spray ionization esi since more abundant adduct ions m na m nh4 and so on are produced under esi validation on feasibility of esi for auxiliary determination on precursor ions of unknown peaks is provided in si besides potential precursor ions were re analyzed under parallel reaction monitoring prm mode with 20 40 and 60 ev stepped normalized collision energy nce to determine corresponding fragment ions of potential parent ions after that a chemical formula prediction using an elemental composition range of c0 100h0 200o4 20p1 3cl0 10br0 10 as well as ring and double bond equivalents dbe in xcalibur s qual browser software was performed unknown chemicals with acceptable formula and correct dbe were matched in online databases i e pubchem database or distributed structure searchable toxicity dsstox database coupled with structure elucidation under prm mode finally the chemical would be confirmed by use of commercial or in house synthesized standard still some criteria were set for nontarget screening 1 s n threshold of chromatographic peaks in ms2 10 2 relative abundance threshold for chromatographic peaks in ms2 5 3 mass tolerance 5 ppm and 10 ppm for ms and ms ms data respectively 4 the identified chemicals should generate corresponding characteristic fragment ions 2 4 quality assurance and quality control strict analytical procedures were applied to ensure the quality control for every batch of 6 12 samples one procedural blank extracting solvent was contained for calibration on the values of opes in each sample the recoveries of target opes in the method validation were estimated by spiking experiments at low concentration 20 ng g and high concentration 100 ng g with three replicates for each level the spiking experiment results are provided in table s6 additionally procedural blank n 10 values of all compounds detected in three typical places are displayed in table s7 the recovery ranges were 60 1 to 119 or 89 4 to 120 at low or high spiking concentration respectively method detection limits mdls or method quantification limits mqls were defined as 3 or 10 times the s n of 10 ng ml standard working solution for chemicals that were not detected in the blanks meanwhile for chemicals detected in blanks mdls or mqls were defined as 3 or 5 times the standard deviation sd of blank measurement chemicals of which concentrations were lower than mdls were defined as not detected nd and of which concentrations higher than mdls but lower than mqls were defined as not quantified nq nd nq was replaced by the values of mdls mqls divided by the square root of 2 in statistical analysis the concentrations of opes in sediment were normalized to dry weight dw besides the sediment samples were spiked with surrogates for accuracy and stabilization of the method the recoveries of these surrogates were 89 4 8 6 d15 tep 95 9 7 7 d15 tphp 101 9 8 d15 tdcipp 65 7 7 5 d12 tcep and 98 2 7 1 d27 tnbp respectively 2 5 data analysis the visualization of sampling sites or data processing were achieved by use of arcgis 10 6 or microsoft excel 2019 respectively meanwhile graphpad prism 8 0 2 and spss 26 0 were used for statistical analysis and data visualization for concentrations of opes detected in sediment the chemical structures of opes were drawn using chembiooffice 2014 additionally spearman correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the correlation relationships on concentrations among different ope congeners student s t test or one way anova were performed to assess the difference on ope concentrations between two groups or among three or more groups respectively principal component analysis pca was performed for determination of difference on regional pollution and dominant opes the value of p 0 05 denoted a significance level while p 0 01 represented highly significant 3 results and discussions 3 1 level and composition of target opes total concentrations ranges and arithmetic means of target opes in industrial and e waste recycling areas as well as detailed information on composition of σ6alkyl opes σ17aryl opes σ7halo opes are summarized in table s8 levels and composition of opes in surface sediments are visualized in fig 2 including taihu lake reported in our previous publication ye et al 2021 24 out of 30 target opes were detected in these three areas total of 23 opes were detected in industrial and e waste recycling areas among these detected opes triethyl phosphate tep tri 2 ethylhexyl phosphate tehp behpp tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate tdtbpp tphp bpabdp tris chloroethyl phosphate tcep and tcipp showed detection frequencies dfs higher than 90 in all three areas concentrations of σ30opes were significantly different between every two areas p 0 001 one way anova with a decreasing rank order following as e waste recycling area 12 8 9250 ng g dw industrial area 25 1 5520 ng g dw taihu lake 32 0 369 ng g dw fig 2a and table s8 it has been reported that e waste treatment plants were important sources of opes released into the environment wang et al 2020b high levels and dfs of opes were also observed in surface sediment of rivers along e waste recycling operations in guiyu china li et al 2019b and surface soils around e waste recycling area in bui dau northern vietnam matsukami et al 2015 in the present study σ7halo opes accounted for most part of σ30opes in e waste recycling area 58 2 while the proportion of σ17aryl opes or σ6alkyl opes were 38 5 or 3 3 respectively fig 2b different from e waste recycling area σ17aryl opes occupied for 75 8 or 51 0 of σ30opes in industrial area or taihu lake respectively tcipp median mean 162 645 ng g was the dominant ope in surface sediment of e waste recycling area ranging from nq to 6260 ng g with df of 100 fig 2c and table s8 tcipp has been widely applied to electronic products as flame retardants he et al 2015 nguyen et al 2019 the abundant release of tcipp to the surroundings in e waste recycling area might be attributed to the crude techniques of e waste recycling li et al 2019b it is worth noting that the gradually phased out chemical tcep cao et al 2017 was detected in sediment of these two areas and displayed considerable dfs 100 in both two typical areas and concentrations range from 0 11 to 517 ng g suggesting a continuous use or pollution of tcep in these areas in industrial area tehp and tdtbpp contributed to the most proportion of σ30opes exhibiting mean concentrations of 62 6 and 164 ng g dw respectively fig 2c and table s8 similar to industrial area tehp as well as tdtbpp were also dominant opes in taihu lake ye et al 2021 due to high hydrophobicity log kow 9 49 and high organic carbon adsorption coefficient log koc 6 87 tehp has been frequently observed in surface sediment liu et al 2018 yadav and devi 2020 tdtbpp is first identified in e waste dust venier et al 2018 but rarely reported in sediment used as plasticizers flame retardants and considered as transformed product of the most widely used organic phosphite antioxidants i168 tdtbpp is somewhat different from other opes in terms of sources shi et al 2020 another novel ope that is behpp has been detected in indoor dust meng et al 2020 surface soil gong et al 2021 and wild fish li et al 2022 in e waste recycling area concentration of behpp median mean 17 3 25 2 ng g range nd 92 3 ng g is lower than that of one traditional ope named as tphp median mean 12 5 125 ng g range nd 987 ng g whereas in industrial area concentrations of behpp is higher than that of tphp it could indicate that behpp may be easier released into the environment during industrial production table s8 concentration of behpp in e waste recycling area china in our present study is equivalent to that of tphp 7 3 38 ng g in sediment from e waste recycling operation area located in northern vietnam matsukami et al 2015 a previous research detected behpp in the standard of ehdpp indicating that behpp might be an impurity or degradation product generated during the synthesis of ehdpp meng et al 2020 in addition behpp was found related to some opes tehp tphp and tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tboep in surface soil samples which might elucidate its sources gong et al 2021 the spatial distribution of σ30opes is illustrated in fig s4 in industrial area similar trends of concentration change occurred in three different areas the highest concentration of σ30opes was obtained at the sampling sites close to electronic product manufacturers demonstrating that electronic product manufacture is responsible for the main input of opes to the rivers in industrial area imported opes are absorbed by solid particles along river flow resulting in gradual decreases on the concentrations of σ30opes in surface sediment for taihu lake σ30opes levels decreased with increasing distance from the coast of lake which may be attributed to ope manufacturing factories located near northwestern taihu lake ye et al 2021 wang et al 2018b in e waste recycling area the highest concentration of opes was found at r19 21 adjacent to an e waste recycling base meanwhile the downstream sites r16 23 254 9250 ng g dw possessed relatively higher concentrations than upstream sites r1 15 12 8 2670 ng g dw of yongning river showing adverse impact of the e waste recycling operation to determine the correlation among opes spearman correlation analysis is performed for opes with df 60 fig s5 s6 and s7 in the samples from taihu lake most of opes were not significantly correlated on concentrations ye et al 2021 in comparison to taihu lake significant positive relationships among opes were observed in industrial and e waste recycling areas except for those traditional opes some emerging or novel opes i e t butylphenyl diphenyl phosphate 2 tbpdpp isodecyl diphenyl phosphate iddp 2 isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate 2ippdpp bpabdp bis 4 tert butylphenyl phenyl phosphate b4tbppp tdtbpp and behpp are worth noting these emerging opes exhibited considerable contents range from nd to 1970 ng g and widespread distribution dfs of 60 to 100 in sampling sites across these two areas table s8 tbpdpp isomers were frequently reported in household dust indicating direct human exposure to them guan et al 2019 phillips et al 2018 besides tbpdpp was confirmed to be more detrimental to endochondral ossification in murine limb bud cultures than 2 2 4 4 tetrabromodiphenyl ether bde 47 yan and hales 2019 the concentration of 2 tbpdpp was in the range of nd 1910 ng g in industrial area and nd 99 2 ng g in e waste recycling area much higher than that in taihu lake nd 2 83 ng g ye et al 2021 suggesting its prevalent use in electronic product and subsequent release into environments during the process of producing or recycling activities iddp is a tphp based ope applied as alternative flame retardants the bioconcentration factor of iddp reached 417500 showing potential exposure risks muir 1984 bpabdp is a kind of oligomeric organophosphorus flame retardants oopfrs and can be metabolized by human into endocrine disruptor bisphenol a alves et al 2018 owing to the abundant content of bpabdp range from nd to 781 ng g in sediment and its wide occurrence dfs 90 in all three areas concerns on biological toxicity of bpabdp to aquatic environments should be aroused since bpabdp is relatively high bioaccumulative in organisms including fish species zhao et al 2019 2ippdpp and b4tbppp were dominant ingredients of ope components in common commercial fr mixture firemaster 550 fm 550 or firemaster 600 fm 600 respectively phillips et al 2017 regarding behpp similar results were obtained against previous studies that behpp was correlated to some opes simultaneously with significantly difference on concentrations of behpp among three typical areas p 0 001 indicating that industrial pollution or human activities might be important factors for the spatial distribution of behpp gong et al 2021 based on the present and previous studies this novel ope is seemingly ubiquitous and extensively used hence behpp requires more researches to be comprehensively interpreted overall the occurrence of emerging and novel opes in different environmental mediums requires continuous attention 3 2 suspect screening of opes by use of suspect screening strategy suspect opes identified in these two typical areas are summarized in table s9 taking the identified 11 suspect opes in taihu lake ye et al 2021 11 in industrial area 12 in e waste recycling area together a total of 15 homologues of opes were identified in these three areas besides information on detected suspect opes in industrial area as well as e waste recycling area is provided in table s10 suspect candidates with retention time as well as extracted mass that are consistent with those of target opes were excluded individual ope in the suspect list was matched regarding both ms1 and ms2 data while the position of substituents was not clear for some opes with isomers thus isomers were combined and one representative chemical was chosen for later analysis compounds with more reference reports in web of science core collection were prioritized additionally isomers with one or two retention times were retained then suspect opes were semiquantified against structurally similar opes possessing reference standards the semiquantified concentrations and detection frequencies of suspect opes are provided in tables s11 s12 and s13 the species of suspect opes detected in e waste recycling area were more diverse as compared to those in industrial area or taihu lake eight out of 15 suspect opes were detected in surface sediment of all three typical areas table s9 among them two ope homologues e g methyl diphenyl phosphate mdpp isomers of 2 4 diisopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate 24dippdpp are worth noting due to their relatively high dfs and lack of research on them in different environmental matrices mdpp nd 60 6 ng g was used as flame retardants and previously detected in sediment of southwestern coastal taiwan chung and ding 2009 similar to 2ippdpp 24dippdpp isomers were also one of dominant ingredients of the individual op components in common commercial fr mixture firemaster 550 fm 550 phillips et al 2017 24dippdpp isomers were detected with considerable semiquantified concentrations range from nd 375 ng g and dfs 83 and 91 in industrial and e waste recycling areas respectively tables s11 s12 and s13 according to previous studies content of 24dippdpp isomers exceeded levels of tphp tcep tcipp in house dust suggesting the potential for chronic human exposure to 24dippdpp isomers phillips et al 2017 bergh et al 2012 however levels of mdpp or 24dippdpp isomers are obviously lower than those of tphp tcep or tcipp in our present study moreover triallyl phosphate tap isomers of isopropyl diphenyl phosphate idpp 3 hydroxyphenyl diphenyl phosphate meta oh tphp and 2 4 di tert butylphenyl pentaerythritol phosphate mbdtpdp were detected in only one area respectively isomers of idpp and mbdtpdp were at low dfs 3 for idpp and 4 for mbdtpdp thus they were not furtherly discussed tap and meta oh tphp were only detectable in sediment from taihu lake table s8 tap was a sort of flame retardants gaan and sun 2007 besides tap was applied in lithium ion cells as an electrolyte additive xia et al 2015 in our previous study we conjectured that meta oh tphp was mainly generated from the hydrolysis of rdp in taihu lake ye et al 2021 despite that tphp was universally detected in sediment from industrial or e waste recycling area meta oh tphp was not detected in these two areas besides rdp was also rarely detected in these two areas not detected in industrial area and with df of 26 in e waste recycling area thus the correlation between rdp and meta oh tphp in these two places cannot be confirmed based on the dataset the findings of above mentioned suspect opes highlight the importance of evaluation on emerging alternative flame retardants 3 3 priority and regional pollution analysis of target and suspect opes among three typical areas to determine the dominant opes as well as difference on regional ope pollution among three different areas industrial area e waste recycling area and taihu lake a k means clustering based heatmap was provided and a principal component analysis pca was conducted the results are illustrated in fig 3 opes in clustering heatmap were divided into three clusters on the basis of log10 transformed concentrations or semiquantified concentrations with the objective of determination on opes that should be priorities in three areas fig 3a the first cluster contains opes tehp tdtbpp tcipp bpabdp behpp tboep tep tcep tphp with relatively high concentrations and dfs suggesting that these opes are of great important in all three areas and require more attention opes in second cluster exhibited plentiful contents in at least two areas although these opes are not comparable to those in first cluster on concentrations attention is still needed on the occurrence of these opes especially some emerging or novel opes e g mbdtpdp b4tbppp iddp 2ippdpp and so on the third cluster represents opes that were rarely detected in sediment samples in three areas however three ope homologues i e ippp isomers bdpp isomers and bmppp are detected in e waste recycling area with dfs 50 ippp isomers are one of isomers of isopropylated triarylphosphate esters itps which have similar or greater neuro and developmental toxicity compared to bde 47 in high throughput assays phillips et al 2017 bdpp isomers were frequently detected in indoor dust jesus duenas mas et al 2020 huang et al 2020 and they could potentially cause endocrine disruption schang et al 2016 and developmental or pharmacological effects on nervous system in organisms jarema et al 2015 bmppp was previously reported in house dust from beijing wang et al 2020a exposure to these three ope homologues could potentially cause health risks to organisms or humans and should be high of concern in further studies pca was performed based on concentrations or semiquantified concentrations of target or suspect opes besides data was normalized using zero mean normalization before analysis the pca biplot is displayed in fig 3b as indicated by biplot fig 3b the variations of industrial area as well as e waste recycling area were more obvious variation of e waste recycling area mainly performed on principal component 1 pc1 while industrial area appeared to vary a lot on principal component 2 pc2 tep tcipp tcep bpabdp tphp tboep tris p tert butylphenyl phosphate tbphp and 2ippdpp differentiated from other opes and offered great contribution to pc1 fig 3b thus these opes affected the variation of e waste recycling area and caused local pollution around e waste recycling operations these opes are extensively applied in electronic products as flame retardants van der veen and de boer 2012 wang et al 2018b chung and ding 2009 and can be easily released to the surroundings during the process of disposal or recycling similarly tehp tdtbpp 2 tbpdpp b4tbppp and behpp supplied most contribution to pc2 and were responsible for the variation of industrial area suggesting that these opes resulted in regional pollution around industrial area however no obvious change was observed in taihu lake on pc1 or pc2 meanwhile no characteristic opes were found to be responsible for the regional pollution variation of taihu lake this might be attributed to the fact that taihu lake is an important source of industrial agricultural and drinking water for the surroundings linked to multiple rivers thus transport vectors for opes into the taihu lake are numerous leading to the complex sources of opes in taihu lake municipal and industrial effluents dry wet deposition et al cao et al 2012 3 4 functional group dependent nontarget screening results in three typical areas for nontarget screening five unknown peaks were detected and the precursor ions of unknown peaks were determined table 1 the ions were re detected under esi in order to promote the accuracy meanwhile the precursor ions were fragmented under prm mode to obtain all fragment ions of unknown chemicals for explanation of structure peak 1 was detected at 7 99 min and was diagnosed by m z 233 03621 as well as monophenyl phosphate ion c6h8o4p m z 175 01547 with its pseudomolecular ion m h identified as m z 513 08586 proposed chemical formula c25h23o8p2 theoretical 513 08627 δmass 0 8 ppm fig s9a isotopes and fragment ions of the unknown peak were acquired and displayed in fig s9a and fig s9b respectively the fragment ions at m z 343 07247 c18h16o5p 1 5 ppm and m z 251 04669 c12h12o4p 0 3 ppm indicated that this unknown compound contained basic structure of triphenyl phosphate tphp meanwhile a neutral loss of ch2 was observed among the fragment ion of m z 265 06200 c13h14o4p 1 6 ppm and diphenyl phosphate ion c12h12o4p therefore on the basis of fragment ions obtained the unknown peak was identified as methoxy phenoxy phosphoryl oxy phenyl diphenyl phosphate mppodp the probable structure was applied in fig s9b mppodp is somewhat similar to rdp on the structure however mppodp was detected in only two areas e g taihu lake and e waste recycling area with relatively low semiquantified concentration nd 11 ng g and low dfs of 26 table s14 thus the concentration data of mppodp is not provided with the qualification of statistical analysis nevertheless the relation between novel chemical and rdp is still need to be determined and analyzed in future studies peak 2 was observed at 9 19 min with diagnostic ion of m z 175 01547 the precursor ion was m z 693 08604 in ms1 spectrum fig 4 a and the predicted formula was c27h39o8cl4p2 theoretical 693 08688 δmass 1 2 ppm actually the ion had another possible formula c28h39o7cl5p theoretical 693 08705 δmass 1 5 ppm thus we furtherly determined the formula on the basis of peak areas of chlorine isotopic ions in the ms1 spectrums fig 4a the peak area ratios were calculated as 1 1 31 0 64 0 13 close to the isotopic mass ratio 1 1 28 0 62 0 13 of cl4 hence ion with m z 693 08604 was identified as c27h39o8cl4p2 fragment ion at m z 389 05456 c15h19o8p2 1 0 ppm indicated a group loss of c12h20cl4 from the precursor ion fig 4b additionally a loss of c3h6 was observed between fragment ion at m z 215 04666 c9h12o4p 0 5 ppm and c6h6o4p moreover we found a diagnostic ion at m z 161 96568 c6h4ocl2 14 3 ppm indicating that two chlorine atoms are attached to a benzene ring despite that remaining groups cannot be fully confirmed based on the fragment ions in ms ms spectra the possible structure of this compound was provided and the chemical was identified as bis dichlorophenyl propane 1 3 diyl bis hexylated phosphate bdcbhp fig 4c bdcbhp was merely detected in taihu lake table s14 therefore the correlation between bdcbhp and other opes in taihu lake were determined interestingly bdcbhp showed significantly positive relationship to tdtbpp mdpp bpabdp rdp and meta oh tphp fig 4d and table s15 these five opes were proved to be imported into western taihu lake through nanxi river in our previous study and might be originated from the largest organophosphate flame retardant manufacturer ye et al 2021 thus bdcbhp might share same sources with these five opes in taihu lake as a kind of chlorinated opes bdcbhp shows potential biological exposure and deserves more research peak 3 was observed at 11 51 min in the eics of triphenyl phosphate ion c18h16o4p m z 327 07807 as well as diphenyl phosphate ion c12h12o4p m z 251 04677 the parent ion m h was m z 649 39996 fig 5 a and the proposed chemical formula was c40h58o5p theoretical 649 40164 δmass 2 6 ppm similarly the isotopes of parent ion were determined fig 5a and the parent ion was segmented under prm mode to acquire fragment ions fig 5b in the prm ms2 spectrum fragment ions at m z 593 33673 c36h50o5p 4 0 ppm m z 537 27521 c32h42o5p 3 2 ppm m z 481 21262 c28h34o5p 0 6 ppm m z 425 15008 c24h26o5p 3 9 ppm and m z 369 08835 c20h18o5p 2 7 ppm were observed and could be attributed to the consecutive neutral losses of c4h8 from the parent ion additionally a group loss of c2h3o was observed between the triphenyl phosphate ion c18h16o4p and fragment ion of c20h18o5p based on above mentioned structural data the unknown peak was identified as tert butyl phenyl ethyne oxidane bis 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate tpbdtp and the possible structure is performed in fig 5c it is worth noting that the structure of this compound is similar to tdtbpp therefore correlation analysis was applied between two structurally similar substances interestingly tpbdtp showed strong positive correlation to tdtbpp r 0 7051 p 0 001 fig 5d demonstrating that these two chemicals might be originated from same pollution source in view of the positive correlations two possible sources of this substance were speculated 1 tpbdtp might be an industrial by product or impurity of tdtbpp 2 tpbdtp might be a transformed product of tdtbpp through microbial metabolism certainly considering that tdtbpp can be generated from i168 this new compound might be also directly produced from i168 similarly correlation of tpbdtp and i168 in three typical areas was determined significant positive correlation was observed between these two chemicals r 0 2862 p 0 0122 fig 5d firstly we verified that tpbdtp did not exist in the standard of tdtbpp or i168 secondly standard of i168 was oxidized by exposing the i168 solution in fume hood for 24 h to determine whether this new substance can be generated through the oxidation of i168 and the result was not thirdly the presence of tpbdtp in previously processed surface soil gong et al 2021 and indoor dust zhao et al 2020 samples was investigated interestingly we observed that this compound was only found in surface soil but did not exist in indoor dust considering relatively low semiquantified content of tpbdtp as compared to tdtbpp table s8 and s14 this new compound is more likely a metabolic transformed product of tdtbpp however confirmation on the structure as well as sources of this compound needs to be accomplished in future studies peak 4 and peak 5 were observed at 13 30 min and 14 12 min with diagnostic ion of m z 98 98417 respectively the precursor ions were m z 635 53740 of peak 5 c36h76o6p 1 6 ppm and m z 663 56775 of peak 6 c38h80o6p 1 4 ppm fig s10a and s11a besides isotopes of these two chemicals were determined fig s10a and s11a given fragment ions under prm mode we found consecutive neutral losses of c16h32 from both parent ions of these two compounds with fragment ion c4h12o6p left fig s10b and s11b different from peak 5 another group loss of c2h4 was observed in parent ion of peak 6 peak 5 was then identified as bis 2 hexadecoxyethyl hydrogen phosphate bhhpp based on the precursor and fragment ions fig s10b bhhpp is recorded in pubchem database but not reported in environmental mediums the specific structure of peak 6 is uncertain due to limited information of fragment ions in view of similar fragmentation modes between peak 5 and peak 6 compound of peak 6 was identified as bis 2 hexadecoxyethyl ethyl phosphate bhepp and possible structure is displayed in fig s11b bhepp is not recorded in online database and might be a potential parent compound of bhhpp bhhpp was only detected in e waste recycling area nd 19 1 ng g df of 43 while bhepp was observed in both industrial nd 0 32 ng g df of 7 and e waste recycling areas nd 10 4 ng g df of 35 table s14 the pearson correlation analysis was applied for these two compounds in e waste recycling area and the result is displayed in fig s12 interestingly strong significant positive relation was observed between these two substances r 0 8576 p 0 0001 indicating that 1 bhhpp and bhepp could have similar sources or 2 bhhpp could be generated from metabolism of bhepp in e waste recycling area however these assumptions need further validations novel opes including mppodp tpbdtp bdcbhp and bhepp had no searchable records in pubchem database or dsstox database lack of information on these opes in the database might be attributed to the fact that these compounds were unnoticed or impurities degradation products of other opes the results showed an active demand for the identification of such potential opes and the nontarget approach developed in this study could help realizing this purpose 4 conclusion overall we optimized the workflow of integrated target suspect and functional group dependent screening strategy by applying esi for improvement on the confidence of precursor ions and the enhanced strategy was applied for comprehensive analysis of opes in surface sediment n 73 from industrial area taihu lake or e waste recycling area we successfully identified 44 opes and industrial or e waste recycling area contained statistically significantly greater ope concentrations as compared to natural taihu lake ye et al 2021 according to the results of pca some opes were determined to be responsible for the regional pollution in e waste recycling area tep tcipp tcep bpabdp tphp tboep tbphp and 2ippdpp or industrial area tehp tdtbpp 2 tbpdpp b4tbppp and behpp whereas the sources of opes in taihu lake were complex besides the discovery of several emerging opes i e 2 tbpdpp 24dippdpp b4tbppp 2ippdpp iddp and bpabdp highlights the market shift to alternative flame retardants more importantly four novel opes mppodp tpbdtp bdcbhp and bhepp identified in this study and not recorded in pubchem or dsstox databases are worth noting and require more studies they may be the transformed products or impurities of other opes and potential impact of them to the environment or

16020,aquatic environments in industrial and e waste recycling areas might undergo severe contamination however there are few studies comprehensively assessing the pollution status of organophosphate esters opes in these two areas here we applied both atmospheric pressure chemical ionization apci and electron spray ionization esi sources in our target suspect and functional group dependent screening strategy which enhanced the confidence for confirmation on precursor ions of opes then n 53 sediment samples 30 from the industrial area and 23 from the e waste recycling area were analyzed twenty three out of 30 target opes were quantifiable in these analyzed samples total ope concentrations σ30opes in samples from e waste recycling area range from 12 8 to 9250 ng g dry weight dw that are statistically significantly greater t test p 0 001 than those from industrial area 25 1 5520 ng g dw σ30opes in the sediments from industrial or e waste recycling area are statistically significantly greater one way anova p 0 001 as compared to those 32 0 369 ng g dw from taihu lake in our previous study in sediment from three areas suspect and non target analysis fully or tentatively identified other 20 opes four of them have not been recorded or registered in any of online chemical databases and they are tentatively named as methoxy phenoxy phosphoryl oxy phenyl diphenyl phosphate mppodp tert butyl phenyl ethyne oxidane bis 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate tpbdtp bis dichlorophenyl propane 1 3 diyl bis hexylated phosphate bdcbhp and bis 2 hexadecoxyethyl ethyl phosphate bhepp overall this study provided new insights regarding both analytical methodology and pollution status of opes and highlights that elevated concentrations and high diversity of opes exist in sediments from industrial and e waste recycling areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organophosphate esters functional group dependent screening strategy electron spray ionization industrial area e waste recycling area non target analysis 1 introduction organophosphate esters opes refer to a class of organic additives extensively applied in industrial consumer products with high production and application volumes van der veen and de boer 2012 huang et al 2022 the global consumption of opes increased from 186 000 tons in 2001 to 680 000 tons in 2015 responsible for 30 of total fr consumption in 2015 pantelaki and voutsa 2019 shi et al 2020 an urgent market demand for alternative flame retardants frs after the phase out of traditional brominated frs such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes accelerates the production and usage of opes simultaneously arousing concerns on the environmental and health risk following exposure to opes li et al 2019a according to toxicological and epidemiological studies exposure to opes would cause various adverse effects in organisms blum et al 2019 haines et al 2017 noyes et al 2015 liu et al 2012 for instance tris 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate tcipp has been reported to affect the hormone balance in both in vivo zebrafish danio rerio and in vitro h295r cells liu et al 2012 triphenyl phosphate tphp was found to be responsible for the serum hypertriglyceridemia in mice morris et al 2014 thus some traditional opes were gradually substituted by emerging ope alternatives i e bisphenol a bis diphenylphosphate bpabdp resorcinol bis diphenyl phosphate rdp trisnonylphenol phosphate tnpp van der veen and de boer 2012 meanwhile there is an increasing number of reports on discoveries of emerging opes with novel structures and these emerging opes were proposed as impurity byproducts of traditional opes or transformation products from organophosphite antioxidants meng et al 2020 liu and mabury 2019 liu et al 2020 for instance meng et al recently discovered a novel ope named as bis 2 ethylhexyl phenyl phosphate behpp in indoor dust and behpp was also detectable in the 2 ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate ehdpp standard meng et al 2020 liu et al reported that triisodecyl phosphate tidep could be generated from the oxidation of organophosphite antioxidants liu and mabury 2019 liu et al 2020 given the high diversity of ope structures it is a great challenge to comprehensively recognize traditional emerging and unknown opes in environmental samples rapid advancement of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms provides an opportunity on fully identification of novel or emerging pollutants offering high accuracy high resolution and a wide mass range hrms enables the sensitive scan and data acquisition for thousands of chemicals hollender et al 2017 meanwhile hrms has been applied in identifying emerging or unknown opes showing promising potentials on discovery and analysis of novel opes or ope like chemicals in environmental samples for instance by use of functional group dependent screening strategy meng et al reported the occurrence of six unknown opes in indoor dust from nanjing city china and fully identified one novel ope named as behpp meng et al 2020 wang et al applied nontarget screening based on hrms for identification of potential opes in house dust from beijing china and discovered 11 unknown aryl opes as well as 3 novel chloroalkyl opes wang et al 2020a wang et al 2021 thus based on hrms suspect and nontarget screening could serve as robust analysis strategies in supplement of target analysis for comprehensive assessment of ope pollution very recently we developed a functional group dependent screening method based on hrms that was successfully applied for identification and analysis of potential opes in taihu lake ye et al 2021 however there were still some disadvantages regarding this previous strategy i e 1 ope concentrations could be diluted in combined extract resulting in few discoveries of novel opes 2 hrms was equipped with positive atmospheric pressure chemical ionization apci source which was weak in determination on precursor ion of unknown opes thus the strategy requires further optimization for conquering these issues most of opes serve as physical additives and are not chemically bonded to the products causing easy release of opes into the environment through volatilization abrasion or leaching during the process of production or disposal van der veen and de boer 2012 cao et al 2017 in fact industrial and e waste recycling areas have become important sources of opes in environment du et al 2020 xu et al 2019 wang et al 2018a kurt karakus et al 2018 thus comprehensively understanding and comparing the occurrence of opes among different areas can help explaining the regional ope pollution however limitation on species of opes or single target screening strategy led to one sided analysis of all potential opes in these two areas in previous studies du et al 2020 matsukami et al 2015 liang et al 2018 sediment is a layer of solid particles under water and considered as carrier destination and sink of organic pollutants thus sediment could reflect the occurrence and level of local pollutants and also represent the historical record of local pollutants ye et al 2021 su et al 2021 more importantly chemicals sorbed by sediment may be released into environment again through allocation among different mediums and become potential pollution source numata et al 2007 hence it is urgent to determine the content of potential opes especially emerging or unknown opes in sediment of two typical areas with an aim to comprehensively assess the environmental effects of opes based on background mentioned above we optimized the functional group dependent screening strategy and then this enhanced strategy was applied for comprehensive analysis of opes in n 53 surface sediment samples from rivers and lakes around industrial or e waste recycling area the specific objectives of our present study are as follows 1 to optimize and innovate the functional group dependent screening strategy 2 to characterize the levels as well as compositions of target opes in two typical areas and compare with that in natural taihu lake and 3 to discover all potential opes that could potentially exist in the environment but we have not recognized yet 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the information of 30 target opes are performed in table s1 the purities of these ope standards are all higher than 95 detailed information on opes standards and reagents is provided in the supporting information si 2 2 sample collection and preparation detailed information on sampling sites can be found in our previous study su et al 2021 and also provided in table s2 and fig 1 in brief 30 surface sediment samples were collected from rivers around electronic product manufacturers and 23 ones were collected from an e waste recycling area sampling sites locate in yangtze river delta region one of the most economically and industrialized areas in china wang et al 2018b the sample collection and preparation methods are provided in si 2 3 instrumental analysis herein ultimate 3000 ultra high performance liquid chromatograph coupled with q exactive hybrid quadrupole orbitrap hrms uhplc q orbitrap hrms thermo fisher scientific usa was used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of opes besides a comprehensive screening strategy developed in our previous study including target suspect and functional group based nontarget screening was performed for comprehensive identification and evaluation of opes the mass spectrometer was operated in apci selected ion monitoring sim mode was applied for target screening and full mass aif all ion fragmentation mode was performed for both suspect and nontarget screening respectively the lc hrms parameters for screening strategy are performed in si the screening strategy followed our previous study with some modifications ye et al 2021 target and suspect screening methods are provided in si the functional group based nontarget screening was performed with six feature fragment ions of opes i e triphenyl phosphate ion c18h16o4p diphenyl phosphate ion c12h12o4p monophenyl phosphate ion c6h8o4p phosphate ion h4o4p diphenyl phosphate dehydrated form ion c12h10o3p and phosphonate dianion ion h2o3p the structures of these feature fragment ions are provided in table s4 compared to previous study procedures of nontarget screening were optimized fig s1 thus samples collected from taihu lake were re analyzed using the optimized nontarget screening method for better explanation of unknown opes in surface sediment from taihu lake briefly each chromatographic peak in the extracted ion chromatograms eics of the six feature fragment ions was confirmed and unknown peaks would be picked out for determination of precursor ions the specific workflow of determination on potential precursor ions is provided in fig s2 to promote the confidence parent ions were subsequently re detected under positive electron spray ionization esi since more abundant adduct ions m na m nh4 and so on are produced under esi validation on feasibility of esi for auxiliary determination on precursor ions of unknown peaks is provided in si besides potential precursor ions were re analyzed under parallel reaction monitoring prm mode with 20 40 and 60 ev stepped normalized collision energy nce to determine corresponding fragment ions of potential parent ions after that a chemical formula prediction using an elemental composition range of c0 100h0 200o4 20p1 3cl0 10br0 10 as well as ring and double bond equivalents dbe in xcalibur s qual browser software was performed unknown chemicals with acceptable formula and correct dbe were matched in online databases i e pubchem database or distributed structure searchable toxicity dsstox database coupled with structure elucidation under prm mode finally the chemical would be confirmed by use of commercial or in house synthesized standard still some criteria were set for nontarget screening 1 s n threshold of chromatographic peaks in ms2 10 2 relative abundance threshold for chromatographic peaks in ms2 5 3 mass tolerance 5 ppm and 10 ppm for ms and ms ms data respectively 4 the identified chemicals should generate corresponding characteristic fragment ions 2 4 quality assurance and quality control strict analytical procedures were applied to ensure the quality control for every batch of 6 12 samples one procedural blank extracting solvent was contained for calibration on the values of opes in each sample the recoveries of target opes in the method validation were estimated by spiking experiments at low concentration 20 ng g and high concentration 100 ng g with three replicates for each level the spiking experiment results are provided in table s6 additionally procedural blank n 10 values of all compounds detected in three typical places are displayed in table s7 the recovery ranges were 60 1 to 119 or 89 4 to 120 at low or high spiking concentration respectively method detection limits mdls or method quantification limits mqls were defined as 3 or 10 times the s n of 10 ng ml standard working solution for chemicals that were not detected in the blanks meanwhile for chemicals detected in blanks mdls or mqls were defined as 3 or 5 times the standard deviation sd of blank measurement chemicals of which concentrations were lower than mdls were defined as not detected nd and of which concentrations higher than mdls but lower than mqls were defined as not quantified nq nd nq was replaced by the values of mdls mqls divided by the square root of 2 in statistical analysis the concentrations of opes in sediment were normalized to dry weight dw besides the sediment samples were spiked with surrogates for accuracy and stabilization of the method the recoveries of these surrogates were 89 4 8 6 d15 tep 95 9 7 7 d15 tphp 101 9 8 d15 tdcipp 65 7 7 5 d12 tcep and 98 2 7 1 d27 tnbp respectively 2 5 data analysis the visualization of sampling sites or data processing were achieved by use of arcgis 10 6 or microsoft excel 2019 respectively meanwhile graphpad prism 8 0 2 and spss 26 0 were used for statistical analysis and data visualization for concentrations of opes detected in sediment the chemical structures of opes were drawn using chembiooffice 2014 additionally spearman correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the correlation relationships on concentrations among different ope congeners student s t test or one way anova were performed to assess the difference on ope concentrations between two groups or among three or more groups respectively principal component analysis pca was performed for determination of difference on regional pollution and dominant opes the value of p 0 05 denoted a significance level while p 0 01 represented highly significant 3 results and discussions 3 1 level and composition of target opes total concentrations ranges and arithmetic means of target opes in industrial and e waste recycling areas as well as detailed information on composition of σ6alkyl opes σ17aryl opes σ7halo opes are summarized in table s8 levels and composition of opes in surface sediments are visualized in fig 2 including taihu lake reported in our previous publication ye et al 2021 24 out of 30 target opes were detected in these three areas total of 23 opes were detected in industrial and e waste recycling areas among these detected opes triethyl phosphate tep tri 2 ethylhexyl phosphate tehp behpp tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate tdtbpp tphp bpabdp tris chloroethyl phosphate tcep and tcipp showed detection frequencies dfs higher than 90 in all three areas concentrations of σ30opes were significantly different between every two areas p 0 001 one way anova with a decreasing rank order following as e waste recycling area 12 8 9250 ng g dw industrial area 25 1 5520 ng g dw taihu lake 32 0 369 ng g dw fig 2a and table s8 it has been reported that e waste treatment plants were important sources of opes released into the environment wang et al 2020b high levels and dfs of opes were also observed in surface sediment of rivers along e waste recycling operations in guiyu china li et al 2019b and surface soils around e waste recycling area in bui dau northern vietnam matsukami et al 2015 in the present study σ7halo opes accounted for most part of σ30opes in e waste recycling area 58 2 while the proportion of σ17aryl opes or σ6alkyl opes were 38 5 or 3 3 respectively fig 2b different from e waste recycling area σ17aryl opes occupied for 75 8 or 51 0 of σ30opes in industrial area or taihu lake respectively tcipp median mean 162 645 ng g was the dominant ope in surface sediment of e waste recycling area ranging from nq to 6260 ng g with df of 100 fig 2c and table s8 tcipp has been widely applied to electronic products as flame retardants he et al 2015 nguyen et al 2019 the abundant release of tcipp to the surroundings in e waste recycling area might be attributed to the crude techniques of e waste recycling li et al 2019b it is worth noting that the gradually phased out chemical tcep cao et al 2017 was detected in sediment of these two areas and displayed considerable dfs 100 in both two typical areas and concentrations range from 0 11 to 517 ng g suggesting a continuous use or pollution of tcep in these areas in industrial area tehp and tdtbpp contributed to the most proportion of σ30opes exhibiting mean concentrations of 62 6 and 164 ng g dw respectively fig 2c and table s8 similar to industrial area tehp as well as tdtbpp were also dominant opes in taihu lake ye et al 2021 due to high hydrophobicity log kow 9 49 and high organic carbon adsorption coefficient log koc 6 87 tehp has been frequently observed in surface sediment liu et al 2018 yadav and devi 2020 tdtbpp is first identified in e waste dust venier et al 2018 but rarely reported in sediment used as plasticizers flame retardants and considered as transformed product of the most widely used organic phosphite antioxidants i168 tdtbpp is somewhat different from other opes in terms of sources shi et al 2020 another novel ope that is behpp has been detected in indoor dust meng et al 2020 surface soil gong et al 2021 and wild fish li et al 2022 in e waste recycling area concentration of behpp median mean 17 3 25 2 ng g range nd 92 3 ng g is lower than that of one traditional ope named as tphp median mean 12 5 125 ng g range nd 987 ng g whereas in industrial area concentrations of behpp is higher than that of tphp it could indicate that behpp may be easier released into the environment during industrial production table s8 concentration of behpp in e waste recycling area china in our present study is equivalent to that of tphp 7 3 38 ng g in sediment from e waste recycling operation area located in northern vietnam matsukami et al 2015 a previous research detected behpp in the standard of ehdpp indicating that behpp might be an impurity or degradation product generated during the synthesis of ehdpp meng et al 2020 in addition behpp was found related to some opes tehp tphp and tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tboep in surface soil samples which might elucidate its sources gong et al 2021 the spatial distribution of σ30opes is illustrated in fig s4 in industrial area similar trends of concentration change occurred in three different areas the highest concentration of σ30opes was obtained at the sampling sites close to electronic product manufacturers demonstrating that electronic product manufacture is responsible for the main input of opes to the rivers in industrial area imported opes are absorbed by solid particles along river flow resulting in gradual decreases on the concentrations of σ30opes in surface sediment for taihu lake σ30opes levels decreased with increasing distance from the coast of lake which may be attributed to ope manufacturing factories located near northwestern taihu lake ye et al 2021 wang et al 2018b in e waste recycling area the highest concentration of opes was found at r19 21 adjacent to an e waste recycling base meanwhile the downstream sites r16 23 254 9250 ng g dw possessed relatively higher concentrations than upstream sites r1 15 12 8 2670 ng g dw of yongning river showing adverse impact of the e waste recycling operation to determine the correlation among opes spearman correlation analysis is performed for opes with df 60 fig s5 s6 and s7 in the samples from taihu lake most of opes were not significantly correlated on concentrations ye et al 2021 in comparison to taihu lake significant positive relationships among opes were observed in industrial and e waste recycling areas except for those traditional opes some emerging or novel opes i e t butylphenyl diphenyl phosphate 2 tbpdpp isodecyl diphenyl phosphate iddp 2 isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate 2ippdpp bpabdp bis 4 tert butylphenyl phenyl phosphate b4tbppp tdtbpp and behpp are worth noting these emerging opes exhibited considerable contents range from nd to 1970 ng g and widespread distribution dfs of 60 to 100 in sampling sites across these two areas table s8 tbpdpp isomers were frequently reported in household dust indicating direct human exposure to them guan et al 2019 phillips et al 2018 besides tbpdpp was confirmed to be more detrimental to endochondral ossification in murine limb bud cultures than 2 2 4 4 tetrabromodiphenyl ether bde 47 yan and hales 2019 the concentration of 2 tbpdpp was in the range of nd 1910 ng g in industrial area and nd 99 2 ng g in e waste recycling area much higher than that in taihu lake nd 2 83 ng g ye et al 2021 suggesting its prevalent use in electronic product and subsequent release into environments during the process of producing or recycling activities iddp is a tphp based ope applied as alternative flame retardants the bioconcentration factor of iddp reached 417500 showing potential exposure risks muir 1984 bpabdp is a kind of oligomeric organophosphorus flame retardants oopfrs and can be metabolized by human into endocrine disruptor bisphenol a alves et al 2018 owing to the abundant content of bpabdp range from nd to 781 ng g in sediment and its wide occurrence dfs 90 in all three areas concerns on biological toxicity of bpabdp to aquatic environments should be aroused since bpabdp is relatively high bioaccumulative in organisms including fish species zhao et al 2019 2ippdpp and b4tbppp were dominant ingredients of ope components in common commercial fr mixture firemaster 550 fm 550 or firemaster 600 fm 600 respectively phillips et al 2017 regarding behpp similar results were obtained against previous studies that behpp was correlated to some opes simultaneously with significantly difference on concentrations of behpp among three typical areas p 0 001 indicating that industrial pollution or human activities might be important factors for the spatial distribution of behpp gong et al 2021 based on the present and previous studies this novel ope is seemingly ubiquitous and extensively used hence behpp requires more researches to be comprehensively interpreted overall the occurrence of emerging and novel opes in different environmental mediums requires continuous attention 3 2 suspect screening of opes by use of suspect screening strategy suspect opes identified in these two typical areas are summarized in table s9 taking the identified 11 suspect opes in taihu lake ye et al 2021 11 in industrial area 12 in e waste recycling area together a total of 15 homologues of opes were identified in these three areas besides information on detected suspect opes in industrial area as well as e waste recycling area is provided in table s10 suspect candidates with retention time as well as extracted mass that are consistent with those of target opes were excluded individual ope in the suspect list was matched regarding both ms1 and ms2 data while the position of substituents was not clear for some opes with isomers thus isomers were combined and one representative chemical was chosen for later analysis compounds with more reference reports in web of science core collection were prioritized additionally isomers with one or two retention times were retained then suspect opes were semiquantified against structurally similar opes possessing reference standards the semiquantified concentrations and detection frequencies of suspect opes are provided in tables s11 s12 and s13 the species of suspect opes detected in e waste recycling area were more diverse as compared to those in industrial area or taihu lake eight out of 15 suspect opes were detected in surface sediment of all three typical areas table s9 among them two ope homologues e g methyl diphenyl phosphate mdpp isomers of 2 4 diisopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate 24dippdpp are worth noting due to their relatively high dfs and lack of research on them in different environmental matrices mdpp nd 60 6 ng g was used as flame retardants and previously detected in sediment of southwestern coastal taiwan chung and ding 2009 similar to 2ippdpp 24dippdpp isomers were also one of dominant ingredients of the individual op components in common commercial fr mixture firemaster 550 fm 550 phillips et al 2017 24dippdpp isomers were detected with considerable semiquantified concentrations range from nd 375 ng g and dfs 83 and 91 in industrial and e waste recycling areas respectively tables s11 s12 and s13 according to previous studies content of 24dippdpp isomers exceeded levels of tphp tcep tcipp in house dust suggesting the potential for chronic human exposure to 24dippdpp isomers phillips et al 2017 bergh et al 2012 however levels of mdpp or 24dippdpp isomers are obviously lower than those of tphp tcep or tcipp in our present study moreover triallyl phosphate tap isomers of isopropyl diphenyl phosphate idpp 3 hydroxyphenyl diphenyl phosphate meta oh tphp and 2 4 di tert butylphenyl pentaerythritol phosphate mbdtpdp were detected in only one area respectively isomers of idpp and mbdtpdp were at low dfs 3 for idpp and 4 for mbdtpdp thus they were not furtherly discussed tap and meta oh tphp were only detectable in sediment from taihu lake table s8 tap was a sort of flame retardants gaan and sun 2007 besides tap was applied in lithium ion cells as an electrolyte additive xia et al 2015 in our previous study we conjectured that meta oh tphp was mainly generated from the hydrolysis of rdp in taihu lake ye et al 2021 despite that tphp was universally detected in sediment from industrial or e waste recycling area meta oh tphp was not detected in these two areas besides rdp was also rarely detected in these two areas not detected in industrial area and with df of 26 in e waste recycling area thus the correlation between rdp and meta oh tphp in these two places cannot be confirmed based on the dataset the findings of above mentioned suspect opes highlight the importance of evaluation on emerging alternative flame retardants 3 3 priority and regional pollution analysis of target and suspect opes among three typical areas to determine the dominant opes as well as difference on regional ope pollution among three different areas industrial area e waste recycling area and taihu lake a k means clustering based heatmap was provided and a principal component analysis pca was conducted the results are illustrated in fig 3 opes in clustering heatmap were divided into three clusters on the basis of log10 transformed concentrations or semiquantified concentrations with the objective of determination on opes that should be priorities in three areas fig 3a the first cluster contains opes tehp tdtbpp tcipp bpabdp behpp tboep tep tcep tphp with relatively high concentrations and dfs suggesting that these opes are of great important in all three areas and require more attention opes in second cluster exhibited plentiful contents in at least two areas although these opes are not comparable to those in first cluster on concentrations attention is still needed on the occurrence of these opes especially some emerging or novel opes e g mbdtpdp b4tbppp iddp 2ippdpp and so on the third cluster represents opes that were rarely detected in sediment samples in three areas however three ope homologues i e ippp isomers bdpp isomers and bmppp are detected in e waste recycling area with dfs 50 ippp isomers are one of isomers of isopropylated triarylphosphate esters itps which have similar or greater neuro and developmental toxicity compared to bde 47 in high throughput assays phillips et al 2017 bdpp isomers were frequently detected in indoor dust jesus duenas mas et al 2020 huang et al 2020 and they could potentially cause endocrine disruption schang et al 2016 and developmental or pharmacological effects on nervous system in organisms jarema et al 2015 bmppp was previously reported in house dust from beijing wang et al 2020a exposure to these three ope homologues could potentially cause health risks to organisms or humans and should be high of concern in further studies pca was performed based on concentrations or semiquantified concentrations of target or suspect opes besides data was normalized using zero mean normalization before analysis the pca biplot is displayed in fig 3b as indicated by biplot fig 3b the variations of industrial area as well as e waste recycling area were more obvious variation of e waste recycling area mainly performed on principal component 1 pc1 while industrial area appeared to vary a lot on principal component 2 pc2 tep tcipp tcep bpabdp tphp tboep tris p tert butylphenyl phosphate tbphp and 2ippdpp differentiated from other opes and offered great contribution to pc1 fig 3b thus these opes affected the variation of e waste recycling area and caused local pollution around e waste recycling operations these opes are extensively applied in electronic products as flame retardants van der veen and de boer 2012 wang et al 2018b chung and ding 2009 and can be easily released to the surroundings during the process of disposal or recycling similarly tehp tdtbpp 2 tbpdpp b4tbppp and behpp supplied most contribution to pc2 and were responsible for the variation of industrial area suggesting that these opes resulted in regional pollution around industrial area however no obvious change was observed in taihu lake on pc1 or pc2 meanwhile no characteristic opes were found to be responsible for the regional pollution variation of taihu lake this might be attributed to the fact that taihu lake is an important source of industrial agricultural and drinking water for the surroundings linked to multiple rivers thus transport vectors for opes into the taihu lake are numerous leading to the complex sources of opes in taihu lake municipal and industrial effluents dry wet deposition et al cao et al 2012 3 4 functional group dependent nontarget screening results in three typical areas for nontarget screening five unknown peaks were detected and the precursor ions of unknown peaks were determined table 1 the ions were re detected under esi in order to promote the accuracy meanwhile the precursor ions were fragmented under prm mode to obtain all fragment ions of unknown chemicals for explanation of structure peak 1 was detected at 7 99 min and was diagnosed by m z 233 03621 as well as monophenyl phosphate ion c6h8o4p m z 175 01547 with its pseudomolecular ion m h identified as m z 513 08586 proposed chemical formula c25h23o8p2 theoretical 513 08627 δmass 0 8 ppm fig s9a isotopes and fragment ions of the unknown peak were acquired and displayed in fig s9a and fig s9b respectively the fragment ions at m z 343 07247 c18h16o5p 1 5 ppm and m z 251 04669 c12h12o4p 0 3 ppm indicated that this unknown compound contained basic structure of triphenyl phosphate tphp meanwhile a neutral loss of ch2 was observed among the fragment ion of m z 265 06200 c13h14o4p 1 6 ppm and diphenyl phosphate ion c12h12o4p therefore on the basis of fragment ions obtained the unknown peak was identified as methoxy phenoxy phosphoryl oxy phenyl diphenyl phosphate mppodp the probable structure was applied in fig s9b mppodp is somewhat similar to rdp on the structure however mppodp was detected in only two areas e g taihu lake and e waste recycling area with relatively low semiquantified concentration nd 11 ng g and low dfs of 26 table s14 thus the concentration data of mppodp is not provided with the qualification of statistical analysis nevertheless the relation between novel chemical and rdp is still need to be determined and analyzed in future studies peak 2 was observed at 9 19 min with diagnostic ion of m z 175 01547 the precursor ion was m z 693 08604 in ms1 spectrum fig 4 a and the predicted formula was c27h39o8cl4p2 theoretical 693 08688 δmass 1 2 ppm actually the ion had another possible formula c28h39o7cl5p theoretical 693 08705 δmass 1 5 ppm thus we furtherly determined the formula on the basis of peak areas of chlorine isotopic ions in the ms1 spectrums fig 4a the peak area ratios were calculated as 1 1 31 0 64 0 13 close to the isotopic mass ratio 1 1 28 0 62 0 13 of cl4 hence ion with m z 693 08604 was identified as c27h39o8cl4p2 fragment ion at m z 389 05456 c15h19o8p2 1 0 ppm indicated a group loss of c12h20cl4 from the precursor ion fig 4b additionally a loss of c3h6 was observed between fragment ion at m z 215 04666 c9h12o4p 0 5 ppm and c6h6o4p moreover we found a diagnostic ion at m z 161 96568 c6h4ocl2 14 3 ppm indicating that two chlorine atoms are attached to a benzene ring despite that remaining groups cannot be fully confirmed based on the fragment ions in ms ms spectra the possible structure of this compound was provided and the chemical was identified as bis dichlorophenyl propane 1 3 diyl bis hexylated phosphate bdcbhp fig 4c bdcbhp was merely detected in taihu lake table s14 therefore the correlation between bdcbhp and other opes in taihu lake were determined interestingly bdcbhp showed significantly positive relationship to tdtbpp mdpp bpabdp rdp and meta oh tphp fig 4d and table s15 these five opes were proved to be imported into western taihu lake through nanxi river in our previous study and might be originated from the largest organophosphate flame retardant manufacturer ye et al 2021 thus bdcbhp might share same sources with these five opes in taihu lake as a kind of chlorinated opes bdcbhp shows potential biological exposure and deserves more research peak 3 was observed at 11 51 min in the eics of triphenyl phosphate ion c18h16o4p m z 327 07807 as well as diphenyl phosphate ion c12h12o4p m z 251 04677 the parent ion m h was m z 649 39996 fig 5 a and the proposed chemical formula was c40h58o5p theoretical 649 40164 δmass 2 6 ppm similarly the isotopes of parent ion were determined fig 5a and the parent ion was segmented under prm mode to acquire fragment ions fig 5b in the prm ms2 spectrum fragment ions at m z 593 33673 c36h50o5p 4 0 ppm m z 537 27521 c32h42o5p 3 2 ppm m z 481 21262 c28h34o5p 0 6 ppm m z 425 15008 c24h26o5p 3 9 ppm and m z 369 08835 c20h18o5p 2 7 ppm were observed and could be attributed to the consecutive neutral losses of c4h8 from the parent ion additionally a group loss of c2h3o was observed between the triphenyl phosphate ion c18h16o4p and fragment ion of c20h18o5p based on above mentioned structural data the unknown peak was identified as tert butyl phenyl ethyne oxidane bis 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate tpbdtp and the possible structure is performed in fig 5c it is worth noting that the structure of this compound is similar to tdtbpp therefore correlation analysis was applied between two structurally similar substances interestingly tpbdtp showed strong positive correlation to tdtbpp r 0 7051 p 0 001 fig 5d demonstrating that these two chemicals might be originated from same pollution source in view of the positive correlations two possible sources of this substance were speculated 1 tpbdtp might be an industrial by product or impurity of tdtbpp 2 tpbdtp might be a transformed product of tdtbpp through microbial metabolism certainly considering that tdtbpp can be generated from i168 this new compound might be also directly produced from i168 similarly correlation of tpbdtp and i168 in three typical areas was determined significant positive correlation was observed between these two chemicals r 0 2862 p 0 0122 fig 5d firstly we verified that tpbdtp did not exist in the standard of tdtbpp or i168 secondly standard of i168 was oxidized by exposing the i168 solution in fume hood for 24 h to determine whether this new substance can be generated through the oxidation of i168 and the result was not thirdly the presence of tpbdtp in previously processed surface soil gong et al 2021 and indoor dust zhao et al 2020 samples was investigated interestingly we observed that this compound was only found in surface soil but did not exist in indoor dust considering relatively low semiquantified content of tpbdtp as compared to tdtbpp table s8 and s14 this new compound is more likely a metabolic transformed product of tdtbpp however confirmation on the structure as well as sources of this compound needs to be accomplished in future studies peak 4 and peak 5 were observed at 13 30 min and 14 12 min with diagnostic ion of m z 98 98417 respectively the precursor ions were m z 635 53740 of peak 5 c36h76o6p 1 6 ppm and m z 663 56775 of peak 6 c38h80o6p 1 4 ppm fig s10a and s11a besides isotopes of these two chemicals were determined fig s10a and s11a given fragment ions under prm mode we found consecutive neutral losses of c16h32 from both parent ions of these two compounds with fragment ion c4h12o6p left fig s10b and s11b different from peak 5 another group loss of c2h4 was observed in parent ion of peak 6 peak 5 was then identified as bis 2 hexadecoxyethyl hydrogen phosphate bhhpp based on the precursor and fragment ions fig s10b bhhpp is recorded in pubchem database but not reported in environmental mediums the specific structure of peak 6 is uncertain due to limited information of fragment ions in view of similar fragmentation modes between peak 5 and peak 6 compound of peak 6 was identified as bis 2 hexadecoxyethyl ethyl phosphate bhepp and possible structure is displayed in fig s11b bhepp is not recorded in online database and might be a potential parent compound of bhhpp bhhpp was only detected in e waste recycling area nd 19 1 ng g df of 43 while bhepp was observed in both industrial nd 0 32 ng g df of 7 and e waste recycling areas nd 10 4 ng g df of 35 table s14 the pearson correlation analysis was applied for these two compounds in e waste recycling area and the result is displayed in fig s12 interestingly strong significant positive relation was observed between these two substances r 0 8576 p 0 0001 indicating that 1 bhhpp and bhepp could have similar sources or 2 bhhpp could be generated from metabolism of bhepp in e waste recycling area however these assumptions need further validations novel opes including mppodp tpbdtp bdcbhp and bhepp had no searchable records in pubchem database or dsstox database lack of information on these opes in the database might be attributed to the fact that these compounds were unnoticed or impurities degradation products of other opes the results showed an active demand for the identification of such potential opes and the nontarget approach developed in this study could help realizing this purpose 4 conclusion overall we optimized the workflow of integrated target suspect and functional group dependent screening strategy by applying esi for improvement on the confidence of precursor ions and the enhanced strategy was applied for comprehensive analysis of opes in surface sediment n 73 from industrial area taihu lake or e waste recycling area we successfully identified 44 opes and industrial or e waste recycling area contained statistically significantly greater ope concentrations as compared to natural taihu lake ye et al 2021 according to the results of pca some opes were determined to be responsible for the regional pollution in e waste recycling area tep tcipp tcep bpabdp tphp tboep tbphp and 2ippdpp or industrial area tehp tdtbpp 2 tbpdpp b4tbppp and behpp whereas the sources of opes in taihu lake were complex besides the discovery of several emerging opes i e 2 tbpdpp 24dippdpp b4tbppp 2ippdpp iddp and bpabdp highlights the market shift to alternative flame retardants more importantly four novel opes mppodp tpbdtp bdcbhp and bhepp identified in this study and not recorded in pubchem or dsstox databases are worth noting and require more studies they may be the transformed products or impurities of other opes and potential impact of them to the environment or

16021,antibiotic resistance genes args are considered as emerging environmental contaminants which should be controlled by wastewater treatment plants to prevent their discharge into the environment however conventional treatment techniques generally fail to successfully reduce args and the release of cell free args was underestimated in this study potassium ferrate fe vi pretreatment combined with ultrafiltration uf process was developed to remove both cell associated and cell free args in real secondary effluent compared to ferric chloride fe iii and poly aluminum chloride pacl pretreatment processes it was found that total args especially cell free args were effectively removed by fe vi oxidation however due to the poor settleability of the negatively charged particles formed by fe vi in the secondary effluent the removal of cell associated args was less compared to fe iii and pacl pretreatments the combination of fe vi and uf removed the most args 3 26 5 01 logs due to the efficient removal of cell free args by fe vi 2 15 logs and co interception of both cell associated args and fe vi formed particles of the uf high throughput sequencing revealed that fe vi decreased the viability and relative abundances of the potential args hosts fe vi uf exhibited the best performance on humic like fluorescent organic matters removal as well as the least phytotoxicity in the effluent moreover membrane fouling was remarkably alleviated by fe vi pretreatment because 1 fe vi removed macromolecules such as protein like and polysaccharide like substances which would block the membrane pores 2 fe vi improved the hydrophilicity of foulants and reduced the hydrophobic adsorption between foulants and membrane in short fe vi uf is a promising technology to efficiently remove args especially cell free args and alleviate uf membrane fouling in wastewater reclamation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes args potassium ferrate coagulation ultrafiltration wastewater reclamation 1 introduction the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in public health and animal husbandry led to their continuous discharge into the environment which will not only cause environmental chemical pollution but also induce the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args yu et al 2021 among them args can pose serious risks to both human health and environmental ecosystem because they typically locate in mobile genetic elements and can widely spread in microorganisms through horizontal gene transfer hgt li et al 2017 wastewater treatment plants wwtps as reservoirs of args receive antibiotics discharges from hospitals residents and agriculture which are considered as an important barrier to prevent the release of args into the urban environment however conventional wwtps are not designed to remove args and relative abundance of args in wwtps effluent can be 105 108 copies l ni et al 2020 therefore post treatment methods should be considered after the conventional biological treatment process to avoid excessive args discharge into receiving water recently args removal has been investigated in a series of advanced treatment processes such as chlorination ozonation ultraviolet irradiation and advanced oxidation processes based on sulfate radical or hydroxyl radical lamba and ahammad 2017 iakovides et al 2019 duan et al 2020 liu et al 2022 however the high energy and reagent costs as well as the formation of potential carcinogenic by products may limit their application dong et al 2017 by contrast coagulation is a physicochemical process to improve the settleable ability of suspended particles by adding coagulating reagents such as ferric based and aluminum based coagulants which is considered as an effective and economical method to remove args in wastewater li et al 2017 yu et al 2021 however in practical application the effect of coagulation for args removal may be reduced due to the incomplete separation and resuspension of solid precipitates caused by water interference li et al 2019 this problem can be solved by the subsequent use of ultrafiltration uf technology which can effectively reject the suspended solids after coagulation moreover uf also has the inherent advantage of removing colloids and microorganisms and the membrane fouling caused by effluent organic matter efom can also be alleviated if coagulation is used as the pretreatment process chen et al 2021 however it should be noted that args cannot be degraded by coagulation which were just transferred from wastewater to coagulation sludge and the sludge with concentrated args may still pose serious risks to the environment if they are handled improperly potassium ferrate fe vi is another promising technique in wastewater treatment as it has dual functions of oxidation and subsequent coagulation as well as green chemical properties liu et al 2018 fe vi has high redox potential at acidic ph 2 2 v and basic ph 0 7 v which has been successfully applied to the inactivation of various microorganisms and the removal of heavy metals phosphate pollutants and micropollutants lee and von gunten 2010 chen et al 2021 meanwhile fe vi can effectively reduce the cytotoxicity and dna dsbs effects in mammalian cells wu et al 2021a however there are few studies on the removal of args by fe vi and sometimes the results may be controversial suyamud et al 2021 studied the effect of fe vi on the removal of bla tem and orta in aquaculture water and found no significant difference before and after treatments similarly zhang et al 2021 considered that fe vi could not remove intracellular tetracycline resistance genes due to the multi protection of cell structure and rapid decay of fe vi in the phosphate solution system conversely ni et al 2020 observed the efficient removal of intracellular args in the secondary effluent due to the combined effect of fe vi induced microbial dna damage and coagulation initiated by fe vi reduction products further studies are necessary to fill in the gaps of knowledge in relation to the effect of fe vi on the removal of args besides it is of concern that previous studies mainly focused on args that could be intercepted by 0 22 μm filters named cell associated args including intercellular args and cell particle adsorbed extracellular args while args that could pass through 0 22 μm filters named cell free args were always neglected li et al 2017 ni et al 2020 suyamud et al 2021 zhang et al 2018a detected the presence of args in free extracellular dna in wwtp effluent revealing a previously overlooked source of args although the abundances of extracellular args are much lower than that of intracellular args they can proliferate among bacteria through hgt pathway based on extracellular dna transformation thus showing persistence in the discharged effluent zhang et al 2013 2018a however up to now the effect of fe vi on cell free args removal from wastewater systems has not been evaluated neither has coagulation process such as ferric chloride fe iii and poly aluminum chloride pacl coagulation besides since membrane fouling limits its long term use it is necessary to further clarify the physicochemical interactions between pretreated foulants and membrane surface on molecular level so as to reveal the mechanisms of membrane fouling mitigation by different pretreatment processes therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to compare cell associated args and cell free args removal efficiency of fe vi uf process with conventional fe iii uf and pacl uf processes 2 to assess the performance of the integrated process on efom removal and phytotoxicity reduction 3 to interpret membrane fouling alleviation mechanism by different pretreatment processes through combined pore blockage cake filtration model and extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory this study is expected to provide a promising wastewater treatment technology for removing args and mitigating membrane fouling in wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 secondary effluent and agents the secondary effluent was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of a municipal wwtp in harbin china the collected wastewater samples were pre filtered through a filter paper pore size of 20 30 μm to remove large particulate matters before the experiment and the previous study has shown that the filter paper can retain neither bacteria nor dna zhang et al 2019 the main characteristics of the secondary effluent were turbidity 0 89 0 11 ntu uv254 0 106 0 008 cm 1 dissolved organic carbon doc 6 10 0 76 mg l tp 0 503 mg l ph 7 87 tn 9 97 mg l nh4 n 0 30 mg l no3 7 32 mg l no2 0 75 mg l and cl 76 02 mg l potassium ferrate k2feo4 fe vi 90 was prepared according to the wet chemical synthesis method li et al 2005 as shown in fig s1 the fe vi solution has a unique uv visible spectrum with a maximum absorbance at 510 nm the coagulants ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o fe iii 99 and poly aluminum chloride al2 oh ncl6 n xh2o m pacl al2o3 28 were purchased from tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china 2 2 pretreatments and membrane filtration tests the fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatment experiments were carried out in a series of 1 l beakers on a programmable jar test apparatus zr4 6 china the fe vi with designed concentrations 1 5 3 6 9 and 12 mg fe6 l was added to the wastewater samples and followed by rapid agitation at 300 rpm for 60 min and then settled for 60 min for the coagulation experiments the coagulants fe iii with a dose of 9 mg fe3 l and pacl with a dose of 9 mg al3 l were added to the solution respectively and the pretreatments procedures were comprised of rapid agitation 300 rpm 2 min and then slow agitation 40 rpm 20 min before settling for 30 min the doses of the coagulants fe iii and pacl were determined based on the preliminary jar tests considering the balance between turbidity removal performance and chemical cost fig s2 flat sheet polyethersulfone pes membranes up150 microdyn nadir germany were used for subsequent membrane filtration tests and the filtration pressure was constant at 0 1 mpa the schematic diagram of membrane filtration device was shown in fig s3 and the detailed filtration methods were presented in text s1 all experiments were performed in triplicate under room temperature 20 1 c with ph uncontroled during each experiment 2 3 args determination and microbial community analysis according to the detection frequency in the effluent from wwtps pazda et al 2019 nine typical args three tetracycline resistance genes tetm teto tetw two sulfonamide resistance genes suli sulii two macrolide resistance genes ermb ermf and two quinolone resistance genes aac 6 ib cr qnrs the mobile genetic element inti1 and the 16s rrna gene were selected for quantitative detection through real time quantitative pcr qpcr the primers for the target genes are listed in table s1 the detailed procedures for cell associated dna and cell free dna extraction and subsequent qpcr reactions as well as high throughput sequencing analysis of microbial community were supplemented in text s2 2 4 interaction energy analysis and membrane fouling assessment based on the xdlvo theory the foulant foulant interaction energy of cohesion δ g f f and the foulant membrane interaction energy of adhesion δ g f m were related to surface tension parameters these values can be calculated by the contact angle between the probe liquid and the solid surface the detailed description of interaction energy calculation can be found in text s3 and the surface tension parameters of three probe liquids ultrapure water glycerol and diiodomethane were listed in table s2 moreover the resistance in series model based on darcy s law was used to evaluate membrane fouling resistance the filtration experimental data were fitted by the combined pore blockage cake filtration model and hermia differential form model which were used to verify the combined fouling mechanisms and assess the fouling mechanism transformation respectively the detailed description of membrane fouling resistance and model fitting can be found in text s4 s6 2 5 analytical methods and statistical analysis the analysis methods of doc uv254 fluorescent organics turbidity ph particle size and seed germination index gi of water samples as well as membrane fouling layer characterization by fourier transform infrared ftir and scanning electron microscopy sem were concluded in text s7 the statistical analysis of args data between different treatments was performed by one way anova through spss 23 0 co occurrence network analysis based on spearman correlations was conducted by gephi software 3 results and discussion 3 1 cell associated and cell free args removal the performance of fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatments in args removal were compared based on the decrease of absolute gene abundances in both cell associated and cell free fractions as shown in fig 1 a and b the relative abundances of cell associated args in the raw water were ranged from 104 to 108 copies l with qnrs 5 59 108 copies l and aac 6 ib cr 2 57 107 copies l being the top two genes and the mobile genetic element inti1 also presented a relatively high gene abundance 2 28 106 copies l meanwhile the detected cell free args also accounted for a large proportion of the total args in the raw water which were only approximately an order of magnitude lower than that in cell associated args some cell free args such as tetw and ermb were even higher than those of cell associated fractions therefore except for cell associated args a watchful eye should also be kept on cell free args which might be an important pollution type of args in secondary effluent a significant reduction of cell associated args was observed in the secondary effluent after the fe vi pretreatment for most target genes a higher fe vi dose could lead to a better removal efficiency and a 0 72 1 06 logs removal of cell associated args was observed under fe vi dose of 12 mg fe6 l nevertheless on the whole the removal of cell associated args at fe vi 9 was not as good as those using fe iii or pacl under the same dose for example pacl pretreatment exhibited the best performance on quinolone resistance genes 1 21 logs and sulfonamide resistance genes 1 16 logs removal while fe iii pretreatment had the best effect on macrolide resistance genes 1 38 logs and tetracycline resistance genes 0 99 logs removal however the removal efficiency of inti1 by fe vi 9 was higher than that by fe iii indicating that fe vi was more conducive to reduce hgt among microbial species than fe iii as for the cell free args the increased fe vi dose did not show obvious regularity on their removal the maximum removal of most cell free args was obtained at the dose of 9 or 12 mg fe6 l 2 15 logs reduction which was much higher compared to those achieved for the cell associated args however different from cell associated args fe iii and pacl pretreatments showed similar removal of cell free args varied between 0 77 1 98 logs and 0 90 2 10 logs respectively which were much lower than those obtained by fe vi these results indicated that fe vi pretreatment had more advantages in the removal of cell free args than fe iii and pacl pretreatments although it showed lower removal efficiencies for cell associated args different mechanisms may lead to differences in the removal efficiencies of cell associated args and cell free args in fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatments in general the specific mechanisms of fe iii and pacl coagulation pretreatments for the removal of args mainly include electric double layer compression charge neutralization electrostatic adsorption physical enmeshment and complexing action and the portions of fe and al play a vital role in determining the performance of coagulation processes yu et al 2021 as the isoelectric point of bacterial cells ph 2 3 or 4 5 and extracellular args ph 2 5 were lower than ph of secondary effluent ph 7 87 in this study table s3 they are mainly negatively charged in the raw water li et al 2017 there were approximately 78 fea and 22 feb in the fe iii solution when fe iii was added to the secondary effluent the monomeric fea species were hydrolyzed into positively charged colloidal or amorphous hydroxide precipitate fec so electric double layer compression and charge neutralization would become the main mechanisms for args removal during fe iii coagulation lei et al 2009 however the portions of alb 33 and alc 42 in pacl solution was higher than ala 25 thus the args would mainly be removed by relatively stable polymeric species alb and sol or gel species alc through adsorption charge neutralization entrapment and interparticle bridging these two species have been proved to have more advantages in removing pollutants during coagulation process zhang et al 2018b moreover al3 and fe3 could induce the aggregation of free dna through complexing with negatively charged dna phosphate groups so as to achieve the purpose of neutralizing the free dna charges and removing cell free args qin et al 2017 different from fe iii and pacl coagulation the mechanisms of args removal by fe vi pretreatment were mainly attributed to its dual functions of chemical oxidation and coagulation fe vi is a strong oxidant which has the redox potential of 2 2 v and 0 7 v under acidic and basic conditions respectively besides fe v fe iv and reactive oxygen species such as oh could also be generated from self decomposition of fe vi which had strong oxidation abilities fe vi fe v fe iii h2o2 fe vi fe iv fe ii fe ii h2o2 oh fe iii liu et al 2018 the previous report showed that fe vi could penetrate into the bacteria cells and act directly on dna inside thus damaging args or inti1 carried by the genomic dna and plasmids ni et al 2020 moreover coagulation also played a role in the removal of both cell associated args and cell free args the in situ formed iron hydr oxide particles can adsorb bacterial cells and extracellular args which were expected to be removed by subsequent settlement however the zeta potentials of particles formed by fe vi remained in the supernatant were 13 6 mv fe vi dose was 9 mg fe6 l settled for 60 min in this study which means these particles were slightly negatively charged and exhibited a relatively stable state in the aqueous solution thus the particle aggregation proceeded slowly and showed poor settleability in the secondary effluent this was also reflected by the increased turbidity 4 05 ntu of the secondary effluent treated by 9 mg fe6 l fe vi as shown in table s3 which was much higher than the raw water 0 89 ntu while the turbidity of fe iii and pacl treated secondary effluent was 0 26 ntu and 0 19 ntu respectively the poor performance of coagulation during fe vi pretreatment may interpret the fact that fe vi showed worse performance than fe iii and pacl pretreatments on cell associated args removal on the other hand some components in the secondary effluent including humic acid inorganic ions and inorganic nitrogen compounds such as ammonia and nitrite would compete with args to react with fe vi lee and von gunten 2010 feng et al 2016 these substances may consume fe vi and resulted in a low removal of cell associated args by contrast fe vi pretreatment had more advantages in removing cell free args probably because cell free args lacked protection from microbial cells and thus were more easily to be oxidized by fe vi in addition it should be noted that extracellular args may be released from the dead microbial cells after being oxidized by fe vi however no increase in the absolute abundances of cell free args was observed in this research suggesting that the released args might be further oxidized by fe vi or adsorbed on iron hydr oxide particles formed from fe vi ni et al 2020 finally the filtration of uf membrane could further remove the residual args as shown in fig 1 c fe vi 9 uf fe iii uf and pacl uf processes exhibited excellent performance on args removal with the removal efficiency of 2 68 5 13 logs compared to the raw water higher than that direct uf process 2 30 3 90 logs to be specific fe vi 9 uf had the best performance in args removal 3 26 5 01 logs and the absolute abundances of all the tested genes were below 2 07 103 copies l therefore the combination of fe vi and subsequent uf was necessary for both cell associated and cell free args removal moreover negatively charged pes membrane surface could also repel negatively charged cell free args slipko et al 2019 as well as the adsorption of cell free args by fe al precipitates or natural colloidal material rejected on the membrane surface li et al 2019 may contribute to args removal 3 2 variation of microbial community and its relationship with args alpha diversity was used to analyze the changes of bacterial community diversity in the secondary effluent before and after fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatments and the results are listed in table s4 the good s coverage values for all the samples were above 0 99 indicating that the results of microbial sequencing could meet the analysis requirements compared to the raw water the observed species and chao1 were all decreased after the pretreatments of fe vi fe iii and pacl suggesting the reduction of microbial species richness in addition after the secondary effluent pretreated by fe vi 9 fe iii and pacl the shannon index decreased from 4 67 to 2 40 4 09 and 3 62 and the simpson index decreased from 0 814 to 0 483 0 794 and 0 783 respectively the reduction of shannon and simpson indexes both suggested the decline of the bacterial diversity of the samples especially for those pretreated by fe vi the relative abundance of bacteria at phylum level in all the water samples are shown in fig 2 a proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in the secondary effluent followed by firmicutes and bacteroidota with the increase of fe vi dose the relative abundances of proteobacteria and firmicutes significantly decreased indicating that they might be more vulnerable to fe vi pretreatment however both fe iii and pacl pretreatments had little effect on the relative abundance of bacteria at phylum level as shown in fig 2 b all the samples were further analyzed with hierarchically clustered heatmap at genus level the results indicated that the microbial community structure in the raw water was similar to that of the samples after fe iii and pacl pretreatments while was significantly different from those pretreated by various doses of fe vi the dissimilar effects of bacterial community between fe vi and coagulation pretreatments were mainly attributed to the oxidation capacity of fe vi previous study has found that the reaction of oxidants with amine moieties might play an important role in cell membrane damage ramseier et al 2011 this is because amines appear in the peptidoglycans which are the components of cell wall and periplasm in gram positive and gram negative bacteria respectively moreover amine moieties also present in some phospholipids forming the cytoplasmic membrane and some amino acids of proteins that are embedded in the cell membrane ramseier et al 2011 fe vi showed reactivity to primary and secondary amines lee and von gunten 2010 so it could possibly penetrate cell membrane and oxidize protoplasm dna and other microbial organs thus causing the inactivation of bacteria zhang et al 2021 different reactivity of fe vi towards the molecules of microbial cells may affect the structure of microbial community in this study fe vi pretreatment significantly declined the relative abundances of novosphingobium sphingobium brevundimonas zoogloea acidovorax methylobacterium methylorubrum aquabacterium hydrogenophaga and acinetobacter which all belong to phylum proteobacteria wu et al 2021b reported that sphingobium had high extracellular polymeric substances productivity and were always found in the foulants on reverse osmosis membranes therefore a decrease in the relative abundance of sphingobium under the pretreatment of fe vi may be beneficial to alleviate long term membrane fouling the correlations among cell associated args inti1 and the top 30 genera were determined based on spearman analysis the results showed that there were 5 genera significantly positively p 0 01 8 genera positively p 0 05 and 1 genus negatively p 0 05 associated with args and inti1 which were marked with different colors of rectangle frame in the heatmap in fig 2 b the positive correlations among args inti1 and genera were further visualized by using network analysis fig 2 c cell associated args including aac 6 ib cr and sulii showed positive correlations to the potential host bacterial aeromonas vagococcus acetobacteroides brochothrix pseudarcobacter chryseobacterium novosphingobium and lactococcus besides args including ermf qnrs suli and tetm also expressed significant association with the above mentioned genera as well as desulfovibrio and desulfomicrobium brevundimonas sphingobium and novosphingobium had a strong relationship with both ermb and teto and these two args showed the maximum removal efficiency among all the tested args under fe vi and pacl pretreatments probably were due to the high reduction of brevundimonas 89 1 in all the pretreatments moreover it was observed that bacteria including aeromonas chryseobacterium acetobacteroides vagococcus and acinetobacter were potential hosts of inti1 and the first four genera also had an affinity relationship with most of the tested args illustrating that they might have multiple antibiotic resistance and have stronger hgt potential therefore it could be concluded that fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatments were beneficial to reduce the viability of potential host of args thus preventing the widespread of args in the aquatic environment 3 3 improvement of the effluent quality as shown in fig 3 a and b the variations of doc and uv254 during fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatment and subsequent uf processes were examined to characterize the total dissolved organic matter and the organic matter mainly humic substances containing unsaturated bonds or aromatic chromophores respectively as fe vi dose increased from 0 to 12 mg fe6 l the average doc concentrations gradually dropped from 6 10 to 5 38 mg l and the average uv254 sharply decreased from 0 106 to 0 068 cm 1 corresponding to the maximum removal efficiencies of 11 8 and 35 8 respectively these findings suggest that fe vi preferentially to attack compounds that could be characterized by uv254 but had limited capability in efom mineralization in addition it was observed that fe vi exhibited better performance in uv254 removal when compared to the same dose of fe iii and pacl while the removal efficiencies of doc by fe vi were lower than the other two this is because fe vi selectively oxide electron rich organic moieties in efom such as aniline phenol amine and alkene lee and von gunten 2010 since the efom containing aromatic structures or unsaturated bonds are particularly to be absorbed by uv light the oxidation of these efom by fe vi would result in a significant reduction in uv254 however some efom also have electron withdrawing moieties or have no active aromatic groups which could resist the attack from fe vi moreover fe vi had self decomposition behavior in water 2 feo 4 2 5 h 2 o 2 fe oh 3 4 o h 1 5 o 2 the consumption of fe vi may reduce the effective fe vi oxidant exposure for the removal of efom thus showing a relatively poorer doc removal compared to fe iii and pacl pretreatment nevertheless the filtration of uf membranes further facilitated the removal efficiencies of organics due to its retention and adsorption and the removal performance of doc and uv254 showed a regularity of pacl 29 5 fe vi 9 26 4 fe iii 24 9 and fe vi 9 39 6 pacl 27 4 fe iii 19 8 respectively the fluorescence three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem was employed to further characterize the changes of fluorescence organic matters in the secondary effluent after the pretreatment of fe vi fe iii and pacl and the subsequent uf process with the help of parallel factor analysis parafac and openfluor database table s5 three components were identified as c1 ex em 270 375 474 terrestrial humic like c2 ex em 250 345 418 wastewater nutrient enrichment tracer and c3 290 390 humic materials from microbial origin the contour plots and wavelength loadings of the three identified components are illustrated in fig s4 and the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of each component in the feed and permeate are shown in fig 3 c the fmax of c1 c2 and c3 in the raw water were 18 87 27 69 and 22 05 qsu respectively where 1 qsu corresponded to the fluorescence intensity for 1 μg l quinine in 0 05 m h2so4 at ex em of 350 450 nm with the increase of fe vi dose the fmax of component c1 c2 and c3 significantly decreased which was as low as 7 68 8 19 and 8 76 qsu at the dose of 12 mg fe6 l respectively suggesting that humic like fluorescent organic matters were very reactive to fe vi nie et al 2020 however fe iii and pacl pretreatments had a limited effect on the fluorescence components removal as the removal efficiencies for all the components were below 20 the results also indicated that uf treatment exerted a minor effect on the fluorescence organic matters and the removal efficiencies for all the components were only slightly improved after filtration in general at the same dose the average removal efficiency of the three components in the permeate followed the order of fe vi 9 60 7 pacl 19 5 fe iii 15 9 suggesting that fe vi exerted better fmax removal performance than pacl or fe iii coagulation probably due to the significant change in the fluorescent characteristic of efom induced by fe vi oxidation gi was also employed in this study to indicate the phytotoxicity of the raw water and treated water samples phytotoxicity assay was selected among various toxicity assessments in order to evaluate the toxicity of the treated wastewater before reuse for agriculture irrigation iakovides et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 d the gi value of the raw water was the lowest 71 9 indicating the strongest phytotoxicity the combined treatment processes all reduced the phytotoxicity especially for fe vi uf process and the gi value followed the order of fe vi 9 uf 83 4 pacl uf 81 2 fe iii uf 76 6 however the gi value of all the combined processes was lower than that of the direct uf process 98 6 probably because of the inhibition of gi by residual fe and al ions in the treated water after fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatments zhang and zhou 2005 wei et al 2008 3 4 membrane fouling control performance 3 4 1 flux curves and fouling reversibility analysis in order to evaluate membrane fouling caused by efom and its alleviation through the pretreatments of fe vi fe iii and pacl membrane filtration tests were carried out as shown in fig 4 a raw water without any pretreatment caused a drastic flux decline with a final normalized flux j j0 the ratio of instantaneous flux to initial pure water flux of 0 22 in contrast fe vi pretreatment significantly alleviated membrane fouling and a higher fe vi dose led to a smoother decline curve the final normalized flux increased to 0 49 0 53 0 58 0 62 and 0 67 after the 1600 ml filtration volume with fe vi doses of 1 5 3 6 9 and 12 mg fe6 l respectively this trend was consistent with the results of tang et al 2022 in which the membrane fouling caused by the shale gas wastewater decreased with the increase of fe vi dose however liu et al 2018 observed a more serious membrane fouling tendency when fe vi dose increased from 8 4 to 11 2 mg fe6 l during the filtration of reclaimed water the disparity of membrane fouling trend may be due to the fact that in their experiment fe vi treated water was directly filtered without settling resulting in more iron hydr oxide particles accumulated on the membrane surface and caused membrane fouling furthermore the flux decline was also significantly alleviated when fe iii and pacl pretreatments were applied and the final normalized flux were 0 56 and 0 75 respectively the above results indicated that pacl pretreatment exhibited the best performance on membrane fouling alleviation followed by fe vi and fe iii at the same dose fig 4 b showed the reversibility of pes membrane fouling during filtration the reversible and irreversible fouling resistance caused by the raw water was 2 92 1012 and 1 46 1011 m 1 respectively indicating that reversible fouling played a dominant role in pes uf membrane fouling caused by efom when fe vi pretreatment was applied the reversible fouling resistance was sharply decreased with the increase of fe vi dose with the maximum reduction of 89 0 at fe vi dose of 12 mg fe6 l this result suggests that fe vi could well remove high molecular weight mw organics which were the main source of the membrane reversible fouling however the variation of irreversible fouling resistance was not obvious at different fe vi doses likely due to the formation of some low mw substances during oxidation which had a higher potential to block membrane pores by contrast both reversible and irreversible fouling resistance were decreased by fe iii and pacl pretreatments and the reduction degree of reversible fouling resistance was greater than that of irreversible overall under the same dose the reduction degree of total fouling resistance by different pretreatments was pacl 89 6 fe vi 9 81 3 fe iii 74 7 3 4 2 modeling of membrane filtration process in order to better understand the membrane fouling mitigation mechanism the combined pore blockage cake filtration model was utilized to fit the normalized flux versus filtration time data for the uf process with fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatments the results depicted in fig s5 showed that all the data fitted well with this model r2 0 99 indicating that the co existence of pore blockage and cake filtration in the efom filtration process regardless of the presence of pretreatments the original data and fitting data were further replotted as d2t dv2 versus dt dv curves to determine the transition of dominant membrane fouling mechanism during filtration and the results are shown in fig 4 c it is observed that the raw water had the maximum values of both d2t dv2 and dt dv compared to the pretreated water samples which was due to the lower initial flux yielded by the fast flux decline caused by efom pretreatments with fe vi fe iii and pacl noticeably reduced the values of both d2t dv2 and dt dv in the characteristic curves and the values gradually decreased with the increase of fe vi dose indicating the alteration of the fouling degree in addition all the curves in fig 4 c exhibit an upward trend in the initial stage which indicated the dominance of pore blockage mechanisms in the early flux decline then each characteristic curve presented a negative slope after reaching the maximum which could be interpreted as the transition of filtration mechanism from pore blockage to cake filtration the plots of fouling behavior index n versus filtration volume in fig 4 d further explained the transition of membrane fouling mechanism in the filtration process the curves of the raw water exhibited an initial n value of 1 74 which indicated that standard or complete pore blocking played the dominant mechanism in the early efom filtration step by contrast the initial n value decreased to around 1 after the pretreatment of fe vi fe iii and pacl showing that the initial fouling mechanisms were changed to intermediate pore blocking in addition it was observed that the pretreated water samples required less filtration volume during the pore blockage stage and they were more likely to enter the transition state from pore blockage to cake filtration which also explained the reduction of irreversible fouling 3 4 3 interaction energy analysis the surface tension parameters interfacial free energy of cohesion δ g f f and interfacial free energy of adhesion δ g f m were measured and listed in table 1 where δ g f f represents the affinity between two similar solid surfaces and δ g f m here represents the affinity potential between membrane and treated or untreated efom samples wang et al 2017 the virgin pes membrane exhibited a relatively high electron donor component value γ s compared to that electron acceptor component γ s indicating a high electron donor monopolarity with apolar characteristics besides the value of δ g f f was negative for the virgin pes membrane 19 92 mj m2 suggesting a hydrophobic nature on membrane surface compared to the raw water the values of γ s were gradually evaluated with the increased dose of fe vi which indicated the improvement of hydrophilicity of efom wang et al 2017 furthermore the values of δ g f f showed an upward trend from 49 87 mj m2 in raw water to 12 25 mj m2 in fe vi 12 pretreated water along with the increasing fe vi dose it is generally believed that a negative value of δ g f f indicates thermodynamic instability and hydrophobicity that is foulants tend to attract each other while a positive δ g f f value represents thermodynamic stability and hydrophilicity thus foulants repel each other the increase in δ g f f value from negative to positive indicated that efom was transformed from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity by fe vi when its dose exceed 9 mg fe6 l which was expected to reduce the hydrophobic adsorption between foulants and membrane by contrast although fe iii and pacl pretreatments weakened the hydrophobicity of efom the pretreated efom still had thermodynamic instability and hydrophobic nature as shown by the less negative values of the two pretreatments versus untreated efom the analysis of δ g f m between foulants and membrane could further provide a basis for explaining the mechanism of membrane fouling alleviation all the measured water samples exhibited the negative values of δ g f m meaning the attractive interaction existed between foulants and pes membrane the lowest value of δ g f m was obtained for the membrane fouled by untreated secondary effluent 35 84 mj m2 indicating that raw water had the strongest attraction to the membrane the affinity between foulants and membrane gradually weakened with the increased dose of fe vi which was shown by the increasing trend of δ g f m however when the secondary effluent was pretreated by the same dose of fe vi fe iii and pacl the value of δ g f m followed the order of fe vi 9 2 50 mj m2 pacl 20 63 mj m2 fe iii 22 46 mj m2 that is fe vi 9 had the least attractive interaction with membrane compared to fe iii and pacl this was not consistent with the regularity of membrane flux decline where fe vi 9 gave a lower final normalized flux and higher fouling resistance when compared to pacl the contradictions between experimental filtration results and thermodynamic calculations indicate that in addition to the interfacial energy other mechanisms such as size exclusion may also have a critical influence on the filtration performance in practice as shown in table s3 the values of turbidity and medium particle diameter dx 50 were much higher than those of raw water when fe vi dose exceeds 6 mg fe6 l the significant increase of suspended solids and particle size may be due to the formation of iron hydr oxide particles through self decomposition of fe vi which was rejected by the membrane and continuously deposit on the membrane surface resulting in serious membrane fouling 3 4 4 characterization of fouled membranes the ftir spectra of the fouled uf membranes were analyzed to identify the functional groups of organic pollutants retained on the membrane surface as shown in fig 5 compared to the virgin pes uf membrane several characteristic peaks were observed at around 3297 2924 1653 and 1546 cm 1 on the membrane surface after the filtration of secondary effluent to be specific the broad absorbance band centered at 3297 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of o h and n h indicating that some hydrophilic compounds led to membrane fouling li et al 2020 the weak absorbance near 2924 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of c h corresponding to the characteristics of polysaccharides zhou et al 2014 furthermore the peak related to c o amide i and n h amide ii stretching vibration were noticed at 1653 cm 1 and 1546 cm 1 respectively revealing the deposition of protein like substances on the membrane surface li et al 2020 compared to the raw water all the characteristic peaks showed a significant decrease when the water samples were pretreated by fe vi while fe iii and pacl pretreatments had negligible effect on them the ftir results indicated that fe vi pretreatment could effectively remove protein like and polysaccharide like substances which were prone to reversibly and irreversibly deposited on in the membrane the sem images of virgin membrane and fouled membranes under different pretreatments were presented in fig 6 where the fouled membranes were hydraulically backwashed by pure water before analyzing in order to eliminate the reversible foulants that existed on membrane surface the surface porosity of the virgin and fouled membranes was also calculated based on sem images with the help of image pro plus as shown in fig 6 b even after hydraulic backwash the surface of membrane fouled by secondary effluent was still covered with part of irreversible foulants with the membrane surface porosity of 13 24 compared to that of 30 52 in the virgin membrane however after the secondary effluent pretreated by fe vi 9 fe iii and pacl the membrane surface become more porous and the pore size become larger and the membrane surface porosity increased to 17 28 19 64 and 22 90 respectively the increase of membrane surface porosity indicated that irreversible foulants attached to membrane surface were effectively removed and pacl pretreatment showed the best performance among which which was also consistent with the results of membrane irreversible fouling resistance shown in fig 4 b 4 conclusions in this study fe vi pretreatment was subsequently combined with uf process to achieve 3 26 5 01 logs removal of args in treating real secondary effluent which was attributed to the efficient removal of cell free args by fe vi pretreatment and the co interception of cell associated args and iron hydr oxide particles by uf cell free args was preferentially removed compared to cell associated ones because the poor coagulation performance induced by iron hydr oxide particles formed from fe vi as well as the protection of cell structure and the competitive consumption of fe vi in the secondary effluent the viability and relative abundances of the potential args hosts were effectively decreased after fe vi pretreatment lowered the risk of args spread in aquatic environment the combined fe vi uf process significantly remove humic like fluorescent organic matters and reduce phytotoxicity while had limited capability in efom mineralization fe vi pretreatment could also mitigate the membrane fouling by decreasing protein like and polysaccharide like substances reducing affinity between foulants and membrane thus transformed initial membrane fouling mechanism these findings suggest that fe vi uf is a

16021,antibiotic resistance genes args are considered as emerging environmental contaminants which should be controlled by wastewater treatment plants to prevent their discharge into the environment however conventional treatment techniques generally fail to successfully reduce args and the release of cell free args was underestimated in this study potassium ferrate fe vi pretreatment combined with ultrafiltration uf process was developed to remove both cell associated and cell free args in real secondary effluent compared to ferric chloride fe iii and poly aluminum chloride pacl pretreatment processes it was found that total args especially cell free args were effectively removed by fe vi oxidation however due to the poor settleability of the negatively charged particles formed by fe vi in the secondary effluent the removal of cell associated args was less compared to fe iii and pacl pretreatments the combination of fe vi and uf removed the most args 3 26 5 01 logs due to the efficient removal of cell free args by fe vi 2 15 logs and co interception of both cell associated args and fe vi formed particles of the uf high throughput sequencing revealed that fe vi decreased the viability and relative abundances of the potential args hosts fe vi uf exhibited the best performance on humic like fluorescent organic matters removal as well as the least phytotoxicity in the effluent moreover membrane fouling was remarkably alleviated by fe vi pretreatment because 1 fe vi removed macromolecules such as protein like and polysaccharide like substances which would block the membrane pores 2 fe vi improved the hydrophilicity of foulants and reduced the hydrophobic adsorption between foulants and membrane in short fe vi uf is a promising technology to efficiently remove args especially cell free args and alleviate uf membrane fouling in wastewater reclamation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes args potassium ferrate coagulation ultrafiltration wastewater reclamation 1 introduction the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in public health and animal husbandry led to their continuous discharge into the environment which will not only cause environmental chemical pollution but also induce the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args yu et al 2021 among them args can pose serious risks to both human health and environmental ecosystem because they typically locate in mobile genetic elements and can widely spread in microorganisms through horizontal gene transfer hgt li et al 2017 wastewater treatment plants wwtps as reservoirs of args receive antibiotics discharges from hospitals residents and agriculture which are considered as an important barrier to prevent the release of args into the urban environment however conventional wwtps are not designed to remove args and relative abundance of args in wwtps effluent can be 105 108 copies l ni et al 2020 therefore post treatment methods should be considered after the conventional biological treatment process to avoid excessive args discharge into receiving water recently args removal has been investigated in a series of advanced treatment processes such as chlorination ozonation ultraviolet irradiation and advanced oxidation processes based on sulfate radical or hydroxyl radical lamba and ahammad 2017 iakovides et al 2019 duan et al 2020 liu et al 2022 however the high energy and reagent costs as well as the formation of potential carcinogenic by products may limit their application dong et al 2017 by contrast coagulation is a physicochemical process to improve the settleable ability of suspended particles by adding coagulating reagents such as ferric based and aluminum based coagulants which is considered as an effective and economical method to remove args in wastewater li et al 2017 yu et al 2021 however in practical application the effect of coagulation for args removal may be reduced due to the incomplete separation and resuspension of solid precipitates caused by water interference li et al 2019 this problem can be solved by the subsequent use of ultrafiltration uf technology which can effectively reject the suspended solids after coagulation moreover uf also has the inherent advantage of removing colloids and microorganisms and the membrane fouling caused by effluent organic matter efom can also be alleviated if coagulation is used as the pretreatment process chen et al 2021 however it should be noted that args cannot be degraded by coagulation which were just transferred from wastewater to coagulation sludge and the sludge with concentrated args may still pose serious risks to the environment if they are handled improperly potassium ferrate fe vi is another promising technique in wastewater treatment as it has dual functions of oxidation and subsequent coagulation as well as green chemical properties liu et al 2018 fe vi has high redox potential at acidic ph 2 2 v and basic ph 0 7 v which has been successfully applied to the inactivation of various microorganisms and the removal of heavy metals phosphate pollutants and micropollutants lee and von gunten 2010 chen et al 2021 meanwhile fe vi can effectively reduce the cytotoxicity and dna dsbs effects in mammalian cells wu et al 2021a however there are few studies on the removal of args by fe vi and sometimes the results may be controversial suyamud et al 2021 studied the effect of fe vi on the removal of bla tem and orta in aquaculture water and found no significant difference before and after treatments similarly zhang et al 2021 considered that fe vi could not remove intracellular tetracycline resistance genes due to the multi protection of cell structure and rapid decay of fe vi in the phosphate solution system conversely ni et al 2020 observed the efficient removal of intracellular args in the secondary effluent due to the combined effect of fe vi induced microbial dna damage and coagulation initiated by fe vi reduction products further studies are necessary to fill in the gaps of knowledge in relation to the effect of fe vi on the removal of args besides it is of concern that previous studies mainly focused on args that could be intercepted by 0 22 μm filters named cell associated args including intercellular args and cell particle adsorbed extracellular args while args that could pass through 0 22 μm filters named cell free args were always neglected li et al 2017 ni et al 2020 suyamud et al 2021 zhang et al 2018a detected the presence of args in free extracellular dna in wwtp effluent revealing a previously overlooked source of args although the abundances of extracellular args are much lower than that of intracellular args they can proliferate among bacteria through hgt pathway based on extracellular dna transformation thus showing persistence in the discharged effluent zhang et al 2013 2018a however up to now the effect of fe vi on cell free args removal from wastewater systems has not been evaluated neither has coagulation process such as ferric chloride fe iii and poly aluminum chloride pacl coagulation besides since membrane fouling limits its long term use it is necessary to further clarify the physicochemical interactions between pretreated foulants and membrane surface on molecular level so as to reveal the mechanisms of membrane fouling mitigation by different pretreatment processes therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to compare cell associated args and cell free args removal efficiency of fe vi uf process with conventional fe iii uf and pacl uf processes 2 to assess the performance of the integrated process on efom removal and phytotoxicity reduction 3 to interpret membrane fouling alleviation mechanism by different pretreatment processes through combined pore blockage cake filtration model and extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory this study is expected to provide a promising wastewater treatment technology for removing args and mitigating membrane fouling in wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 secondary effluent and agents the secondary effluent was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of a municipal wwtp in harbin china the collected wastewater samples were pre filtered through a filter paper pore size of 20 30 μm to remove large particulate matters before the experiment and the previous study has shown that the filter paper can retain neither bacteria nor dna zhang et al 2019 the main characteristics of the secondary effluent were turbidity 0 89 0 11 ntu uv254 0 106 0 008 cm 1 dissolved organic carbon doc 6 10 0 76 mg l tp 0 503 mg l ph 7 87 tn 9 97 mg l nh4 n 0 30 mg l no3 7 32 mg l no2 0 75 mg l and cl

maximum absorbance at 510 nm the coagulants ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o fe iii 99 and poly aluminum chloride al2 oh ncl6 n xh2o m pacl al2o3 28 were purchased from tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china 2 2 pretreatments and membrane filtration tests the fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatment experiments were carried out in a series of 1 l beakers on a programmable jar test apparatus zr4 6 china the fe vi with designed concentrations 1 5 3 6 9 and 12 mg fe6 l was added to the wastewater samples and followed by rapid agitation at 300 rpm for 60 min and then settled for 60 min for the coagulation experiments the coagulants fe iii with a dose of 9 mg fe3 l and pacl with a dose of 9 mg al3 l were added to the solution respectively and the pretreatments procedures were comprised of rapid agitation 300 rpm 2 min and then slow agitation 40 rpm 20 min before settling for 30 min the doses of the coagulants fe iii and pacl were determined based on the preliminary jar

throughput sequencing analysis of microbial community were supplemented in text s2 2 4 interaction energy analysis and membrane fouling assessment based on the xdlvo theory the foulant foulant

water glycerol and diiodomethane were listed in table s2 moreover the resistance in series model based on darcy s law was used to evaluate membrane fouling resistance the filtration experimental data

analysis based on spearman correlations was conducted by gephi software 3 results and discussion 3 1 cell associated and cell free args removal the performance of fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatments in args removal were compared based on the decrease of absolute gene abundances in both cell associated and cell free fractions as shown in fig 1 a and b the relative abundances of cell associated args in the raw water were ranged from 104 to 108 copies l with qnrs 5 59 108 copies l and aac 6 ib cr 2 57 107 copies l being the top two genes and the mobile genetic element inti1 also presented a relatively high gene abundance 2 28 106 copies l meanwhile the detected cell free args also accounted for a large proportion of the total args in the raw water which were only approximately an order of magnitude lower than that in cell associated args some cell free args such as tetw and ermb were even higher than those of cell associated fractions therefore except for cell associated args a watchful eye should also be kept on cell free args which might be an important pollution type of args in secondary effluent a significant reduction of cell associated args was observed in the secondary effluent after the fe vi pretreatment for most target genes a higher fe vi dose could lead to a better removal efficiency and a 0 72 1 06 logs removal of cell associated args was observed under fe vi dose of 12 mg fe6 l nevertheless on the whole the removal of cell associated args at fe vi 9 was not as good as those using fe iii or pacl under the same dose for example pacl pretreatment exhibited the best performance on quinolone resistance genes 1 21 logs and sulfonamide resistance genes 1 16 logs removal while fe iii pretreatment had the best effect on macrolide resistance genes 1 38 logs and tetracycline resistance genes 0 99 logs removal however the removal efficiency of inti1 by fe vi 9 was higher than that by fe iii indicating that fe vi was more conducive to reduce hgt among microbial species than fe iii as for the cell free args the increased fe vi dose did not show obvious regularity on their removal the maximum removal of most cell free args was obtained at the dose of 9 or 12 mg fe6 l 2 15 logs reduction which was much higher compared to those achieved for the cell associated args however different from cell associated args fe iii and pacl pretreatments showed similar removal of cell free args varied between 0 77 1 98 logs and 0 90 2 10 logs respectively which were much lower than those obtained by fe vi these results indicated that fe vi pretreatment had more advantages in the removal of cell free args than fe iii and pacl pretreatments although it showed lower removal efficiencies for cell associated args different mechanisms may lead to differences in the removal efficiencies of cell associated args and cell free args in fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatments in general the specific mechanisms of fe iii and pacl coagulation pretreatments for the removal of args mainly include electric double layer compression charge neutralization electrostatic adsorption physical enmeshment and complexing action and the portions of fe and al play a vital role in determining the performance of coagulation processes yu et al 2021 as the isoelectric point of bacterial cells ph 2 3 or 4 5 and extracellular args ph 2 5 were lower than ph of secondary effluent ph 7 87 in this study table s3 they are mainly negatively charged in the raw water li et al 2017 there were approximately 78 fea and 22 feb in the fe iii solution when fe iii was added to the secondary effluent the monomeric fea species were hydrolyzed into positively charged colloidal or amorphous hydroxide precipitate fec so electric double layer compression and charge neutralization would become the main mechanisms for args removal during fe iii coagulation lei et al 2009 however the portions of alb 33 and alc 42 in pacl solution was higher than ala 25 thus the args would mainly be removed by relatively stable polymeric species alb and sol or gel species alc through adsorption charge neutralization entrapment and interparticle bridging these two species have been proved to have more advantages in removing pollutants during coagulation process zhang et al 2018b moreover al3 and fe3 could induce the aggregation of free dna through complexing with negatively charged dna phosphate groups so as to achieve the purpose of neutralizing the free dna charges and removing cell free args qin et al 2017 different from fe iii and pacl coagulation the mechanisms of args removal by fe vi pretreatment were mainly attributed to its dual functions of chemical oxidation and coagulation fe vi is a strong oxidant which has the redox potential of 2 2 v and 0 7 v under acidic and basic conditions respectively besides fe v fe iv and reactive oxygen species such as oh could also be generated from self decomposition of fe vi which had strong oxidation abilities fe vi fe v fe iii h2o2 fe vi fe iv fe ii fe ii h2o2 oh fe iii liu et al 2018 the previous report showed that fe vi could penetrate into the bacteria cells and act directly on dna inside thus damaging args or inti1 carried by the genomic dna and plasmids ni et al 2020 moreover coagulation also played a role in the removal of both cell associated args and cell free args the in situ formed iron hydr oxide particles can adsorb bacterial cells and extracellular args which were expected to be removed by subsequent settlement however the zeta potentials of particles formed by fe vi remained in the supernatant were 13 6 mv fe vi dose was 9 mg fe6 l settled for 60 min in this study which means these particles were slightly negatively charged and exhibited a relatively stable state in the aqueous solution thus the particle aggregation proceeded slowly and showed poor settleability in the secondary effluent this was also reflected by the increased turbidity 4 05 ntu of the secondary effluent treated by 9 mg fe6 l fe vi as shown in table s3 which was much higher than the raw water 0 89 ntu while the turbidity of fe iii and pacl treated secondary effluent was 0 26 ntu and 0 19 ntu respectively the poor performance of coagulation during fe vi pretreatment may interpret the fact that fe vi showed worse performance than fe iii and pacl pretreatments on cell associated args removal on the other hand some components in the secondary effluent including humic acid inorganic ions and inorganic nitrogen compounds such as ammonia and nitrite would compete with args to react with fe vi lee and von gunten 2010 feng et al 2016 these substances may consume fe vi and resulted in a low removal of cell associated args by contrast fe vi pretreatment had more advantages in removing cell free args probably because cell free args lacked protection from microbial cells and thus were more easily to be oxidized by fe vi in addition it should be noted that extracellular args may be released from the dead microbial cells after being oxidized by fe vi however no increase in the absolute abundances of cell free args was observed in this research suggesting that the released args might be further oxidized by fe vi or adsorbed on iron hydr oxide particles formed from fe vi ni et al 2020 finally the filtration of uf membrane could further remove the residual args as shown in fig 1 c fe vi 9 uf fe iii uf and pacl uf processes exhibited excellent performance on args removal with the removal efficiency of 2 68 5 13 logs compared to the raw water higher than that direct uf process 2 30 3 90 logs to be specific fe vi 9 uf had the best performance in args removal 3 26 5 01 logs and the absolute abundances of all the tested genes were below 2 07 103 copies l therefore the combination of fe vi and subsequent uf was necessary for both cell associated and cell free args removal moreover negatively charged pes membrane surface could also repel negatively charged cell free args slipko et al 2019 as well as the adsorption of cell free args by fe al precipitates or natural colloidal material rejected on the membrane surface li et al 2019 may contribute to args removal 3 2 variation of microbial community and its relationship with args alpha diversity was used to analyze the changes of bacterial community diversity in the secondary effluent before and after fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatments and the results are listed in table s4 the good s coverage values for all the samples were above 0 99 indicating that the results of microbial sequencing could meet the analysis requirements compared to the raw water the observed species and chao1 were all decreased after the pretreatments of fe vi fe iii and pacl suggesting the reduction of microbial species richness in addition after the secondary effluent pretreated by fe vi 9 fe iii and pacl the shannon index decreased from 4 67 to 2 40 4 09 and 3 62 and the simpson index decreased from 0 814 to 0 483 0 794 and 0 783 respectively the reduction of shannon and simpson indexes both suggested the decline of the bacterial diversity of the samples especially for those pretreated by fe vi the relative abundance of bacteria at phylum level in all the water samples are shown in fig 2 a proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in the secondary effluent followed by firmicutes and bacteroidota with the increase of fe vi dose the relative abundances of proteobacteria and firmicutes significantly decreased indicating that they might be more vulnerable to fe vi pretreatment however both fe iii and pacl pretreatments had little effect on the relative abundance of bacteria at phylum level as shown in fig 2 b all the samples were further analyzed with hierarchically clustered heatmap at genus level the results indicated that the microbial community structure in the raw water was similar to that of the samples after fe iii and pacl pretreatments while was significantly different from those pretreated by various doses of fe vi the dissimilar effects of bacterial community between fe vi and coagulation pretreatments were mainly attributed to the oxidation capacity of fe vi previous study has found that the reaction of oxidants with amine moieties might play an important role in cell membrane damage ramseier et al 2011 this is because amines appear in the peptidoglycans which are the components of cell wall and periplasm in gram positive and gram negative bacteria respectively moreover amine moieties also present in some phospholipids forming the cytoplasmic membrane and some amino acids of proteins that are embedded in the cell membrane ramseier et al 2011 fe vi showed reactivity to primary and secondary amines lee and von gunten 2010 so it could possibly penetrate cell membrane and oxidize protoplasm dna and other microbial organs thus causing the inactivation of bacteria zhang et al 2021 different reactivity of fe vi towards the molecules of microbial cells may affect the structure of microbial community in this study fe vi pretreatment significantly declined the relative abundances of novosphingobium sphingobium brevundimonas zoogloea acidovorax methylobacterium methylorubrum aquabacterium hydrogenophaga and acinetobacter which all belong to phylum proteobacteria wu et al 2021b reported that sphingobium had high extracellular polymeric substances productivity and were always found in the foulants on reverse osmosis membranes therefore a decrease in the relative abundance of sphingobium under the pretreatment of fe vi may be beneficial to alleviate long term membrane fouling the correlations among cell associated args inti1 and the top 30 genera were determined based on spearman analysis the results showed that there were 5 genera significantly positively p 0 01 8 genera positively p 0 05 and 1 genus negatively p 0 05 associated with args and inti1 which were marked with different colors of rectangle frame in the heatmap in fig 2 b the positive correlations among args inti1 and genera were further visualized by using network analysis fig 2 c cell associated args including aac 6 ib cr and sulii showed positive correlations to the potential host bacterial aeromonas vagococcus acetobacteroides brochothrix pseudarcobacter chryseobacterium novosphingobium and lactococcus besides args including ermf qnrs suli and tetm also expressed significant association with the above mentioned genera as well as desulfovibrio and desulfomicrobium brevundimonas sphingobium and novosphingobium had a strong relationship with both ermb and teto and these two args showed the maximum removal efficiency among all the tested args under fe vi and pacl pretreatments probably were due to the high reduction of brevundimonas 89 1 in all the pretreatments moreover it was observed that bacteria including aeromonas chryseobacterium acetobacteroides vagococcus and acinetobacter were potential hosts of inti1 and the first four genera also had an affinity relationship with most of the tested args illustrating that they might have multiple antibiotic resistance and have stronger hgt potential therefore it could be concluded that fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatments were beneficial to reduce the viability of potential host of args thus preventing the widespread of args in the aquatic environment 3 3 improvement of the effluent quality as shown in fig 3 a and b the variations of doc and uv254 during fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatment and subsequent uf processes were examined to characterize the total dissolved organic matter and the organic matter mainly humic substances containing unsaturated bonds or aromatic chromophores respectively as fe vi dose increased from 0 to 12 mg fe6 l the average doc concentrations gradually dropped from 6 10 to 5 38 mg l and the average uv254 sharply decreased from 0 106 to 0 068 cm 1 corresponding to the maximum removal efficiencies of 11 8 and 35 8 respectively these findings suggest that fe vi preferentially to attack compounds that could be characterized by uv254 but had limited capability in efom mineralization in addition it was observed that fe vi exhibited better performance in uv254 removal when compared to the same dose of fe iii and pacl while the removal efficiencies of doc by fe vi were lower than the other two this is because fe vi selectively oxide electron rich organic moieties in efom such as aniline phenol amine and alkene lee and von gunten 2010 since the efom containing aromatic structures or unsaturated bonds are particularly to be absorbed by uv light the oxidation of these efom by fe vi would result in a significant reduction in uv254 however some efom also have electron withdrawing moieties or have no active aromatic groups which could resist the attack from fe vi moreover fe vi had self decomposition behavior in water 2 feo 4 2 5 h 2 o 2 fe oh 3 4 o h 1 5 o 2 the consumption of fe vi may reduce the effective fe vi oxidant exposure for the removal of efom thus showing a relatively poorer doc removal compared to fe iii and pacl pretreatment nevertheless the filtration of uf membranes further facilitated the removal efficiencies of organics due to its retention and adsorption and the removal performance of doc and uv254 showed a regularity of pacl 29 5 fe vi 9 26 4 fe iii 24 9 and fe vi 9 39 6 pacl 27 4 fe iii 19 8 respectively the fluorescence three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem was employed to further characterize the changes of fluorescence organic matters in the secondary effluent after the pretreatment of fe vi fe iii and pacl and the subsequent uf process with the help of parallel factor analysis parafac and openfluor database table s5 three components were identified as c1 ex em 270 375 474 terrestrial humic like c2 ex em 250 345 418 wastewater nutrient enrichment tracer and c3 290 390 humic materials from microbial origin the contour plots and wavelength loadings of the three identified components are illustrated in fig s4 and the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of each component in the feed and permeate are shown in fig 3 c the fmax of c1 c2 and c3 in the raw water were 18 87 27 69 and 22 05 qsu respectively where 1 qsu corresponded to the fluorescence intensity for 1 μg l quinine in 0 05 m h2so4 at ex em of 350 450 nm with the increase of fe vi dose the fmax of component c1 c2 and c3 significantly decreased which was as low as 7 68 8 19 and 8 76 qsu at the dose of 12 mg fe6 l respectively suggesting that humic like fluorescent organic matters were very reactive to fe vi nie et al 2020 however fe iii and pacl pretreatments had a limited effect on the fluorescence components removal as the removal efficiencies for all the components were below 20 the results also indicated that uf treatment exerted a minor effect on the fluorescence organic matters and the removal efficiencies for all the components were only slightly improved after filtration in general at the same dose the average removal efficiency of the three components in the permeate followed the order of fe vi 9 60 7 pacl 19 5 fe iii 15 9 suggesting that fe vi exerted better fmax removal performance than pacl or fe iii coagulation probably due to the significant change in the fluorescent characteristic of efom induced by fe vi oxidation gi was also employed in this study to indicate the phytotoxicity of the raw water and treated water samples phytotoxicity assay was selected among various toxicity assessments in order to evaluate the toxicity of the treated wastewater before reuse for agriculture irrigation iakovides et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 d the gi value of the raw water was the lowest 71 9 indicating the strongest phytotoxicity the combined treatment processes all reduced the phytotoxicity especially for fe vi uf process and the gi value followed the order of fe vi 9 uf 83 4 pacl uf 81 2 fe iii uf 76 6 however the gi value of all the combined processes was lower than that of the direct uf process 98 6 probably because of the inhibition of gi by residual fe and al ions in the treated water after fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatments zhang and zhou 2005 wei et al 2008 3 4 membrane fouling control performance 3 4 1 flux curves and fouling reversibility analysis in order to evaluate membrane fouling caused by efom and its alleviation through the pretreatments of fe vi fe iii and pacl membrane filtration tests were carried out as shown in fig 4 a raw water without any pretreatment caused a drastic flux decline with a final normalized flux j j0 the ratio of instantaneous flux to initial pure water flux of 0 22 in contrast fe vi pretreatment significantly alleviated membrane fouling and a higher fe vi dose led to a smoother decline curve the final normalized flux increased to 0 49 0 53 0 58 0 62 and 0 67 after the 1600 ml filtration volume with fe vi doses of 1 5 3 6 9 and 12 mg fe6 l respectively this trend was consistent with the results of tang et al 2022 in which the membrane fouling caused by the shale gas wastewater decreased with the increase of fe vi dose however liu et al 2018 observed a more serious membrane fouling tendency when fe vi dose increased from 8 4 to 11 2 mg fe6 l during the filtration of reclaimed water the disparity of membrane fouling trend may be due to the fact that in their experiment fe vi treated water was directly filtered without settling resulting in more iron hydr oxide particles accumulated on the membrane surface and caused membrane fouling furthermore the flux decline was also significantly alleviated when fe iii and pacl pretreatments were applied and the final normalized flux were 0 56 and 0 75 respectively the above results indicated that pacl pretreatment exhibited the best performance on membrane fouling alleviation followed by fe vi and fe iii at the same dose fig 4 b showed the reversibility of pes membrane fouling during filtration the reversible and irreversible fouling resistance caused by the raw water was 2 92 1012 and 1 46 1011 m 1 respectively indicating that reversible fouling played a dominant role in pes uf membrane fouling caused by efom when fe vi pretreatment was applied the reversible fouling resistance was sharply decreased with the increase of fe vi dose with the maximum reduction of 89 0 at fe vi dose of 12 mg fe6 l this result suggests that fe vi could well remove high molecular weight mw organics which were the main source of the membrane reversible fouling however the variation of irreversible fouling resistance was not obvious at different fe vi doses likely due to the formation of some low mw substances during oxidation which had a higher potential to block membrane pores by contrast both reversible and irreversible fouling resistance were decreased by fe iii and pacl pretreatments and the reduction degree of reversible fouling resistance was greater than that of irreversible overall under the same dose the reduction degree of total fouling resistance by different pretreatments was pacl 89 6 fe vi 9 81 3 fe iii 74 7 3 4 2 modeling of membrane filtration process in order to better understand the membrane fouling mitigation mechanism the combined pore blockage cake filtration model was utilized to fit the normalized flux versus filtration time data for the uf process with fe vi fe iii and pacl pretreatments the results depicted in fig s5 showed that all the data fitted well with this model r2 0 99 indicating that the co existence of pore blockage and cake filtration in the efom filtration process regardless of the presence of pretreatments the original data and fitting data were further replotted as d2t dv2 versus dt dv curves to determine the transition of dominant membrane fouling mechanism during filtration and the results are shown in fig 4 c it is observed that the raw water had the maximum values of both d2t dv2 and dt dv compared to the pretreated water samples which was due to the lower initial flux yielded by the fast flux decline caused by efom pretreatments with fe vi fe iii and pacl noticeably reduced the values of both d2t dv2 and dt dv in the characteristic curves and the values gradually decreased with the increase of fe vi dose indicating the alteration of the fouling degree in addition all the curves in fig 4 c exhibit an upward trend in the initial stage which indicated the dominance of pore blockage mechanisms in the early flux decline then each characteristic curve presented a negative slope after reaching the maximum which could be interpreted as the transition of filtration mechanism from pore blockage to cake filtration the plots of fouling behavior index n versus filtration volume in fig 4 d further explained the transition of membrane fouling mechanism in the filtration process the curves of the raw water exhibited an initial n value of 1 74 which indicated that standard or complete pore blocking played the dominant mechanism in the early efom filtration step by contrast the initial n value decreased to around 1 after the pretreatment of fe vi fe iii and pacl showing that the initial fouling mechanisms were changed to intermediate pore blocking in addition it was observed that the pretreated water samples required less filtration volume during the pore blockage stage and they were more likely to enter the transition state from pore blockage to cake filtration which also explained the reduction of irreversible fouling 3 4 3 interaction energy analysis the surface tension parameters interfacial free energy of cohesion δ g f f and interfacial free energy of adhesion δ g f m were measured and listed in table 1 where δ g f f represents the affinity between two similar solid surfaces and δ g f m here represents the affinity potential between membrane and treated or untreated efom samples wang et al 2017 the virgin pes membrane exhibited a relatively high electron donor component value γ s compared to that electron acceptor component γ s indicating a high electron donor monopolarity with apolar characteristics besides the value of δ g f f was negative for the virgin pes membrane 19 92 mj m2 suggesting a hydrophobic nature on membrane surface compared to the raw water the values of γ s were gradually evaluated with the increased dose of fe vi which indicated the improvement of hydrophilicity of efom wang et al 2017 furthermore the values of δ g f f showed an upward trend from 49 87 mj m2 in raw water to 12 25 mj m2 in fe vi 12 pretreated water along with the increasing fe vi dose it is generally believed that a negative value of δ g f f indicates thermodynamic instability and hydrophobicity that is foulants tend to attract each other while a positive δ g f f value represents thermodynamic stability and hydrophilicity thus foulants repel each other the increase in δ g f f value from negative to positive indicated that efom was transformed from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity by fe vi when its dose exceed 9 mg fe6 l which was expected to reduce the hydrophobic adsorption between foulants and membrane by contrast although fe iii and pacl pretreatments weakened the hydrophobicity of efom the pretreated efom still had thermodynamic instability and hydrophobic nature as shown by the less negative values of the two pretreatments versus untreated efom the analysis of δ g f m between foulants and membrane could further provide a basis for explaining the mechanism of membrane fouling alleviation all the measured water samples exhibited the negative values of δ g f m meaning the attractive interaction existed between foulants and pes membrane the lowest value of δ g f m was obtained for the membrane fouled by untreated secondary effluent 35 84 mj m2 indicating that raw water had the strongest attraction to the membrane the affinity between foulants and membrane gradually weakened with the increased dose of fe vi which was shown by the increasing trend of δ g f m however when the secondary effluent was pretreated by the same dose of fe vi fe iii and pacl the value of δ g f m followed the order of fe vi 9 2 50 mj m2 pacl 20 63 mj m2 fe iii 22 46 mj m2 that is fe vi 9 had the least attractive interaction with membrane compared to fe iii and pacl this was not consistent with the regularity of membrane flux decline where fe vi 9 gave a lower final normalized flux and higher fouling resistance when compared to pacl the contradictions between experimental filtration results and thermodynamic calculations indicate that in addition to the interfacial energy other mechanisms such as size exclusion may also have a critical influence on the filtration performance in practice as shown in table s3 the values of turbidity and medium particle diameter dx 50 were much higher than those of raw water when fe vi dose exceeds 6 mg fe6 l the significant increase of suspended solids and particle size may be due to the formation of iron hydr oxide particles through self decomposition of fe vi which was rejected by the membrane and continuously deposit on the membrane surface resulting in serious membrane fouling 3 4 4 characterization of fouled membranes the ftir spectra of the fouled uf membranes were analyzed to identify the functional groups of organic pollutants retained on the membrane surface as shown in fig 5 compared to the virgin pes uf membrane several characteristic peaks were observed at around 3297 2924 1653 and 1546 cm 1 on the membrane surface after the filtration of secondary effluent to be specific the broad absorbance band centered at 3297 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of o h and n h indicating that some hydrophilic compounds led to membrane fouling li et al 2020 the weak absorbance near 2924 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of c h corresponding to the characteristics of polysaccharides zhou et al 2014 furthermore the peak related to c o amide i and n h amide ii stretching vibration were noticed at 1653 cm 1 and 1546 cm 1 respectively revealing the deposition of protein like substances on the membrane surface li et al 2020 compared to the raw water all the characteristic peaks showed a significant decrease when the water samples were pretreated by fe vi while fe iii and pacl pretreatments had negligible effect on them the ftir results indicated that fe vi pretreatment could effectively remove protein like and polysaccharide like substances which were prone to reversibly and irreversibly deposited on in the membrane the sem images of virgin membrane and fouled membranes under different pretreatments were presented in fig 6 where the fouled membranes were hydraulically backwashed by pure water before analyzing in order to eliminate the reversible foulants that existed on membrane surface the surface porosity of the virgin and fouled membranes was also calculated based on sem images with the help of image pro plus as shown in fig 6 b even after hydraulic backwash the surface of membrane fouled by secondary effluent was still covered with part of irreversible foulants with the membrane surface porosity of 13 24 compared to that of 30 52 in the virgin membrane however after the secondary effluent pretreated by fe vi 9 fe iii and pacl the membrane surface become more porous and the pore size become larger and the membrane surface porosity increased to 17 28 19 64 and 22 90 respectively the increase of membrane surface porosity indicated that irreversible foulants attached to membrane surface were effectively removed and pacl pretreatment showed the best performance among which which was also consistent with the results of membrane irreversible fouling resistance shown in fig 4 b 4 conclusions in this study fe vi pretreatment was subsequently combined with uf process to achieve 3 26 5 01 logs removal of args in treating real secondary effluent which was attributed to the efficient removal of cell free args by fe vi pretreatment and the co interception of cell associated args and iron hydr oxide particles by uf cell free args was preferentially removed compared to cell associated ones because the poor coagulation performance induced by iron hydr oxide particles formed from fe vi as well as the protection of cell structure and the competitive consumption of fe vi in the secondary effluent the viability and relative abundances of the potential args hosts were effectively decreased after fe vi pretreatment lowered the risk of args spread in aquatic environment the combined fe vi uf process significantly remove humic like fluorescent organic matters and reduce phytotoxicity while had limited capability in efom mineralization fe vi pretreatment could also mitigate the membrane fouling by decreasing protein like and polysaccharide like substances reducing affinity between foulants and membrane thus transformed initial membrane fouling mechanism these findings suggest that fe vi uf is a

16022,co transport of colloidal substances and pollutants is a pivotal link that significantly affects the environment of coastal groundwater the effect of colloid mobilization and aquifer pore

intrusion swi and freshwater replenishment fwr processes using a sampled medium from a coastal sandy aquifer hydrodynamic hydrochemical variables and heavy metal pb cu cd transport during the propagation of the seawater freshwater interface were tested and analyzed during the swi stage cation exchange induced heavy metal liberations and it developed peak concentrations synchronized with the seawater freshwater interface at the pore volume of 1 00 the colloid facilitated transport for heavy metals was the predominant mechanism in the fwr stage characterized by a peak release lagging the interface propagation by approximately 0 5 pore volumes because the colloidal fraction was mobilized during aquifer desalination it lagged behind the decline of the salinity gradient furthermore derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo calculations explained that the replenishment decreased the depth of the secondary energy minimum of the colloids meanwhile the thickness of the electrical double layer increased from 0 63 nm to 10 14 nm resulting in a repulsive energy barrier up to 3 213 kt the transport of colloids led to a reduction in porosity from 18 16 to 2 28 of the total immobile domain at these times the dimension of the transported colloids evolved showing a size selective transport and therefore regulating the total emission fluxes of the heavy metals these mechanisms were

days wang et al 2019 the fluxes of large amounts of nutrients e g nitrate phosphate into the sea are close to the estuarine input whereas the discharge fluxes of fe mn zn cr cd could be even higher than the riverine input wang et al 2019 2021 xiao et al 2019 moreover the total amount of heavy metals associated with colloids is much higher than the dissolved fractions in the liquid phase li et al 2018 liu et al 2001 such interactive processes develop a saline wedge accompanied by significant substance exchange at the interface thus providing the dynamics for mass transport from terrestrial sources to the ocean through groundwater kuan et al 2019 mobile colloidal particles provide a privileged transit pathway for the adsorbed heavy metals due to their relatively large surface area and surface activity zhu et al 2014 groundwater flow rate and colloidal adsorption properties for heavy metals play an essential role in whether the transport is facilitated or inhibited won et al 2019 in particular some elements with greater affinity e g pb cu exhibit transport dependent behavior vodyanitskii and minkina 2021 and their binding ratio to colloids could reach 24 soderberg et al 2019 furthermore the number of colloidal particles in coastal groundwater could account for up to 4 1011 per liter rani and sasidhar 2011 rendering their remarkable contribution in the co transport with heavy metals known to exceed 40 of the total flux in certain regions johannesson et al 2017 as the colloidal particle dimension 10 nm to 10 μm kinetics are dominated by the electrical interaction energy hydraulic drag force and gravity ikni et al 2013 sen and khilar 2006 translocation of colloids between the aqueous and solid phases is significant for coastal groundwater interaction due to the ionic strength and ph fluctuation furukawa et al 2014 grolimund and borkovec 2005 kim and kim 2015 regarding the hydrochemistry the isoelectric point of the colloid is perceived as the critical factor in determining whether the colloids are favorable for transport because the colloidal surface status shows different adhesion patterns in the vicinity of the isoelectric point which is highly dependent on the aqueous ph and ionic strength chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 won and burns 2018 experiments showed that high ionic strength retards the transport of cd2 in the dissolved state because of competitive adsorption and complexation and conversely low ionic strength favors the transport allowing cd2 to remain mobilized in the colloid bound state wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 researchers have long been devoted to characterizing the interaction processes in response to the complexities they have proposed the classical boussinesq equation the advection diffusion equation etc derived numerical models were constructed to provide theoretical bases and research tools for solving the problems of tidal fluctuation and variable density flow in coastal groundwater cartwright et al 2004 chang et al 2021 li et al 2000 nielsen 1990 xiong et al 2020 related studies revealed the mechanism of solute transport and water chemistry by simulating the swi under a one dimensional transmissive scenario boluda botella et al 2008 and the mechanism for salt ph and flow rate affecting the transport of heavy metals by colloidal particles chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 won et al 2019 meanwhile modeling experiments for two dimensional saline and freshwater interaction were conducted to reveal the saltwater up coning effect during coastal groundwater extraction werner et al 2009 tidal induced groundwater circulation recharge mechanism kuan et al 2012 the effect of saltwater wedge pattern in the coastal stratified geological system lu et al 2013 and the effect of sea level rise on contaminant transport in coastal aquifers guo et al 2020 however evidence suggests that the mixing displacement process of the seawater and freshwater induces discrepancies in characterizations and predictions of heavy metal transport microscopic effects of colloidal facilitation in the coastal aquifer can outweigh the direct elution with groundwater discharge as a suspension of colloids migrates undergoes ripening straining hetero aggregation and collision during migration some fractions are retained wang et al 2015a this process is commonly referred to as colloidal filtration it is characterized by the fact that the retained colloids increase the frictional resistance to the aqueous phase thereby reducing the regional permeability of the aquifer chen et al 2010 conversely our previous study suggested that colloid transport contributed to pore connectivity tan et al 2017 this discrepancy was due to variable colloidal state thus affecting the behavior the mobility of colloidal particles is functionally related to the size of medium pores the higher the sand content and the larger the pores the lower the probability of colloidal particles being filtered during transport löv et al 2018 wang et al 2016 accurate prediction of colloid trajectories and pathways under specific environmental conditions requires the incorporation of adequate geometries for particle and pores into consideration li et al 2012 on this basis coupled with the selective binding of heavy metals to colloids the complexity of the process of colloid associated heavy metal transport is further increased differences in colloidal particle size affect the enrichment of heavy metals for instance zn and cd are mainly enriched in the soluble phase 3 kda at the same time cu and pb tend to be enriched in slightly coarser colloidal particles 30 kda 0 22 μm and are generally higher in finer colloidal particles gradually transferring to fine particles and soluble phase during the transport wen et al 2019 nevertheless the above phenomena remain elusive in detailed experimental observations and model interpretations at this stage our proposal is to establish an understanding of the effect of colloid mobilization and aquifer pore structure change on heavy metal transport driven by seawater freshwater interface dynamics through laboratory experiments thus the present study aimed to investigate 1 the mobilization and transport patterns of colloids associated with heavy metals during the swi and fwr processes and 2 the effect of size selective transport and retention of the colloids driven by seawater freshwater interface dynamics at column scale 2 material and methods 2 1 porous medium treatment and experimental set up this study involved packed column experiments using the porous medium sampled from a shallow sandy aquifer beneath the beach near a landfill at the yangtze river estuary 31 39 31 62 n 121 42 8 23 e the sampling site was shown in figure s1 in the supplementary material the sampled medium was pretreated before column experiments according to the procedure described in our previous research with minor revision tan et al 2017 the sample was dried at 80 c for 48 h while stirring evenly using an overhead electric mixer ika rw47 to ensure homogeneity the mixture of the medium and heavy metal reagents pb cd and cu nitrates was prepared to mimic the porous medium polluted by heavy metals originating from landfill leachate the treated medium was aged for 30 days as suggested by loganathan et al 2012 then homogenized and air dried resulting in a final concentration of 0 1 mg g of each element fig 1 a showed that the experimental set up was designed for simulating the seawater and freshwater mixing displacement process the plexiglass column had a length of 16 7 cm and an inner diameter of 5 0 cm the inner surface was dull polished to avoid preferential flow the trumpet shaped lids were installed with radial pipes and porous stones to ensure that the injected water could be distributed evenly to the column section pre tests demonstrated that the column configuration could effectively eliminate the pulsation caused by the peristaltic pump and the preferential flow neither the column inner surface nor the porous stones retained the transported heavy metal ions and colloids the transport data was accurate and repeatable the inlet and outlet of the column were alternately connected with a freshwater tank a seawater tank and an automatic fraction collector which enabled the apparatus to switch the injected solution and its flow direction the exhaust valves were used to drain air bubbles from the pipe electrode probes mounted on the pipe were used to record the ph and conductivity of the outlet solution the apparatus set up was shown in figure s2 a in the supplementary material a wet packing method was employed as described in our previous research tan et al 2017 the column was prefilled with prepared freshwater to a thickness of 2 cm first then the dried medium and the freshwater were added into the column alternately each shift added the medium by a thickness of 0 5 cm to minimize the influence of grain size sorting and subsequent layering the packing procedure was performed under vibration to eliminate bubbles and ensure replicable packing conditions the packed column was saturated for 24 h to reach the adsorption desorption equilibrium of heavy metals with the medium before the subsequent experiments 2 2 seawater and freshwater mixing displacement configuration column experiments were conducted to model the mixing displacement process in coastal aquifers the darcy velocity was set to 8 18 cm h to mimic the rate of coastal groundwater interaction boluda botella et al 2008 correspondingly the fluid injection rate was 2 676 ml min according to the column size all infiltration processes were performed in steady state flow conditions thus the fluid volume was converted to pore volume pv to measure the transport process with respect to the medium porosity and the injection flow rate the packed column was used for the tracer test 1 conducted by injection of 1 mm sodium nitrate solution under saturated conditions a breakthrough curve was obtained to determine the transport parameters for the column next the column was used for transport experiments which were conducted to simulate the cycle of swi and fwr via a mixing displacement procedure in the swi phase the column was salinized by injecting 2 00 pvs of seawater heavy metal elution was rendered accompanied by aquifer salinization at this stage in the fwr phase the column was desalinized by injecting 4 00 pvs of freshwater and colloid associated heavy metals were eluted during these two stages salinized water was prepared in the laboratory to represent the seawater as suggested by lee and kim 2015 and tan et al 2017 the ph of seawater was adjusted to 8 26 via titration using a sodium hydroxide solution and the salinity was adjusted to 2 8 high ionic strength of 487 72 mm using sodium chloride while for freshwater the ph was adjusted to 5 50 via titration with a hydrochloric acid solution and the salinity was set to a low value low ionic strength of 2 02 mm based on our previous field study liu et al 2015 the detailed sequence of injecting solutions used in the experiments was shown in table s1 in the supplementary material after the two phase fluid has finished a replacement cycle the pore structure of the aquifer was altered by colloids migration tracer test 2 was therefore conducted after the fwr stage to examine the hydrodynamic and physical parameter change in addition an experiment of heavy metal elution by freshwater was also conducted which was elaborated in the supplementary material 2 3 visualization of aquifer pore structure change induced by colloids mobilization as shown in fig 1 b depending on the lengthwise size of the column a slice like apparatus 167 50 3 mm was used to demonstrate the mixing displacement process of two phase water through a porous medium the apparatus set up was shown in figure s2 b in the supplementary material the injection sequences were consistent with the column experiments identical darcy velocity driven by the seawater freshwater interaction the suspended colloids in interconnected pores were first eluted then the pore structure changes as the colloidal translocation and this phenomenon was observed by micro ct scanning vivact 80 scanco medical ag switzerland a scanning coverage area of 80 80 cm2 in the mid section of the apparatus was selected for image reconstruction to visualize the pore structure changes after colloidal migration 2 4 laboratory analyses for column medium and elution samples the grain size of the packed medium and eluted colloids was measured using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern panalytical uk the porosity of the packed medium was ε 0 44 cm3 cm3 and the bulk density was ρb 1 73 g cm3 the grain size distribution shown in figure s3 in the supplementary material indicated that the medium had a uniformity coefficient of cu 1 93 and a curvature coefficient of cc 0 93 the composition of the medium was mainly silica scanning electron microscopy images by phenom prox desktop sem thermo fisher scientific inc usa showed that the surface of this medium was mostly flat and smooth with sphere like colloids in contact with the surfaces and efficiently clustered in concave areas shown in figure s4 in the supplementary material the elution samples including the colloidal suspension were digested using mixed acids 60 perchloric acid 40 hydrofluoric acid in a teflon crucible huang et al 1988 and analyzed for heavy metal concentration by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer 720es icp oes agilent technologies inc usa detailed analytical procedures were described in the previous work tan et al 2017 the zeta potential of the suspended colloids was measured using a zeta potential measurement system zetasizer nano zs 90 malvern panalytical uk milli q ultra pure water was used for solution preparation and analysis all glassware was properly washed with liquid detergent and rinsed with distilled water before use and all reagents were analytical grade 2 5 model interpretation and statistical analysis basic transport parameters were initially obtained by fitting with the experimental data from the tracer tests using the analytical solution of the convection dispersion equation as eq 1 via acuaintrusion transport model assuming that the breakthrough curves contain non reactive components boluda botella et al 2014 lapidus and amundson 1952 1 c l t c i c 0 c i 2 erfc l v t 4 d l t exp v l d l erfc l v t 4 d l t where c l t is the elution concentration of the sodium nitrate solution ci is the initial concentration of the porous solute c0 is the concentration of sodium nitrate solution of the injection l is the column length t is the time v is the interstitial water velocity in the direction of propagation equal to darcy velocity divided by porosity u ε dl is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient given the presence of transportable colloidal fractions in the coastal aquifer their clogging effect on the pore space is heterogeneous and time variable and this effect may cause discrepancies in fitting with the model when part of the water flow is restricted in inter aggregate pores and macropores they are immobile pockets that can exchange retain and store water but do not develop convective flow thus the dual porosity type flow requires incorporating the liquid phase into mobile and immobile regions therefore the dual porosity model was used to fit the breakthrough curves among which u v tm dl pe ε and dispersivity α l pe were determined in the hydrus 1d model by inverse modeling refer to supplementary material for detailed model descriptions during the seawater and freshwater mixing displacement process in coastal aquifers the transport and retention behaviors of the colloidal particles were determined by the interaction energy between the sand surface and the colloids themselves derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo calculation was performed to elucidate the relationship between the transport potential of the colloids and the groundwater chemistry alternation through observations by electron microscopy tan et al 2017 the contact surface of sand and movable colloids was reasonably hypothesized as plate while the colloidal particles were spherical the colloid to sand interaction energy can be calculated by the ideal sphere plate model in dlvo theory chen et al 2018 a detailed model description for dlvo calculation was elaborated in the supplementary material numerous interdependent factors affected the co transport of colloids and heavy metals during the swi and fwr therefore principal component analysis pca was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the possibly correlated variables while retaining most of the information fourteen variables including the concentrations of heavy metals in ionic state pb ionic cd ionic and cu ionic concentrations of heavy metals bonded with colloids pb colloid bonded cd colloid bonded and cu colloid bonded ionic strength zeta potential ph total colloid concentration and dimensions for mobilized colloids and particles 1 μm 1 100 μm 100 1000 μm and 1000 μm were considered in the present study data were analyzed using spss 23 0 software spss inc chicago il usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 heavy metal transport during seawater intrusion and freshwater replenishment heavy metal transport due to the swi was appreciably more prominent than in freshwater driven cases see figure s5 in supplementary material for freshwater elution experiment as shown in fig 2 heavy metals liberated and developed peak values of concentration in the vicinity of pv 1 00 apparently the formation of the peaks synchronized with the seawater freshwater interface and they propagated to the column outlet the observed peak concentrations of pb cu and cd in the test were 0 025 0 91 and 0 49 mg cm3 with a total collection of 2 74 45 81 and 26 10 mg during the 2 pvs these fractions accounted for 4 83 80 76 and 46 01 of the total amount of each element in the column medium respectively as shown in fig 3 it was worth noting that the concentrations of pb and cu exhibited similar peaks during the fwr stage but the peaks emerged with a lag of approximately 0 5 pvs from the interface the concentration curves of pb and cu were highly identical with a peak value of 0 12 mg cm3 a total collection of 4 31 mg and 4 08 mg during a period range of 2 pvs before and after the peak value at pv 1 56 these fractions accounted for 7 20 and 7 60 of the total amount of each element in the column medium respectively note that the cd transport was low at this stage and did not show a peak pattern the different magnitude of the heavy metal liberation was due to varied driven factors during the seawater and freshwater mixing displacement process there was undoubtedly a dissolved fraction that maintained a maximum transport potential however due to the existence of multiple binding interactions e g complexation electrostatic attraction and cation π bond between heavy metals and substrates dong et al 2014 reddad et al 2002 such strong adsorption affinity led to the enrichment of heavy metals on the soil surface qi et al 2012 while this fraction was negligible in natural aquifers as pb has various valence states in groundwater it is more readily adsorbed than cu and cd higher valence states and formations variability led to higher adsorption capacity and stability meanwhile larger ionic radius and difference in electronic configurations of pb also contributed to its high affinity to aquifer medium marques et al 2020 the present study emphasized that the heavy metal liberation was driven by seawater and freshwater mixing displacement the swi stage exhibited a peak concentration due to the liberation of pb from ion exchange sites in the aquifer medium due to exchange with sodium the substitution of cations to occupy the ion exchange sites induces concentration peaks near pv 1 gomis et al 1996 sodium chloride solution was used to mimic seawater in this study nevertheless variation in seawater composition in field conditions also interacted with this process such as potassium magnesium and sulfate and their reactions at the interface follow a similar pattern for instance the potassium was more likely to be retained in the interlayer space of aquifer colloidal particles due to its strong adsorption leading to a significant delay of propagation during the seawater intrusion process ruiz et al 1990 in uncontaminated aquifers due to the high concentrations of calcium liberated and the sulfate in the seawater gypsum precipitation was also accompanied by aquifer salinization boluda botella et al 2008 the substitution of heavy metals was linked to fluctuations in the concentration of these cations in the swi as demonstrated in this study heavy metal contaminated aquifers would liberate large amounts of ions as a process synchronized with the swi another factor contributing to the enhanced transport of heavy metals which has been overlooked was the colloid facilitated transport during the freshwater replenishment process after eluting a certain amount of heavy metals in the swi stage the remaining fractions were generally adsorbed on the colloids through stronger specific and electrostatic cation binding strength wang et al 2018 however in this case a colloid facilitated transport was initiated due to aquifer desalinization as previously salinized aquifer gave a high potential barrier to the attraction the fwr in aquifer gave an abrupt decline in the depth of the secondary energy minimum between colloidal particles finally as the ionic strength decreased colloids were released from the secondary energy minimum massoudieh and ginn 2007 the following section elaborated this phenomenon in greater detail via dlvo calculation from a holistic perspective of the circulation processes of the swi and fwr the co transport of heavy metal and colloids was recognized to be affected by multiple inherently correlated factors correlation matrix was shown in the supplementary material as figure s6 as shown in fig 4 the samples from different stages were closely clustered indicating that the influence of seawater freshwater interface transit was statistically significant for clustering the data the eigenvalues for principal component numbers 1 and 2 pc1 and pc2 were 5 51 and 2 83 respectively their cumulative percentage of variance accounted for 59 54 the ph and colloid related factors were of the highest loadings on pc1 ranging from 0 23 to 0 37 whereas for pc2 they were hydrochemical related factors e g ionic strength and zeta potential and transported heavy metals as ions thus we determined that the loading scores for pc1 were mainly related to colloidal mobilization while pc2 was mainly contributed by metal sorption it was apparent that the liberation of heavy metals and colloids were clustered in the vicinity of the interface pv 1 in all stages as the interface propagation the clusters gradually returned to the origin which indicated the status of the colloids being retained and the heavy metals being adsorbed zeta potential and ph were highly correlated with the phenomenon of colloid mobilization linking the colloid facilitated transport for heavy metals with the interface dynamics as the stage of freshwater elution shifted to the swi and then to the fwr the transported heavy metals changed from ionic to colloid bonded state the samples scattered diagonally from the upper left to the origin and then to the upper right and the clusters tilted clockwise which could be interpreted as a hydrogeochemical manifestation of the cycles between continental and oceanic phases 3 2 dlvo explanation for colloidal mobilization as the continental phase that has not experienced salinization assuming a steady freshwater flow it only elutes heavy metals from the aquifer without the facilitation of the colloids because under stable seepage conditions drag force of the pore flow was trivial for colloids mobilization and the colloids were difficult to release from the secondary energy minimum without favorable hydrochemical conditions bradford and kim 2010 the colloids tended to deposit on matrix surface and clogged in pore throats wiesner et al 1996 thus filtrated by the aquifer however the colloid facilitated transport for heavy metals was driven by seawater freshwater interface dynamics such behaviors could be explained by the variation of the dlvo interaction energy in the vicinity of the interface the spatial morphology of the seawater freshwater interface was shown in the supplementary material as figure s7 as shown in fig 5 a prior to the interface arrival as the thickness of the electrical double layer was 0 63 nm the total interaction energy exhibited attraction through all action ranges hence colloidal mobilization was not observed the trapping of colloids into the primary energy minimum could explain this process since the van der waals attraction dominated the repulsive interactions in the separation distance associated with the energy barrier torkzaban and bradford 2016 in fig 5 b with the propagation of freshwater the colloids showed a repulsive energy barrier in the distance range 0 13 0 70 nm while the depth of the secondary energy minimum declined however the peak liberation of the heavy metal was yet to be observed because the hydraulic drag force was insufficient to cross the pronounced energy barrier shen et al 2012 note that an isoelectric point of the colloids was presented behind the seawater freshwater interface as the zeta potential decreased from 1 16 mv to 1 62 mv in response as shown in fig 5 c and d the thickness of the electrical double layer increased to 10 14 nm revealing a high repulsive energy barrier and a corresponding cancelation of the secondary energy minimum 3 3 analysis of colloid mobilization by characterizing the pore structure changes the breakthrough curves of the conservative solute contained all the necessary information on the physical and hydrodynamic characteristics of the column as shown in table s4 in the supplementary material the column that has experienced the colloidal mobilization exhibited varied transport parameters and accordingly steeper in breakthrough curves fig 6 in the case of tracer test 1 these parameters reflected a loose property of the sandy aquifer in the beach as the effective porosity was higher than the aquifers farther from the beach liu et al 2015 the peclet number tended to be greater indicating a minor dispersion for pollution transport waleeittikul et al 2019 in aquifers with a stable pore structure heavy metals were adsorbed on retarded colloids and were hardly transported wang et al 2015b however pollutants trapped in the immobile pore space may pose a greater threat to the environment because of their more extended release period you et al 2020 once the colloid mobilization was initialized massive release of pollutants could be induced by the pore structure changes and disturbance of colloid suspension treumann et al 2014 zhu et al 2012 as such the use of transport parameters as indicators for coastal groundwater interaction remained elusive partly due to the challenge in its heterogeneity and time variability herein we emphasize this complexity by characterizing the pore structure changes during the fwr stage a fraction of the colloids was constantly lost which directly led to a 1 79 reduction in the effective porosity in tracer test 2 consequently it induced a partial unclogging of the pores which parametrically resulted in a declining porosity of the immobile domain from 18 16 to 2 28 of the total pores as shown in fig 7 the 3d reconstructed pore structure map displayed that the mobilization of colloids developed macropores of approximately 1 mm in diameter in local areas resulting in interconnected pores which provided privileged transit pathways for colloid and heavy metal however part of the colloids simultaneously clogged in the pore throat and gradually expanded to develop a local area with low permeability as the peclet number decreased from 535 94 to 280 67 the solute exchange between mobile and immobile liquid regions was reduced depicting a decrease in the traveled length of the fluid this phenomenon has raised concerns in field investigation baumann et al 2006 but it has been neglected in most modeling studies because the hydrogeological properties were conventionally considered constants in model configurations 3 4 size selective transport and retention of the colloids driven by seawater freshwater interface dynamics based on the colloid mobilization and corresponding pore structure change revealed from the microscopic observation the evolution of the colloidal particle dimension was more evident in this complexity as shown in fig 8 the initially released colloidal fraction from the secondary energy minimum belonged to the dimension range of 1 1000 µm while the highest populations were distributed in the vicinity of 5 µm which was the main component of the colloid release peak notably with the pv ranging from 1 3 to 1 6 there were finer particles 1 μm presented in the effluent accompanying the arrival of the colloid release peak these observations indicated that large particles were more efficiently mobilized by following the propagation of the interface the size selective transport could be explained by the dynamic balance of hydrodynamic drag force and electrostatic interaction energy since larger particles were more prominently subject to macroscopic forces for finer particles the microscopic binding energy between their surfaces was more dominant for their motion li et al 2005 moreover with an abrupt change in pore structure during the colloid release peak the subsequent persistence of the colloidal plume in this stage was attributed to the connectivity of the transmission pathways it was anticipated that the magnitude of straining would decline due to less amount of low velocity regions torkzaban et al 2008 which was confirmed in the concentration curve fig 3 but instead a colloidal gap was presented in fig 8 this phenomenon could be attributed to increased straining and filtration for the colloids with such dimension approximately 1 μm i e pore structure was newly developed and acted as dead ends for these fractions bradford et al 2002 furthermore straining served as a secondary significant mechanism for colloid removal for finer fractions thus showing the gap like morphology this gap gradually smoothed out as the colloids continuously collided and aggregated therefore we suggested that the fluctuation with the evolution that characterized the particle dimension of the mobilized colloids was ascribed to different degrees of ripening straining hetero aggregation and collision efficiency wang et al 2015a or more likely to a combination of these factors during seawater freshwater interface transit evidence showed that the behavior of colloids significantly dominated the co transport under transient hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions especially under highly heterogeneous hydrogeological conditions and diverse colloid composition bennacer et al 2013 masciopinto 2013 wang et al 2015b the challenges for description and prediction laid in the fact that the colloidal energy barrier fluctuates from approximately 10 kts to hundreds or thousands of kts depending on seawater freshwater interface dynamics with extensive low flow and backward flow zones in natural porous media li et al 2010 leading to discrepancies in the simulation in classical colloid filtration theory li et al 2012 4 conclusions this study conducted packed column experiments to investigate the co transport of heavy metals and colloids driven by seawater freshwater interface dynamics succinctly the seawater and freshwater mixing displacement induced colloids mobilization which carried heavy metals for discharge from coastal aquifers in addition to the ionic dissolved heavy metals that were transported with groundwater flow cation exchange caused transport of a fraction of the heavy metals adsorbed on the aquifer medium during the swi stage whereas in the fwr stage the colloids were liberated and mobilized due to the decline in the depth of the secondary energy minimum between colloids thus favoring the colloid facilitated transport for heavy metals this mechanism led to changes in the transmission pathways of the porous medium in which the proportion of immobile pores decreased while the dimensions of the transported colloids evolved due to colloidal ripening straining hetero aggregation and collision showing a size selective transport and therefore regulating the total emission fluxes of the heavy metals given the complexities and heterogeneities that characterize the co transport of heavy metals and colloids it is essential to understand how variations of hydrodynamics and hydrochemistry in site scale flow regimes can affect the transport behavior of heavy metals introduced to the subsurface in coastal regions explicit incorporation of geometries of colloids and characterization of the pore structure for coastal aquifers is of central importance in subsequent

16022,co transport of colloidal substances and pollutants is a pivotal link that significantly affects the environment of coastal groundwater the effect of colloid mobilization and aquifer pore structure change on heavy metal transport driven by seawater freshwater interface dynamics is not fully understood in this study packed column experiments were conducted to model the seawater intrusion swi and freshwater replenishment fwr processes using a sampled medium from a coastal sandy aquifer hydrodynamic hydrochemical variables and heavy metal pb cu cd transport during the propagation of the seawater freshwater interface were tested and analyzed during the swi stage cation exchange induced heavy metal liberations and it developed peak concentrations synchronized with the seawater freshwater interface at the pore volume of 1 00 the colloid facilitated transport for heavy metals was the predominant mechanism in the fwr stage characterized by a peak release lagging the interface propagation by approximately 0 5 pore volumes because the colloidal fraction was mobilized during aquifer desalination it lagged behind the decline of the salinity gradient furthermore derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo calculations explained that the replenishment decreased the depth of the secondary energy minimum of the colloids meanwhile the thickness of the electrical double layer increased from 0 63 nm to 10 14 nm resulting in a repulsive energy barrier up to 3 213 kt the transport of colloids led to a reduction in porosity from 18 16 to 2 28 of the total immobile domain at these times the dimension of the transported colloids evolved showing a size selective transport and therefore regulating the total emission fluxes of the heavy metals these mechanisms were

dependent on the aqueous ph and ionic strength chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 won and burns 2018 experiments showed that high ionic strength retards the transport of cd2 in the dissolved state because of competitive adsorption and complexation and conversely low ionic strength favors the transport allowing cd2 to remain mobilized in the colloid bound state wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 researchers have long been devoted to characterizing the interaction processes in response to the complexities they have proposed the classical boussinesq equation the advection diffusion equation etc derived numerical models were constructed to provide theoretical bases and research tools for solving the problems of tidal fluctuation and variable density flow in coastal groundwater cartwright et al 2004 chang et al 2021 li et al 2000 nielsen 1990 xiong et al 2020 related studies revealed the mechanism of solute transport and water chemistry by simulating the swi under a one dimensional transmissive scenario boluda botella et al 2008 and the mechanism for salt ph and flow rate affecting the transport of heavy metals by colloidal particles chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 won et al 2019 meanwhile modeling experiments for two dimensional saline and freshwater interaction were conducted to reveal the saltwater up coning effect during coastal groundwater extraction werner et al 2009 tidal induced groundwater circulation recharge mechanism kuan et al 2012 the effect of saltwater wedge pattern in the coastal stratified geological system lu et al 2013 and the effect of sea level rise on contaminant transport in coastal aquifers guo et al 2020 however evidence suggests that the mixing displacement process of the seawater and freshwater induces discrepancies in characterizations and predictions of heavy metal transport microscopic effects of colloidal facilitation in the coastal aquifer can outweigh the direct elution with groundwater discharge as a suspension of colloids migrates undergoes ripening straining hetero aggregation and collision during migration some fractions are retained wang et al 2015a this process is commonly referred to as colloidal filtration it is characterized by the fact that the retained colloids increase the frictional resistance to the aqueous phase thereby reducing the regional permeability of the aquifer chen et al 2010 conversely our previous study suggested that colloid transport contributed to pore connectivity tan et al 2017 this discrepancy was due to variable colloidal state thus affecting the behavior the mobility of colloidal particles is functionally related to the size of medium pores the higher the sand content and the larger the pores the lower the probability of colloidal particles being filtered during transport löv et al 2018 wang et al 2016 accurate prediction of colloid trajectories and pathways under specific environmental conditions requires the incorporation of adequate geometries for particle and pores into consideration li et al 2012 on this basis coupled with the selective binding of heavy metals to colloids the complexity of the process of colloid associated heavy metal transport is further increased differences in colloidal particle size affect the enrichment of heavy metals for instance zn and cd are mainly enriched in the soluble phase 3 kda at the same time cu and pb tend to be enriched in slightly coarser colloidal particles 30 kda 0 22 μm and are generally higher in finer colloidal particles gradually transferring to fine particles and soluble phase during the transport wen et al 2019 nevertheless the above phenomena remain elusive in detailed experimental observations and model interpretations at this stage our proposal is to establish an understanding of the effect of colloid mobilization and aquifer pore structure change on heavy metal transport driven by seawater freshwater interface dynamics through laboratory experiments thus the present study aimed to investigate 1 the mobilization and transport patterns of colloids associated with heavy metals during the swi and fwr processes and 2 the effect of size selective transport and retention of the colloids driven by seawater freshwater interface dynamics at column scale 2 material and methods 2 1 porous medium treatment and experimental set up this study involved packed column experiments using the porous medium sampled from a shallow sandy aquifer beneath the beach near a landfill at the yangtze river estuary 31 39 31 62 n 121 42 8 23 e the sampling site was shown in figure s1 in the supplementary material the sampled medium was pretreated before column experiments according to the procedure described in our previous research with minor revision tan et al 2017 the sample was dried at 80 c for 48 h while stirring evenly using an overhead electric mixer ika rw47 to ensure homogeneity the mixture of the medium and heavy metal reagents pb cd and cu nitrates was prepared to mimic the porous medium polluted by heavy metals originating from landfill leachate the treated medium was aged for 30 days as suggested by loganathan et al 2012 then homogenized and air dried resulting in a final concentration of 0 1 mg g of each element fig 1 a showed that the experimental set up was designed for simulating the seawater and freshwater mixing displacement process the plexiglass column had a length of 16 7 cm and an inner diameter of 5 0 cm the inner surface was dull polished to avoid preferential flow the trumpet shaped lids were installed with radial pipes and porous stones to ensure that the injected water could be distributed evenly to the column section pre tests demonstrated that the column configuration could effectively eliminate the pulsation caused by the peristaltic pump and the preferential flow neither the column inner surface nor the porous stones retained the transported heavy metal ions and colloids the transport data was accurate and repeatable the inlet and outlet of the column were alternately connected with a freshwater tank a seawater tank and an automatic fraction collector which enabled the apparatus to switch the injected solution and its flow direction the exhaust valves were used to drain air bubbles from the pipe electrode probes mounted on the pipe were used to record the ph and conductivity of the outlet solution the apparatus set up was shown in figure s2 a in the supplementary material a wet packing method was employed as described in our previous research tan et al 2017 the column was prefilled with prepared freshwater to a thickness of 2 cm first then the dried medium and the freshwater were added into the column alternately each shift added the medium by a thickness of 0 5 cm to minimize the influence of grain size sorting and subsequent layering the packing procedure was performed under vibration to eliminate bubbles and ensure replicable packing conditions the packed column was saturated for 24 h to reach the adsorption desorption equilibrium of heavy metals with the medium before the subsequent experiments 2 2 seawater and freshwater mixing displacement configuration column experiments were conducted to model the mixing displacement process in coastal aquifers the darcy velocity was set to 8 18 cm h to mimic the rate of coastal groundwater interaction boluda botella et al 2008 correspondingly the fluid injection rate was 2 676 ml min according to the column size all infiltration processes were performed in steady state flow conditions thus the fluid volume was converted to pore volume pv to measure the transport process with respect to the medium porosity and the injection flow rate the packed column was used for the tracer test 1 conducted by injection of 1 mm sodium nitrate solution under saturated conditions a breakthrough curve was obtained to determine the transport parameters for the column next the column was used for transport experiments which were conducted to simulate the cycle of swi and fwr via a mixing displacement procedure in the swi phase the column was salinized by injecting 2 00 pvs of seawater heavy metal elution was rendered accompanied by aquifer salinization at this stage in the fwr phase the column was desalinized by injecting 4 00 pvs of freshwater and colloid associated heavy metals were eluted during these two stages salinized water was prepared in the laboratory to represent the seawater as suggested by lee and kim 2015 and tan et al 2017 the ph of seawater was adjusted to 8 26 via titration using a sodium hydroxide solution and the salinity was adjusted to 2 8 high ionic strength of 487 72 mm using sodium chloride while for freshwater the ph was adjusted to 5 50 via titration with a hydrochloric acid solution and the salinity was set to a low value low ionic strength of 2 02 mm based on our previous field study liu et al 2015 the detailed sequence of injecting solutions used in the experiments was shown in table s1 in the supplementary material after the two phase fluid has finished a replacement cycle the pore structure of the aquifer was altered by colloids migration tracer test 2 was therefore conducted after the fwr stage to examine the hydrodynamic and physical parameter change in addition an experiment of heavy metal elution by freshwater was also conducted which was elaborated in the supplementary material 2 3 visualization of aquifer pore structure change induced by colloids mobilization as shown in fig 1 b depending on the lengthwise size of the column a slice like apparatus 167 50 3 mm was used to demonstrate the mixing displacement process of two phase water through a porous medium the apparatus set up was shown in figure s2 b in the supplementary material the injection sequences were consistent with the column experiments identical darcy velocity driven by the seawater freshwater interaction the suspended colloids in interconnected pores were first eluted then the pore structure changes as the colloidal translocation and this phenomenon was observed by micro ct scanning vivact 80 scanco medical ag switzerland a scanning coverage area of 80 80 cm2 in the mid section of the apparatus was selected for image reconstruction to visualize the pore structure changes after colloidal migration 2 4 laboratory analyses for column medium and elution samples the grain size of the packed medium and eluted colloids was measured using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern panalytical uk the porosity of the packed medium was ε 0 44 cm3 cm3 and the bulk density was ρb 1 73 g cm3 the grain size distribution shown in figure s3 in the supplementary material indicated that the medium had a uniformity coefficient of cu 1 93 and a curvature coefficient of cc 0 93 the composition of the medium was mainly silica scanning electron microscopy images by phenom prox desktop sem thermo fisher scientific inc usa showed that the surface of this medium was mostly flat and smooth with sphere like colloids in contact with the surfaces and efficiently clustered in concave areas shown in figure s4 in the supplementary material the elution samples including the colloidal suspension were digested using mixed acids 60 perchloric acid 40 hydrofluoric acid in a teflon crucible huang et al 1988 and analyzed for heavy metal concentration by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer 720es icp oes agilent technologies inc usa detailed analytical procedures were described in the previous work tan et al 2017 the zeta potential of the suspended colloids was measured using a zeta potential measurement system zetasizer nano zs 90 malvern panalytical uk milli q ultra pure water was used for solution preparation and analysis all glassware was properly washed with liquid detergent and rinsed with distilled water before use and all reagents were analytical grade 2 5 model interpretation and statistical analysis basic transport parameters were initially obtained by fitting with the experimental data from the tracer tests using the analytical solution of the convection dispersion equation as eq 1 via acuaintrusion transport model assuming that the breakthrough curves contain non reactive components boluda botella et al 2014 lapidus and amundson 1952 1 c l t c i c 0 c i 2 erfc l v t 4 d l t exp v l d l erfc l v t 4 d l t where c l t is the elution concentration of the sodium nitrate solution ci is the initial concentration of the porous solute c0 is the concentration of sodium nitrate solution of the injection l is the column length t is the time v is the interstitial water velocity in the direction of propagation equal to darcy velocity divided by porosity u ε dl is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient given the presence of transportable colloidal fractions in the coastal aquifer their clogging effect on the pore space is heterogeneous and time variable and this effect may cause discrepancies in fitting with the model when part of the water flow is restricted in inter aggregate pores and macropores they are immobile pockets that can exchange retain and store water but do not develop convective flow thus the dual porosity type flow requires incorporating the liquid phase into mobile and immobile regions therefore the dual porosity model was used to fit the breakthrough curves among which u v tm dl pe ε and dispersivity α l pe were determined in the hydrus 1d model by inverse modeling refer to supplementary material for detailed model descriptions during the seawater and freshwater mixing displacement process in coastal aquifers the transport and retention behaviors of the colloidal particles were determined by the interaction energy between the sand surface and the colloids themselves derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo calculation was performed to elucidate the relationship between the transport potential of the colloids and the groundwater chemistry alternation through observations by electron microscopy tan et al 2017 the contact surface of sand and movable colloids was reasonably hypothesized as plate while the colloidal particles were spherical the colloid to sand interaction energy can be calculated by the ideal sphere plate model in dlvo theory chen et al 2018 a detailed model description for dlvo calculation was elaborated in the supplementary material numerous interdependent factors affected the co transport of colloids and heavy metals during the swi and fwr therefore principal component analysis pca was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the possibly correlated variables while retaining most of the information fourteen variables including the concentrations of heavy metals in ionic state pb ionic cd ionic and cu ionic concentrations of heavy metals bonded with colloids pb colloid bonded cd colloid bonded and cu colloid bonded ionic strength zeta potential ph total colloid concentration and dimensions for mobilized colloids and particles 1 μm 1 100 μm 100 1000 μm and 1000 μm were considered in the present study data were analyzed using spss 23 0 software spss inc chicago il usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 heavy metal transport during seawater intrusion and freshwater replenishment heavy metal transport due to the swi was appreciably more prominent than in freshwater driven cases see figure s5 in supplementary material for freshwater elution experiment as shown in fig 2 heavy metals liberated and developed peak values of concentration in the vicinity of pv 1 00 apparently the formation of the peaks synchronized with the seawater freshwater interface and they propagated to the column outlet the observed peak concentrations of pb cu and cd in the test were 0 025 0 91 and 0 49 mg cm3 with a total collection of 2 74 45 81 and 26 10 mg during the 2 pvs these fractions accounted for 4 83 80 76 and 46 01 of the total amount of each element in the column medium respectively as shown in fig 3 it was worth noting that the concentrations of pb and cu exhibited similar peaks during the fwr stage but the peaks emerged with a lag of approximately 0 5 pvs from the interface the concentration curves of pb and cu were highly identical with a peak value of 0 12 mg cm3 a total collection of 4 31 mg and 4 08 mg during a period range of 2 pvs before and after the peak value at pv 1 56 these fractions accounted for 7 20 and 7 60 of the total amount of each element in the column medium respectively note that the cd transport was low at this stage and did not show a peak pattern the different magnitude of the heavy metal liberation was due to varied driven factors during the seawater and freshwater mixing displacement process there was undoubtedly a dissolved fraction that maintained a maximum transport potential however due to the existence of multiple binding interactions e g complexation electrostatic attraction and cation π bond between heavy metals and substrates dong et al 2014 reddad et al 2002 such strong adsorption affinity led to the enrichment of heavy metals on the soil surface qi et al 2012 while this fraction was negligible in natural aquifers as pb has various valence states in groundwater it is more readily adsorbed than cu and cd higher valence states and formations variability led to higher adsorption capacity and stability meanwhile larger ionic radius and difference in electronic configurations of pb also contributed to its high affinity to aquifer medium marques et al 2020 the present study emphasized that the heavy metal liberation was driven by seawater and freshwater mixing displacement the swi stage exhibited a peak concentration due to the liberation of pb from ion exchange sites in the aquifer medium due to exchange with sodium the substitution of cations to occupy the ion exchange sites induces concentration peaks near pv 1 gomis et al 1996 sodium chloride solution was used to mimic seawater in this study nevertheless variation in seawater composition in field conditions also interacted with this process such as potassium magnesium and sulfate and their reactions at the interface follow a similar pattern for instance the potassium was more likely to be retained in the interlayer space of aquifer colloidal particles due to its strong adsorption leading to a significant delay of propagation during the seawater intrusion process ruiz et al 1990 in uncontaminated aquifers due to the high concentrations of calcium liberated and the sulfate in the seawater gypsum precipitation was also accompanied by aquifer salinization boluda botella et al 2008 the substitution of heavy metals was linked to fluctuations in the concentration of these cations in the swi as demonstrated in this study heavy metal contaminated aquifers would liberate large amounts of ions as a process synchronized with the swi another factor contributing to the enhanced transport of heavy metals which has been overlooked was the colloid facilitated transport during the freshwater replenishment process after eluting a certain amount of heavy metals in the swi stage the remaining fractions were generally adsorbed on the colloids through stronger specific and electrostatic cation binding strength wang et al 2018 however in this case a colloid facilitated transport was initiated due to aquifer desalinization as previously salinized aquifer gave a high potential barrier to the attraction the fwr in aquifer gave an abrupt decline in the depth of the secondary energy minimum between colloidal particles finally as the ionic strength decreased colloids were released from the secondary energy minimum massoudieh and ginn 2007 the following section elaborated this phenomenon in greater detail via dlvo calculation from a holistic perspective of the circulation processes of the swi and fwr the co transport of heavy metal and colloids was recognized to be affected by multiple inherently correlated factors correlation matrix was shown in the supplementary material as figure s6 as shown in fig 4 the samples from different stages were closely clustered indicating that the influence of seawater freshwater interface transit was statistically significant for clustering the data the eigenvalues for principal component numbers 1 and 2 pc1 and pc2 were 5 51 and 2 83 respectively their cumulative percentage of variance accounted for 59 54 the ph and colloid related factors were of the highest loadings on pc1 ranging from 0 23 to 0 37 whereas for pc2 they were hydrochemical related factors e g ionic strength and zeta potential and transported heavy metals as ions thus we determined that the loading scores for pc1 were mainly related to colloidal mobilization while pc2 was mainly contributed by metal sorption it was apparent that the liberation of heavy metals and colloids were clustered in the vicinity of the interface pv 1 in all stages as the interface propagation the clusters gradually returned to the origin which indicated the status of the colloids being retained and the heavy metals being adsorbed zeta potential and ph were highly correlated with the phenomenon of colloid mobilization linking the colloid facilitated transport for heavy metals with the interface dynamics as the stage of freshwater elution shifted to the swi and then to the fwr the transported heavy metals changed from ionic to colloid bonded state the samples scattered diagonally from the upper left to the origin and then to the upper right and the clusters tilted clockwise which could be interpreted as a hydrogeochemical manifestation of the cycles between continental and oceanic phases 3 2 dlvo explanation for colloidal mobilization as the continental phase that has not experienced salinization assuming a steady freshwater flow it only elutes heavy metals from the aquifer without the facilitation of the colloids because under stable seepage conditions drag force of the pore flow was trivial for colloids mobilization and the colloids were difficult to release from the secondary energy minimum without favorable hydrochemical conditions bradford and kim 2010 the colloids tended to deposit on matrix surface and clogged in pore throats wiesner et al 1996 thus filtrated by the aquifer however the colloid facilitated transport for heavy metals was driven by seawater freshwater interface dynamics such behaviors could be explained by the variation of the dlvo interaction energy in the vicinity of the interface the spatial morphology of the seawater freshwater interface was shown in the supplementary material as figure s7 as shown in fig 5 a prior to the interface arrival as the thickness of the electrical double layer was 0 63 nm the total interaction energy exhibited attraction through all action ranges hence colloidal mobilization was not observed the trapping of colloids into the primary energy minimum could explain this process since the van der waals attraction dominated the repulsive interactions in the separation distance associated with the energy barrier torkzaban and bradford 2016 in fig 5 b with the propagation of freshwater the colloids showed a repulsive energy barrier in the distance range 0 13 0 70 nm while the depth of the secondary energy minimum declined however the peak liberation of the heavy metal was yet to be observed because the hydraulic drag force was insufficient to cross the pronounced energy barrier shen et al 2012 note that an isoelectric point of the colloids was presented behind the seawater freshwater interface as the zeta potential decreased from 1 16 mv to 1 62 mv in response as shown in fig 5 c and d the thickness of the electrical double layer increased to 10 14 nm revealing a high repulsive energy barrier and a corresponding cancelation of the secondary energy minimum 3 3 analysis of colloid mobilization by characterizing the pore structure changes the breakthrough curves of the conservative solute contained all the necessary information on the physical and hydrodynamic characteristics of the column as shown in table s4 in the supplementary material the column that has experienced the colloidal mobilization exhibited varied transport parameters and accordingly steeper in breakthrough curves fig 6 in the case of tracer test 1 these parameters reflected a loose property of the sandy aquifer in the beach as the effective porosity was higher than the aquifers farther from the beach liu et al 2015 the peclet number tended to be greater indicating a minor dispersion for pollution transport waleeittikul et al 2019 in aquifers with a stable pore structure heavy metals were adsorbed on retarded colloids and were hardly transported wang et al 2015b however pollutants trapped in the immobile pore space may pose a greater threat to the environment because of their more extended release period you et al 2020 once the colloid mobilization was initialized massive release of pollutants could be induced by the pore structure changes and disturbance of colloid suspension treumann et al 2014 zhu et al 2012 as such the use of transport parameters as indicators for coastal groundwater interaction remained elusive partly due to the challenge in its heterogeneity and time variability herein we emphasize this complexity by characterizing the pore structure changes during the fwr stage a fraction of the colloids was constantly lost which directly led to a 1 79 reduction in the effective porosity in tracer test 2 consequently it induced a partial unclogging of the pores which parametrically resulted in a declining porosity of the immobile domain from 18 16 to 2 28 of the total pores as shown in fig 7 the 3d reconstructed pore structure map displayed that the mobilization of colloids developed macropores of approximately 1 mm in diameter in local areas resulting in interconnected pores which provided privileged transit pathways for colloid and heavy metal however part of the colloids simultaneously clogged in the pore throat and gradually expanded to develop a local area with low permeability as the peclet number decreased from 535 94 to 280 67 the solute exchange between mobile and immobile liquid regions was reduced depicting a decrease in the traveled length of the fluid this phenomenon has raised concerns in field investigation baumann et al 2006 but it has been neglected in most modeling studies because the hydrogeological properties were conventionally considered constants in model configurations 3 4 size selective transport and retention of the colloids driven by seawater freshwater interface dynamics based on the colloid mobilization and corresponding pore structure change revealed from the microscopic observation the evolution of the colloidal particle dimension was more evident in this complexity as shown in fig 8 the initially released colloidal fraction from the secondary energy minimum belonged to the dimension range of 1 1000 µm while the highest populations were distributed in the vicinity of 5 µm which was the main component of the colloid release peak notably with the pv ranging from 1 3 to 1 6 there were finer particles 1 μm presented in the effluent accompanying the arrival of the colloid release peak these observations indicated that large particles were more efficiently mobilized by following the propagation of the interface the size selective transport could be explained by the dynamic balance of hydrodynamic drag force and electrostatic interaction energy since larger particles were more prominently subject to macroscopic forces for finer particles the microscopic binding energy between their surfaces was more dominant for their motion li et al 2005 moreover with an abrupt change in pore structure during the colloid release peak the subsequent persistence of the colloidal plume in this stage was attributed to the connectivity of the transmission pathways it was anticipated that the magnitude of straining would decline due to less amount of low velocity regions torkzaban et al 2008 which was confirmed in the concentration curve fig 3 but instead a colloidal gap was presented in fig 8 this phenomenon could be attributed to increased straining and filtration for the colloids with such dimension approximately 1 μm i e pore structure was newly developed and acted as dead ends for these fractions bradford et al 2002 furthermore straining served as a secondary significant mechanism for colloid removal for finer fractions thus showing the gap like morphology this gap gradually smoothed out as the colloids continuously collided and aggregated therefore we suggested that the fluctuation with the evolution that characterized the particle dimension of the mobilized colloids was ascribed to different degrees of ripening straining hetero aggregation and collision efficiency wang et al 2015a or more likely to a combination of these factors during seawater freshwater interface transit evidence showed that the behavior of colloids significantly dominated the co transport under transient hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions especially under highly heterogeneous hydrogeological conditions and diverse colloid composition bennacer et al 2013 masciopinto 2013 wang et al 2015b the challenges for description and prediction laid in the fact that the colloidal energy barrier fluctuates from approximately 10 kts to hundreds or thousands of kts depending on seawater freshwater interface dynamics with extensive low flow and backward flow zones in natural porous media li et al 2010 leading to discrepancies in the simulation in classical colloid filtration theory li et al 2012 4 conclusions this study conducted packed column experiments to investigate the co transport of heavy metals and colloids driven by seawater freshwater interface dynamics succinctly the seawater and freshwater mixing displacement induced colloids mobilization which carried heavy metals for discharge from coastal aquifers in addition to the ionic dissolved heavy metals that were transported with groundwater flow cation exchange caused transport of a fraction of the heavy metals adsorbed on the aquifer medium during the swi stage whereas in the fwr stage the colloids were liberated and mobilized due to the decline in the depth of the secondary energy minimum between colloids thus favoring the colloid facilitated transport for heavy metals this mechanism led to changes in the transmission pathways of the porous medium in which the proportion of immobile pores decreased while the dimensions of the transported colloids evolved due to colloidal ripening straining hetero aggregation and collision showing a size selective transport and therefore regulating the total emission fluxes of the heavy metals given the complexities and heterogeneities that characterize the co transport of heavy metals and colloids it is essential to understand how variations of hydrodynamics and hydrochemistry in site scale flow regimes can affect the transport behavior of heavy metals introduced to the subsurface in coastal regions explicit incorporation of geometries of colloids and characterization of the pore structure for coastal aquifers is of central importance in subsequent studies notably the heterogeneity of contact surfaces and colloidal charge induced by anthropogenic multi pollutant mixing requires integration into the colloid filtration theory declaration of

introduction from 1961 to 2020 the world average yields kg ha 1 of corn and wheat increased more than 200 and those of rice and soybean increased about 150 faostat 2021 in addition there is no sign that these increasing trends will decline in the coming decades the increases in crop yields are attributable to both cultivar improvement and improved agronomic practices miflin 2000 which significantly changed field crop traits e g root and canopy structure stress tolerance and growing degree days egli 2008 kholová et al 2021 these crop trait changes will impact the water and nutrient cycle in cropland and thus affect the hydrologic and water quality processes of agricultural watersheds however crop trait changes have largely been ignored in previous studies clarifying the potential effects of crop improvement on hydrologic and water quality processes in agricultural watersheds can not only fill the cognitive gap but also shed light on long term watershed sustainability assessment since crop hydrology interactions involve complex processes related to atmosphere field management crop growth surface runoff soil water and nutrient transport groundwater and stream flow their assessment through field experiments is costly time consuming and impossible in many instances hydrological models with appropriate crop growth simulation are alternatives to study the effects of crop improvement especially at the regional scale the swat soil and water assessment tool model which was developed for assessing the impact of land management practices on water sediment and nutrient in watersheds arnold et al 1998 2012 has inherent advantages for such efforts the crop growth model in swat uses daily accumulated heat units to quantify phenological plant development a method developed by monteith to calculate potential biomass monteith 1977 harvest index for partitioning grain yield and water temperature nutrient stresses to adjust growth neitsch et al 2011 it has appropriate complexity to consider crop trait improvements a remaining challenge is to review and summarize the crop trait improvements and parameterize these improvements for the swat model

therefore in this study an agricultural watershed in the u s corn belt was selected as a case region to study the effects of crop improvement on water quality using an improved swat model based on the reported crop improvements in recent decades the corresponding model parameters which reflect these improvements were summarized and used to develop plausible crop scenarios the objectives of this research were to 1 identify the key crop trait improvements that affect water quantity and quality processes and 2 analyze the hydrologic and water quality impacts of crop improvements in recent decades and project the impacts for future crop changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study area model setup calibration and validation the st joseph river watershed sjrw located in the u s corn

of the cropland ren et al 2022 chemical fertilizers were intensively applied in this region to achieve high crop yields table s 1 kim et al 2021 cao et al 2018 muenich et al 2016 due to the high annual precipitation and poor natural drain conditions subsurface tile drainage is widely applied to maintain suitable soil moisture for crop growth it is estimated that nearly half of the watershed is drained by subsurface tiles sugg 2007 these agricultural activities have caused nutrient losses from soil which eventually degrade surface and shallow groundwater quality a nine year from 2011 to

increasing rate of 96 and 27 kg ha 1 yr 1 since the 1940s fig 2 the main crop improvements in corn and soybean related to yield increase during recent decades can be summarized in the changes of 1 growing degree days gdd 2 leaf area index lai 3 light utilization lu 4 drought tolerance dt 5 nutrient content nc and 6 harvest index hi in order to study the potential effects of these changes on water quantity and quality processes the crop traits in the 2010s with corresponding calibrated swat crop parameters were set as the baseline current scenario the crop traits in the 1980s were summarized from literature review and used as the historical scenario while the crop traits in the 2040s were determined from the historical and future scenarios by assuming crop traits are changing linearly with time and projected as the future scenario table 1 this linear assumption was made based on the linear increase of crop yields since the 1940s fig 2 and the linear reactions of crop yields to crop trait changes which will be discussed in the following sensitivity analysis detail discussions about the linear assumption can be found in the supplementary material text s 2 all the other model inputs and parameters were kept the same as those used in the baseline scenario the determination of the historical and future crop traits and their reflection in swat parameters are discussed below 2 2 1 growing degree days gdd the gdd is a measure of the average daily temperature accumulation during a crop s life it is a useful concept for predicting crop growth stages and maturity many crop improvements for corn and soybean are related to the change of gdd related properties such as the lengthening of the growth period sacks and kucharik 2011 earlier planting grassini et al 2015 tollenaar and lee 2011 and tolerance to low air temperature dwyer and tollenaar 1989 miransari 2016 the gdd concept is used in the swat crop growth model to drive phenological crop development swat parameters that can reflect changes of gdd include the total number of heat units needed to bring plants to maturity phu c and base temperature for plant growth t base c table 1 for the gdd for corn and soybean in the u s corn belt studies have shown that the phu increased 14 from 1981 to 2005 sacks and kucharik 2011 and the planting times of corn and soybean have shifted to ever earlier dates at a rate of about 0 4 0 5 d year 1 in the past decades grassini et al 2015 kucharik 2006 assuming this rate is constant during the study period the historical 1981 1989 phu should be about 15 less than the baseline 2011 2019 value and the future 2041 2049 phu should be 15 larger than baseline as this study mainly focuses attention on crop improvements earlier planting is related to field management and may be caused by climate change and thus is not considered in the simulation however crop cold tolerance which may also contribute to earlier planting is considered through the adjustment of t base because the change of t base has seldom been studied the historical t base was calibrated to capture the historical yield trend goal and then the future t base was projected based on the linear assumption and the historical and baseline values table 1 2 2 2 leaf area index lai lai is a direct reflection of the amount of light that can be intercepted by crop canopy many crop improvements are related to the increase of lai during the growing season including tolerance to high plant populations duvick 2005 lambert et al 2014 van roekel and coulter 2011 and improved stay green characteristics during seed filling duvick 2005 valentinuz and tollenaar 2004 for corn and tolerance to narrower rows and greater plant densities cober et al 2005 heatherly and elmore 2004 and longer seed filling periods de bruin and pedersen 2009 rowntree et al 2014 for soybean crop tolerance to high densities can be represented by increasing the parameter blai maximum potential leaf area index m2 m 2 in swat the longer seed filling periods can be realized through extending the interval between parameters frgrw2 fraction of the plant growing season corresponding to the 2nd point which approaches the blai on the optimal leaf area development curve and dlai fraction of growing season when leaf area begins to decline it has long been recognized that the lai increase can partially explain the yield increase of corn and soybean lambert et al 2014 li et al 2018 tagliapietra et al 2018 however the specific lai increments of the two crops in the past decades have not been reported for corn there is a relatively clear record about plant density change in the study area about 53 000 plants ha 1 in 1980s historical period and 77 000 plants ha 1 in 2010s baseline period based on the relationship between lai and plant density for corn bavec and bavec 2002 mokhtarpour et al 2011 westgate et al 1997 the blai in the 1980s would be about 15 30 less than that in the 2010s when assuming the cultivar was not changing however as the increased density tolerance of new corn cultivars may relate to lower leaf area per plant ford et al 2008 lambert et al 2014 morrison et al 1999 a relatively smaller reduction 15 of blai for the historical scenario compared with the baseline value was adopted in this study correspondingly a 15 increase of the baseline blai was set for the future crop scenario the frgrw2 and dlai were also adjusted to make their interval 15 shorter for the historical scenario and 15 longer for the future scenario table 1 as no detailed data were found for determining soybean lai change the same changes for corn were also specified for soybean for the historical and future scenarios considering that the soybean yield and gdd changes were similar to corn table 1 2 2 3 light utilization lu the lu characteristics of corn and soybean are also changing with crop improvement the main parameters in swat related to lu are ext coef light extinction coefficient and bio e radiation use efficiency represents the amount of dry biomass produced per unit of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation 10 1 g mj 1 with crop row spacing decrease the light extinction coefficient tends to increase flénet et al 1996 genetic improvement of corn has resulted in a more erect canopy architecture which can increase the bio e by distributing light more effectively through canopies duvick 2005 lee and tollenaar 2007 meghji et al 1984 stöckle and kemanian 2009 modern soybean cultivars with improved resistance to lodging and environmental stresses also have a higher bio e anda et al 2021 koester et al 2014 lopez et al 2021 since there is no quantitative record about the ext coef and bio e change in the past decades for corn and soybean the two parameters for the historical scenario were adjusted based on previous studies koester et al 2014 tollenaar and aguilera 1992 westgate et al 1997 to make sure the historical simulation can capture the yield trend for the 1980s once the historical ext coef and bio e were obtained their differences to baseline values can be used for determining future scenario values based on the linear assumption table 1 2 2 4 drought tolerance dt both corn and soybean in the u s corn belt are becoming more drought tolerant yu and babcock 2010 zipper et al 2016 several traits have been recognized for contributing to crop tolerance to drought including improvements in root system architecture and function comas et al 2013 hammer et al 2009 better stomatal regulation laffray and louguet 1990 martin stpaul et al 2017 messina et al 2015 and less reduction of radiation use efficiency to high vapor pressure deficit vpd gilbert et al 2011a sinclair et al 2017 parameters related to drought tolerance in swat including epco plant uptake compensation factor and rdmx maximum root depth m for root systems gsi maximum stomatal conductance m s 1 frgmax fraction of maximum stomatal conductance corresponding to the second point on the stomatal conductance curve and vpdfr vapor pressure deficit corresponding to the second point on the stomatal conductance curve kpa for stomatal regulation and wavp rate of decline in radiation use efficiency per unit increase in vapor pressure deficit g mj 1 kpa 1 for radiation use table 1 with increased drought stress tolerance crops should have larger rdmx and epco that allow more of the water and nutrient uptake demand to be met by lower layers in the soil lower frgmax and vpdfr that enable an early and timely stomatal closure under drought conditions and higher gsi and lower wavp that can maintain a higher photosynthesis rate since no adequate data were found regarding the trend of these parameters a 15 change compared with the baseline for historical and future scenarios was assumed referring to the above confirmed changes table 1 this assumption may be somewhat arbitrary but it does not significantly affect our research goal as the sensitivity analysis that follows will show that dt is mainly sensitive to water quantity processes and its absolute influence is limited in addition the 15 change is in an acceptable range for dt parameters as reported by previous studies gilbert et al 2011b grossiord et al 2020 ordóñez et al 2018 rochette et al 1991 stöckle and kemanian 2009 2 2 5 nutrient content nc with yield improvement in the past decades decreases in seed protein as well as nitrogen and phosphorus content have been extensively reported for both corn and soybean assefa et al 2019 debruin et al 2017 duvick 2005 morrison et al 2000 rincker et al 2014 villamil et al 2019 the swat model uses the normal fraction of nitrogen in yield cnyld kg kg 1 the normal fraction of nitrogen in plant biomass at emergence bn1 kg kg 1 50 maturity bn2 kg kg 1 and maturity bn3 kg kg 1 as parameters for crop nitrogen simulation and uses the normal fraction of phosphorus in yield cpyld kg kg 1 the normal fraction of phosphorus in plant biomass at emergence bp1 kg kg 1 50 maturity bp2 kg kg 1 and maturity bp3 kg kg 1 as parameters for crop phosphorus simulation the corn grain nitrogen content declined at a rate between 0 017 and 0 046 g kg 1 yr 1 in recent decades chen and vyn 2017 ciampitti and vyn 2013 debruin et al 2017 duvick 2005 duvick and cassman 1999 haegele et al 2013 based on this a 5 increase of baseline cnyld was set for the historical scenario and a 5 decrease was set for the future corn scenario the soybean seed protein content decreased at a rate between 0 16 and 0 55 g kg 1 yr 1 nitrogen concentration decreased at a rate between 0 026 and 0 088 g kg 1 yr 1 given nitrogen content of protein is relatively constant at 16 in recent decades morrison et al 2000 rincker et al 2014 voldeng et al 1997 wilcox 2001 based on this a 4 change of cnyld was set for the historical and future soybean scenarios due to the nitrogen content in plants had a similar trend with grain chen and vyn 2017 ortez et al 2019 the historical and future change percentage for bn1 3 were set the same as cnyld for both corn and soybean due to the linear relationship between phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations in the two crops jin et al 2006 ziadi et al 2007 the same change percentage as for nitrogen was also set for the phosphorus parameter cpyld bp1 3 scenarios for corn and soybean table 1 2 2 6 harvest index hi increased allocation of dry matter to reproductive organs has been recognized as one of the reasons contributing to corn and soybean yield increase in recent decades cui and yu 2005 duvick 2005 huetsch and schubert 2017 rowntree et al 2014 this crop trait can be reflected by increasing the swat parameters hvsti harvest index for optimal growing conditions and wsyf lower limit of harvest index the degrees of genetic change in harvest index hi for corn and soybean have been extensively studied most of the studies claim that increases in the hi of corn under temperate climate conditions are rather modest and inconsistent since it was already high about 0 50 in the 1930s duvick 2005 huetsch and schubert 2017 russell 1991 considering the improved harvest efficiency caused by crop resistance to lodging and increased equipment efficiency over time duvick 2005 wang et al 2021 a 5 decrease of the baseline hvsti and wsyf were assumed for the historical scenario and a 5 increase was set for the future scenario for corn with crop cultivar improvement the soybean harvest index increased at a rate between 0 9 10 3 and 1 3 10 3 yr 1 jin et al 2010 morrison et al 1999 rowntree et al 2014 based on this and the improvement of harvest efficiency rincker et al 2014 a 12 change of the baseline hvsti and wsyf was set for the soybean historical and future scenarios table 1 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate which crop trait had the most significant effect on water quantity and quality processes based on the baseline simulation parameters relating to the crop traits mentioned above were varied by 30 to 30 with a 10 interval for model input table s 3 for each crop trait the corresponding group of parameters were usually inherently related and thus they were changed simultaneously rather than independently to represent the change of the crop trait the parameters may be changed in opposite directions to reflect a coincident crop trait change due to their different physical meanings for example increase of phu and decrease of t base was set to represent the increase of gdd and increase of epco rdmx and gsi and decrease of frgmax and wavp to represent the increase of dt for lai the increase scenario was set as the increase of blai and the corresponding increase of the interval between frgrw2 and dlai the parameters for lu nc and hi were all changed in a consistent way when setting the sensitivity analysis scenarios table s 3 simulated annual crop yields and eta of corn and soybean were selected as crop scale objective variables for sensitivity analysis monthly stream flow and stream nutrient loads no3 n tn soluble p and tp were selected as watershed scale objective variables for sensitivity analysis since crop improvements have the most direct effects on cropland hydrological processes simulated monthly tile flow surface flow tile no3 n and tn loads surface no3 n and tn loads tile soluble p and tp loads surface soluble p and tp loads in the corn and soybean rotation system csrs were also selected as objective variables all the objective variables mentioned above were spatiotemporally averaged values of their corresponding scales 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis the variations of corn and soybean yields and eta under different crop trait scenarios are shown in fig 3 results showed that both the corn yield and soybean yield changed nearly linearly to the changing of crop traits with crop traits changing between 30 to 30 the yield of corn ranged from 39 to 35 and the yield of soybean ranged from 41 to 46 corn and soybean yield had an obvious increasing trend with the increase of lu hi gdd and lai in which lu and hi were the most sensitive crop yields were also sensitive to changes in gdd especially when the gdd was below its baseline for soybean the yield decline with a decrease of gdd was comparable with that of hi nc and dt were the most insensitive traits to yield the above crop trait sensitivities to yield resulted from the swat model assumption that only the maximum stress makes a difference for calculating actual crop growth when water stress temperature stress nitrogen stress and phosphorus stress occurred simultaneously neitsch et al 2011 since temperature stress is the dominant stress among the four as revealed by the model simulation gdd is more sensitive than nc and dt crop trait changes had limited influence on eta with only about 2 eta change under 30 crop trait variation dt and lu were the most sensitive crop traits to eta the eta increased with the increase of dt while it decreased with an increase of lu this was because the increase of dt increased the plant water uptake comas et al 2013 hammer et al 2009 however the increase of lu increased aboveground biomass which reduced soil evaporation and finally reduced eta van donk et al 2010 it is worth mentioning that corn eta increased with gdd increase while soybean eta decreased with gdd increase this may be because the increase of gdd lengthened the crop growth period which increased plant transpiration and aboveground biomass and reduced soil evaporation since soybean is more sensitive to gdd fig 3 the effects of gdd increase on soil evaporation reduction exceeded its effects on transpiration increase on the contrary the soil evaporation reduction was less than the transpiration increases for corn the eta of corn and soybean both increased slightly with the increase of hi and lai this is because the increase of hi reduced soil biomass coverage after harvest which enhanced soil evaporation the increase of lai increased plant transpiration and its effect was larger than the soil evaporation reduction effect caused by biomass increase nc was the most insensitive crop trait as eta remained nearly constant with variation of nc the ratios of simulated objective variables for watershed stream flow csrs tile flow and csrs surface runoff to their baseline values under different crop trait scenarios are plotted in fig 4 results showed that dt and lu were the most sensitive crop traits to watershed stream flow csrs tile flow and surface runoff with the 30 variation of crop traits stream flow varied about 2 this was very similar with eta except that the variation trend was the opposite fig 3 the csrs tile flow and surface runoff varied more significantly than stream flow with tile flow being the most sensitive objective variable to crop trait changes it indicated that crop improvements had more significant impacts on cropland hydrology especially on subsurface drainage overall effects of crop trait changes on flow were limited in the range between 4 and 5 hi was the most sensitive parameter to all nutrient loads in stream flow csrs tile flow and surface runoff fig 4 with the increase of hi nutrient loads decreased it was because the increase of hi increased the yield removal from fields and decreased crop residues which reduced the nutrients available to be carried away by water cui and yu 2005 huetsch and schubert 2017 nutrient loads were much more sensitive than water flow to crop trait changes this was especially true for the tile flow nutrients where nitrogen and phosphorus loads varied from 27 to 45 with the 30 crop trait changes the variations of tile flow nutrient loads were similar with that of crop yields in addition no3 n and soluble p which can be directly absorbed by crops were usually more sensitive than tn and tp this indicated that crop trait changes mainly affected subsurface nutrient losses through plant uptake and yield removal lu is the second most sensitive crop trait to the nutrient loads except surface runoff tn this may be because the impacts of lu change on surface runoff no3 n and organic n loads were opposite thus the final tn was neutralized with slight variation under the change of lu most of the nutrient loads declined with an increase of lu while the surface runoff no3 n slightly increased with an increase of lu this was because the increase of lu increased plant growth which extracted more nutrients from soil and reduced nutrient losses with water however since no3 n in the top 10 mm soil was first depleted by plant uptake the increased nutrient uptake had little effect on no3 n load in surface runoff meanwhile the increased surface runoff amount caused by lu increase may finally increase no3 n load fig 4 nitrogen no3 n and tn load variation under different crop trait changes in stream flow fell between that in csrs tile flow and surface runoff while the phosphorus soluble p and tp load variation in stream flow was obviously smaller than that in csrs tile flow and surface runoff this indicated that the stream flow nitrogen loads were primarily dominated by csrs tile flow and surface runoff while phosphorus loads were less affected by csrs ren et al 2022 even though dt is insensitive to most of the nutrient load sources tile soluble p and tp increased with an increase of dt this may be because phosphorus loads in tile flow were mainly contributed by soil crack flow since phosphorus is less mobile in soil williams et al 2016 an increase of dt would increase root water uptake and result in dryer and cracked soil enhancing phosphorus losses through crack flow crop traits are more sensitive to nutrient loads when they are lower than the baseline this was because constant fertilizer strategies were applied to the crop scenario simulations as a result the excessive nutrients in soil become smaller with enhanced crop traits and the reduction of nutrient losses decline 3 2 effects of historical crop scenario on water quantity and quality processes with the historical crop scenario table 1 the simulated average annual corn and soybean yields were respectively 6 68 and 2 33 t ha 1 which were exactly the projected yields in the 1980s fig 2 the 9 year average monthly and annual eta stream flow and nutrient loads changes compared with the baseline are summarized in table 2 results showed that the historical annual eta was 0 9 lower than the baseline value with eta during the growing season may to september slightly lower than the baseline value while that during the non growing season october to the next april was slightly higher than the baseline the monthly historical to baseline ratios h b of eta also showed this trend with values usually larger than 1 0 during the non growing season and lower than 1 0 during the growing season fig 5 this was because the historical crop traits resulted in smaller crop lai and shorter root depth which reduced plant transpiration during the growing season al kaisi et al 1989 however the reduced crop residue caused by the smaller plants resulted in higher soil evaporation van donk et al 2010 especially during the non growing season the largest gap between the historical and baseline eta during the growing season usually occurred in september when h b reached the lowest point between 0 91 and 0 96 each year fig 5 this was mainly caused by a decrease of gdd in the historical scenario which resulted in shorter growth period and early crop senescence the largest h b during the non growing season usually occurred in october and november just after crop harvest with the peak ratios ranging between 1 02 and 1 04 this was because the lower eta during the growing season resulted in a relatively wet soil after harvest in addition the reduced residue cover also enhanced soil evaporation during this time period the historical annual stream flow was about 2 0 larger than the baseline value table 2 the difference was mainly caused by the non growing season flow as the historical growing season flow was only 0 5 larger than the baseline while the non growing season flow was 2 9 larger this indicated that the influence of crop trait changes on stream flow mainly happened during the non growing season the maximum difference between the historical and baseline monthly flow usually occurred in the first significant rainfall after harvest with the peak h b reaching about 1 3 fig 5 thus crop trait changes had a significant lag effect on the hydrology the historical annual no3 n and tn loads were respectively 18 6 and 13 4 larger than the baseline values table 2 the monthly average nitrogen load changes showed two peaks respectively in july and october when the historical no3 n loads were more than 70 larger than the baseline and the tn loads were about 40 larger since nitrogen fertilizer was applied in june table s 1 the peak in july reflected the significant impacts of crop trait changes on nitrogen uptake similar with stream flow the peak in october was due to lag caused by crop changes historical no3 n loads can be three times the baseline value in certain months when the first significant rainfall occurred after crop harvest fig 5 the historical tn load changes were not as significant as no3 n but still reached an h b of 2 0 during this time period however due to the peak ratios usually occurring in the months with relatively lower absolute nitrogen loads their contribution to the finial annual changes was limited with the historical crop scenario soluble p and tp loads were respectively 3 8 and 3 9 higher than the baseline table 2 the monthly average phosphorus load changes were larger during the non growing season than the growing season and reached the maximum value just after harvest in october this is very similar with the changing pattern of stream flow except that the phosphorus load changes were larger the monthly variation showed that the historical crop scenario had similar effects on the soluble p and tp loads with the peak h b between 1 1 and 1 5 usually occurring after the first significant rainfall after harvest fig 5 3 3 effects of future crop scenario on water quantity and quality processes with the projected future crop trait parameters table 1 the swat simulated corn 12 53 t ha 1 and soybean 4 00 t ha 1 yields were both within 2 of the yield trend projections in the 2040s fig 2 this verified that a linear assumption for crop trait parameter changes would be reasonable when using swat as a tool to conduct this research under the future crop scenario eta mainly increased during the growing season especially the last month of the growing season in september table 2 it was because the increase of gdd increased the crop stay green period sacks and kucharik 2011 which resulted in an obvious higher eta in the late growing season the non growing season lower eta was caused by the higher aboveground biomass after harvest which reduced soil evaporation van donk et al 2010 the future monthly average stream flow was lower than the baseline value especially in october and november when reductions reached 9 2 and 6 5 respectively this again proved that the effects of crop trait changes on hydrology had a lag time future monthly average no3 n load was 4 3 to 31 5 lower than the baseline value with the maximum reduction occurring in july this was because the improved crop used more no3 n and reduced excess nitrogen in soil caused by the fertilizer application in june another significant no3 n reduction period was october and november just after crop harvest the trend of tn reduction was similar with no3 n except that the magnitude is a little lower similar with the change of stream flow future phosphorus load reductions mainly occurred during the non growing season especially october and november just after crop harvest it is worth mentioning that even though the monthly relative changes of nutrient loads in some months e g march april and may were not large their contributions to the annual changes may be very significant due to their higher baseline nutrient loads for future 2040s crop traits the annual eta increased about 0 7 annual stream flow no3 n tn soluble p and tp decreased 1 5 9 2 6 8 2 9 and 2 6 respectively compared with the baseline values table 2 these changes were smaller than the historical changes the monthly f b future to baseline ratios varied in the opposite direction of h b with the magnitude of changes lower than the historical one fig 5 this indicated that the future crop scenario had relatively less impact than the historical scenario since the degree of the 30 year crop trait changes for the future and historical scenarios were the same the reason was that the fixed baseline fertilizer amount was applied for both the historical and future scenario given actual fertilizer application usually increases with increased crop yields miflin 2000 the actual effects of crop improvements on water quantity and quality processes should fall between the results of historical and future scenarios 3 4 water quantity and quality in csrs the csrs was directly affected by crop improvements in the watershed annual eta of csrs decreased 1 8 with the historical crop scenario while it increased 1 4 with the future crop scenario the changes of the other four water balance components i e surface runoff lateral soil flow tile flow and percolation under historical and future crop traits ranged between 3 7 to 4 8 fig 6 since the above changes happened in the csrs they are usually larger than the water balance changes of the entire watershed table 2 being the two largest components in csrs ren et al 2022 surface runoff and tile flow contributed the main stream flow changes due to crop improvement the changes in nutrient loads in the four water balance components were usually larger than the corresponding water quantity changes the no3 n loads in surface runoff were least affected among the four water paths but still increased 7 5 for the historical scenario and decreased 4 8 for the future scenario the no3 n losses through lateral soil flow tile drainage and percolation increased by 24 7 26 4 and 36 5 for the historical scenario and decreased by 11 9 12 6 and 14 2 for the future scenario respectively since the baseline no3 n load in lateral soil flow was small the main causes of stream flow no3 n load change were tile flow and percolation fig 6 the impacts of historical and future crop scenarios on tn loads in the four water paths were similar with that of no3 n fig 6 surface runoff contributed the main loads and changes of phosphorus in the csrs which was contrary to nitrogen in surface runoff the historical soluble p load increased 10 8 and tp increased 10 6 compared with the baseline while the future soluble p load decreased 8 6 and tp decreased 7 1 tile flow was the second largest source contributing to phosphorus loads the soluble p and tp in tile flow increased 10 8 and 7 5 under the historical crop scenario and decreased 9 7 and 6 5 under the future crop scenario respectively 4 conclusions this study represents the first attempt to clarify the effects of crop improvements on hydrology and nutrient loads at large watershed scale results indicated that 1 crop improvements have more significant effects on nutrients than on water the recent 30 year crop improvements resulted in a 6 8 18 6 reduction of nitrogen loads no3 n and tn and 2 6 3 9 reduction of phosphorus loads soluble p and tp while only 0 7 0 9 increase of eta and 1 5 2 0 reduction of stream flow annually in an agricultural watershed with about 50 cropland in the u s corn belt 2 the effects of crop improvements had a lag time on stream water and nutrient processes the main reductions of stream flow and nutrient loads caused by crop improvement usually occurred during the non growing season from october to next april especially in the first significant rainfall after crop harvest e g october and november when the reductions for tn reached about 40 and stream flow and tp reached about 10 3 long term water quantity and quality studies should consider crop improvements crop growth models in the hydrologic water

16023,field crop traits have and are experiencing significant changes due to genetic and agronomic improvements how these changes affect regional water quantity and quality processes has not been clarified the st joseph river watershed sjrw located in the u s corn belt was selected as a case study area crop corn and soybean trait improvements in the past decades were reviewed and summarized and include changes of growing degree days gdd leaf area index lai light utilization lu drought tolerance dt nutrient content nc and harvest index hi based on a calibrated 9 year from 2011 to 2019 swat soil and water assessment tool simulation in sjrw sensitivities of the above crop traits to yield eta stream flow tile flow surface runoff and nutrient loads no3 n tn soluble p and tp were analyzed crop traits and their corresponding swat parameters for the 2010s were obtained from model calibration and used as the baseline current scenario for the 1980s they were summarized from literature review and used as an historical scenario while those for the 2040s were determined by assuming crop traits are changing linearly with time and projected as the future scenario water quantity and quality changes under the historical and future crop scenarios were compared with the baseline current simulation results showed lu and dt were the most sensitive crop traits to water quantity i e eta stream flow tile flow and surface runoff while hi was the most sensitive to nutrient loads the impacts of crop improvements on nutrient loads were more significant than on water budgets compared with the baseline the historical and future scenarios resulted in 1 5 2 0 changes of stream flow 6 8 18 6 changes of nitrogen loads no3 n and tn and 2 6 3 9 changes of phosphorus loads soluble p and tp in the stream flow annually moreover in certain months these changes can reach about 12 for stream flow 42 for nitrogen loads and 12 for phosphorus loads nitrogen losses by tile drainage and percolation and phosphorus losses by surface runoff and tile drainage were most significantly affected by the crop improvements future work should consider expected crop improvements when studying long term hydrology and nutrient cycles in agricultural watersheds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords crop traits stream flow nitrogen load phosphorus load tile drainage 1 introduction from 1961 to 2020 the world average yields kg ha 1 of corn and wheat increased more than 200 and those of rice and soybean increased about 150 faostat 2021 in addition there is no sign that these increasing trends will decline in the coming decades the increases in crop yields are attributable to both cultivar improvement and improved agronomic practices miflin 2000 which significantly changed field crop traits e g root and canopy structure stress tolerance and growing degree days egli 2008 kholová et al 2021 these crop trait changes will impact the water and nutrient cycle in cropland and thus affect the hydrologic and water quality processes of agricultural watersheds however crop trait changes have largely been ignored in previous studies clarifying the potential effects of crop improvement on hydrologic and water quality processes in agricultural watersheds can not only fill the cognitive gap but also shed light on long term watershed sustainability assessment since crop hydrology interactions involve complex processes related to atmosphere field management crop growth surface runoff soil water and nutrient transport groundwater and stream flow their assessment through field experiments is costly time consuming and impossible in many instances hydrological models with appropriate crop growth simulation are alternatives to study the effects of crop improvement especially at the regional scale the swat soil and water assessment tool model which was developed for assessing the impact of land management practices on water sediment and nutrient in watersheds arnold et al 1998 2012 has inherent advantages for such efforts the crop growth model in swat uses daily accumulated heat units to quantify phenological plant development a method developed by monteith to calculate potential biomass monteith 1977 harvest index for partitioning grain yield and water temperature nutrient stresses to adjust growth neitsch et al 2011 it has appropriate complexity to consider crop trait improvements a remaining challenge is to review and summarize the crop trait improvements and parameterize these improvements for the swat model simulation producing about a third of the global corn and soybean crop harvested faostat 2021 much of the u s corn belt fig 1 a is characterized by a typical corn soybean rotation system and subsurface tile drainage ort and long 2014 suyker and verma 2012 crops in the corn belt have experienced significant changes with the yields of corn and soybean increasing at a rate of 118 and 25 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively since the 1940s usda nass 2021 these crop improvements may have significant impacts on plant water and nutrient uptake and subsequently on hydrologic and water quality processes since agricultural non point source pollution has long been an intractable problem in this region fausey et al 1995 mclellan et al 2018 demonstrating the impacts of crop improvement may enhance our knowledge for reducing nutrient losses and mitigating downstream e g the lake erie and the gulf of mexico water eutrophication national science and technology council 2017 rabalais and turner 2019 therefore in this study an agricultural watershed in the u s corn belt was selected as a case region to study the effects of crop improvement on water quality using an improved swat model based on the reported crop improvements in recent decades the corresponding model parameters which reflect these improvements were summarized and used to develop plausible crop scenarios the objectives of this research were to 1 identify the key crop trait improvements that affect water quantity and quality processes and 2 analyze the hydrologic and water quality impacts of crop improvements in recent decades and project the impacts for future crop changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study area model setup calibration and validation the st joseph river watershed sjrw located in the u s corn belt fig 1 was selected as the case study area it covers an area of about 2815 km2 in which nearly 50 is cropland corn and soybean were the main crops in this region together accounting for about 95 of the cropland ren et al 2022 chemical fertilizers were intensively applied in this region to achieve high crop yields table s 1 kim et al 2021 cao et al 2018 muenich et al 2016 due to the high annual precipitation and poor natural drain conditions subsurface tile drainage is widely applied to maintain suitable soil moisture for crop growth it is estimated that nearly half of the watershed is drained by subsurface tiles sugg 2007 these agricultural activities have caused nutrient losses from soil which eventually degrade surface and shallow groundwater quality a nine year from 2011 to 2019 swat model calibration and validation have been conducted in this region to study water and nutrient balances ren et al 2022 the model was comprehensively calibrated for monthly stream flow total suspended solids tss nutrient including total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn nitrate and nitrite nitrogen nox n total phosphorus tp and orthophosphate phosphorus orthop loads actual evapotranspiration eta leaf area index lai and annual crop yields results indicated that the model performed well for simulating water quantity and quality processes as well as crop growth and yield and thus the model can be used for studying the effects of crop improvements on these processes the main crop parameters used for the 2011 to 2019 simulation are shown in table s 2 these parameters were determined based on both literature reports and model calibration ren et al 2022 thus to obtain better model performance while ensuring the parameters are consistent with reality more details of the model calibration and validation are summarized in the supplementary material text s 1 2 2 crop improvements parameters and scenarios the statistical county level corn and soybean yields in sjrw respectively had a steady increasing rate of 96 and 27 kg ha 1 yr 1 since the 1940s fig 2 the main crop improvements in corn and soybean related to yield increase during recent decades can be summarized in the changes of 1 growing degree days gdd 2 leaf area index lai 3 light utilization lu 4 drought tolerance dt 5 nutrient content nc and 6 harvest index hi in order to study the potential effects of these changes on water quantity and quality processes the crop traits in the 2010s with corresponding calibrated swat crop parameters were set as the baseline current scenario the crop traits in the 1980s were summarized from literature review and used as the historical scenario while the crop traits in the 2040s were determined from the historical and future scenarios by assuming crop traits are changing linearly with time and projected as the future scenario table 1 this linear assumption was made based on the linear increase of crop yields since the 1940s fig 2 and the linear reactions of crop yields to crop trait changes which will be discussed in the following sensitivity analysis detail discussions about the linear assumption can be found in the supplementary material text s 2 all the other model inputs and parameters were kept the same as those used in the baseline scenario the determination of the historical and future crop traits and their reflection in swat parameters are discussed below 2 2 1 growing degree days gdd the gdd is a measure of the average daily temperature accumulation during a crop s life it is a useful concept for predicting crop growth stages and maturity many crop improvements for corn and soybean are related to the change of gdd related properties such as the lengthening of the growth period sacks and kucharik 2011 earlier planting grassini et al 2015 tollenaar and lee 2011 and tolerance to low air temperature dwyer and tollenaar 1989 miransari 2016 the gdd concept is used in the swat crop growth model to drive phenological crop development swat parameters that can reflect changes of gdd include the total number of heat units needed to bring plants to maturity phu c and base temperature for plant growth t base c table 1 for the gdd for corn and soybean in the u s corn belt studies have shown that the phu increased 14 from 1981 to 2005 sacks and kucharik 2011 and the planting times of corn and soybean have shifted to ever earlier dates at a rate of about 0 4 0 5 d year 1 in the past decades grassini et al 2015 kucharik 2006 assuming this rate is constant during the study period the historical 1981 1989 phu should be about 15 less than the baseline 2011 2019 value and the future 2041 2049 phu should be 15 larger than baseline as this study mainly focuses attention on crop improvements earlier planting is related to field management and may be caused by climate change and thus is not considered in the simulation however crop cold tolerance which may also contribute to earlier planting is considered through the adjustment of t base because the change of t base has seldom been studied the historical t base was calibrated to capture the historical yield trend goal and then the future t base was projected based on the linear assumption and the historical and baseline values table 1 2 2 2 leaf area index lai lai is a direct reflection of the amount of light that can be intercepted by crop canopy many crop improvements are related to the increase of lai during the growing season including tolerance to high plant populations duvick 2005 lambert et al 2014 van roekel and coulter 2011 and improved stay green characteristics during seed filling duvick 2005 valentinuz and tollenaar 2004 for corn and tolerance to narrower rows and greater plant densities cober et al 2005 heatherly and elmore 2004 and longer seed filling periods de bruin and pedersen 2009 rowntree et al 2014 for soybean crop tolerance to high densities can be represented by increasing the parameter blai maximum potential leaf area index m2 m 2 in swat the longer seed filling periods can be realized through extending the interval between parameters frgrw2 fraction of the plant growing season corresponding to the 2nd point which approaches the blai on the optimal leaf area development curve and dlai fraction of growing season when leaf area begins to decline it has long been recognized that the lai increase can partially explain the yield increase of corn and soybean lambert et al 2014 li et al 2018 tagliapietra et al 2018 however the specific lai increments of the two crops in the past decades have not been reported for corn there is a relatively clear record about plant density change in the study area about 53 000 plants ha 1 in 1980s historical period and 77 000 plants ha 1 in 2010s baseline period based on the relationship between lai and plant density for corn bavec and bavec 2002 mokhtarpour et al 2011 westgate et al 1997 the blai in the 1980s would be about 15 30 less than that in the 2010s when assuming the cultivar was not changing however as the increased density tolerance of new corn cultivars may relate to lower leaf area per plant ford et al 2008 lambert et al 2014 morrison et al 1999 a relatively smaller reduction 15 of blai for the historical scenario compared with the baseline value was adopted in this study correspondingly a 15 increase of the baseline blai was set for the future crop scenario the frgrw2 and dlai were also adjusted to make their interval 15 shorter for the historical scenario and 15 longer for the future scenario table 1 as no detailed data were found for determining soybean lai change the same changes for corn were also specified for soybean for the historical and future scenarios considering that the soybean yield and gdd changes were similar to corn table 1 2 2 3 light utilization lu the lu characteristics of corn and soybean are also changing with crop improvement the main parameters in swat related to lu are ext coef light extinction coefficient and bio e radiation use efficiency represents the amount of dry biomass produced per unit of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation 10 1 g mj 1 with crop row spacing decrease the light extinction coefficient tends to increase flénet et al 1996 genetic improvement of corn has resulted in a more erect canopy architecture which can increase the bio e by distributing light more effectively through canopies duvick 2005 lee and tollenaar 2007 meghji et al 1984 stöckle and kemanian 2009 modern soybean cultivars with improved resistance to lodging and environmental stresses also have a higher bio e anda et al 2021 koester et al 2014 lopez et al 2021 since there is no quantitative record about the ext coef and bio e change in the past decades for corn and soybean the two parameters for the historical scenario were adjusted based on previous studies koester et al 2014 tollenaar and aguilera 1992 westgate et al 1997 to make sure the historical simulation can capture the yield trend for the 1980s once the historical ext coef and bio e were obtained their differences to baseline values can be used for determining future scenario values based on the linear assumption table 1 2 2 4 drought tolerance dt both corn and soybean in the u s corn belt are becoming more drought tolerant yu and babcock 2010 zipper et al 2016 several traits have been recognized for contributing to crop tolerance to drought including improvements in root system architecture and function comas et al 2013 hammer et al 2009 better stomatal regulation laffray and louguet 1990 martin stpaul et al 2017 messina et al 2015 and less reduction of radiation use efficiency to high vapor pressure deficit vpd gilbert et al 2011a sinclair et al 2017 parameters related to drought tolerance in swat including epco plant uptake compensation factor and rdmx maximum root depth m for root systems gsi maximum stomatal conductance m s 1 frgmax fraction of maximum stomatal conductance corresponding to the second point on the stomatal conductance curve and vpdfr vapor pressure deficit corresponding to the second point on the stomatal conductance curve kpa for stomatal regulation and wavp rate of decline in radiation use efficiency per unit increase in vapor pressure deficit g mj 1 kpa 1 for radiation use table 1 with increased drought stress tolerance crops should have larger rdmx and epco that allow more of the water and nutrient uptake demand to be met by lower layers in the soil lower frgmax and vpdfr that enable an early and timely stomatal closure under drought conditions and higher gsi and lower wavp that can maintain a higher photosynthesis rate since no adequate data were found regarding the trend of these parameters a 15 change compared with the baseline for historical and future scenarios was assumed referring to the above confirmed changes table 1 this assumption may be somewhat arbitrary but it does not significantly affect our research goal as the sensitivity analysis that follows will show that dt is mainly sensitive to water quantity processes and its absolute influence is limited in addition the 15 change is in an acceptable range for dt parameters as reported by previous studies gilbert et al 2011b grossiord et al 2020 ordóñez et al 2018 rochette et al 1991 stöckle and kemanian 2009 2 2 5 nutrient content nc with yield improvement in the past decades decreases in seed protein as well as nitrogen and phosphorus content have been extensively reported for both corn and soybean assefa et al 2019 debruin et al 2017 duvick 2005 morrison et al 2000 rincker et al 2014 villamil et al 2019 the swat model uses the normal fraction of nitrogen in yield cnyld kg kg 1 the normal fraction of nitrogen in plant biomass at emergence bn1 kg kg 1 50 maturity bn2 kg kg 1 and maturity bn3 kg kg 1 as parameters for crop nitrogen simulation and uses the normal fraction of phosphorus in yield cpyld kg kg 1 the normal fraction of phosphorus in plant biomass at emergence bp1 kg kg 1 50 maturity bp2 kg kg 1 and maturity bp3 kg kg 1 as parameters for crop phosphorus simulation the corn grain nitrogen content declined at a rate between 0 017 and 0 046 g kg 1 yr 1 in recent decades chen and vyn 2017 ciampitti and vyn 2013 debruin et al 2017 duvick 2005 duvick and cassman 1999 haegele et al 2013 based on this a 5 increase of baseline cnyld was set for the historical scenario and a 5 decrease was set for the future corn scenario the soybean seed protein content decreased at a rate between 0 16 and 0 55 g kg 1 yr 1 nitrogen concentration decreased at a rate between 0 026 and 0 088 g kg 1 yr 1 given nitrogen content of protein is relatively constant at 16 in recent decades morrison et al 2000 rincker et al 2014 voldeng et al 1997 wilcox 2001 based on this a 4 change of cnyld was set for the historical and future soybean scenarios due to the nitrogen content in plants had a similar trend with grain chen and vyn 2017 ortez et al 2019 the historical and future change percentage for bn1 3 were set the same as cnyld for both corn and soybean due to the linear relationship between phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations in the two crops jin et al 2006 ziadi et al 2007 the same change percentage as for nitrogen was also set for the phosphorus parameter cpyld bp1 3 scenarios for corn and soybean table 1 2 2 6 harvest index hi increased allocation of dry matter to reproductive organs has been recognized as one of the reasons contributing to corn and soybean yield increase in recent decades cui and yu 2005 duvick 2005 huetsch and schubert 2017 rowntree et al 2014 this crop trait can be reflected by increasing the swat parameters hvsti harvest index for optimal growing conditions and wsyf lower limit of harvest index the degrees of genetic change in harvest index hi for corn and soybean have been extensively studied most of the studies claim that increases in the hi of corn under temperate climate conditions are rather modest and inconsistent since it was already high about 0 50 in the 1930s duvick 2005 huetsch and schubert 2017 russell 1991 considering the improved harvest efficiency caused by crop resistance to lodging and increased equipment efficiency over time duvick 2005 wang et al 2021 a 5 decrease of the baseline hvsti and wsyf were assumed for the historical scenario and a 5 increase was set for the future scenario for corn with crop cultivar improvement the soybean harvest index increased at a rate between 0 9 10 3 and 1 3 10 3 yr 1 jin et al 2010 morrison et al 1999 rowntree et al 2014 based on this and the improvement of harvest efficiency rincker et al 2014 a 12 change of the baseline hvsti and wsyf was set for the soybean historical and future scenarios table 1 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate which crop trait had the most significant effect on water quantity and quality processes based on the baseline simulation parameters relating to the crop traits mentioned above were varied by 30 to 30 with a 10 interval for model input table s 3 for each crop trait the corresponding group of parameters were usually inherently related and thus they were changed simultaneously rather than independently to represent the change of the crop trait the parameters may be changed in opposite directions to reflect a coincident crop trait change due to their different physical meanings for example increase of phu and decrease of t base was set to represent the increase of gdd and increase of epco rdmx and gsi and decrease of frgmax and wavp to represent the increase of dt for lai the increase scenario was set as the increase of blai and the corresponding increase of the interval between frgrw2 and dlai the parameters for lu nc and hi were all changed in a consistent way when setting the sensitivity analysis scenarios table s 3 simulated annual crop yields and eta of corn and soybean were selected as crop scale objective variables for sensitivity analysis monthly stream flow and stream nutrient loads no3 n tn soluble p and tp were selected as watershed scale objective variables for sensitivity analysis since crop improvements have the most direct effects on cropland hydrological processes simulated monthly tile flow surface flow tile no3 n and tn loads surface no3 n and tn loads tile soluble p and tp loads surface soluble p and tp loads in the corn and soybean rotation system csrs were also selected as objective variables all the objective variables mentioned above were spatiotemporally averaged values of their corresponding scales 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis the variations of corn and soybean yields and eta under different crop trait scenarios are shown in fig 3 results showed that both the corn yield and soybean yield changed nearly linearly to the changing of crop traits with crop traits changing between 30 to 30 the yield of corn ranged from 39 to 35 and the yield of soybean ranged from 41 to 46 corn and soybean yield had an obvious increasing trend with the increase of lu hi gdd and lai in which lu and hi were the most sensitive crop yields were also sensitive to changes in gdd especially when the gdd was below its baseline for soybean the yield decline with a decrease of gdd was comparable with that of hi nc and dt were the most insensitive traits to yield the above crop trait sensitivities to yield resulted from the swat model assumption that only the maximum stress makes a difference for calculating actual crop growth when water stress temperature stress nitrogen stress and phosphorus stress occurred simultaneously neitsch et al 2011 since temperature stress is the dominant stress among the four as revealed by the model simulation gdd is more sensitive than nc and dt crop trait changes had limited influence on eta with only about 2 eta change under 30 crop trait variation dt and lu were the most sensitive crop traits to eta the eta increased with the increase of dt while it decreased with an increase of lu this was because the increase of dt increased the plant water uptake comas et al 2013 hammer et al 2009 however the increase of lu increased aboveground biomass which reduced soil evaporation and finally reduced eta van donk et al 2010 it is worth mentioning that corn eta increased with gdd increase while soybean eta decreased with gdd increase this may be because the increase of gdd lengthened the crop growth period which increased plant transpiration and aboveground biomass and reduced soil evaporation since soybean is more sensitive to gdd fig 3 the effects of gdd increase on soil evaporation reduction exceeded its effects on transpiration increase on the contrary the soil evaporation reduction was less than the transpiration increases for corn the eta of corn and soybean both increased slightly with the increase of hi and lai this is because the increase of hi reduced soil biomass coverage after harvest which enhanced soil evaporation the increase of lai increased plant transpiration and its effect was larger than the soil evaporation reduction effect caused by biomass increase nc was the most insensitive crop trait as eta remained nearly constant with variation of nc the ratios of simulated objective variables for watershed stream flow csrs tile flow and csrs surface runoff to their baseline values under different crop trait scenarios are plotted in fig 4 results showed that dt and lu were the most sensitive crop traits to watershed stream flow csrs tile flow and surface runoff with the 30 variation of crop traits stream flow varied about 2 this was very similar with eta except that the variation trend was the opposite fig 3 the csrs tile flow and surface runoff varied more significantly than stream flow with tile flow being the most sensitive objective variable to crop trait changes it indicated that crop improvements had more significant impacts on cropland hydrology especially on subsurface drainage overall effects of crop trait changes on flow were limited in the range between 4 and 5 hi was the most sensitive parameter to all nutrient loads in stream flow csrs tile flow and surface runoff fig 4 with the increase of hi nutrient loads decreased it was because the increase of hi increased the yield removal from fields and decreased crop residues which reduced the nutrients available to be carried away by water cui and yu 2005 huetsch and schubert 2017 nutrient loads were much more sensitive than water flow to crop trait changes this was especially true for the tile flow nutrients where nitrogen and phosphorus loads varied from 27 to 45 with the 30 crop trait changes the variations of tile flow nutrient loads were similar with that of crop yields in addition no3 n and soluble p which can be directly absorbed by crops were usually more sensitive than tn and tp this indicated that crop trait changes mainly affected subsurface nutrient losses through plant uptake and yield removal lu is the second most sensitive crop trait to the nutrient loads except surface runoff tn this may be because the impacts of lu change on surface runoff no3 n and organic n loads were opposite thus the final tn was neutralized with slight variation under the change of lu most of the nutrient loads declined with an increase of lu while the surface runoff no3 n slightly increased with an increase of lu this was because the increase of lu increased plant growth which extracted more nutrients from soil and reduced nutrient losses with water however since no3 n in the top 10 mm soil was first depleted by plant uptake the increased nutrient uptake had little effect on no3 n load in surface runoff meanwhile the increased surface runoff amount caused by lu increase may finally increase no3 n load fig 4 nitrogen no3 n and tn load variation under different crop trait changes in stream flow fell between that in csrs tile flow and surface runoff while the phosphorus soluble p and tp load variation in stream flow was obviously smaller than that in csrs tile flow and surface runoff this indicated that the stream flow nitrogen loads were primarily dominated by csrs tile flow and surface runoff while phosphorus loads were less affected by csrs ren et al 2022 even though dt is insensitive to most of the nutrient load sources tile soluble p and tp increased with an increase of dt this may be because phosphorus loads in tile flow were mainly contributed by soil crack flow since phosphorus is less mobile in soil williams et al 2016 an increase of dt would increase root water uptake and result in dryer and cracked soil enhancing phosphorus losses through crack flow crop traits are more sensitive to nutrient loads when they are lower than the baseline this was because constant fertilizer strategies were applied to the crop scenario simulations as a result the excessive nutrients in soil become smaller with enhanced crop traits and the reduction of nutrient losses decline 3 2 effects of historical crop scenario on water quantity and quality processes with the historical crop scenario table 1 the simulated average annual corn and soybean yields were respectively 6 68 and 2 33 t ha 1 which were exactly the projected yields in the 1980s fig 2 the 9 year average monthly and annual eta stream flow and nutrient loads changes compared with the baseline are summarized in table 2 results showed that the historical annual eta was 0 9 lower than the baseline value with eta during the growing season may to september slightly lower than the baseline value while that during the non growing season october to the next april was slightly higher than the baseline the monthly historical to baseline ratios h b of eta also showed this trend with values usually larger than 1 0 during the non growing season and lower than 1 0 during the growing season fig 5 this was because the historical crop traits resulted in smaller crop lai and shorter root depth which reduced plant transpiration during the growing season al kaisi et al 1989 however the reduced crop residue caused by the smaller plants resulted in higher soil evaporation van donk et al 2010 especially during the non growing season the largest gap between the historical and baseline eta during the growing season usually occurred in september when h b reached the lowest point between 0 91 and 0 96 each year fig 5 this was mainly caused by a decrease of gdd in the historical scenario which resulted in shorter growth period and early crop senescence the largest h b during the non growing season usually occurred in october and november just after crop harvest with the peak ratios ranging between 1 02 and 1 04 this was because the lower eta during the growing season resulted in a relatively wet soil after harvest in addition the reduced residue cover also enhanced soil evaporation during this time period the historical annual stream flow was about 2 0 larger than the baseline value table 2 the difference was mainly caused by the non growing season flow as the historical growing season flow was only 0 5 larger than the baseline while the non growing season flow was 2 9 larger this indicated that the influence of crop trait changes on stream flow mainly happened during the non growing season the maximum difference between the historical and baseline monthly flow usually occurred in the first significant rainfall after harvest with the peak h b reaching about 1 3 fig 5 thus crop trait changes had a significant lag effect on the hydrology the historical annual no3 n and tn loads were respectively 18 6 and 13 4 larger than the baseline values table 2 the monthly average nitrogen load changes showed two peaks respectively in july and october when the historical no3 n loads were more than 70 larger than the baseline and the tn loads were about 40 larger since nitrogen fertilizer was applied in june table s 1 the peak in july reflected the significant impacts of crop trait changes on nitrogen uptake similar with stream flow the peak in october was due to lag caused by crop changes historical no3 n loads can be three times the baseline value in certain months when the first significant rainfall occurred after crop harvest fig 5 the historical tn load changes were not as significant as no3 n but still reached an h b of 2 0 during this time period however due to the peak ratios usually occurring in the months with relatively lower absolute nitrogen loads their contribution to the finial annual changes was limited with the historical crop scenario soluble p and tp loads were respectively 3 8 and 3 9 higher than the baseline table 2 the monthly average phosphorus load changes were larger during the non growing season than the growing season and reached the maximum value just after harvest in october this is very similar with the changing pattern of stream flow except that the phosphorus load changes were larger the monthly variation showed that the historical crop scenario had similar effects on the soluble p and tp loads with the peak h b between 1 1 and 1 5 usually occurring after the first significant rainfall after harvest fig 5 3 3 effects of future crop scenario on water quantity and quality processes with the projected future crop trait parameters table 1 the swat simulated corn 12 53 t ha 1 and soybean 4 00 t ha 1 yields were both within 2 of the yield trend projections in the 2040s fig 2 this verified that a linear assumption for crop trait parameter changes would be reasonable when using swat as a tool to conduct this research under the future crop scenario eta mainly increased during the growing season especially the last month of the growing season in september table 2 it was because the increase of gdd increased the crop stay green period sacks and kucharik 2011 which resulted in an obvious higher eta in the late growing season the non growing season lower eta was caused by the higher aboveground biomass after harvest which reduced soil evaporation van donk et al 2010 the future monthly average stream flow was lower than the baseline value especially in october and november when reductions reached 9 2 and 6 5 respectively this again proved that the effects of crop trait changes on hydrology had a lag time future monthly average no3 n load was 4 3 to 31 5 lower than the baseline value with the maximum reduction occurring in july this was because the improved crop used more no3 n and reduced excess nitrogen in soil caused by the fertilizer application in june another significant no3 n reduction period was october and november just after crop harvest the trend of tn reduction was similar with no3 n except that the magnitude is a little lower similar with the change of stream flow future phosphorus load reductions mainly occurred during the non growing season especially october and november just after crop harvest it is worth mentioning that even though the monthly relative changes of nutrient loads in some months e g march april and may were not large their contributions to the annual changes may be very significant due to their higher baseline nutrient loads for future 2040s crop traits the annual eta increased about 0 7 annual stream flow no3 n tn soluble p and tp decreased 1 5 9 2 6 8 2 9 and 2 6 respectively compared with the baseline values table 2 these changes were smaller than the historical changes the monthly f b future to baseline ratios varied in the opposite direction of h b with the magnitude of changes lower than the historical one fig 5 this indicated that the future crop scenario had relatively less impact than the historical scenario since the degree of the 30 year crop trait changes for the future and historical scenarios were the same the reason was that the fixed baseline fertilizer amount was applied for both the historical and future scenario given actual fertilizer application usually increases with increased crop yields miflin 2000 the actual effects of crop improvements on water quantity and quality processes should fall between the results of historical and future scenarios 3 4 water quantity and quality in csrs the csrs was directly affected by crop improvements in the watershed annual eta of csrs decreased 1 8 with the historical crop scenario while it increased 1 4 with the future crop scenario the changes of the other four water balance components i e surface runoff lateral soil flow tile flow and percolation under historical and future crop traits ranged between 3 7 to 4 8 fig 6 since the above changes happened in the csrs they are usually larger than the water balance changes of the entire watershed table 2 being the two largest components in csrs ren et al 2022 surface runoff and tile flow contributed the main stream flow changes due to crop improvement the changes in nutrient loads in the four water balance components were usually larger than the corresponding water quantity changes the no3 n loads in surface runoff were least affected among the four water paths but still increased 7 5 for the historical scenario and decreased 4 8 for the future scenario the no3 n losses through lateral soil flow tile drainage and percolation increased by 24 7 26 4 and 36 5 for the historical scenario and decreased by 11 9 12 6 and 14 2 for the future scenario respectively since the baseline no3 n load in lateral soil flow was small the main causes of stream flow no3 n load change were tile flow and percolation fig 6 the impacts of historical and future crop scenarios on tn loads in the four water paths were similar with that of no3 n fig 6 surface runoff contributed the main loads and changes of phosphorus in the csrs which was contrary to nitrogen in surface runoff the historical soluble p load increased 10 8 and tp increased 10 6 compared with the baseline while the future soluble p load decreased 8 6 and tp decreased 7 1 tile flow was the second largest source contributing to phosphorus loads the soluble p and tp in tile flow increased 10 8 and 7 5 under the historical crop scenario and decreased 9 7 and 6 5 under the future crop scenario respectively 4 conclusions this study represents the first attempt to clarify the effects of crop improvements on hydrology and nutrient loads at large watershed scale results indicated that 1 crop improvements have more significant effects on nutrients than on water the recent 30 year crop improvements resulted in a 6 8 18 6 reduction of nitrogen loads no3 n and tn and 2 6 3 9 reduction of phosphorus loads soluble p and tp while only 0 7 0 9 increase of eta and 1 5 2 0 reduction of stream flow annually in an agricultural watershed with about 50 cropland in the u s corn belt 2 the effects of crop improvements had a lag time on stream water and nutrient processes the main reductions of stream flow and nutrient loads caused by crop improvement usually occurred during the non growing season from october to next april especially in the first significant rainfall after crop harvest e g october and november when the reductions for tn reached about 40 and stream flow and tp reached about 10 3 long term water quantity and quality studies should consider crop improvements crop growth models in the hydrologic water quality models should be improved for more holistically considering crop parameter changes with crop improvements in long term simulations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

16024,there is significant debate about why less than half of european rivers and streams are in good ecological status despite decades of intense regulatory efforts of the multiple stressors that are recognized as potential contributors to stream degradation we focus on discharge from 26 500 european wastewater treatment plants wwtps we tested the hypothesis that stream ecological status degradation across europe is related to the local intensity of wastewater discharge with an expected stream order ω dependence based on the scaling laws that govern receiving stream networks we found that ecological status in streams ω 3 declined consistently with increasing urban wastewater discharge fraction of stream flow udf across river types and basins in contrast ecological status in larger rivers ω 4 was not related to udf from a continental scale logistic regression model accuracy 86 we identified an ecologically critical threshold udf 6 5 0 5 this is exceeded by more than one third of

medium large large and geology siliceous calcareous or mixed organic and siliceous or combinations of these the aggregated river types are provided in si table 1 the process of deriving river types did not explicitly consider a strahler order therefore selected strahler orders from the existing eu hydro stream network see above were assigned to river types according to their size class description si table 1 the assignment caused an exclusion of 29 of the data because the broad river types were not reported for all european water bodies to obtain the working database the 5 data sets

effluent discharge qu and derived urban discharge fraction udf some rwbs are naturally excluded if there are no wwtps discharging to the rwb or within a radius of 5 km or if the wwtp discharges directly to the sea or ocean and not to the river network 2 2 data subsets catchments and ecoregions the hypotheses were tested for the total dataset and for subsets of 10 larger catchments and 12 river types si table 1 with aggregated data for a low flow situation qr10 the data were aggregated by ω in two classes smaller streams ω 3 and larger streams ω 3 and also by ω and ecological status again in two classes class 1 high and good class 2 less than good with this an assessment can be done either on the complete data set no aggregation or on the spatially aggregated data as the data have a catchment relation see methods above the hypothesis can also be tested for single catchments here we presented 10 catchments danube elbe loire oder garonne rhine rhone seine vistula weser with more than 200 data points each 2 3 statistical analysis the interquartile range and the median are used in the plots to illustrate the relationship between udf and ecological status and ecoregion we used the non parametric mann whitney test to assess if there are statistically significant differences between groups according to their ecological status mann and whitney 1947 the test compares the medians of different groups to determine if the samples come from the same population the medians of the five groups ecological status 1 5 high good moderate poor and bad within each subset were tested for a positive trend using the nonparametric mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 we fit a binomial logistic regression model to ecological status classified in two groups group 1 contains the good and high rwbs and group 2 contains the rwbs less than good we chose a threshold t50 as 50 probability of being in group 1 high or good the t10 and t90 related to 10 and 90 probability to be high or good were computed in an analogous way bootstrapping 1000 subsamples with sample size of 500 from the total dataset was used to determine confidence intervals the model performance was assessed using a classification table confusion matrix where the observed and predicted values for success segment has a good or high ecological status and not segment does not have good or high ecological status are compared accuracy precision sensitivity and specificity of the model are given peng et al 2002 all in a range between 0 and 100 with 100 being the perfect model accuracy is the fraction of model forecasts that are correct precision or positive predictive value is the fraction of segments forcasted to be in good or high ecological status that are observed like this sensitivity or hit rate or true positive rate is the fraction of the observed segments in good or high ecological status that were correctly forecast specificity or true negative rate answers the question how good the model identifies the segments with less than good ecological status note that there are many potential model performance indicators for assessing quality of logistic regression models peng et al 2002 pan european data for seven stressors were provided by lemm et al 2021 the data were downloaded from https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 4322819 these data are spatially organized by so called functional elementary catchments describing sub catchment units provided by european catchment and rivers network system eea 2012 the udf was spatially related to this data set to check for correlations between udf and the seven stressors the correlation was calculated as rank correlation spearman s rho udf was found not to be strongly correlated to any of the stressors in the multi stressor environment lemm et al 2021 si fig 2 si table 2 this finding supports the use of udf as an additional and independent stressor that can be interpreted as a quantitative and spatially distributed stream order dependent proxy for the intensity of wastewater related ecological impacts 2 4 estimating the share of river network under risk the risk for a river stretch within the presented framework is not to achieve at least a good ecological status due to udf a river stretch can be the whole waterbody wfd approach or a segment of the eu hydro river network in this study we used the segments of eu hydro the average segment length for streams ω 3 n 15 400 is 5 4 km the udf is a local approach which does not account for any accumulated upstream effects and therefore the length of the wwtp connected segment of eu hydro is taken for the risk assessment for a particular threshold tx the share of length of local stream segments to be in a good or high status is calculated as follows 1 select all wwtps with udf tx and ecological status of related segment is less than good and determine the number nbad 2 based on the probability x of the chosen threshold determine the number of segments that would change the status to high or good as n x nbad 3 then randomly select n segments from the nbad segments and calculate the sum of the length of n segments and add it to the length of the high or good segments divide by total length to get the percentage share the steps 1 to 3 were performed for tx 0 5 100 and x 0 5 2 5 determination the number of wwtps under risk a wwtp is defined to be under risk if the udf t where t is a specific threshold in this paper a general threshold t50 is derived from a binomial logistic regression model see above the number of wwtps with udf t for 0 5 t 100 was counted and plotted for a certain threshold the number of wwtps under risk can be directly obtained from the resulting table 2 6 software used all spatial operations were performed with python scripts based on arcgis version 10 8 statistics and access to the data import and export to and from database tables was organized by matlab r2021a all data

urban discharge fraction udf and ecological status across europe across all european streams strahler order ω 3 increasing pressure from wwtps based on median udf is associated with a consistent decline in ecological status fig 1 as of 2018 82 of the total length of european stream segments receiving wwtp effluent were in a less than good ecological status with median udf 11 si fig 3 the relationship is strongest for small streams ω 2 significant trend at p 0 05 si table 3 where the highest ecological status is associated with the lowest udf this pattern is also evident for small rivers ω 4 albeit in compressed form indicating a transition in the relative strength of the udf stressor as a driver of ecological status a significant difference was found between the ecological status groups high and good versus less than good i e moderate poor or bad for ω 4 p 0 001 si table 3 for rivers ω 4 the relationship completely disappears we therefore focus on streams ω 3 in the following sections 3 2 udf and ecological status by catchment and river type to evaluate whether these patterns are uniform across europe we separated the data by catchment and by river type si tables 4 and 5 within 7 of the 10 largest catchments in europe there was a significant relationship 0 027 p 0 089 between increasing median udf and declining ecological status of streams fig 2 when differentiated by river type a similar significant trend was observed for lowland mid altitude siliceous including organic and highland glacial small streams fig 2a c d e the trend was not significant for mid altitude calcareous including organic and mediterranean small streams fig 3b f however for all six river types streams with ecological status less than good had significantly higher p 0 05 median udf than those with status good or better si fig 4 a f a similar significant difference between the ecological status groups high and good versus less than good was found for 9 of the 10 catchments si table 5 consistent with the continental scale analysis of fig 1 no udf relation to ecological status was found for the large and very large river types 3 3 a threshold for udf related to good ecological status based on the statistically significant results we derived a udf maximum threshold t50 6 5 0 5 for streams ω 3 from a binomial logistic regression model indicating 50 probability of high or good status fig 4a b for the european wide dataset this model has an overall prediction accuracy of 86 si table 8 the consequence of this threshold is significant since nearly 60 of all segments in european streams currently exceed this value si fig 3 based on our model implementation of this threshold would more than double the share of stream segments in high or good status fig 4c increase from 18 to 38 thresholds with higher 90 or lower 10 probability of high or good status of t90 1 0 and t10 12 0 would result in 55 and 24 of the total length of stream segments in good or high status fig 4c how many european wwtps would be affected by interventions related to the suggested threshold of the 26 523 permitted european wwtps 9713 discharge to streams ω 3 at udf t50 6 5 fig 4d

percentage of wwtps of a given size that cause a risk for failing good ecological status increases with pe udf 6 5 r2 0 31 p 0 01 si fig 5b these facilities are distributed broadly throughout the eu with 76 of the wwtps with udf 6 5 both in terms of number and of total length of stream segments located in germany italy france spain poland and the uk si figs 6 7 the worst situation among these 6 countries in terms of percentage wwtps at risk was observed in spain where 92 of wwtps exceed t50 other eu countries where more than 80 of wwtps exceed t50 include bulgaria cyprus greece hungary netherlands and portugal 4 discussion 4 1 consistent udf proxy patterns our results demonstrate that across europe ecological degradation of streams ω 3 increases with udf despite multiple stressor contexts we found a surprisingly consistent pattern of declining ecological status with increasing udf for streams across geographically widely distributed river basins and river types the consistency of this finding irrespective of altitude geology and character of river basins suggests a broader relevance for small watercourses beyond europe for example in the united states approximately 23 of regulated effluent releases enter streams receiving less than 10 fold instream dilution and during low flow conditions this percentage increases to 60 brooks et al 2006 udf is a simple proxy that normalizes urban wastewater flows to catchment runoff however urban settlements cause an array of complex environmental changes in the water environment strokal et al 2021 due to paving of land surfaces elvidge et al 2007 stormwater runoff shuster et al 2005 alteration of flow paths and water balances mejía et al 2015 watercourse modifications and habitat loss mcdonald et al 2020 and discharges of municipal or industrial wastewater with complex chemical mixtures kümmerer et al 2018 posthuma et al 2019 including agricultural pesticides köck schulmeyer et al 2013 münze et al 2017 our indicator could be extended to account for more differentiated sets of urban pressures in order to disentangle the ecological impact hierarchy of the resulting stressors in a mechanistic context 4 2 options to make streams resilient our results suggest that the prevalence of policies that emphasize effluent discharge load limits without specific consideration of the discharge conditions of the receiving water body are failing to protect river ecosystems sufficiently according to our results wwtp discharges are harmful when exceeding safe boundaries of udf the 50 probability threshold of 6 5 at base flow conditions is surprisingly low this value can be considered as an upper limit of a safe operating space steffen et al 2015 for the load of treated wastewater to streams and therefore to the headwaters of running water networks but even a very strict 90 probability threshold of udf 1 at base flow would not ensure good ecological status for all streams our model predicts 55 of streams in good or better status at this threshold reinforcing the importance of considering the multiple pressure environment vigiak et al 2021 the vast majority 93 of cases exceeding this upper 50 probability threshold are streams of order three or lower for which a new approach is needed to set watercourse specific wastewater treatment requirements a forward looking approach would be to resilience the overall system of wastewater generation treatment and discharge with a system oriented approach including spatial optimization of the entry points of treated wastewater into the hydrological cycle and considering the ecological uptake capacity of receiving water bodies as proposed by weise et al 2020 for critical cases many options are available for avoiding or reversing the ecological deterioration of river networks caused by treated wastewater even after decades of investment in sewers and wastewater treatment infrastructure promising options include i enhancing pollution prevention larsen tove et al 2016 kümmerer et al 2018 ii spatial optimization and reallocation of discharge points statzner and sperling 1993 iii post processing of technically treated wastewater with nature based solutions nivala et al 2018 wwap un water 2018 oral et al 2020 iv safe re use of wastewater grant et al 2012 liu et al 2020 and v the restoration and protection of ecosystems wang et al 2018 trimmer et al 2019 such a strategy would also be crucial for countries in transition and many developing countries for example poorly treated wastewater has been linked to severe bacterial pollution in one third of all river kilometers in the river networks of south america africa and asia unep 2016 nevertheless the majority of reaches in the river networks of these continents are still in good water quality condition unep 2016 signaling a critical juncture for river systems in view of scenarios that assume a doubling of wastewater flows in the next three decades due to population growth alone un 2021 this growth will be accompanied by huge investments in infrastructure damania et al 2019 but preserving the still prevailing good ecological conditions and high biodiversity of the stream and river networks will require consideration of the ecologically safe operating spaces for treated wastewater and the uptake capacity of the receiving water bodies the results of this study can thus support steering future investments in the wastewater sector towards options that avoid or reverse the ecological deterioration of river networks caused by treated wastewater 5 conclusions wastewater treatment fails to protect stream ecosystems in europe for two main reasons first across catchments and ecoregions the entry points of treated wastewater into the hydrological cycle are not always at the spatially optimal position because the flow and thus dilution capacity of the receiving water bodies is insufficient compared to the amount of wastewater introduced into the stream network this problem is exacerbated under low flow conditions second a system oriented approach for the entire wastewater sector is missing such an approach should take into account the quantity and locations of wastewater generation treatment reuse and discharge throughout the river network wwtp effluents contribute to the degradation of ecological status depending on their position in stream networks we used udf as a proxy for the intensity of wastewater related ecological impacts and found that across all european streams stream order less than or equal to three increasing udf is associated with a consistent decline in ecological status the relationship was not found for rivers stream order greater than or equal to four the data were separated by catchments and river types and the relationship of decreasing ecological status with increasing udf was found to be significant 0 027 p 0 089 for streams in 7 out of the 10 largest catchments in europe as well as in four river types lowland siliceous including organic lowland calcareous or mixed mid altitude siliceous including organic and highland glacial small streams a maximum udf threshold t50 6 5 0 5 for streams ω 3 was derived from a binomial logistic regression model indicating 50 probability of high or good ecological status nearly 60 of stream segments affected by wwtp effluents currently exceed this threshold implementing the t50 threshold would more than double the share of stream segments in high or good ecological status the threshold could be considered as an upper limit for a safe operation space for udf in streams new strategies for wastewater management are necessary that combine an integrated view of wastewater generation treatment and wastewater reuse with direct

16024,there is significant debate about why less than half of european rivers and streams are in good ecological status despite decades of intense regulatory efforts of the multiple stressors that are recognized as potential contributors to stream degradation we focus on discharge from 26 500 european wastewater treatment plants wwtps we tested the hypothesis that stream ecological status degradation across europe is related to the local intensity of wastewater discharge with an expected stream order ω dependence based on the scaling laws that govern receiving stream networks we found that ecological status in streams ω 3 declined consistently with increasing urban wastewater discharge fraction of stream flow udf across river types and basins in contrast ecological status in larger rivers ω 4 was not related to udf from a continental scale logistic regression model accuracy 86 we identified an ecologically critical threshold udf 6 5 0 5 this is exceeded by more than one third of

basin district rbd by spatial intersect 6 combine national river basin districts to international catchments rhine danube or elbe are examples for international catchments whereas weser is an example for a national catchment we could thus relate the following attributes to each wwtp catchment ecological status and all other wfd attributes related to rwbs strahler order ω river discharge qr wwtp effluent discharge qu and derived urban discharge fraction udf some rwbs are naturally excluded if there are no wwtps discharging to the rwb or within a radius of 5 km or if the wwtp discharges directly to the sea or ocean and not to the river network 2 2 data subsets catchments and ecoregions the hypotheses were tested for the total dataset and for subsets of 10 larger catchments and 12 river types si table 1 with aggregated data for a low flow situation qr10 the data were aggregated by ω in two classes smaller streams ω 3 and larger streams ω 3 and also by ω and ecological status again in two classes class 1 high and good class 2 less than good with this an assessment can be done either on the complete data set no aggregation or on the spatially aggregated data as the data have a catchment relation see methods above the hypothesis can also be tested for single catchments here we presented 10 catchments danube elbe loire oder garonne rhine rhone seine vistula weser with more than 200 data points each 2 3 statistical analysis the interquartile range and the median are used in the plots to illustrate the relationship between udf and ecological status and ecoregion we used the non parametric mann whitney test to assess if there are statistically significant differences between groups according to their ecological status mann and whitney 1947 the test compares the medians of different groups to determine if the samples come from the same population the medians of the five groups ecological status 1 5 high good moderate poor and bad within each subset were tested for a positive trend using the nonparametric mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 we fit a binomial logistic regression model to ecological status classified in two groups group 1 contains the good and high rwbs and group 2 contains the rwbs less than good we chose a threshold t50 as 50 probability of being in group 1 high or good the t10 and t90 related to 10 and 90 probability to be high or good were computed in an analogous way bootstrapping 1000 subsamples with sample size of 500 from the total dataset was used to determine confidence intervals the model performance was assessed using a classification table confusion matrix where the observed and predicted values for success segment has a good or high ecological status and not segment does not have good or high ecological status are compared accuracy precision sensitivity and specificity of the model are given peng et al 2002 all in a range between 0 and 100 with 100 being the perfect model accuracy is the fraction of model forecasts that are correct precision or positive predictive value is the fraction of segments forcasted to be in good or high ecological status that are observed like this sensitivity or hit rate or true positive rate is the fraction of the observed segments in good or high ecological status that were correctly forecast specificity or true negative rate answers the question how good the model identifies the segments with less than good ecological status note that there are many potential model performance indicators for assessing quality of logistic regression models peng et al 2002 pan european data for seven stressors were provided by lemm et al 2021 the data were downloaded from https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 4322819 these data are spatially organized by so called functional elementary catchments describing sub catchment units provided by european catchment and rivers network system eea 2012 the udf was spatially related to this data set to check for correlations between udf and the seven stressors the correlation was calculated as rank correlation spearman s rho udf was found not to be strongly correlated to any of the stressors in the multi stressor environment lemm et al 2021 si fig 2 si table 2 this finding supports the use of udf as an additional and independent stressor that can be interpreted as a quantitative and spatially distributed stream order dependent proxy for the intensity of wastewater related ecological impacts 2 4 estimating the share of river network under risk the risk for a river stretch within the presented framework is not to achieve at least a good ecological status due to udf a river stretch can be the whole waterbody wfd approach or a segment of the eu hydro river network in this study we used the segments of eu hydro the average segment length for streams ω 3 n 15 400 is 5 4 km the udf is a local approach which does not account for any accumulated upstream effects and therefore the length of the wwtp connected segment of eu hydro is taken for the risk assessment for a particular threshold tx the share of length of local stream segments to be in a good or high status is calculated as follows 1 select all wwtps with udf tx and ecological status of related segment is less than good and determine the number nbad 2 based on the probability x of the chosen threshold determine the number of segments that would change the status to high or good as n x nbad 3 then randomly select n segments from the nbad segments and calculate the sum of the length of n segments and add it to the length of the high or good segments divide by total length to get the percentage share the steps 1 to 3 were performed for tx 0 5 100 and x 0 5 2 5 determination the number of wwtps under risk a wwtp is defined to be under risk if the udf t where t is a specific threshold in this paper a general threshold t50 is derived from a binomial logistic regression model see above the number of wwtps with udf t for 0 5 t 100 was counted and plotted for a certain threshold the number of wwtps under risk can be directly obtained from the resulting table 2 6 software used all spatial operations were performed with python scripts based on arcgis version 10 8 statistics and access to the data import and export to and from database tables was organized by matlab r2021a all data necessary for the analysis are stored in a relational database oracle 12c enterprise edition release 12 1 0 2 0 tables and data views were created using structured query language sql 3 results 3 1 urban discharge fraction udf and ecological status across europe across all european streams strahler order ω 3 increasing pressure from wwtps based on median udf is associated with a consistent decline in ecological status fig 1 as of 2018 82 of the total length of european stream segments receiving wwtp effluent were in a less than good ecological status with median udf 11 si fig 3 the relationship is strongest for small streams ω 2 significant trend at p 0 05 si table 3 where the highest ecological status is associated with the lowest udf this pattern is also evident for small rivers ω 4 albeit in compressed form indicating a transition in the relative strength of the udf stressor as a driver of ecological status a significant difference was found between the ecological status groups high and good versus less than good i e moderate poor or bad for ω 4 p 0 001 si table 3 for rivers ω 4 the relationship completely disappears we therefore focus on streams ω 3 in the following sections 3 2 udf and ecological status by catchment and river type to evaluate whether these patterns are uniform across europe we separated the data by catchment and by river type si tables 4 and 5 within 7 of the 10 largest catchments in europe there was a significant relationship 0 027 p 0 089 between increasing median udf and declining ecological status of streams fig 2 when differentiated by river type a similar significant trend was observed for lowland mid altitude siliceous including organic and highland glacial small streams fig 2a c d e the trend was not significant for mid altitude calcareous including organic and mediterranean small streams fig 3b f however for all six river types streams with ecological status less than good had significantly higher p 0 05 median udf than those with status good or better si fig 4 a f a similar significant difference between the ecological status groups high and good versus less than good was found for 9 of the 10 catchments si table 5 consistent with the continental scale analysis of fig 1 no udf relation to ecological status was found for the large and very large river types 3 3 a threshold for udf related to good ecological status based on the statistically significant results we derived a udf maximum threshold t50 6 5 0 5 for streams ω 3 from a binomial logistic regression model indicating 50 probability of high or good status fig 4a b for the european wide dataset this model has an overall prediction accuracy of 86 si table 8 the consequence of this threshold is significant since nearly 60 of all segments in european streams currently exceed this value si fig 3 based on our model implementation of this threshold would more than double the share of stream segments in high or good status fig 4c increase from 18 to 38 thresholds with higher 90 or lower 10 probability of high or good status of t90 1 0 and t10 12 0 would result in 55 and 24 of the total length of stream segments in good or high status fig 4c how many european wwtps would be affected by interventions related to the suggested threshold of the 26 523 permitted european wwtps 9713 discharge to streams ω 3 at udf t50 6 5 fig 4d the majority of these 63 are smaller wwtps size classes 1 3 population equivalent pe 10 000 but 3637 larger facilities of size class 4 or 5 pe 10 000 also exceed the t50 threshold fig 4d generally the percentage of wwtps of a given size that cause a risk for failing good ecological status increases with pe udf 6 5 r2 0 31 p 0 01 si fig 5b these facilities are distributed broadly throughout the eu with 76 of the wwtps with udf 6 5 both in terms of number and of total length of stream segments located in germany italy france spain poland and the uk si figs 6 7 the worst situation among these 6 countries in terms of percentage wwtps at risk was observed in spain where 92 of wwtps exceed t50 other eu countries where more than 80 of wwtps exceed t50 include bulgaria cyprus greece hungary netherlands and portugal 4 discussion 4 1 consistent udf proxy patterns our results demonstrate that across europe ecological degradation of streams ω 3 increases with udf despite multiple stressor contexts we found a surprisingly consistent pattern of declining ecological status with increasing udf for streams across geographically widely distributed river basins and river types the consistency of this finding irrespective of altitude geology and character of river basins suggests a broader relevance for small watercourses beyond europe for example in the united states approximately 23 of regulated effluent releases enter streams receiving less than 10 fold instream dilution and during low flow conditions this percentage increases to 60 brooks et al 2006 udf is a simple proxy that normalizes urban wastewater flows to catchment runoff however urban settlements cause an array of complex environmental changes in the water environment strokal et al 2021 due to paving of land surfaces elvidge et al 2007 stormwater runoff shuster et al 2005 alteration of flow paths and water balances mejía et al 2015 watercourse modifications and habitat loss mcdonald et al 2020 and discharges of municipal or industrial wastewater with complex chemical mixtures kümmerer et al 2018 posthuma et al 2019 including agricultural pesticides köck schulmeyer et al 2013 münze et al 2017 our indicator could be extended to account for more differentiated sets of urban pressures in order to disentangle the ecological impact hierarchy of the resulting stressors in a mechanistic context 4 2 options to make streams resilient our results suggest that the prevalence of policies that emphasize effluent discharge load limits without specific consideration of the discharge conditions of the receiving water body are failing to protect river ecosystems sufficiently according to our results wwtp discharges are harmful when exceeding safe boundaries of udf the 50 probability threshold of 6 5 at base flow conditions is surprisingly low this value can be considered as an upper limit of a safe operating space steffen et al 2015 for the load of treated wastewater to streams and therefore to the headwaters of running water networks but even a very strict 90 probability threshold of udf 1 at base flow would not ensure good ecological status for all streams our model predicts 55 of streams in good or better status at this threshold reinforcing the importance of considering the multiple pressure environment vigiak et al 2021 the vast majority 93 of cases exceeding this upper 50 probability threshold are streams of order three or lower for which a new approach is needed to set watercourse specific wastewater treatment requirements a forward looking approach would be to resilience the overall system of wastewater generation treatment and discharge with a system oriented approach including spatial optimization of the entry points of treated wastewater into the hydrological cycle and considering the ecological uptake capacity of receiving water bodies as proposed by weise et al 2020 for critical cases many options are available for avoiding or reversing the ecological deterioration of river networks caused by treated wastewater even after decades of investment in sewers and wastewater treatment infrastructure promising options include i enhancing pollution prevention larsen tove et al 2016 kümmerer et al 2018 ii spatial optimization and reallocation of discharge points statzner and sperling 1993 iii post processing of technically treated wastewater with nature based solutions nivala et al 2018 wwap un water 2018 oral et al 2020 iv safe re use of wastewater grant et al 2012 liu et al 2020 and v the restoration and protection of ecosystems wang et al 2018 trimmer et al 2019 such a strategy would also be crucial for countries in transition and many developing countries for example poorly treated wastewater has been linked to severe bacterial pollution in one third of all river kilometers in the river networks of south america africa and asia unep 2016 nevertheless the majority of reaches in the river networks of these continents are still in good water quality condition unep 2016 signaling a critical juncture for river systems in view of scenarios that assume a doubling of wastewater flows in the next three decades due to population growth alone un 2021 this growth will be accompanied by huge investments in infrastructure damania et al 2019 but preserving the still prevailing good ecological conditions and high biodiversity of the stream and river networks will require consideration of the ecologically safe operating spaces for treated wastewater and the uptake capacity of the receiving water bodies the results of this study can thus support steering future investments in the wastewater sector towards options that avoid or reverse the ecological deterioration of river networks caused by treated wastewater 5 conclusions wastewater treatment fails to protect stream ecosystems in europe for two main reasons first across catchments and ecoregions the entry points of treated wastewater into the hydrological cycle are not always at the spatially optimal position because the flow and thus dilution capacity of the receiving water bodies is insufficient compared to the amount of wastewater introduced into the stream network this problem is exacerbated under low flow conditions second a system oriented approach for the entire wastewater sector is missing such an approach should take into account the quantity and locations of wastewater generation treatment reuse and discharge throughout the river network wwtp effluents contribute to the degradation of ecological status depending on their position in stream networks we used udf as a proxy for the intensity of wastewater related ecological impacts and found that across all european streams stream order less than or equal to three increasing udf is associated with a consistent decline in ecological status the relationship was not found for rivers stream order greater than or equal to four the data were separated by catchments and river types and the relationship of decreasing ecological status with increasing udf was found to be significant 0 027 p 0 089 for streams in 7 out of the 10 largest catchments in europe as well as in four river types lowland siliceous including organic lowland calcareous or mixed mid altitude siliceous including organic and highland glacial small streams a maximum udf threshold t50 6 5 0 5 for streams ω 3 was derived from a binomial logistic regression model indicating 50 probability of high or good ecological status nearly 60 of stream segments affected by wwtp effluents currently exceed this threshold implementing the t50 threshold would more than double the share of stream segments in high or good ecological status the threshold could be considered as an upper limit for a safe operation space for udf in streams new strategies for wastewater management are necessary that combine an integrated view of wastewater generation treatment and wastewater reuse with direct
