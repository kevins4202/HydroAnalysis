1675,biodegradation of contaminants can increase the temperature in the subsurface due to heat generated from exothermic reactions making temperature observations a potentially low cost approach for determining microbial activity for this technique to gain more widespread acceptance it is necessary to better understand all the factors affecting the measured temperatures biodegradation has been occurring at a crude oil contaminated site near bemidji minnesota for 39 years creating a quasi steady state plume of contaminants and degradation products a model of subsurface heat generation and transport helps elucidate the contribution of microbial and infrastructure heating to observed temperature increases at this site we created a steady state two dimensional heat transport model using previous published parameter values for physical chemical and biodegradation properties simulated temperature distributions closely match the observed average annual temperatures measured in the contaminated area at the site within less than 0 2 c in the unsaturated zone and 0 4 c in the saturated zone the model results confirm that the observed subsurface heat from microbial activity is due primarily to methane oxidation in the unsaturated zone resulting in a 3 6 c increase in average annual temperature another important source of subsurface heat is from the active crude oil pipelines crossing the site the pipelines impact temperatures for a distance of 200 m and contribute half the heat model results show that not accounting for the heat from the pipelines leads to overestimating the degradation rates by a factor of 1 7 demonstrating the importance of identifying and quantifying all heat sources the model results also highlighted a zone where previously unknown microbial activity is occurring at the site graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbial degradation heat model crude oil temperature 1 introduction processes contributing to natural source zone depletion nszd of petroleum hydrocarbons were recently reviewed garg et al 2017 the review suggests additional approaches and improvement of current methods for evaluating nszd rates are needed for site assessments to predict contaminant persistence microbial degradation rates of contaminants can be measured using a variety of techniques weiss and cozzarelli 2008 because heat is produced during exothermic biodegradation reactions subsurface temperature changes can also be used as a proxy for microbial activity sweeney and ririe 2014 warren and bekins 2007 2015 estimation of microbial heat production at field sites can be complicated by lack of accessibility heat from land surface recharge and other sources heat transport by convection and conduction and variations in physical properties the itrc 2018 report summarizes existing publications on use of temperature for measuring nszd rates and characterize it as an emerging technology for this method to be more widely adopted it is necessary to develop conceptual models that include all the heat sources and heat transport mechanisms temperature models compared to independent measurements of degradation rates can be used to quantify and test understanding of the processes contributing to observed temperatures sweeney and ririe 2014 proposed the use of temperature measurements to estimate aerobic biodegradation rates of petroleum hydrocarbons they noted the importance of using average annual temperatures but did not test this concept by comparing the observed temperature with independent estimates of reaction rates warren and bekins 2015 compared field temperature measurements to independently determined reaction rates and noted the importance of accounting for all heat sources stockwell 2015 calculated biodegradation rates at five petroleum impacted locations using measured unsaturated zone temperatures and either measured or modeled background temperatures the results suggested that more information is needed about heat sources other than biodegradation and strategies for selecting appropriate background locations these studies indicate that using temperature differences to estimate biodegradation rates requires an approach that can distinguish the effect of microbial activity from other heat sources this paper describes the use of groundwater flow and heat transport modeling to understand the contributions of different heat sources at a well characterized crude oil contaminated site near bemidji minnesota this study expanded on the one dimensional analysis of warren and bekins 2015 with two dimensional modeling constrained by groundwater measurements spatially variable thermal conductivity and redox zones other than methane oxidation analyses made possible with this modeling approach include the relative heat contributions of different redox processes a comprehensive heat budget with the percentage contribution of the oil pipelines and illustration of the long distance transport of the pipeline heat this model uses published values for physical and chemical properties and recharge rates locations and reaction rates of microbially active zones in the model come from independently measured subsurface gas concentrations and biodegradation rates sihota et al 2016 estimated biodegradation rates using carbon dioxide efflux rates at the land surface and identified the areal extent of the methane oxidation zone in the unsaturated zone modeling by ng et al 2015 contributed the location and reaction rates of the iron reducing zone the degradation rates from both zones are converted to heating rates using reaction enthalpies the resulting model is used to describe heat transport and quantify the contribution of microbial activity towards total heat generated in the subsurface at the site the model distinguishes the heat contributions by each of the major microbial redox reactions and the pipelines that cross the site and describes the heat transport through the aquifer the temperature output is compared to measured site temperatures to confirm all known heat sources and identify previously unknown sources in addition we discuss the viability of using temperatures as a measure of biodegradation rates 2 site description the bemidji crude oil spill research site is located in a pine forest with wetlands and lakes 18 km northwest of bemidji minnesota the glacial outwash aquifer is part of the bemidji bagley outwash plain kanivetsky 1979 stark et al 1991 and consists primarily of moderately well sorted fine to medium grained sands and silts with some gravel the subsurface consists of a six to eight meter thick unsaturated zone and a 13 to 22 m thick aquifer over till six pipelines for transport of liquid hydrocarbons presently cross the site fig 1 in 1979 when only three pipelines were present one of them ruptured spilling about 1700 m3 of crude oil while much of the oil was removed about 25 remained and infiltrated into the subsurface forming three pools designated north middle and south pools monitored natural attenuation of the remaining contamination was initially accepted as a remedial strategy in 1986 the site was established by the u s geological survey as a long term study on the fate of crude oil contaminants in the environment essaid et al 2011 present a summary of study results from the site the site has been undergoing biodegradation for almost 40 years creating a plume of contaminants a microbial community has developed in the subsurface with both anaerobic and aerobic activity fig 2 baedecker et al 1993 beaver et al 2015 bekins et al 1999 methanogenic activity occurs in the residual crude oil source zone and at the center of the plume bekins et al 1999 iron reducing activity occurs downgradient of the methanogenic zone cozzarelli et al 2016 the aerobic activity primarily occurs in the methanotrophic unsaturated zone as methane from the degradation of crude oil constituents diffuses towards the land surface and mixes with downward diffusing atmospheric oxygen about half way between the water table and land surface amos et al 2005 essaid et al 2011 warren and bekins 2007 2015 found that heat from microbial biodegradation created a thermal plume with temperatures 2 9 c above background near the oil fig 3 temperatures were used to estimate methane oxidation rates which were comparable to rates from surface carbon dioxide efflux the results supported the feasibility of using subsurface temperatures to determine degradation rates but indicated that other heat sources including the pipelines and focused recharge at lower areas must be considered a secondary source of contamination and heating resulted from operation of an oil recovery system in 1999 2003 delin and herkelrath 2014 water and oil pumped from recovery wells installed in the three oil pools were processed in an oil water separator recovered oil was re injected into the pipelines while contaminated water was introduced in the unsaturated zone 2 to 3 m below land surface through a gravel bed infiltration gallery located 110 to 120 m upgradient from the center of the oil source zone fig 1 the gravel bed had a surface area of about 37 m2 3 temperature observations for this modeling study groundwater temperatures were measured at six hour intervals using data loggers installed in wells along a flowpath fig 1 circles the loggers were attached to fishing lines connected to a float that maintained the depths at 0 5 m and 4 0 m below water table previously published unsaturated zone temperature profiles were also used for the modeling these were measured hourly using temperature data loggers from july 2013 to august 2014 warren and bekins 2015 the temperature profiles extend from the surface to the water table 5 8 m depth at two active sites above the oil and two background sites fig 1 stars see warren and bekins 2015 for their locations and a more detailed description one background site bkgd 1 was located 200 m upgradient of the center of the source zone the other background site bkgd 2 was located 5 m downgradient from the pipelines to the northwest and well away from the oil source zone one active site oil 1 was located at the downgradient half of the oil source zone the other active site oil 2 was located 5 m downgradient from the pipelines previous studies showed that average temperatures of vertical profiles in the unsaturated zone are useful to understand trends at and among sites sweeney and ririe 2014 warren and bekins 2015 following that approach average annual temperatures were calculated for the period from 20 july 2013 to 19 july 2014 for both the groundwater and unsaturated zone to compare to the steady state model results in the unsaturated zone average annual temperatures at bkgd 1 were 6 7 c fig 4 temperatures at bkgd 2 which is 5 m downgradient from the pipelines peaked at 9 6 c showing the influence of the pipelines on the unsaturated zone temperatures the average annual unsaturated zone temperatures at two contaminated locations also showed the influence of the pipelines in the source zone oil 1 which is beyond the influence of the pipelines and thus comparable to bkgd 1 peaked at 9 4 c whereas oil 2 comparable to bkgd 2 peaked at 11 0 c 4 heat transport model formulation 4 1 model domain and flow model the approach for the modeling was adopted to achieve the objectives of isolating the heat sources and quantifying the microbial heating ground water flow and heat transport were simulated in two vertical cross sections fig 1 a a and b b using sutra v2 2 modified to allow for spatially variable thermal properties and density and viscosity variation with temperature voss and provost 2002 sutra was chosen as the best model to account for the different heat sources conductive and advective heat transport and variable thermal conductivity the pipeline background cross section fig 5a was oriented along the flow line passing through the bkgd 2 observation location and the contaminant plume cross section was oriented along the axis of the plume fig 5b the conceptual model includes heat sources from the pipelines biodegradation of hydrocarbons continental heat flow and fluid inflow fig 5b the main assumptions of the simulations are 1 steady state water flow with steady state recharge 2 an oil phase saturation distribution that does not change with time 3 spatially variable constant biodegradation rates and 4 spatially variable sediment thermal properties for simplicity the model input data consisted of average values for temperatures recharge permeability thermal conductivity water table gradient etc resulting in a steady state output enbridge energy limited partnership provided pipeline sizes locations and depths but pipeline temperatures are not measured with the actual pipeline temperature unavailable pipelines were assigned the same temperature and represented as constant temperature nodes temperatures were determined by changing the background model to find the optimal value that matched the measured temperatures at the two background sites due to differences in topography between the pipeline background and the contaminant plume transects separate models were created for each cross section the top boundary in each model is based on land elevations the background model vertical domain extends from 402 m to 433 4 m elevation and the horizontal domain from 260 m to 146 m with the long axis parallel to the flow direction and 0 m located at a corresponding position to the center of the oil source zone fig 5a in the vertical direction the node spacings are 1 67 m from the bottom boundary to 422 m elevation between 422 m and the top boundary the model has 22 elements with node spacings ranging from 0 4 m to 0 5 m depending on the topographic surface the horizontal node spacing is 1 m the contaminant model domain extends from 402 m to 433 5 m elevation vertically and from 260 m to 260 m horizontally with the long axis parallel to the flow direction and 0 m located at the center of the oil source zone fig 5b the vertical node spacing is 0 5 m below 425 m and 0 25 to 0 4 m spacing above 425 m with 20 elements the horizontal grid spacing is 1 m for both models the impermeable bottom boundary is placed deep enough so that heads are not influenced by it and is assigned constant heat flux of 0 03 w s 1 m 1 to account for the typical continental geothermal heating rate a constant head of 425 1 m is specified at the upgradient boundary based on water level measurements collected at the site the head at downgradient boundary is set to produce the average observed water table gradient of 0 0023 m m 1 water entering at the upgradient boundary has a specified temperature of 6 5 c the average temperature in the groundwater at bkgd 1 fig 3 the temperatures at the top boundaries of the models are influenced by the air temperatures and are set from average measured surface temperatures at bkgd 1 surface temperatures averaged over a year were 6 5 c and at oil 1 they were 6 1 c fig 4 thus 6 5 c was used upgradient of the pipelines and 6 1 c downgradient to match the observed surface temperatures over the pipelines and for 8 m on either side fig 5 the surface temperatures are set to 7 7 c and 7 8 c for the contaminant and background models based on measured temperatures at oil 2 and bkgd 2 respectively fig 4 the higher surface values over the pipelines are assumed to be caused by upward flow of heat from pipelines the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity are 1 and 0 04 m respectively essaid et al 2003 essaid et al 2003 found a linear groundwater velocity of 0 06 m d 1 corresponding to an estimated permeability of 1 1 10 11 m2 this value was based on a short tracer test conducted near the center of the oil source zone other researchers estimated groundwater velocities of 0 21 m d 1 corresponding to an estimated permeability of 3 9 10 11 m2 using pumping tests william herkelrath personal communication it is apparent from these results that the velocities vary in the aquifer to determine the effect of velocities on heat transport the model was run with saturated zone permeability values between 1 10 11 m2 and 2 2 10 10 m2 to give a range of groundwater velocities the contaminant model oil source zone is 1 2 m deep and 82 m long fig 5b approximating the location and size of the observed oil source zone within the oil source zone the permeability is reduced to 1 4 10 14 to 1 10 11 m2 this reduction accounts for the effect of oil saturations ranging from 30 to 60 and also entrapped methane bubbles amos et al 2005 the values for saturated zone permeability and pipeline temperature were calibrated by trial and error alternating between the contaminant and background model to minimize the root mean square deviations between the modeled and observed temperatures more of the temperature data were from groundwater wells along the contaminant model transect than the background transect fig 1a a thus the contaminant transect was initially used to optimize model groundwater permeability when the rmsd was minimized in the contaminant model the resultant permeability was used in the background model to calibrate the pipeline temperature the modeled pipeline temperature was calibrated using this permeability by comparing model results using different pipeline temperatures to the measured unsaturated zone temperature profile at bkgd 2 fig 1 finally since the contaminant model results are dependent on pipeline temperature groundwater permeability and pipeline temperature were changed iteratively until both models were optimized unsaturated flow is not modeled explicitly instead the unsaturated zone is replaced by a fully saturated zone with a porosity of 0 03 the vertical permeability of this zone is assigned a relatively high value of 2 10 9 m2 in order to match the observed velocity of a recharge pulse of about 6 m y 1 delin and herkelrath 2017 the horizontal permeability is set to a low value of 1 10 18 m2 to ensure that no horizontal flow occurs in the unsaturated zone bulk thermal conductivities were measured in a core taken at the site supplementary table 3 in warren and bekins 2015 and ranged from 0 37 to 2 00 w m 1 c 1 in the unsaturated zone the solid grain thermal conductivity in the saturated zone is set to 3 4 w m 1 c 1 based on the measured bulk thermal conductivity of 2 33 w m 1 c 1 water thermal conductivity of 0 58 w m 1 c 1 and porosity of 0 38 warren and bekins 2015 in the unsaturated zone thermal conductivity varies with moisture content with dryer conditions closer to the surface and wetter values near the water table the principle direction of heat flow is vertical which is perpendicular to the variations thus the geometric mean of unsaturated zone thermal conductivity κ was calculated using κ z σ z i κ i where z i is vertical distance and κ i is thermal conductivity the geometric mean value of 1 1 w m 1 c 1 is used for elevation from 1 5 m below land surface to the water table the difference in slope of the average annual temperatures at bkgd 2 indicates a thermal conductivity change near 430 m fig 4 since no thermal conductivity measurements are available above 430 m to find the thermal conductivity the ratio of the temperature gradient below 428 m to that above 430 m was multiplied by 1 1 w m 1 c 1 to obtain a value of 0 37 w m 1 c 1 for the top 1 5 m this lower value is indicative of drier sediments in the root zone although frost in winter extends to 0 5 to 1 m below land surface creating temporarily higher values the lower thermal conductivity best fits average annual temperatures this low value is likely because dry soil extends below 1 m and the geometric mean will be closer to the dry soil value solid grain specific heat is set to 795 j kg 1 c 1 carslaw and jaeger 1973 the model uses published average recharge rates of 5 5 10 6 m s 1 essaid et al 2003 similar recharge rates are used for hydrophobic and relatively non hydrophobic soils based the results of delin and herkelrath 2017 previous studies have found that the recharge rates in the lower elevation area near the pipelines and oil 2 fig 5b are 3 2 bekins et al 2005 or 1 15 delin and herkelrath 2017 times higher than elsewhere along the groundwater flow path the model was run keeping the recharge rates constant at the higher elevations however to gauge the influence of the recharge the model was run with lower elevation recharge values of 1 2 and 3 times the average values at the higher elevations in the final model we set the lower elevation recharge to twice the average recharge rate temperature results from the model were gridded using kriging with 1 m horizontal and 0 2 m vertical spacing and a linear variogram with a slope of 1 ratio of 1 and angle of 0 anisotropy was not used as it negatively influences contours drawn in the unsaturated zone where flow is vertical contour maps were created using surfer version 13 4 2 heat generation due to biodegradation the heat generation from microbial activity can be calculated from the rates and enthalpies of the degradation reactions at the bemidji site relevant reactions occur under aerobic iron reducing and methanogenic conditions fig 5 three model compounds are used as representatives of the degrading fractions in the oil and the groundwater plume most of the oil loss occurs under methanogenic conditions in the n alkane fraction baedecker et al 2011 so hexadecane is the model compound used to represent the degrading fraction in the oil source zone in the contaminant plume the important reduced carbon sources are the aromatics and the organic acids benzene represents the aromatic fraction because it is the most prevalent aromatic compound cozzarelli et al 2001 benzoate represents the organic acids because its redox state is similar to their average stoichiometry identified by thorn and aiken 1998 the enthalpy of each reaction is calculated using the molar enthalpies of formation table 1 of the products minus the reactants the calculations of enthalpy show that the methanogenic reactions yield a fraction of the heat compared to iron reducing and aerobic reactions table 2 thus we exclude methanogenic reactions in the groundwater in this model because the low concentrations and enthalpy of reaction would not contribute measurable heat heating rates in the unsaturated zone over the oil source zone are derived from published aerobic methane oxidation observations methane oxidation rates are determined using average observed carbon dioxide efflux at the land surface of 1 1 μmol m 2 s 1 sihota et al 2016 the efflux consists of carbon dioxide from methanogenic alkane degradation and aerobic methane oxidation adding the enthalpy of reactions per mole carbon 655 kj mol 1 and multiplying by the efflux gives the rate of heat generation warren and bekins 2015 the location of the unsaturated heating zone was determined from sihota and mayer 2015 and is shown in fig 5b the elevations of the reaction zones were set from the locations where methane and oxygen mix molins et al 2010 since the efflux changes along the transect the distribution of heating given in table 3 was allocated based on observations of sihota and mayer 2015 heating in the groundwater plume is estimated based on the modeling results of ng et al 2015 the iron reducing zone is placed in the same location as in their model fig 5b the heating rates are estimated using reactant loss table 4 over the length of the iron reducing zone 105 5 to 165 5 m with the modeled average groundwater velocity at an elevation of 420 5 m and porosity of 0 38 these values result in rates of 0 033 w m 3 5 results the root mean square deviations were lowest using a groundwater permeability of 1 6 10 10 m2 table 5 this permeability was used for the groundwater in the background and contaminant models resulting in a horizontal groundwater velocity of 0 67 m d 1 pipeline temperatures of 24 c in the model best matched the measured temperatures the unsaturated zone temperature profile at bkgd 1 was not affected by the pipeline temperatures due to its distance from the pipelines model profile temperatures at bkgd 1 were 0 4 c less than measured values for the top 2 5 m and within 0 2 c from this depth to the water table fig 6a at bkgd 2 temperatures were within 0 4 c within the top 2 m fig 6b below that depth the temperatures differed by no more than 0 2 c throughout the profile results from the contaminant model show that the thermal plume originates primarily in the unsaturated zone fig 7a model temperatures are more than 23 c in the unsaturated zone near the pipelines due to assigned values of 24 c at the pipeline model nodes near the water table temperatures drop to about 10 c in the unsaturated zone away from the pipelines 0 to 50 m but within the microbial heating zone temperatures reach a high of 10 8 c a groundwater thermal plume of more than 1 c above background extends downgradient to 170 m away from the center of the oil source zone in order to separate the effects of microbial heating and the pipelines the model was run with only the microbial heating fig 7b and with only the pipeline heating fig 7c the results of the model with only microbial activity show higher temperatures were found in the unsaturated zone with an increase up to 3 6 c the groundwater has temperature increases of up to 1 7 c near the water table within and near the modeled oil source zone the results of the model with the pipelines alone show that a half degree temperature increase extends 115 m downgradient at the water table and extends up into the unsaturated zone the results of the contaminant model unsaturated temperatures at site bkgd 1 closely match observed average annual temperatures similar to the results of the background model the model results at oil 2 exhibit a similar vertical temperature profile as measured at the site fig 8a the model temperature profile is within 0 3 c of the measured profile at oil 1 the model profile also closely parallels the measured profile within 0 2 c fig 8b the modeled groundwater temperatures were compared to measured average annual temperatures in wells at the site the results of the modeled and measured average annual temperatures are plotted in fig 9a and b the modeled temperatures at 0 5 m below the water table start at 6 5 c at 200 m from the center of the oil source zone temperatures increase to a high of 9 9 c at 24 m oil 2 then steadily decrease to 7 4 c at 212 m fig 9a the measured average annual temperatures similarly increase over the oil source zone and pipelines then decrease downgradient a similar trend is found at 4 0 m below the water table but with lower peak temperatures fig 9b the biggest deviation between the modeled and measured temperatures in the groundwater occurs at 100 m from the center of the oil source zone at 0 5 m below the water table the modeled temperature at this location is 0 8 c less than the measured temperature varying the recharge from 5 5 10 6 m s 1 to 1 65 10 5 m s 1 in the lower elevation portion of the site 84 m to 12 m in fig 5b relative to the rest of the model had little effect on the model temperature at 0 5 m below water table the greatest temperature difference over the range of recharge values was 0 3 c at 29 m the model temperatures at 0 5 m below water table with and without pipeline and microbial heating are shown in fig 10 temperatures increase to a peak of 4 2 c above background near the lowest pipeline then decrease to 0 9 c at 200 m the model run without microbial heating shows a similar trend subtracting the two model runs yields the effect of the heat from biodegradation on the temperature plume temperatures from microbial activity increase to 1 7 c above background at 0 m and decrease to 0 45 c at 200 m the figure illustrates that half the temperature increase at 200 m is due to the pipeline heating alone the total energy gained in the model is 1481 w and comes from four sources fig 5b microbial activity pipelines continental heat flow and fluids table 6 the total energy generated by microbial activity is 143 w with 139 w from methane oxidation and 3 9 w from iron reduction by comparison the energy input with the pipelines set to a steady state temperature of 24 c is 146 w continental heat flow contributes 16 w the fluid sources including specified pressure nodes and model surface recharge and conduction contribute 1176 w these energy inputs are balanced by heat leaving the system through downgradient fluid outflows and specified temperature nodes at the model surface 6 discussion the model developed in this study enables us to analyze the sources and movement of heat as well as other contributing factors to temperature changes in the system the sources of heat are primarily from microbial reactions and the pipelines with these two sources being about equal of the microbial energy 97 is from methane oxidation in the unsaturated zone table 6 the iron reducing reactions in the groundwater do not contribute significantly to the thermal plume for two reasons first the enthalpy of methane oxidation coupled to iron reduction is 64 of the aerobic value table 2 further more carbon is oxidized in the unsaturated zone than in the iron reducing zone tables 3 and 4 the two factors lead to the large differences in heating amounts the biggest difference between the modeled and measured temperatures in the groundwater occurs at 100 m upgradient from the center of the oil source zone at 0 5 m below the water table the modeled temperature is 0 8 c less than the measured temperature this area is near an infiltration gallery used from 1999 to 2003 delin and herkelrath 2014 to dispose of contaminated water that was withdrawn from oil recovery wells and run through an oil water separator delin and herkelrath 2014 expected that water soluble contaminants would have been fully degraded by 2007 and the groundwater would remain anoxic at least until july 2009 if only contaminated groundwater was injected into the unsaturated zone however in 2017 augering at 112 m upgradient fig 1 revealed oil under a confining plastic sheet about 3 m below land surface the presence of separate phase oil in the infiltration gallery can provide a long term source of reduced carbon in this area although higher carbon dioxide efflux at the surface was not found in the area sihota and mayer 2015 presumably due to the confining plastic sheet higher measured temperatures indicate significant microbial degradation is occurring using the carbon dioxide efflux method sihota et al 2016 found the average annual contaminant degradation rate was 1 1 μmol c m 2 s 1 at the bemidji site using their efflux in the steady state model simulation resulted in 139 w from methanotrophic activity table 6 using average elemental content of the oil of 83 5 carbon baedecker et al 2017 this results in 0 43 kg oil m 2 yr 1 with a density of 0 840 kg l 1 baedecker et al 2017 the degradation rate of the oil is 0 51 l m 2 yr 1 550 gal acre 1 yr 1 a careful viewing of the unsaturated zone temperature profile shows that the thermal conductivity varies with depth the profile with a heat source such as pipelines or microbial activity in the middle of the unsaturated zone and a constant conductivity would have a smooth curve from land surface to water table with the highest temperature at the heat source location however at bkgd 2 oil 1 and oil 2 the slope changes within 1 0 m from land surface indicating an increase in thermal conductivity with depth since thermal conductivity is dependent on water content it is likely that the conductivity increases due to increased water content below the root zone measured temperatures are dependent on the accuracy of the temperature data loggers in this case the loggers have an accuracy of 0 21 c onset computer corporation the average difference between groundwater temperatures and modeled temperatures excluding the location at 100 m is 0 05 c this value is well within the accuracy of the data loggers we modeled all pipeline temperatures as constant temperature at the site this assumption may not necessarily be the case the company that operates the pipelines enbridge energy limited partnership does not measure temperatures of the oil in the pipelines at the research site thus there is no record of the changes in the oil temperature with time or within each pipeline knowing the temperatures of the pipelines is particularly important if temperatures vary among the pipelines despite these discrepancies the model simulates the temperatures rather well the biggest differences occur in the unsaturated zone a different unsaturated zone model or better parameter estimation may provide a closer fit regardless of whether the temperatures of the individual pipelines differ the total heat produced by all of them is constrained by the observed temperatures at the water table at bkgd 2 thus our conclusion that the pipeline heat is a large fraction of the heat budget is not affected by variations in the pipeline temperatures the model distinguishes the pipeline and biological heat sources that cause the thermal plume and provides estimates of each heat from microbial degradation comprises 51 of the heat from the two sources of the microbial heat methane oxidation in the unsaturated zone accounts for by far the most heat the transport of the heat in the unsaturated zone is dominated by conduction as shown by the insensitivity of the thermal plume to changes in recharge rates further the model results using a range of groundwater velocities show that transport is dominated by advection once the heat moves into the groundwater modeling the site requires accounting for sources of heat from infrastructure the six active pipelines crossing the site the other major source of heat presented a challenge for the model they contribute 46 of the heat and create their own thermal plume thus the model shows that the site infrastructure can contribute significantly to the heat budget and if not considered can lead to overestimation of degradation rates by a factor of 1 7 in other words increasing the microbial activity in the unsaturated zone by 1 7 times leads to a similar profile rates calculated from a bemidji site model that does not include pipeline heat and match groundwater temperature profiles will be 70 higher than actual rates other contaminated sites including refineries and fuel depots also have complex infrastructure our results show the heat effects of the infrastructure extend for a distance of 200 m downgradient and must be included in the heat budget to allow degradation rates to be calculated from field temperatures heat sources associated with active remediation such as bioventing soil vapor extraction and air sparging will add or remove heat in ways that would be difficult to track in addition methane may be stripped or otherwise removed from the system decreasing the amount of heat generated due to the multiple conflicting heat sources and flow temperature measurements might not be helpful in determining biodegradation rates associated with these remediation methods the steady state model successfully matches the measured average annual temperatures due to significant heat generation in the unsaturated zone high heating rates require reactions with high enthalpy coupled to large fluxes of reactants to the reaction zone at the bemidji site methane from methanogenic degradation of oil mixes with atmospheric oxygen in the unsaturated zone without the high fluxes and exothermic reactions not enough heat would be generated to create measurable temperature increases above background an active heat producing zone is essential to derive degradation rates at the bemidji site the dominant microbial heat source is due to aerobic methane oxidation it remains an open question whether sites with other redox reactions may produce sufficient heat surface temperatures at the bemidji site can vary by more than 40 c over a year temperatures in the subsurface are significantly attenuated but still vary this steady state model uses average parameter values microbial activity rates pipeline temperatures recharge rates and temperatures pressures hydraulic gradient etc and works well when comparing the model results to measured average annual temperatures a transient model presents difficulties matching temperatures under varying conditions that occur between seasons or over years and decades required for complete biodegradation of the contaminant source zone further due to the diurnal temperature fluctuations measurements observed at any one time may not be sufficient to calculate a reasonable microbial degradation rate that can be applied to the site over space and time 7 summary new techniques are needed to predict biodegradation rates of contaminants in the subsurface to understand fate and transport due to the relationship between reaction rates and heat generation the measurement of temperatures may be a useful method however to calculate the microbial activity at a contaminated site all sources of heat including site infrastructure must be quantified a two dimensional steady state unsaturated zone groundwater flow model with heat generation and transport of the bemidji crude oil research site was constructed to better understand the challenges associated with using temperature measurements at field sites to calculate microbial activity the approach expanded on previous research to produce a comprehensive heat budget and modeled long distance transport of the heat the model provided insight into the relative importance of heat from microbial degradation and oil pipelines in creation of a thermal plume the simulated results are comparable to temperatures measured in the unsaturated and saturated zones biodegradation of oil contaminants primarily from methanogenesis followed by methane oxidation leads to a temperature increase of 3 6 c in the unsaturated zone and 1 7 c in the ground water the model showed that about half of the heat originates from the microbial activity and half from the pipelines highlighting the importance of accounting for both biodegradation and infrastructure heat sources the model results led to the discovery of microbial activity in an area previously not know as an oil source zone located 100 m upgradient from the middle of the source

1675,biodegradation of contaminants can increase the temperature in the subsurface due to heat generated from exothermic reactions making temperature observations a potentially low cost approach for determining microbial activity for this technique to gain more widespread acceptance it is necessary to better understand all the factors affecting the measured temperatures biodegradation has been occurring at a crude oil contaminated site near bemidji minnesota for 39 years creating a quasi steady state plume of contaminants and degradation products a model of subsurface heat generation and transport helps elucidate the contribution of microbial and infrastructure heating to observed temperature increases at this site we created a steady state two dimensional heat transport model using previous published parameter values for physical chemical and biodegradation properties simulated temperature distributions closely match the observed average annual temperatures measured in the contaminated area at the site within less than 0 2 c in the unsaturated zone and 0 4 c in the saturated zone the model results confirm that the observed subsurface heat from microbial activity is due primarily to methane oxidation in the unsaturated zone resulting in a 3 6 c increase in average annual temperature another important source of subsurface heat is from the active crude oil pipelines crossing the site the pipelines impact temperatures for a distance of 200 m and contribute half the heat model results show that not accounting for the heat from the pipelines leads to overestimating the degradation rates by a factor of 1 7 demonstrating the importance of identifying and quantifying all heat sources the model results also highlighted a zone where previously unknown microbial activity is occurring at the site graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbial degradation heat model crude oil temperature 1 introduction processes contributing to natural source zone depletion nszd of petroleum hydrocarbons were recently reviewed garg et al 2017 the review suggests additional approaches and improvement of current methods for evaluating nszd rates are needed for site assessments to predict contaminant persistence microbial degradation rates of contaminants can be measured using a variety of techniques weiss and cozzarelli 2008 because heat is produced during exothermic biodegradation reactions subsurface temperature changes can also be used as a proxy for microbial activity sweeney and ririe 2014 warren and bekins 2007 2015 estimation of microbial heat production at field sites can be complicated by lack of accessibility heat from land surface recharge and other sources heat transport by convection and conduction and variations in physical properties the itrc 2018 report summarizes existing publications on use of temperature for measuring nszd rates and characterize it as an emerging technology for this method to be more widely adopted it is necessary to develop conceptual models that include all the heat sources and heat transport mechanisms temperature models compared to independent measurements of degradation rates can be used to quantify and test understanding of the processes contributing to observed temperatures sweeney and ririe 2014 proposed the use of temperature measurements to estimate aerobic biodegradation rates of petroleum hydrocarbons they noted the importance of using average annual temperatures but did not test this concept by comparing the observed temperature with independent estimates of reaction rates warren and bekins 2015 compared field temperature measurements to independently determined reaction rates and noted the importance of accounting for all heat sources stockwell 2015 calculated biodegradation rates at five petroleum impacted locations using measured unsaturated zone temperatures and either measured or modeled background temperatures the results suggested that more information is needed about heat sources other than biodegradation and strategies for selecting appropriate background locations these studies indicate that using temperature differences to estimate biodegradation rates requires an approach that can distinguish the effect of microbial activity from other heat sources this paper describes the use of groundwater flow and heat transport modeling to understand the contributions of different heat sources at a well characterized crude oil contaminated site near bemidji minnesota this study expanded on the one dimensional analysis of warren and bekins 2015 with two dimensional modeling constrained by groundwater measurements spatially variable thermal conductivity and redox zones other than methane oxidation analyses made possible with this modeling approach include the relative heat contributions of different redox processes a comprehensive heat budget with the percentage contribution of the oil pipelines and illustration of the long distance transport of the pipeline heat this model uses published values for physical and chemical properties and recharge rates locations and reaction rates of microbially active zones in the model come from independently measured subsurface gas concentrations and biodegradation rates sihota et al 2016 estimated biodegradation rates using carbon dioxide efflux rates at the land surface and identified the areal extent of the methane oxidation zone in the unsaturated zone modeling by ng et al 2015 contributed the location and reaction rates of the iron reducing zone the degradation rates from both zones are converted to heating rates using reaction enthalpies the resulting model is used to describe heat transport and quantify the contribution of microbial activity towards total heat generated in the subsurface at the site the model distinguishes the heat contributions by each of the major microbial redox reactions and the pipelines that cross the site and describes the heat transport through the aquifer the temperature output is compared to measured site temperatures to confirm all known heat sources and identify previously unknown sources in addition we discuss the viability of using temperatures as a measure of biodegradation rates 2 site description the bemidji crude oil spill research site is located in a pine forest with wetlands and lakes 18 km northwest of bemidji minnesota the glacial outwash aquifer is part of the bemidji bagley outwash plain kanivetsky 1979 stark et al 1991 and consists primarily of moderately well sorted fine to medium grained sands and silts with some gravel the subsurface consists of a six to eight meter thick unsaturated zone and a 13 to 22 m thick aquifer over till six pipelines for transport of liquid hydrocarbons presently cross the site fig 1 in 1979 when only three pipelines were present one of them ruptured spilling about 1700 m3 of crude oil while much of the oil was removed about 25 remained and infiltrated into the subsurface forming three pools designated north middle and south pools monitored natural attenuation of the remaining contamination was initially accepted as a remedial strategy in 1986 the site was established by the u s geological survey as a long term study on the fate of crude oil contaminants in the environment essaid et al 2011 present a summary of study results from the site the site has been undergoing biodegradation for almost 40 years creating a plume of contaminants a microbial community has developed in the subsurface with both anaerobic and aerobic activity fig 2 baedecker et al 1993 beaver et al 2015 bekins et al 1999 methanogenic activity occurs in the residual crude oil source zone and at the center of the plume bekins et al 1999 iron reducing activity occurs downgradient of the methanogenic zone cozzarelli et al 2016 the aerobic activity primarily occurs in the methanotrophic unsaturated zone as methane from the degradation of crude oil constituents diffuses towards the land surface and mixes with downward diffusing atmospheric oxygen about half way between the water table and land surface amos et al 2005 essaid et al 2011 warren and bekins 2007 2015 found that heat from microbial biodegradation created a thermal plume with temperatures 2 9 c above background near the oil fig 3 temperatures were used to estimate methane oxidation rates which were comparable to rates from surface carbon dioxide efflux the results supported the feasibility of using subsurface temperatures to determine degradation rates but indicated that other heat sources including the pipelines and focused recharge at lower areas must be considered a secondary source of contamination and heating resulted from operation of an oil recovery system in 1999 2003 delin and herkelrath 2014 water and oil pumped from recovery wells installed in the three oil pools were processed in an oil water separator recovered oil was re injected into the pipelines while contaminated water was introduced in the unsaturated zone 2 to 3 m below land surface through a gravel bed infiltration gallery located 110 to 120 m upgradient from the center of the oil source zone fig 1 the gravel bed had a surface area of about 37 m2 3 temperature observations for this modeling study groundwater temperatures were measured at six hour intervals using data loggers installed in wells along a flowpath fig 1 circles the loggers were attached to fishing lines connected to a float that maintained the depths at 0 5 m and 4 0 m below water table previously published unsaturated zone temperature profiles were also used for the modeling these were measured hourly using temperature data loggers from july 2013 to august 2014 warren and bekins 2015 the temperature profiles extend from the surface to the water table 5 8 m depth at two active sites above the oil and two background sites fig 1 stars see warren and bekins 2015 for their locations and a more detailed description one background site bkgd 1 was located 200 m upgradient of the center of the source zone the other background site bkgd 2 was located 5 m downgradient from the pipelines to the northwest and well away from the oil source zone one active site oil 1 was located at the downgradient half of the oil source zone the other active site oil 2 was located 5 m downgradient from the pipelines previous studies showed that average temperatures of vertical profiles in the unsaturated zone are useful to understand trends at and among sites sweeney and ririe 2014 warren and bekins 2015 following that approach average annual temperatures were calculated for the period from 20 july 2013 to 19 july 2014 for both the groundwater and unsaturated zone to compare to the steady state model results in the unsaturated zone average annual temperatures at bkgd 1 were 6 7 c fig 4 temperatures at bkgd 2 which is 5 m downgradient from the pipelines peaked at 9 6 c showing the influence of the pipelines on the unsaturated zone temperatures the average annual unsaturated zone temperatures at two contaminated locations also showed the influence of the pipelines in the source zone oil 1 which is beyond the influence of the pipelines and thus comparable to bkgd 1 peaked at 9 4 c whereas oil 2 comparable to bkgd 2 peaked at 11 0 c 4 heat transport model formulation 4 1 model domain and flow model the approach for the modeling was adopted to achieve the objectives of isolating the heat sources and quantifying the microbial heating ground water flow and heat transport were simulated in two vertical cross sections fig 1 a a and b b using sutra v2 2 modified to allow for spatially variable thermal properties and density and viscosity variation with temperature voss and provost 2002 sutra was chosen as the best model to account for the different heat sources conductive and advective heat transport and variable thermal conductivity the pipeline background cross section fig 5a was oriented along the flow line passing through the bkgd 2 observation location and the contaminant plume cross section was oriented along the axis of the plume fig 5b the conceptual model includes heat sources from the pipelines biodegradation of hydrocarbons continental heat flow and fluid inflow fig 5b the main assumptions of the simulations are 1 steady state water flow with steady state recharge 2 an oil phase saturation distribution that does not change with time 3 spatially variable constant biodegradation rates and 4 spatially variable sediment thermal properties for simplicity the model input data consisted of average values for temperatures recharge permeability thermal conductivity water table gradient etc resulting in a steady state output enbridge energy limited partnership provided pipeline sizes locations and depths but pipeline temperatures are not measured with the actual pipeline temperature unavailable pipelines were assigned the same temperature and represented as constant temperature nodes temperatures were determined by changing the background model to find the optimal value that matched the measured temperatures at the two background sites due to differences in topography between the pipeline background and the contaminant plume transects separate models were created for each cross section the top boundary in each model is based on land elevations the background model vertical domain extends from 402 m to 433 4 m elevation and the horizontal domain from 260 m to 146 m with the long axis parallel to the flow direction and 0 m located at a corresponding position to the center of the oil source zone fig 5a in the vertical direction the node spacings are 1 67 m from the bottom boundary to 422 m elevation between 422 m and the top boundary the model has 22 elements with node spacings ranging from 0 4 m to 0 5 m depending on the topographic surface the horizontal node spacing is 1 m the contaminant model domain extends from 402 m to 433 5 m elevation vertically and from 260 m to 260 m horizontally with the long axis parallel to the flow direction and 0 m located at the center of the oil source zone fig 5b the vertical node spacing is 0 5 m below 425 m and 0 25 to 0 4 m spacing above 425 m with 20 elements the horizontal grid spacing is 1 m for both models the impermeable bottom boundary is placed deep enough so that heads are not influenced by it and is assigned constant heat flux of 0 03 w s 1 m 1 to account for the typical continental geothermal heating rate a constant head of 425 1 m is specified at the upgradient boundary based on water level measurements collected at the site the head at downgradient boundary is set to produce the average observed water table gradient of 0 0023 m m 1 water entering at the upgradient boundary has a specified temperature of 6 5 c the average temperature in the groundwater at bkgd 1 fig 3 the temperatures at the top boundaries of the models are influenced by the air temperatures and are set from average measured surface temperatures at bkgd 1 surface temperatures averaged over a year were 6 5 c and at oil 1 they were 6 1 c fig 4 thus 6 5 c was used upgradient of the pipelines and 6 1 c downgradient to match the observed surface temperatures over the pipelines and for 8 m on either side fig 5 the surface temperatures are set to 7 7 c and 7 8 c for the contaminant and background models based on measured temperatures at oil 2 and bkgd 2 respectively fig 4 the higher surface values over the pipelines are assumed to be caused by upward flow of heat from pipelines the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity are 1 and 0 04 m respectively essaid et al 2003 essaid et al 2003 found a linear groundwater velocity of 0 06 m d 1 corresponding to an estimated permeability of 1 1 10 11 m2 this value was based on a short tracer test conducted near the center of the oil source zone other researchers estimated groundwater velocities of 0 21 m d 1 corresponding to an estimated permeability of 3 9 10 11 m2 using pumping tests william herkelrath personal communication it is apparent from these results that the velocities vary in the aquifer to determine the effect of velocities on heat transport the model was run with saturated zone permeability values between 1 10 11 m2 and 2 2 10 10 m2 to give a range of groundwater velocities the contaminant model oil source zone is 1 2 m deep and 82 m long fig 5b approximating the location and size of the observed oil source zone within the oil source zone the permeability is reduced to 1 4 10 14 to 1 10 11 m2 this reduction accounts for the effect of oil saturations ranging from 30 to 60 and also entrapped methane bubbles amos et al 2005 the values for saturated zone permeability and pipeline temperature were calibrated by trial and error alternating between the contaminant and background model to minimize the root mean square deviations between the modeled and observed temperatures more of the temperature data were from groundwater wells along the contaminant model transect than the background transect fig 1a a thus the contaminant transect was initially used to optimize model groundwater permeability when the rmsd was minimized in the contaminant model the resultant permeability was used in the background model to calibrate the pipeline temperature the modeled pipeline temperature was calibrated using this permeability by comparing model results using different pipeline temperatures to the measured unsaturated zone temperature profile at bkgd 2 fig 1 finally since the contaminant model results are dependent on pipeline temperature groundwater permeability and pipeline temperature were changed iteratively until both models were optimized unsaturated flow is not modeled explicitly instead the unsaturated zone is replaced by a fully saturated zone with a porosity of 0 03 the vertical permeability of this zone is assigned a relatively high value of 2 10 9 m2 in order to match the observed velocity of a recharge pulse of about 6 m y 1 delin and herkelrath 2017 the horizontal permeability is set to a low value of 1 10 18 m2 to ensure that no horizontal flow occurs in the unsaturated zone bulk thermal conductivities were measured in a core taken at the site supplementary table 3 in warren and bekins 2015 and ranged from 0 37 to 2 00 w m 1 c 1 in the unsaturated zone the solid grain thermal conductivity in the saturated zone is set to 3 4 w m 1 c 1 based on the measured bulk thermal conductivity of 2 33 w m 1 c 1 water thermal conductivity of 0 58 w m 1 c 1 and porosity of 0 38 warren and bekins 2015 in the unsaturated zone thermal conductivity varies with moisture content with dryer conditions closer to the surface and wetter values near the water table the principle direction of heat flow is vertical which is perpendicular to the variations thus the geometric mean of unsaturated zone thermal conductivity κ was calculated using κ z σ z i κ i where z i is vertical distance and κ i is thermal conductivity the geometric mean value of 1 1 w m 1 c 1 is used for elevation from 1 5 m below land surface to the water table the difference in slope of the average annual temperatures at bkgd 2 indicates a thermal conductivity change near 430 m fig 4 since no thermal conductivity measurements are available above 430 m to find the thermal conductivity the ratio of the temperature gradient below 428 m to that above 430 m was multiplied by 1 1 w m 1 c 1 to obtain a value of 0 37 w m 1 c 1 for the top 1 5 m this lower value is indicative of drier sediments in the root zone although frost in winter extends to 0 5 to 1 m below land surface creating temporarily higher values the lower thermal conductivity best fits average annual temperatures this low value is likely because dry soil extends below 1 m and the geometric mean will be closer to the dry soil value solid grain specific heat is set to 795 j kg 1 c 1 carslaw and jaeger 1973 the model uses published average recharge rates of 5 5 10 6 m s 1 essaid et al 2003 similar recharge rates are used for hydrophobic and relatively non hydrophobic soils based the results of delin and herkelrath 2017 previous studies have found that the recharge rates in the lower elevation area near the pipelines and oil 2 fig 5b are 3 2 bekins et al 2005 or 1 15 delin and herkelrath 2017 times higher than elsewhere along the groundwater flow path the model was run keeping the recharge rates constant at the higher elevations however to gauge the influence of the recharge the model was run with lower elevation recharge values of 1 2 and 3 times the average values at the higher elevations in the final model we set the lower elevation recharge to twice the average recharge rate temperature results from the model were gridded using kriging with 1 m horizontal and 0 2 m vertical spacing and a linear variogram with a slope of 1 ratio of 1 and angle of 0 anisotropy was not used as it negatively influences contours drawn in the unsaturated zone where flow is vertical contour maps were created using surfer version 13 4 2 heat generation due to biodegradation the heat generation from microbial activity can be calculated from the rates and enthalpies of the degradation reactions at the bemidji site relevant reactions occur under aerobic iron reducing and methanogenic conditions fig 5 three model compounds are used as representatives of the degrading fractions in the oil and the groundwater plume most of the oil loss occurs under methanogenic conditions in the n alkane fraction baedecker et al 2011 so hexadecane is the model compound used to represent the degrading fraction in the oil source zone in the contaminant plume the important reduced carbon sources are the aromatics and the organic acids benzene represents the aromatic fraction because it is the most prevalent aromatic compound cozzarelli et al 2001 benzoate represents the organic acids because its redox state is similar to their average stoichiometry identified by thorn and aiken 1998 the enthalpy of each reaction is calculated using the molar enthalpies of formation table 1 of the products minus the reactants the calculations of enthalpy show that the methanogenic reactions yield a fraction of the heat compared to iron reducing and aerobic reactions table 2 thus we exclude methanogenic reactions in the groundwater in this model because the low concentrations and enthalpy of reaction would not contribute measurable heat heating rates in the unsaturated zone over the oil source zone are derived from published aerobic methane oxidation observations methane oxidation rates are determined using average observed carbon dioxide efflux at the land surface of 1 1 μmol m 2 s 1 sihota et al 2016 the efflux consists of carbon dioxide from methanogenic alkane degradation and aerobic methane oxidation adding the enthalpy of reactions per mole carbon 655 kj mol 1 and multiplying by the efflux gives the rate of heat generation warren and bekins 2015 the location of the unsaturated heating zone was determined from sihota and mayer 2015 and is shown in fig 5b the elevations of the reaction zones were set from the locations where methane and oxygen mix molins et al 2010 since the efflux changes along the transect the distribution of heating given in table 3 was allocated based on observations of sihota and mayer 2015 heating in the groundwater plume is estimated based on the modeling results of ng et al 2015 the iron reducing zone is placed in the same location as in their model fig 5b the heating rates are estimated using reactant loss table 4 over the length of the iron reducing zone 105 5 to 165 5 m with the modeled average groundwater velocity at an elevation of 420 5 m and porosity of 0 38 these values result in rates of 0 033 w m 3 5 results the root mean square deviations were lowest using a groundwater permeability of 1 6 10 10 m2 table 5 this permeability was used for the groundwater in the background and contaminant models resulting in a horizontal groundwater velocity of 0 67 m d 1 pipeline temperatures of 24 c in the model best matched the measured temperatures the unsaturated zone temperature profile at bkgd 1 was not affected by the pipeline temperatures due to its distance from the pipelines model profile temperatures at bkgd 1 were 0 4 c less than measured values for the top 2 5 m and within 0 2 c from this depth to the water table fig 6a at bkgd 2 temperatures were within 0 4 c within the top 2 m fig 6b below that depth the temperatures differed by no more than 0 2 c throughout the profile results from the contaminant model show that the thermal plume originates primarily in the unsaturated zone fig 7a model temperatures are more than 23 c in the unsaturated zone near the pipelines due to assigned values of 24 c at the pipeline model nodes near the water table temperatures drop to about 10 c in the unsaturated zone away from the pipelines 0 to 50 m but within the microbial heating zone temperatures reach a high of 10 8 c a groundwater thermal plume of more than 1 c above background extends downgradient to 170 m away from the center of the oil source zone in order to separate the effects of microbial heating and the pipelines the model was run with only the microbial heating fig 7b and with only the pipeline heating fig 7c the results of the model with only microbial activity show higher temperatures were found in the unsaturated zone with an increase up to 3 6 c the groundwater has temperature increases of up to 1 7 c near the water table within and near the modeled oil source zone the results of the model with the pipelines alone show that a half degree temperature increase extends 115 m downgradient at the water table and extends up into the unsaturated zone the results of the contaminant model unsaturated temperatures at site bkgd 1 closely match observed average annual temperatures similar to the results of the background model the model results at oil 2 exhibit a similar vertical temperature profile as measured at the site fig 8a the model temperature profile is within 0 3 c of the measured profile at oil 1 the model profile also closely parallels the measured profile within 0 2 c fig 8b the modeled groundwater temperatures were compared to measured average annual temperatures in wells at the site the results of the modeled and measured average annual temperatures are plotted in fig 9a and b the modeled temperatures at 0 5 m below the water table start at 6 5 c at 200 m from the center of the oil source zone temperatures increase to a high of 9 9 c at 24 m oil 2 then steadily decrease to 7 4 c at 212 m fig 9a the measured average annual temperatures similarly increase over the oil source zone and pipelines then decrease downgradient a similar trend is found at 4 0 m below the water table but with lower peak temperatures fig 9b the biggest deviation between the modeled and measured temperatures in the groundwater occurs at 100 m from the center of the oil source zone at 0 5 m below the water table the modeled temperature at this location is 0 8 c less than the measured temperature varying the recharge from 5 5 10 6 m s 1 to 1 65 10 5 m s 1 in the lower elevation portion of the site 84 m to 12 m in fig 5b relative to the rest of the model had little effect on the model temperature at 0 5 m below water table the greatest temperature difference over the range of recharge values was 0 3 c at 29 m the model temperatures at 0 5 m below water table with and without pipeline and microbial heating are shown in fig 10 temperatures increase to a peak of 4 2 c above background near the lowest pipeline then decrease to 0 9 c at 200 m the model run without microbial heating shows a similar trend subtracting the two model runs yields the effect of the heat from biodegradation on the temperature plume temperatures from microbial activity increase to 1 7 c above background at 0 m and decrease to 0 45 c at 200 m the figure illustrates that half the temperature increase at 200 m is due to the pipeline heating alone the total energy gained in the model is 1481 w and comes from four sources fig 5b microbial activity pipelines continental heat flow and fluids table 6 the total energy generated by microbial activity is 143 w with 139 w from methane oxidation and 3 9 w from iron reduction by comparison the energy input with the pipelines set to a steady state temperature of 24 c is 146 w continental heat flow contributes 16 w the fluid sources including specified pressure nodes and model surface recharge and conduction contribute 1176 w these energy inputs are balanced by heat leaving the system through downgradient fluid outflows and specified temperature nodes at the model surface 6 discussion the model developed in this study enables us to analyze the sources and movement of heat as well as other contributing factors to temperature changes in the system the sources of heat are primarily from microbial reactions and the pipelines with these two sources being about equal of the microbial energy 97 is from methane oxidation in the unsaturated zone table 6 the iron reducing reactions in the groundwater do not contribute significantly to the thermal plume for two reasons first the enthalpy of methane oxidation coupled to iron reduction is 64 of the aerobic value table 2 further more carbon is oxidized in the unsaturated zone than in the iron reducing zone tables 3 and 4 the two factors lead to the large differences in heating amounts the biggest difference between the modeled and measured temperatures in the groundwater occurs at 100 m upgradient from the center of the oil source zone at 0 5 m below the water table the modeled temperature is 0 8 c less than the measured temperature this area is near an infiltration gallery used from 1999 to 2003 delin and herkelrath 2014 to dispose of contaminated water that was withdrawn from oil recovery wells and run through an oil water separator delin and herkelrath 2014 expected that water soluble contaminants would have been fully degraded by 2007 and the groundwater would remain anoxic at least until july 2009 if only contaminated groundwater was injected into the unsaturated zone however in 2017 augering at 112 m upgradient fig 1 revealed oil under a confining plastic sheet about 3 m below land surface the presence of separate phase oil in the infiltration gallery can provide a long term source of reduced carbon in this area although higher carbon dioxide efflux at the surface was not found in the area sihota and mayer 2015 presumably due to the confining plastic sheet higher measured temperatures indicate significant microbial degradation is occurring using the carbon dioxide efflux method sihota et al 2016 found the average annual contaminant degradation rate was 1 1 μmol c m 2 s 1 at the bemidji site using their efflux in the steady state model simulation resulted in 139 w from methanotrophic activity table 6 using average elemental content of the oil of 83 5 carbon baedecker et al 2017 this results in 0 43 kg oil m 2 yr 1 with a density of 0 840 kg l 1 baedecker et al 2017 the degradation rate of the oil is 0 51 l m 2 yr 1 550 gal acre 1 yr 1 a careful viewing of the unsaturated zone temperature profile shows that the thermal conductivity varies with depth the profile with a heat source such as pipelines or microbial activity in the middle of the unsaturated zone and a constant conductivity would have a smooth curve from land surface to water table with the highest temperature at the heat source location however at bkgd 2 oil 1 and oil 2 the slope changes within 1 0 m from land surface indicating an increase in thermal conductivity with depth since thermal conductivity is dependent on water content it is likely that the conductivity increases due to increased water content below the root zone measured temperatures are dependent on the accuracy of the temperature data loggers in this case the loggers have an accuracy of 0 21 c onset computer corporation the average difference between groundwater temperatures and modeled temperatures excluding the location at 100 m is 0 05 c this value is well within the accuracy of the data loggers we modeled all pipeline temperatures as constant temperature at the site this assumption may not necessarily be the case the company that operates the pipelines enbridge energy limited partnership does not measure temperatures of the oil in the pipelines at the research site thus there is no record of the changes in the oil temperature with time or within each pipeline knowing the temperatures of the pipelines is particularly important if temperatures vary among the pipelines despite these discrepancies the model simulates the temperatures rather well the biggest differences occur in the unsaturated zone a different unsaturated zone model or better parameter estimation may provide a closer fit regardless of whether the temperatures of the individual pipelines differ the total heat produced by all of them is constrained by the observed temperatures at the water table at bkgd 2 thus our conclusion that the pipeline heat is a large fraction of the heat budget is not affected by variations in the pipeline temperatures the model distinguishes the pipeline and biological heat sources that cause the thermal plume and provides estimates of each heat from microbial degradation comprises 51 of the heat from the two sources of the microbial heat methane oxidation in the unsaturated zone accounts for by far the most heat the transport of the heat in the unsaturated zone is dominated by conduction as shown by the insensitivity of the thermal plume to changes in recharge rates further the model results using a range of groundwater velocities show that transport is dominated by advection once the heat moves into the groundwater modeling the site requires accounting for sources of heat from infrastructure the six active pipelines crossing the site the other major source of heat presented a challenge for the model they contribute 46 of the heat and create their own thermal plume thus the model shows that the site infrastructure can contribute significantly to the heat budget and if not considered can lead to overestimation of degradation rates by a factor of 1 7 in other words increasing the microbial activity in the unsaturated zone by 1 7 times leads to a similar profile rates calculated from a bemidji site model that does not include pipeline heat and match groundwater temperature profiles will be 70 higher than actual rates other contaminated sites including refineries and fuel depots also have complex infrastructure our results show the heat effects of the infrastructure extend for a distance of 200 m downgradient and must be included in the heat budget to allow degradation rates to be calculated from field temperatures heat sources associated with active remediation such as bioventing soil vapor extraction and air sparging will add or remove heat in ways that would be difficult to track in addition methane may be stripped or otherwise removed from the system decreasing the amount of heat generated due to the multiple conflicting heat sources and flow temperature measurements might not be helpful in determining biodegradation rates associated with these remediation methods the steady state model successfully matches the measured average annual temperatures due to significant heat generation in the unsaturated zone high heating rates require reactions with high enthalpy coupled to large fluxes of reactants to the reaction zone at the bemidji site methane from methanogenic degradation of oil mixes with atmospheric oxygen in the unsaturated zone without the high fluxes and exothermic reactions not enough heat would be generated to create measurable temperature increases above background an active heat producing zone is essential to derive degradation rates at the bemidji site the dominant microbial heat source is due to aerobic methane oxidation it remains an open question whether sites with other redox reactions may produce sufficient heat surface temperatures at the bemidji site can vary by more than 40 c over a year temperatures in the subsurface are significantly attenuated but still vary this steady state model uses average parameter values microbial activity rates pipeline temperatures recharge rates and temperatures pressures hydraulic gradient etc and works well when comparing the model results to measured average annual temperatures a transient model presents difficulties matching temperatures under varying conditions that occur between seasons or over years and decades required for complete biodegradation of the contaminant source zone further due to the diurnal temperature fluctuations measurements observed at any one time may not be sufficient to calculate a reasonable microbial degradation rate that can be applied to the site over space and time 7 summary new techniques are needed to predict biodegradation rates of contaminants in the subsurface to understand fate and transport due to the relationship between reaction rates and heat generation the measurement of temperatures may be a useful method however to calculate the microbial activity at a contaminated site all sources of heat including site infrastructure must be quantified a two dimensional steady state unsaturated zone groundwater flow model with heat generation and transport of the bemidji crude oil research site was constructed to better understand the challenges associated with using temperature measurements at field sites to calculate microbial activity the approach expanded on previous research to produce a comprehensive heat budget and modeled long distance transport of the heat the model provided insight into the relative importance of heat from microbial degradation and oil pipelines in creation of a thermal plume the simulated results are comparable to temperatures measured in the unsaturated and saturated zones biodegradation of oil contaminants primarily from methanogenesis followed by methane oxidation leads to a temperature increase of 3 6 c in the unsaturated zone and 1 7 c in the ground water the model showed that about half of the heat originates from the microbial activity and half from the pipelines highlighting the importance of accounting for both biodegradation and infrastructure heat sources the model results led to the discovery of microbial activity in an area previously not know as an oil source zone located 100 m upgradient from the middle of the source zone in a former infiltration gallery overall the model results indicate the heat sources from site infrastructure should be carefully accounted for when using temperature to estimate biodegradation

1676,groundwater quality assessment at contaminated sites often involves the use of short screen 1 5 to 3 m monitoring wells however even over these intervals considerable variation may occur in contaminant concentrations in groundwater adjacent to the well screen this is especially true in heterogeneous dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl source zones where cm scale contamination variability may call into question the effectiveness of monitoring wells to deliver representative data the utility of monitoring wells in such settings is evaluated by reference to high resolution multilevel sampler mls wells located proximally to short screen wells together with sampling capture zone modelling to explore controls upon well sample provenance and sensitivity to monitoring protocols field data are analysed from the highly instrumented sabre research site that contained an old trichloroethene source zone within a shallow alluvial aquifer at a uk industrial facility with increased purging monitoring well samples tend to a flow weighted average concentration but may exhibit sensitivity to the implemented protocol and degree of purging formation heterogeneity adjacent to the well screen particularly alongside pump intake position and water level influence this sensitivity purging of low volumes is vulnerable to poor reproducibility arising from concentration variability predicted over the initial 1 to 2 screen volumes purged marked heterogeneity may also result in limited long term sample concentration stabilization development of bespoke monitoring protocols that consider screen volumes purged alongside water quality indicator parameter stabilization is recommended to validate and reduce uncertainty when interpreting monitoring well data within source zone areas generalised recommendations on monitoring well based protocols are also developed a key monitoring well utility is their proportionately greater sample draw from permeable horizons constituting a significant contaminant flux pathway and hence representative fraction of source mass flux acquisition of complementary high resolution site monitoring data however vitally underpins optimal interpretation of monitoring well datasets and appropriate advancement of a site conceptual model and remedial implementation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater sampling monitoring wells groundwater quality low flow sampling dnapl flow weighted average fwa concentration 1 introduction monitoring wells have been used extensively worldwide for the assessment of groundwater quality at contaminated sites barber and davis 1987 basu et al 2006 fdep 2008 fretwell et al 2006 puls and paul 1997 even though most wells nowadays are screened over relatively short intervals of 1 5 to 3 m 5 to 10 ft the variation in groundwater quality within the screen adjacent geological formation over even these length scales may still be considerable at dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contaminated sites orders of magnitude changes in dissolved phase concentrations may occur locally in source zone areas arising from the marked spatial variability in the occurrence of residual dnapl contributing to dissolved phase plume contaminaion guilbeault et al 2005 johnston et al 2013 parker et al 2003 rivett and feenstra 2005 resolution of this variability may be required to better understand where the principal fluxes of contamination originate from also where to surgically target remediation efforts to address discretely layered persistent dnapl and diffused secondary source zone mass within low permeability units increasingly characteristic in later stages of source zone aging kueper et al 2014 rivett et al 2014 justifiably the utility of monitoring wells even short screen to deliver data appropriate to develop such surgical efforts may be called into question although monitoring wells will typically detect the presence of a dnapl source area via the observation of elevated concentrations relative to the wider site pumped groundwater samples will provide an averaged concentration drawn from across the well screen length theoretically under a steady state flow condition a pumped sample should provide a flow weighted average fwa concentration i e an average of the formation s vertical heterogeneous concentration distribution weighted by the vertical distribution of flow rates or formation hydraulic conductivities k in a flow system characterised by horizontal gradients martin hayden and britt 2006 mcmillan et al 2014 puls and barcelona 1996 a wide spectrum of methods has become available to sample monitoring wells with potential to deliver a fwa concentration britt et al 2010 itrc 2007 mchugh et al 2016 parsons 2005 puls and barcelona 1996 us epa 2010 2013 2017 vroblesky 2001 these may be categorized under zero minimal purge protocols using grab or passive diffusion based samplers that remove none or a very small water volume prior to sampling and effectively obtain a grab sample of the ambient flow regime occurring at the point or interval monitored within the well screen low flow low stress protocols that purge and sample at low flow rates until indicator parameter stabilization occurs and may involve low to moderate volumes of water being extracted to achieve this condition multiple well volume purging fixed volume purge protocols that are based upon a specified number of well volumes being purged prior to sampling our focus is upon pumped samples and hence low flow and multiple well volume purging protocols but cognizant of the fact that the ambient conditions existent within the well screen that control a zero minimal purge protocol sample provenance also constitute the initial condition to and remain influential during purging progressed under the studied protocols the in well ambient condition is perhaps surprisingly complex and can be difficult to predict a priori whilst natural gradient through flow across the well screen fundamentally occurs with cross well lateral flushing rates controlled by the formation k profile robin and gillham 1987 the in well stratified contamination resulting may be variously perturbed formation vertical hydraulic gradients may induce up downward in well flows in well mixing re distribution may also arise from convection due to temperature gradients and fluid density effects lateral or vertical flow turbulence and contaminant diffusion gradients martin hayden and britt 2006 mcmillan et al 2014 itrc 2006 2007 vroblesky et al 2006 a fwa concentration may only arise for a zero minimal purge sample if full mixing of just groundwater flowing through the screen section occurs more probable is that heterogeneous groundwater concentrations entering the well are irregularly and incompletely mixed alongside possible mixing with blank casing water that is susceptible to convection martin hayden and britt 2006 the more recent work of britt et al 2014 concludes that whilst most wells are expected to experience significant redistribution effects some wells may maintain stratification or potentially even re stratify differently from the surrounding formation under both low flow and multiple well volume purging protocols provided that a steady state flow condition is reached then a fwa concentration is expected varljen et al 2006 whether purge times and hence purged volumes are adequate to attain a steady state fwa sample concentration however is a key issue martin hayden 2000 martin hayden et al 2014 mcmillan et al 2014 the variation in delayed arrival times within the sample taken of groundwater entering the monitoring well screen at distance from the pump intake becomes of critical significance here martin hayden et al 2014 where protocols are based upon a specified number of standing water well or screen volumes purged prior to sampling then greater volumes increase the likelihood of a steady state fwa sample being obtained for low flow low stress sampling protocols where steady state conditions are evidenced by stabilization of the pumping water level and water quality indicator parameters ec ph etc puls and barcelona 1996 us epa 2010 2017 these protocols typically do not indicate a minimum purged volume other than to specify it exceeds any well drawdown measured and sample equipment volume where comparatively low volumes are purged then a partial rather than full purge of the original standing well or screen water volume will occur martin hayden et al 2014 and samples may then be expected to variously approach but not fully constitute a fwa sample concentration it is clear from the above that understanding the influence of employed protocols upon monitoring well assessment of heterogeneous dnapl source zone areas is of critical importance whilst higher resolution site assessment alternative technologies have become increasingly recommended anneser et al 2008 basu et al 2009 kram et al 2001 itrc 2015 their use is still perceived to represent a small fraction of the site characterization effort worldwide that still predominantly involves monitoring wells alternatives to characterize source zone mass distribution include detailed core sampling parker et al 2003 inter well partitioning tracer tests annable et al 1998 and direct push methods involving direct water sampling groundwater profiling and indirect measurements using sensor based tools such as the membrane interface probe adamson et al 2014 guilbeault et al 2005 alternatives to resolve dissolved phase plume mass fluxes include multi level sampler mls transect monitoring basu et al 2006 béland pelletier et al 2011 johnston et al 2013 as well as those extending monitoring well or long screen borehole utility such as passive flux meter annable et al 2005 integral pumping test béland pelletier et al 2011 or flexible membrane liner approaches cherry et al 2007 such alternatives despite their benefits can still be perceived as onerous mls transect monitoring for instance may be viewed not cost effective due to the sheer numbers of mls point samples involved and the large resource allocated to a small albeit important locality within the much larger site this view is perhaps reasonable when it is recognised that even research based studies cai et al 2012 king et al 1999 kao and wang 2001 einarson and mackay 2001 may fail to achieve mls transect minimum sample densities necessary to estimate mass discharge with quantified uncertainty brooks et al 2015 li et al 2007 it is concluded that the continued use of monitoring wells to characterize source zones is not because they are technically more effective than alternative assessment options typically they are not expected to be but rather they offer a cost effective easily implemented and widely accepted approach to site assessment that can be implemented from the detailed source zone to greater site scales to give an integrated but reasonable indication of contamination present recognizing the conundrum that monitoring well use is hence non ideal but set to continue into the foreseeable future it remains imperative that monitoring wells are not simply used as an unthinking default option rather we seek to better understand and improve upon their utility including their collaborative use with the aforementioned higher resolution alternatives alongside considered interpretation this ambition provides critical impetus to the research herein surprisingly few site studies have evaluated the detailed origin of groundwater sampled by monitoring wells despite their near ubiquitous use available studies whilst offering explanations for sample provenance hutchins and acree 2000 mcdonald and smith 2009 metcalf and robbins 2007 puls and paul 1997 reilly and leblanc 1998 sukop 2000 typically lack the ideal of detailed corroborating data this notably includes data afforded by proximal high resolution mls transects that could be used to estimate groundwater flows and concentrations contributing to a well sample from the horizons screened furthermore the above studies have often focused upon monitoring wells boreholes with screen lengths over 3 m sometimes considerably so our field based research has been conducted at the sabre source area bioremediation site located in the uk where a trichloroethene tce dnapl source area has been intensively monitored prior to and throughout a pilot scale bioremediation field trial buss et al 2010 the historic industrial spill site provided a unique field scale opportunity to compare traditional monitoring well sampling with proximal mls transect data and develop insight to the provenance of monitoring well samples within an aged dnapl source zone set within a typically heterogeneous sand gravel aquifer the goal was to use field scale evidence gained from conventional monitoring well and proximal mls sampling together with supporting numerical model simulation of monitoring well capture zones to better understand the provenance of samples obtained during conventional sampling focusing on low flow and multiple well volume purging of typical short screen monitoring wells objectives were to evaluate proximal mls monitoring well data within the existing sabre research study field dataset obtained during baseline monitoring and bioremediation phases to use numerical flow and transport modelling to inform the field scale study interpretation and to explore sensitivities to monitoring well sample origins and sampling protocols and to consider the implications of sampling scale and well screen length for practitioners regarding the utility of monitoring wells particularly within dnapl source zone areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and historical field data overview specific data relevant to our project aim were drawn from the larger dataset of the sabre project concerning the in situ bioremediation of an aged tce dnapl source zone buss et al 2010 dearden et al 2010a harkness et al 2012 robinson et al 2009 wilson and cai 2010 zeeb and houlden 2010 the source area contamination is the result of tce releases from subsurface effluent pipes at a chemical manufacturing plant in the uk midlands over a plant operational period spanning 20 to 45 years prior to the sabre study the source zone architecture has been shown in detail to be spatially heterogeneous rivett et al 2014 the shallow aquifer underlying the site consists of c 1 m of made ground overlying c 5 m of superficial quaternary alluvium and river terrace gravels chambers et al 2010 dearden et al 2013 below this lies c 50 m of relatively impermeable triassic mudstone mercia mudstone group which may be weathered in the top 0 5 to 1 25 m chambers et al 2010 the quaternary deposits are heterogeneous they are generally finer in the upper c 1 2 m and comprise a sequence of alluvial sands silts and clays with mm scale laminations lelliot et al 2008 chambers et al 2010 these finer deposits grade into c 4 m of poorly sorted river terrace deposits the river terrace deposits comprise coarser sands and gravels formed from river channel deposition the water table is typically 1 2 m bgl below ground level with hydraulic gradients of 0 001 0 002 towards a local river chambers et al 2010 dearden et al 2013 a key feature of the sabre project of advantage to our study was the constrained known groundwater flow regime afforded by the installation of the 3 sided u shaped sabre test cell comprising sealed plastic sheet pile walls keyed into the underlying mudstone aquitard fig 1 the cell was oriented parallel to the prevailing groundwater flow direction and isolated a portion of the dnapl source zone around 3 13 m along the cell length buss et al 2010 rivett et al 2014 the cell is open upgradient of the source zone to allow groundwater inflow with an abstraction well positioned at the closed cell end that controlled groundwater flow rates and residence time along the length of the cell streamtube created the well abstraction rate during cell operation of 1 4 1 6 l min was chosen to give groundwater velocities of 0 7 m d comparable to the natural and a nominal cell residence time of around 42 days cai et al 2012 rivett et al 2014 cell water levels as measured at sw70 and sw75 monitoring wells and t2a and t3a transects fig 1 were variable during cell operation typically values were 2 4 m bgl with decreasing water levels ascribed to partial cell dewatering from clogging at the entrance reducing cell inflow rates part way through the study then overcome by additional groundwater pumping into the cell we draw upon data from the seven detailed sampling operations table 1 conducted during the 2 year operational period buss et al 2010 the initial three sampling operations op 1 to op 3 were during the baseline pre bioremediation period and the remaining four during the bioremediation phase op 4 to op 7 involving electron donor injection and bioaugmentation harkness and fisher 2013 cai et al 2012 increased occurrence of tce dechlorination products cdce cis dichloroethene vc vinyl chloride aka chloroethene and eth ethene was found during this later phase wilson and cai 2010 high resolution groundwater monitoring was undertaken in the source zone and in the down gradient dissolved phase plume using mls transects installed both perpendicular to and parallel with groundwater flow in addition to the mls transects a number of 3 m screen 50 mm diameter monitoring wells were installed two such monitoring wells and their adjoining mls transects comprise the focus of this study monitoring well sw70 positioned close to the down gradient boundary of the dnapl source zone and monitoring well sw75 within the dissolved plume down gradient of the source fig 1 mls transects t2a and t3a provided very proximal depth discrete contaminant concentration distribution data from their positions immediately upgradient of sw70 and sw75 respectively these transects each contained seven mlss that were spaced equally across the cell at 0 5 m intervals each mls comprised a bundle of nine hdpe 10 mm internal diameter sampling tubes completed at different depths the lowermost 15 cm interval of each tube was slotted and over wrapped in geotextile to serve as a discrete sampling port mls ports were spaced at 0 5 m intervals vertically and installed to monitor the 4 m thick superficial aquifer immediately overlying the mudstone fig 1 a total of 63 ports within each transect spaced 0 5 m laterally and vertically hence allowed detailed spatial characterization of contaminant concentrations in the cell passing sw70 and sw75 well screens that were centrally positioned laterally and vertically with respect to their associated mls transect c 1 m up gradient sw70 and sw75 were sampled using a 12 v submersible pump wasp positioned just within the lower 1 m interval of the well screen interval pumping was undertaken at rates of 1 5 l min with the motivation that traditional purged monitoring well water quality samples would result purged water was monitored for stabilization of water quality parameters with removal of a minimum of 3 well volumes 24 l assuming typical rest water levels at 2 m bgl prior to taking samples for voc volatile organic compound and supporting hydrochemical analysis similar to martin hayden et al 2014 we later report and simulate time variant data as screen volumes sv removed purged as opposed to well volumes for a 3 m 50 mm diameter well screen 3 sv is equivalent to 18 l with minimal drawdown sampling where the pump intake is located within the well screen little sample water is expected to originate from the blank casing also the screen volume is fixed across different sampling events as long as drawdown remains above the top of the well screen t2a and t3a mls transects were sampled at 200 ml min using a peristaltic pump transect port samples within 10 mm diameter tubes were taken following chemical stabilization with a minimum of 3 sample tube volumes removed prior to sampling low water table conditions meant it was not always possible to sample all transect ports on all occasions in addition to the transect and monitoring well sampling data other sabre project data drawn upon included 1 chlorinated ethene tce cdce vc and eth concentrations measured at the abstraction well used to constrain mass flow estimates through the cell 2 k estimates from hvorslev hvorslev 1951 analysis of falling head tests on t2a and t3a used to provide initial estimates of k distribution at sw70 and sw75 cai et al 2012 3 conservative bromide tracer test breakthrough times at t2a used to provide additional evidence of cell transport pathways away from the source zone the conservative tracer test was undertaken from injection wells located 5 m upgradient of t2a dearden et al 2010b monitoring at t2a was undertaken 14 times over the 25 day period of that test 2 2 numerical modelling approach the aim of numerical modelling was twofold to examine quantitatively inferences on sw70 and sw75 monitoring well sample origin via simulation of well capture zones based on the observed field data and to examine the groundwater quality samples which might have resulted had different sampling approaches been undertaken and hence to comment on sampling best practice modelled scenarios incorporate the field observed heterogeneity in formation permeability and contaminant distributions the numerical model assumes darcy s law flow within the aquifer and wellbore and does not consider the sensitivity to alternative wellbore flow representations e g poiseuille flow viscous effects these are examined for instance by martin hayden et al 2014 within a homogeneous aquifer setting to which the reader is referred numerical modelling of the cell during the sabre sampling operations was undertaken using modpath 5 pollock 1994 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 in conjunction with modflow harbaugh et al 2000 calculated specific discharges the scope of modelling excluded direct simulation of the evolution of chemical concentrations in the cell between sampling operations rather individual simulations of transient flow and transport during monitoring well sampling were undertaken separately for each sabre sampling operation tce cdce and vc were all included in the numerical modelling particle tracking using modpath was used to assess advective well capture zones and compare simulated tracer test transport velocities to those observed in the conservative tracer test dearden et al 2010b 2 2 1 model setup the unconfined model domain fig 2 is a simplified representation of the sabre cell the model domain is 29 m long 4 m wide and 6 m deep and comprises 101 columns 51 rows and 200 layers the monitoring and abstraction wells are represented explicitly using a single column of very high k 106 m d cells the high k cells extend from the top of the model to the bottom of the screen interval of each well the well casing is represented by modflow s wall boundary condition with a k value of 10 7 m d and thickness of 0 01 m the model grid is refined in the vicinity of the wells such that model well cross sectional areas are equivalent to the real world well dimensions grid refinement is reduced away from the wells up to a maximum row column width of 0 13 m uniform layer spacing of 0 03 m is used between 1 5 and 6 m bgl above this which for the majority of the model is above the water table the layer heights incrementally increase up to a maximum of 0 4 m in the top layer the pump intake located near the base of monitoring well screen interval in accordance with the field protocol is explicitly represented using modflow s well boundary condition simulated pumping rates were initially set to 1 l min with sensitivity to increased and decreased pumping rate also investigated effluent discharge from the cell was simulated via a well boundary condition abstracting at a rate of 1 4 l min placed in the middle of the screen interval location transient sampling simulations were of 60 minute duration to allow examination up to and beyond the time to remove 3 well volumes 24 l at 1 l min changes in wider groundwater heads are assumed negligible over this short duration and hence the only model inflows are via a steady state general head boundary ghb at the left hand side of the domain recharge was assumed to be zero cell was covered and boundaries with the underlying aquitard and sheet pile walls assumed impermeable and hence assigned as no flow boundaries in the model observed heads in wells located immediately outside the cell remained roughly constant at c 1 2 m bgl during sabre cell operation the right hand ghb head is hence 1 2 m bgl with conductance configured distance 100 m k 0 5 m d such that initial heads at t2a and t3a matched those observed c 2 m bgl for t2a c 2 5 m bgl for t3a the exception was during operations 5 and 7 when cell dewatering had resulted in decreased heads for these simulations the ghb was lowered to 2 2 m bgl such that the water table was c 3 m bgl at t2a and c 4 m bgl at t3a extrapolation interpolation of falling head test derived hydraulic conductivity k and sampled t2a and t3a concentration data for each operation served to provide initial model k and chlorinated ethene concentration distributions that provided a representative source of dissolved phase voc concentrations surrounding and available to the pumped monitoring wells the complexity of explicit representation of dnapl dissolution was hence avoided and considered not warranted for the study aim ordinary kriging was used to interpolate laterally across the cell at t2a and t3a and linear interpolation to assign values between the kriged k distributions at t2a and t3a upgradient of t2a and downgradient of t3a k and concentration distributions were extrapolated these were assumed to be the same as t2a and t3a respectively this is recognised to be a simplification but not critical to the assessment of interactions local to the monitoring wells for concentration kriging non detects were set to the detection limit and non sampled ports were not included model porosity was set to the suggested cell average 0 25 cai et al 2012 specific yield and specific storage were chosen to be 0 1 and 0 0001 respectively the heterogeneous k distribution in the model was assumed to account for large scale macro dispersion to simulate small scale dispersive processes local to the monitoring wells and to ensure model stability model longitudinal dispersivity was set to 0 04 m around 10 of local modelled capture zone radial distance over sampling timeframes simulated and the transverse dispersivity to 10 of that value 0 004 m a standard assumption retardation due to sorption was reasonably ignored due to the low transport distances and timescales simulated recognizing relatively low sorption is anticipated in high concentration dnapl environments rivett and allen king 2003 alongside the modest difference in sorption potential between the chlorinated ethenes involved 2 2 2 model calibration and performance model performance was assessed by comparing the fit of simulated monitoring well sample concentrations with observed concentrations non exhaustive manual calibration of t2a and t3a k distributions was used to explore improvement in model concentration fit statistics achievable through realistic and constrained adjustment of transect k values constraining t2a k adjustment involved comparison of tracer test peak arrival times to t2a with model simulated times to better define the velocity distribution through the transect this resulted in greater weighting of faster flow paths traced by the test and hence their more prominent representation within the calibrated model for t3a adjustments in k weighted estimates of total chlorinated ethenes mass flux through t3a were constrained by their expected equality with the overall cell abstraction well mass flux equality of t3a water flux to the cell abstraction rate also being assumed spatial chemical concentrations interpolated from t2a t3a were assumed fixed throughout the calibration process albeit recognizing similar to k these may not fully represent actual conditions summary residual statistics root mean square error rmse and residual bias represented the overall model fit these statistics were calculated using results from both monitoring wells for all chemical components and operations 1 rmse o 1 7 c 1 3 w 1 2 y ocw y ocw 2 42 2 bias o 1 7 c 1 3 w 1 2 y ocw y ocw 42 where o is the operation 1 7 c is the chlorinated ethene component tce cdce or vc w is the monitoring well sw70 or sw75 y ocw is the modelled sample value for a particular operation chemical and monitoring well and y ocw the observed sample value the field protocol involved sw70 and sw75 being purged for a minimum of 3 well volumes typically 4 screen volumes with inline water quality parameters allowed to stabilize before sampling with hence some variation of purge times possible model simulations simply assumed a purging time greater than the time to remove 3 well volumes c 24 min being a typical timeframe for each set of model parameters calibration results were reported at 5 min intervals assuming purging times between 25 and 60 min plotted simulated estimates used the purging time result at which overall residual summary statistics were minimised 2 2 3 predictive modelling predictive modelling using a non exhaustive range of scenarios table 2 was undertaken with the aim to investigate the effect pumping rate pumping time and pump intake position might have had on monitoring well sample concentrations in the sabre cell pumping rates were selected to span a range from low flow 0 3 l min to higher 1 and 2 5 l min but not untypical rates used to sample 3 m screen monitoring wells predictive modelling was undertaken using the final calibrated k distribution resulting from the observed monitoring well data fits 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed mls transect and monitoring well data orders of magnitude variation in concentration was observed across the mls transects t2a fig 3 and t3a fig 4 both spatially and with time proximity to the heterogeneous dnapl source and weakness of transverse dispersion are probable key factors leading to this high level of variability total not shown and individual chlorinated ethenes could locally and sometimes extensively approach literature tce molar solubility values c 8400 to 10 700 μm and accords with close proximity of mls points to the dnapl source zone t3a generally exhibited greater concentrations at depth 4 m bgl with t2a presenting a more complex distribution with low concentrations of tce above 4 m bgl contrasting with elevated cdce values the reverse distribution is observed below 4 m bgl chlorinated ethene concentrations remained relatively stable during the baseline period operations 1 3 whilst daughter products were observed in both transects their relative occurrence was variable across the cell a comparative absence of tce above 4 m bgl in t2a was observed fig 3 with increased cdce by contrast below 4 m bgl relatively high tce concentrations remained with daughter products making up a much smaller contribution to total chlorinated ethene mass variation laterally across transects was marked in some cases and absent in others where concentration appeared more layered monitoring well concentrations were relatively stable over the baseline period fig 3 and 4 op1 op3 sw 70 concentrations of tce at 1765 1826 μm were elevated compared to cdce at 649 835 μm and vc at 176 320 μm the relative increase in daughter products in the upper half of t2a during the baseline conditions was not reflected in sw70 samples fig 3 sw75 baseline samples were similarly reflective of the higher chlorinated ethene concentrations observed in the lower half of t3a rather than the low concentrations observed above 4 m bgl fig 4 total molar chlorinated ethene concentrations at both sw70 and sw75 during the baseline not shown were 10 of the tce molar solubility and hence provided some endorsement of the so called 1 10 solubility rule of thumb pankow and cherry 1996 us epa 1992 often used by practitioners to be indicative of possible presence of dnapl upgradient during bioremediation enrichment in dechlorination daughter products and depletion of tce were observed in both monitoring wells and mls transects figs 3 and 4 op4 op7 total chlorinated ethene molar concentrations observed even in monitoring well samples approached or exceeded tce molar solubility this could potentially reflect enhanced dissolution effects at the site rivett et al 2014 k distributions measured at t2a and t3a were heterogeneous fig 3 and fig 4 hydraulic conductivity was generally greater within transect t2a 1 to 28 m d than within transect t3a 0 1 to 14 m d values were also generally larger in the upper alluvium above 2 m bgl marked variation in k was apparent in the poorly sorted river terrace gravels at depth with an area of higher k observed in both transects at 5 m bgl this high k zone appeared restricted to the right hand side of the cell at t2a but extends the full width of the cell at t3a 3 2 provenance of monitoring well samples pumped monitoring well samples as a first approximation may be expected to yield a fwa of adjacent formation concentrations occasional observations were made of monitoring well concentrations approaching minimum or maximum concentrations recorded within adjacent transects figs 3 and 4 it is usefully inferred from such occurrences that sample provenance must be strongly biased towards similarly high or low concentration zones found in the adjacent formation with little contribution to the sample concentration from other parts of the transect hence sw70 sample provenance was strongly biased towards the highly conductive zone towards the lower right hand side of the cell although less clear for sw75 the data generally support sample provenance was from the more permeable formation at depth but less strongly biased towards the right hand side of the cell than encountered for sw70 the provenance of monitoring well samples is further evaluated in fig 5 where observed monitoring well concentrations are plotted against calculated well concentrations based on mls transect k weighted concentrations k weighted concentration estimates from the mls ports directly down gradient spanning the vertical screen interval solid circles in fig 5b and g that potentially represented the most appropriate fwa concentration estimate available provided only moderate prediction of observed sw70 and sw75 sample concentrations fig 5c and h k weighted concentrations using selectively sampled concentrations drawn from the high k zones in both t2a and t3a dashed circles in fig 5b and g provided much improved predictions of observed monitoring well concentrations for chlorinated ethenes fig 5d and i as well as for chloride and sulfate fig 5e and j for which a particularly good fit was observed with very low rmse and bias values calculated our preliminary conclusion is that well inflows were more complex than can be judged from simplistic consideration of the k distribution corresponding to projected location of the well on the upgradient transect the monitoring well sample is likely to have contributions from across the screen interval however k contrasts are such that these contributions appear to be dominated by inflows from the highest k zone s at depth furthermore 2 or 3 dimensional rather than simple 1 dimensional information is required to assess the sampling interaction of the monitoring well with its surrounding formation 3 3 monitoring well sample bias towards preferential transport pathways temporal variance across sampling operations was not uniform in space fig 5b and g particularly for t2a and to a lesser extent t3a areas of the mls transect associated with smaller changes in concentration with time generally coincided with areas of lower k fig 5a and f and conversely greater temporal changes were generally associated with zones of higher k the more permeable horizons act as preferential pathways for transport away from the source zone and thus reflect enhanced concentration variation resulting from changes to dnapl dissolution caused by bioremediation because monitoring well results are weighted to reflect conditions within preferential transport pathways sw70 and sw75 likewise sample concentrations exhibiting a relatively high temporal variance fig 5 note coloration of well screen depicts temporal variance of well samples such monitoring well observations further underscore the importance of the high k zones contributing to monitoring well sample provenance and suggest that the monitoring wells usefully reflect concentrations occurring in pathways that are important to voc transport through the test cell the significance of spatial continuity of the high k zone at c 5 m bgl towards the lower right side of t2a is further highlighted by the bromide tracer test contoured in fig 6 breakthrough supplementary material video v1 fastest breakthrough at t2a 0 25 d fig 6 and peak tracer concentrations were each observed in this high k zone analysis of a plume longitudinal snapshot sample along the cell length at 6 days not shown confirmed tracer had migrated 25 m down the cell and confirmed maximum and mean cell velocities of 3 4 m d and 2 1 m d respectively rivett et al 2014 such velocities resulted in estimates of minimum and mean travel times between sw70 and the abstraction well of 4 25 5 d and 8 1 d respectively travel times from sw75 to the abstraction well are approximately one quarter of those from sw70 to the abstraction well these times are much shorter than those predicted from the nominal cell pore volume calculation earlier and again point to the continuity and significance of localized preferential flow paths along the cell length the concentrations as total moles of parent and daughter products measured at abstraction wells that captured the cell effluent and hence expected to be indicative of a k weighted average concentration moving through the bulk cell reasonably compared to those measured at sw70 and sw75 during both the baseline and bioremediation phases fig 7a this is noteworthy given the orders of magnitude variation in concentration observed within the t2a and t3a transect points and provides a further line of evidence that the monitoring well samples may be reasonably representative of the overall bulk concentration dissolving from the dnapl source zone and transported through the cell 3 4 numerical modelling results numerical modelling of individual monitoring well capture zones provided additional insights into sample provenance simulated sample concentrations for purge times of 24 to 60 min were compared with observed data not shown the best match to monitoring well sample concentrations was obtained after 30 min of simulated pumping and is shown in fig 8c g for cell simulations based on the observed uncalibrated k distribution interpolated extrapolated from t2a and t3a data for sw70 the matches with observed tce and vc were generally good however cdce concentrations were overestimated for sw75 tce concentrations were underestimated particularly in operations 4 to 7 model predictions using the observed k distribution were similar to those obtained by averaging directly upgradient port concentrations fig 5c and h insufficient weighting importance appeared to be allocated to well inflows from the high k zone at 5 m bgl to generate the concentrations observed at the monitoring wells use of calibration model k distributions section 2 2 2 allowed improved monitoring well concentration matches to be obtained fig 8 transect t2a k calibration used for well sw70 predictions was constrained by use of the tracer test velocity estimates fig 6 and t3a k calibration used for well sw75 simulations by improved prediction of the overall cell abstraction mass flux from t3a mass flux data fig 7b the calibrated model k distributions achieved are shown fig 8b f to retain the style for the most part of the field observed k distributions fig 8a e see later discussion of t3a departure improved simulation of observed concentrations using the calibrated k model fig 8c compared to fig 8d fig 8g compared to fig 8h was largely ascribed to the relative accentuation of flows to monitoring wells from the inferred preferential flow zones located to the lower right side of each transect in the calibrated model compared to flow regimes simulated with the observed k distribution the accentuation of preferential flows invoked within this part of the t2a transect is corroborated by the rapid breakthrough of much of the tracer in this zone at 1 2 d fig 6 this time compares to the calibrated model estimate of 2 7 d but is significantly below the observed k distribution model estimate of 7 9 d the difference in monitoring well simulated capture zones between observed and calibrated model k distributions assumed is shown in fig 9 the difference is more significant in sw70 compare fig 9a and b and illustrates the k distribution caused the majority of the sample to be drawn from the lower half of the screen interval even after 60 min after 15 min of pumping removal of 2 5 screen volumes from sw70 and sw75 the well capture zone had still not spread to encompass the entire screen interval the elapsed time as screen volumes purged until a screen integrated sample is achieved depends on the relative volumes of water entering different parts of the screen and translocation to the pump intake this volume is a function of screen inflows and therefore the k distribution sensitivity testing confirmed that the simulated monitoring well concentration was relatively insensitive to the model k distribution in regions not immediately adjacent to the screened interval both laterally and above the screen interval rather it was the local relative contrast in k immediately adjacent to the screen interval that assumed most importance in determining the contribution to sample concentration from different parts of the screen interval the k value of the low k zones adjacent to the upper screen interval in both sw70 and sw75 fig 8a e were similar however the contribution to the pumped sample from the low k zone adjacent to sw70 is much smaller reduced sample distances travelled than that from the low k zone adjacent to sw75 fig 9 this is ascribed to the greater a factor of c 2 permeability contrast adjacent to the screen at depth in sw70 compared to sw75 in determining well inflows it is hence the relative difference in permeabilities occurring across a screen length that is important and not the absolute values the connectivity of the more permeable zones adjacent to the well screen with the distribution and orientation of permeable horizons more remote from the well but immediately surrounding and supplying inflow to these zones is assumed to influence the wider sample provenance observed abstraction well total chlorinated ethenes mass flux rates for all but two of the sampling operations op 5 and op 7 were significantly underestimated using the observed t3a k distribution to provide a darcy flux concentration based estimate of chlorinated ethenes mass flux through this transect fig 7b this was despite a relatively high sampling density at t3a 3 75 points m2 cai et al 2012 observed t3a k distributions excessively weight abstraction well contributions from the top half of the cell improved matches for operations 5 and 7 were attributed to low water levels and corresponding absence of flow and mass from higher elevations a good match to abstraction well mass flux estimates across all operations fig 7b was achieved only after model calibration which almost entirely excluded flows to the abstraction well from the upper half of the cell at t3a by assuming substantially reduced permeability at upper cell elevations of t3a compare fig 8f to fig 8e the probable reality is that continuity of the low k layer in t3a at 3 to 4 m bgl fig 8e limited shallow groundwater flows to the cell abstraction well screen this interpretation is endorsed by distinct chlorinated ethene concentrations above and below 4 m bgl in t3a and cross cell hydraulic heads recorded in t3a where heads were consistently higher above 3 5 m bgl supplementary material fig sm1 it is conceptualized that some leakage of shallow groundwater may occur across the low k layer with associated convergence of flows and contamination into the deeper screened aquifer dominant flows are however through the permeable cell horizons at depth such conceptual understanding is consistent with interpretations hitherto made of flows sampled by the monitoring wells and core lithological data not shown 3 4 1 predictive modelling of alternative sampling strategies simulation of long time 3 screen volumes sv purged sampling suggest that monitoring well sample concentration in sw70 and sw75 was insensitive to the pumping rate and pump intake positions used fig 10 this result is expected given steady state screen inflow rates dependent on the variation in k local to the screen interval as groundwater from contributing horizons reaches the pump intake a quasi steady state mixing is achieved regardless of pumping rate and pump intake location in sw70 and sw75 this is further explained in fig 11a and fig 11b which show similar well inflow profile variability with depth for the various pump rate and positions simulated the exception was if drawdown was sufficient to drop water levels below the screen interval during operations 5 and 7 cell water levels were within the screen interval at sw75 for these two operations the long time screen inflows depended on the pumping induced drawdown in the well and hence the pumping rate fig 11c interestingly while screen inflows varied with pumping rate during operations 5 and 7 in sw75 simulated sw75 monitoring well concentrations varied little fig 10 this lack of simulated sample concentration variation with pumping rate is attributed to the small contribution to total screen inflow from the top half of the screen due to bias towards the high k zone at 5 m bgl convergence of flow from higher up in the formation towards the well as evidenced by the small peaks in the inflow profiles at the water level in fig 11c meaning groundwater from higher in the aquifer still makes a contribution to sample concentration early time 3 sv simulated sample concentration was independent of pumping rate but did depend on the pump intake position fig 10 if a large concentration contrast existed across the screen interval e g op 1 tce fig 3 and fig 4 differences in early time simulated sample concentrations as a function of pump intake position were large where little or no concentration contrast existed with depth e g t3a vc concentrations during op1 3 fig 4 variation in sample concentration with pump intake location was small or negligible fig 10 the variation in simulated sample concentration during very early times was significant particularly over 1 sv purged by 1 2 sv variation was more limited this was also a function of the variation in chlorinated ethene concentration with depth adjacent the screen interval greatest sample variation with time occurred when variation in chlorinated ethene concentration across the screen interval was high e g during ops 1 3 for sw70 fig 3 fig 10 pump intake location can also be important in early time sample variation the greatest change in simulated sample concentration with time occurred when starting concentrations were very different from the k weighted long time average e g sw70 cdce ops 1 3 fig 3 fig 10 it can hence be reasonably inferred monitoring well sample concentrations obtained during low flow purging and indicator chemical parameter stabilization that involves removal of low volumes around 1 sv or less will be very sensitive to pump intake position especially where marked variability of concentrations occurs with depth a default expectation and hence issue for dnapl source zone areas concentration sensitivity over 1 sv purged but extending up to around 2 sv or more is similarly predicted by martin hayden et al 2014 even under homogeneous aquifer conditions alongside secondary sensitivity to the wellbore flow representation modelled in our model the initial well contaminant distribution reflected that found in the immediately upgradient multilevel assuming different initial conditions within the wellbore would clearly influence early time 1sv sampling predictions however the analytical solution of martin hayden 2000 suggests that the relationship between early time sampling variability and near screen vertical stratification in contamination remains even if the wellbore is assumed to be fully mixed this raises the possibility of using early time variations in sample concentration as an indicator of contaminant variability this though is likely impractical due to the inadequate timeframes to complete the collection of multiple early time samples required prior studies suggest purging of 3 sv is likely sufficient to obtain a quasi steady state sample from a monitoring well for example the modelling of martin hayden et al 2014 to account for partial mixing and transport times to the pump and the modelling of mcmillan et al 2014 to account for the delayed arrival of casing water at the pump our predictive model simulations support these prior conclusions after removal of 2 3 sv early time variations in sample concentration due to the influence of pump intake location or vertical contaminant stratification have largely been resolved with relative stability achieved as formation water is drawn from across the screen interval fig 9 furthermore though we also show that in such heterogeneous dnapl source zone environments a lower level of variability may persist beyond 2 3 sv fig 10 this long term variation was attributed to the arrival of more distant formation water of different concentrations to the pump intake location dispersion meant changes with time became less pronounced but it is likely that a truly stable sample concentration may not be attained 4 conclusions establishing the utility of short screen monitoring wells within heterogeneous dnapl source zones is important due to the widespread continued use of wells this is despite the availability of higher resolution technologies where heterogeneity and vertical head gradients are low monitoring well samples are weighted by vertical variations in hydraulic conductivity local to the screen at long sampling times corresponding to 3 screen volumes sv purged a quasi steady state flow condition is approached where the fwa concentration sample becomes independent of pump rate and intake position at early times however purged sample variability depends upon chemical stratification adjacent to the screen and the difference between initial well and long time fwa concentrations in chemically heterogeneous environments true sample chemical stability may never be reached where geological permeability varies over orders of magnitude mass flux from the high permeability zones will tend to dominate and sampled concentrations reflect contamination from these transmissive zones this was the case at the sabre site where monitoring well concentrations sampled the dominant aquifer contaminant flux and provided a representative indicator of dissolution and transport from the dnapl source it is hence concluded that careful well design and the development of bespoke monitoring protocols are needed to validate data from short screen wells used to monitor source zone areas individual well protocols are particularly merited here due to the greater contamination heterogeneity expected relative to areas more distant from the source area although expensive to develop such protocols may ultimately prove cost effective as risks of prolonged employment of inappropriate protocols are lowered samples will exhibit sensitivity to the adopted protocol and the degree of purging undertaken as a consequence of the varying degree of heterogeneity permeability and contaminant adjacent to a well screen pump intake position and water level protocols involving sampling after purging of low screen volumes particularly up to 1 sv and potentially 2 sv may be vulnerable to poor repeatability as a consequence of marked sample concentration variability over these purged volumes this is particularly true where formation contamination varies markedly with depth indeed a default expectation at dnapl sites it is inferred here that zero minimal purge sample concentrations may be sensitive to sampler positioning in the well screen and the presence of any distinct stratification of contamination where high temporal concentration sensitivity is apparent over a 1sv purge and probable at dnapl sites this may not unreasonably translate to an expectation of high sensitivity of zero minimal purge sample concentrations to deployment depths and vice versa there would be an onus to evaluate the degree of in well mixing and contaminant redistribution versus contaminant stratification britt et al 2014 to justify adoption of a depth specific zero minimal purge type sample protocol low flow sampling protocols typically advocate sampling after stabilization of well head parameters as an indicator of representative formation water fluxes us epa 2017 but do not specify a minimum number of screen or well volumes to be purged in view of the lack of sensitivity of typical well head parameters to dissolved phase dnapl contaminant presence we recommend low flow sampling protocols should also routinely record a minimum number of screen volumes to be purged to quantify the degree of purging undertaken this work suggests 1 sv at minimum 2 sv to allow good sample confidence and 3 sv to allow high sample confidence recognizing decreasing time efficiency and cost effectiveness the objective being to ensure sampled water is in quasi steady state interaction with the formation such volumes are consistent with the recommendations of martin hayden et al 2014 who illustrate a partial purge condition may persist over c 3 sv in passing we concur with the recommendation of martin hayden et al and robin and gillham 1987 that where the pump intake is positioned within the well screen and there is insignificant drawdown screen volumes should be used as the unit of measure for quantification of purging as they are technically more defensible than well volumes and constant with time as introduced earlier there is debate between potentially onerous low flow purging of multiple screen volumes and the comparative ease of zero minimal purge sampling but also a recognised need to aim for consistency in monitoring well sampling approaches protocols should aim to capture the key concentration features and avoid undue or unknown sensitivity of concentrations to sample depth or purge time this is challenging in dnapl source zone areas however our generalised recommendations for monitoring well based protocols that are pragmatic for such environments include protocols should be developed bespoke to individual wells but aim to have commonality among wells where possible pumped samples using low flow rates should ideally only be taken after purging at least 1 sv to overcome much of the expected initial sample concentration variability however the potential for concentration temporal variability should be initially and occasionally examined by sampling over 2 3 sv purged or more purged volumes should be recorded to evaluate potential concentration sensitivity to volume variation between sampling events where it is deemed impractical to routinely remove at least 1 sv using low flow rates justification should be demonstrated by an initial validation in which samples are taken after removal of at least 1 sv but ideally up to 3 sv whilst zero minimal purge methods were not used in this study their deployment in dnapl source zones should be used cautiously and demonstrated by appropriate individual well validation e g deployment at several depths the underpinning relationship to purged concentration variation over at least 1 sv should be examined initially and ideally occasionally overall a key utility of monitoring wells is their potential cost effective monitoring of contaminant fluxes immediately down gradient of a dnapl source zone area in particular their proportionately greater sample draw from the more permeable horizons that constitute critical high mobility pathways of contaminant flux to the wider environment monitoring wells thereby capture an important representative fraction of the source mass flux that poses wider risk and may provide a valuable metric of overall bulk source dissolution with increasing source age however availability of complementary higher resolution e g mls data is important to help confirm contamination flux contributions from the less permeable horizons expected to prove increasingly important at late time indeed the additional interpretive understanding demonstrated in this study by acquiring higher resolution monitoring data mls concentration and k data primarily supplemented by a detailed tracer test and integrative pumped cell capture of contaminant fluxes to complement the monitoring well data is significant little of the detailed understanding developed may be discerned from the monitoring well installations alone without reducing to ultra short screen wells c 0 3 m being a realistic practical minimum in summary short screen monitoring wells sampled with validated and informed protocols are shown to have valuable utility in the assessment of dnapl source zone areas and expected to remain a cost effective site assessment tool however it is essential that complementary high resolution site data are acquired via the aforementioned technologies to help inform interpretation of the monitoring well data collected optimising this data partnership is viewed critical to the cost effective advancement of the site conceptual model and for informed remedial design implementation and performance monitoring

1676,groundwater quality assessment at contaminated sites often involves the use of short screen 1 5 to 3 m monitoring wells however even over these intervals considerable variation may occur in contaminant concentrations in groundwater adjacent to the well screen this is especially true in heterogeneous dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl source zones where cm scale contamination variability may call into question the effectiveness of monitoring wells to deliver representative data the utility of monitoring wells in such settings is evaluated by reference to high resolution multilevel sampler mls wells located proximally to short screen wells together with sampling capture zone modelling to explore controls upon well sample provenance and sensitivity to monitoring protocols field data are analysed from the highly instrumented sabre research site that contained an old trichloroethene source zone within a shallow alluvial aquifer at a uk industrial facility with increased purging monitoring well samples tend to a flow weighted average concentration but may exhibit sensitivity to the implemented protocol and degree of purging formation heterogeneity adjacent to the well screen particularly alongside pump intake position and water level influence this sensitivity purging of low volumes is vulnerable to poor reproducibility arising from concentration variability predicted over the initial 1 to 2 screen volumes purged marked heterogeneity may also result in limited long term sample concentration stabilization development of bespoke monitoring protocols that consider screen volumes purged alongside water quality indicator parameter stabilization is recommended to validate and reduce uncertainty when interpreting monitoring well data within source zone areas generalised recommendations on monitoring well based protocols are also developed a key monitoring well utility is their proportionately greater sample draw from permeable horizons constituting a significant contaminant flux pathway and hence representative fraction of source mass flux acquisition of complementary high resolution site monitoring data however vitally underpins optimal interpretation of monitoring well datasets and appropriate advancement of a site conceptual model and remedial implementation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater sampling monitoring wells groundwater quality low flow sampling dnapl flow weighted average fwa concentration 1 introduction monitoring wells have been used extensively worldwide for the assessment of groundwater quality at contaminated sites barber and davis 1987 basu et al 2006 fdep 2008 fretwell et al 2006 puls and paul 1997 even though most wells nowadays are screened over relatively short intervals of 1 5 to 3 m 5 to 10 ft the variation in groundwater quality within the screen adjacent geological formation over even these length scales may still be considerable at dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contaminated sites orders of magnitude changes in dissolved phase concentrations may occur locally in source zone areas arising from the marked spatial variability in the occurrence of residual dnapl contributing to dissolved phase plume contaminaion guilbeault et al 2005 johnston et al 2013 parker et al 2003 rivett and feenstra 2005 resolution of this variability may be required to better understand where the principal fluxes of contamination originate from also where to surgically target remediation efforts to address discretely layered persistent dnapl and diffused secondary source zone mass within low permeability units increasingly characteristic in later stages of source zone aging kueper et al 2014 rivett et al 2014 justifiably the utility of monitoring wells even short screen to deliver data appropriate to develop such surgical efforts may be called into question although monitoring wells will typically detect the presence of a dnapl source area via the observation of elevated concentrations relative to the wider site pumped groundwater samples will provide an averaged concentration drawn from across the well screen length theoretically under a steady state flow condition a pumped sample should provide a flow weighted average fwa concentration i e an average of the formation s vertical heterogeneous concentration distribution weighted by the vertical distribution of flow rates or formation hydraulic conductivities k in a flow system characterised by horizontal gradients martin hayden and britt 2006 mcmillan et al 2014 puls and barcelona 1996 a wide spectrum of methods has become available to sample monitoring wells with potential to deliver a fwa concentration britt et al 2010 itrc 2007 mchugh et al 2016 parsons 2005 puls and barcelona 1996 us epa 2010 2013 2017 vroblesky 2001 these may be categorized under zero minimal purge protocols using grab or passive diffusion based samplers that remove none or a very small water volume prior to sampling and effectively obtain a grab sample of the ambient flow regime occurring at the point or interval monitored within the well screen low flow low stress protocols that purge and sample at low flow rates until indicator parameter stabilization occurs and may involve low to moderate volumes of water being extracted to achieve this condition multiple well volume purging fixed volume purge protocols that are based upon a specified number of well volumes being purged prior to sampling our focus is upon pumped samples and hence low flow and multiple well volume purging protocols but cognizant of the fact that the ambient conditions existent within the well screen that control a zero minimal purge protocol sample provenance also constitute the initial condition to and remain influential during purging progressed under the studied protocols the in well ambient condition is perhaps surprisingly complex and can be difficult to predict a priori whilst natural gradient through flow across the well screen fundamentally occurs with cross well lateral flushing rates controlled by the formation k profile robin and gillham 1987 the in well stratified contamination resulting may be variously perturbed formation vertical hydraulic gradients may induce up downward in well flows in well mixing re distribution may also arise from convection due to temperature gradients and fluid density effects lateral or vertical flow turbulence and contaminant diffusion gradients martin hayden and britt 2006 mcmillan et al 2014 itrc 2006 2007 vroblesky et al 2006 a fwa concentration may only arise for a zero minimal purge sample if full mixing of just groundwater flowing through the screen section occurs more probable is that heterogeneous groundwater concentrations entering the well are irregularly and incompletely mixed alongside possible mixing with blank casing water that is susceptible to convection martin hayden and britt 2006 the more recent work of britt et al 2014 concludes that whilst most wells are expected to experience significant redistribution effects some wells may maintain stratification or potentially even re stratify differently from the surrounding formation under both low flow and multiple well volume purging protocols provided that a steady state flow condition is reached then a fwa concentration is expected varljen et al 2006 whether purge times and hence purged volumes are adequate to attain a steady state fwa sample concentration however is a key issue martin hayden 2000 martin hayden et al 2014 mcmillan et al 2014 the variation in delayed arrival times within the sample taken of groundwater entering the monitoring well screen at distance from the pump intake becomes of critical significance here martin hayden et al 2014 where protocols are based upon a specified number of standing water well or screen volumes purged prior to sampling then greater volumes increase the likelihood of a steady state fwa sample being obtained for low flow low stress sampling protocols where steady state conditions are evidenced by stabilization of the pumping water level and water quality indicator parameters ec ph etc puls and barcelona 1996 us epa 2010 2017 these protocols typically do not indicate a minimum purged volume other than to specify it exceeds any well drawdown measured and sample equipment volume where comparatively low volumes are purged then a partial rather than full purge of the original standing well or screen water volume will occur martin hayden et al 2014 and samples may then be expected to variously approach but not fully constitute a fwa sample concentration it is clear from the above that understanding the influence of employed protocols upon monitoring well assessment of heterogeneous dnapl source zone areas is of critical importance whilst higher resolution site assessment alternative technologies have become increasingly recommended anneser et al 2008 basu et al 2009 kram et al 2001 itrc 2015 their use is still perceived to represent a small fraction of the site characterization effort worldwide that still predominantly involves monitoring wells alternatives to characterize source zone mass distribution include detailed core sampling parker et al 2003 inter well partitioning tracer tests annable et al 1998 and direct push methods involving direct water sampling groundwater profiling and indirect measurements using sensor based tools such as the membrane interface probe adamson et al 2014 guilbeault et al 2005 alternatives to resolve dissolved phase plume mass fluxes include multi level sampler mls transect monitoring basu et al 2006 béland pelletier et al 2011 johnston et al 2013 as well as those extending monitoring well or long screen borehole utility such as passive flux meter annable et al 2005 integral pumping test béland pelletier et al 2011 or flexible membrane liner approaches cherry et al 2007 such alternatives despite their benefits can still be perceived as onerous mls transect monitoring for instance may be viewed not cost effective due to the sheer numbers of mls point samples involved and the large resource allocated to a small albeit important locality within the much larger site this view is perhaps reasonable when it is recognised that even research based studies cai et al 2012 king et al 1999 kao and wang 2001 einarson and mackay 2001 may fail to achieve mls transect minimum sample densities necessary to estimate mass discharge with quantified uncertainty brooks et al 2015 li et al 2007 it is concluded that the continued use of monitoring wells to characterize source zones is not because they are technically more effective than alternative assessment options typically they are not expected to be but rather they offer a cost effective easily implemented and widely accepted approach to site assessment that can be implemented from the detailed source zone to greater site scales to give an integrated but reasonable indication of contamination present recognizing the conundrum that monitoring well use is hence non ideal but set to continue into the foreseeable future it remains imperative that monitoring wells are not simply used as an unthinking default option rather we seek to better understand and improve upon their utility including their collaborative use with the aforementioned higher resolution alternatives alongside considered interpretation this ambition provides critical impetus to the research herein surprisingly few site studies have evaluated the detailed origin of groundwater sampled by monitoring wells despite their near ubiquitous use available studies whilst offering explanations for sample provenance hutchins and acree 2000 mcdonald and smith 2009 metcalf and robbins 2007 puls and paul 1997 reilly and leblanc 1998 sukop 2000 typically lack the ideal of detailed corroborating data this notably includes data afforded by proximal high resolution mls transects that could be used to estimate groundwater flows and concentrations contributing to a well sample from the horizons screened furthermore the above studies have often focused upon monitoring wells boreholes with screen lengths over 3 m sometimes considerably so our field based research has been conducted at the sabre source area bioremediation site located in the uk where a trichloroethene tce dnapl source area has been intensively monitored prior to and throughout a pilot scale bioremediation field trial buss et al 2010 the historic industrial spill site provided a unique field scale opportunity to compare traditional monitoring well sampling with proximal mls transect data and develop insight to the provenance of monitoring well samples within an aged dnapl source zone set within a typically heterogeneous sand gravel aquifer the goal was to use field scale evidence gained from conventional monitoring well and proximal mls sampling together with supporting numerical model simulation of monitoring well capture zones to better understand the provenance of samples obtained during conventional sampling focusing on low flow and multiple well volume purging of typical short screen monitoring wells objectives were to evaluate proximal mls monitoring well data within the existing sabre research study field dataset obtained during baseline monitoring and bioremediation phases to use numerical flow and transport modelling to inform the field scale study interpretation and to explore sensitivities to monitoring well sample origins and sampling protocols and to consider the implications of sampling scale and well screen length for practitioners regarding the utility of monitoring wells particularly within dnapl source zone areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and historical field data overview specific data relevant to our project aim were drawn from the larger dataset of the sabre project concerning the in situ bioremediation of an aged tce dnapl source zone buss et al 2010 dearden et al 2010a harkness et al 2012 robinson et al 2009 wilson and cai 2010 zeeb and houlden 2010 the source area contamination is the result of tce releases from subsurface effluent pipes at a chemical manufacturing plant in the uk midlands over a plant operational period spanning 20 to 45 years prior to the sabre study the source zone architecture has been shown in detail to be spatially heterogeneous rivett et al 2014 the shallow aquifer underlying the site consists of c 1 m of made ground overlying c 5 m of superficial quaternary alluvium and river terrace gravels chambers et al 2010 dearden et al 2013 below this lies c 50 m of relatively impermeable triassic mudstone mercia mudstone group which may be weathered in the top 0 5 to 1 25 m chambers et al 2010 the quaternary deposits are heterogeneous they are generally finer in the upper c 1 2 m and comprise a sequence of alluvial sands silts and clays with mm scale laminations lelliot et al 2008 chambers et al 2010 these finer deposits grade into c 4 m of poorly sorted river terrace deposits the river terrace deposits comprise coarser sands and gravels formed from river channel deposition the water table is typically 1 2 m bgl below ground level with hydraulic gradients of 0 001 0 002 towards a local river chambers et al 2010 dearden et al 2013 a key feature of the sabre project of advantage to our study was the constrained known groundwater flow regime afforded by the installation of the 3 sided u shaped sabre test cell comprising sealed plastic sheet pile walls keyed into the underlying mudstone aquitard fig 1 the cell was oriented parallel to the prevailing groundwater flow direction and isolated a portion of the dnapl source zone around 3 13 m along the cell length buss et al 2010 rivett et al 2014 the cell is open upgradient of the source zone to allow groundwater inflow with an abstraction well positioned at the closed cell end that controlled groundwater flow rates and residence time along the length of the cell streamtube created the well abstraction rate during cell operation of 1 4 1 6 l min was chosen to give groundwater velocities of 0 7 m d comparable to the natural and a nominal cell residence time of around 42 days cai et al 2012 rivett et al 2014 cell water levels as measured at sw70 and sw75 monitoring wells and t2a and t3a transects fig 1 were variable during cell operation typically values were 2 4 m bgl with decreasing water levels ascribed to partial cell dewatering from clogging at the entrance reducing cell inflow rates part way through the study then overcome by additional groundwater pumping into the cell we draw upon data from the seven detailed sampling operations table 1 conducted during the 2 year operational period buss et al 2010 the initial three sampling operations op 1 to op 3 were during the baseline pre bioremediation period and the remaining four during the bioremediation phase op 4 to op 7 involving electron donor injection and bioaugmentation harkness and fisher 2013 cai et al 2012 increased occurrence of tce dechlorination products cdce cis dichloroethene vc vinyl chloride aka chloroethene and eth ethene was found during this later phase wilson and cai 2010 high resolution groundwater monitoring was undertaken in the source zone and in the down gradient dissolved phase plume using mls transects installed both perpendicular to and parallel with groundwater flow in addition to the mls transects a number of 3 m screen 50 mm diameter monitoring wells were installed two such monitoring wells and their adjoining mls transects comprise the focus of this study monitoring well sw70 positioned close to the down gradient boundary of the dnapl source zone and monitoring well sw75 within the dissolved plume down gradient of the source fig 1 mls transects t2a and t3a provided very proximal depth discrete contaminant concentration distribution data from their positions immediately upgradient of sw70 and sw75 respectively these transects each contained seven mlss that were spaced equally across the cell at 0 5 m intervals each mls comprised a bundle of nine hdpe 10 mm internal diameter sampling tubes completed at different depths the lowermost 15 cm interval of each tube was slotted and over wrapped in geotextile to serve as a discrete sampling port mls ports were spaced at 0 5 m intervals vertically and installed to monitor the 4 m thick superficial aquifer immediately overlying the mudstone fig 1 a total of 63 ports within each transect spaced 0 5 m laterally and vertically hence allowed detailed spatial characterization of contaminant concentrations in the cell passing sw70 and sw75 well screens that were centrally positioned laterally and vertically with respect to their associated mls transect c 1 m up gradient sw70 and sw75 were sampled using a 12 v submersible pump wasp positioned just within the lower 1 m interval of the well screen interval pumping was undertaken at rates of 1 5 l min with the motivation that traditional purged monitoring well water quality samples would result purged water was monitored for stabilization of water quality parameters with removal of a minimum of 3 well volumes 24 l assuming typical rest water levels at 2 m bgl prior to taking samples for voc volatile organic compound and supporting hydrochemical analysis similar to martin hayden et al 2014 we later report and simulate time variant data as screen volumes sv removed purged as opposed to well volumes for a 3 m 50 mm diameter well screen 3 sv is equivalent to 18 l with minimal drawdown sampling where the pump intake is located within the well screen little sample water is expected to originate from the blank casing also the screen volume is fixed across different sampling events as long as drawdown remains above the top of the well screen t2a and t3a mls transects were sampled at 200 ml min using a peristaltic pump transect port samples within 10 mm diameter tubes were taken following chemical stabilization with a minimum of 3 sample tube volumes removed prior to sampling low water table conditions meant it was not always possible to sample all transect ports on all occasions in addition to the transect and monitoring well sampling data other sabre project data drawn upon included 1

falling head tests on t2a and t3a used to provide initial estimates of k distribution at sw70 and sw75 cai et al 2012 3 conservative bromide tracer test breakthrough times at t2a used to provide additional evidence of cell transport pathways away from the source zone the conservative tracer test was undertaken from injection wells located 5 m upgradient of t2a dearden et al 2010b monitoring at t2a was undertaken 14 times over the 25 day period of that test 2 2 numerical modelling approach the aim of numerical modelling was twofold to examine quantitatively inferences on sw70 and sw75 monitoring well sample origin via simulation of well capture zones based on the observed field data and to examine the groundwater quality samples which might have resulted had different sampling approaches been undertaken and hence to comment on sampling best practice modelled scenarios incorporate the field observed heterogeneity in formation permeability and contaminant distributions the numerical model assumes darcy s law flow within the aquifer and wellbore and does not consider the sensitivity to alternative wellbore flow representations e g poiseuille flow viscous effects these are examined for instance by martin hayden et al 2014 within a homogeneous aquifer setting to which the reader is referred numerical modelling of the cell during the sabre sampling operations was undertaken using modpath 5 pollock 1994 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 in conjunction with modflow harbaugh et al 2000 calculated specific discharges the scope of modelling excluded direct simulation of the evolution of chemical concentrations in the cell between sampling operations rather individual simulations of transient flow and transport during monitoring well sampling were undertaken separately for each sabre sampling operation tce cdce and vc were all included in the numerical modelling particle tracking using modpath was used to assess advective well capture zones and compare simulated tracer test transport velocities to those observed in the conservative tracer test dearden et al 2010b 2 2 1 model setup the unconfined model domain fig 2 is a simplified representation of the sabre cell the model domain is 29 m long 4 m wide and 6 m deep and comprises 101 columns 51 rows and 200 layers the monitoring and abstraction wells are represented explicitly using a single column of very high k 106 m d cells the high k cells extend from the top of the model to the bottom of the screen interval of each well the well casing is represented by modflow s wall boundary condition with a k value of 10 7 m d and thickness of 0 01 m the model grid is refined in the vicinity of the wells such that model well cross sectional areas are equivalent to the real world well dimensions grid refinement is reduced away from the wells up to a maximum row column width of 0 13 m uniform layer spacing of 0 03 m is used between 1 5 and 6 m bgl above this which for the majority of the model is above the water table the layer heights incrementally increase up to a maximum of 0 4 m in the top layer the pump intake located near the base of monitoring well screen interval in accordance with the field protocol is explicitly represented using modflow s well boundary condition simulated pumping rates were initially set to 1 l min with sensitivity to increased and decreased pumping rate also investigated effluent discharge from the cell was simulated via a well boundary condition abstracting at a rate of 1 4 l min placed in the middle of the screen interval location transient sampling simulations were of 60 minute duration to allow examination up to and beyond the time to remove 3 well volumes 24 l at 1 l min changes in wider groundwater heads are assumed negligible over this short duration and hence the only model inflows are via a steady state general head boundary ghb at the left hand side of the domain recharge was assumed to be zero cell was covered and boundaries with the underlying aquitard and sheet pile walls assumed impermeable and hence assigned as no flow boundaries in the model observed heads in wells located immediately outside the cell remained roughly constant at c 1 2 m bgl during sabre cell operation the right hand ghb head is hence 1 2 m bgl with conductance configured distance 100 m k 0 5 m d such that initial heads at t2a and t3a matched those observed c 2 m bgl for t2a c 2 5 m bgl for t3a the exception was during operations 5 and 7 when cell dewatering had resulted in decreased heads for these simulations the ghb was lowered to 2 2 m bgl such that the water table was c 3 m bgl at t2a and c 4 m bgl at t3a extrapolation interpolation of falling head test derived hydraulic conductivity k and sampled t2a and t3a concentration data for each operation served to provide initial model k and chlorinated ethene concentration distributions that provided a representative source of dissolved phase voc concentrations surrounding and available to the pumped monitoring wells the complexity of explicit representation of dnapl dissolution was hence avoided and considered not warranted for the study aim ordinary kriging was used to interpolate laterally across the cell at t2a and t3a and linear interpolation to assign values between the kriged k distributions at t2a and t3a upgradient of t2a and downgradient of t3a k and concentration distributions were extrapolated these were assumed to be the same as t2a and t3a respectively this is recognised to be a simplification but not critical to the assessment of interactions local to the monitoring wells for concentration kriging non detects were set to the detection limit and non sampled ports were not included model porosity was set to the suggested cell average 0 25 cai et al 2012 specific yield and specific storage were chosen to be 0 1 and 0 0001 respectively the heterogeneous k distribution in the model was assumed to account for large scale macro dispersion to simulate small scale dispersive processes local to the monitoring wells and to ensure model stability model longitudinal dispersivity was set to 0 04 m around 10 of local modelled capture zone radial distance over sampling timeframes simulated and the transverse dispersivity to 10 of that value 0 004 m a standard assumption retardation due to sorption was reasonably ignored due to the low transport distances and timescales simulated recognizing relatively low sorption is anticipated in high concentration dnapl environments rivett and allen king 2003 alongside the modest difference in sorption potential between the chlorinated ethenes involved 2 2 2 model calibration and performance model performance was assessed by comparing the fit of simulated monitoring well sample concentrations with observed concentrations non exhaustive manual calibration of t2a and t3a k distributions was used to explore improvement in model concentration fit statistics achievable through realistic and constrained adjustment of transect k values constraining t2a k adjustment involved comparison of tracer test peak arrival times to t2a with model simulated times to better define the velocity distribution through the transect this resulted in greater weighting of faster flow paths traced by the test and hence their more prominent representation within the calibrated model for t3a adjustments in k weighted estimates of total chlorinated ethenes mass flux through t3a were constrained by their expected equality with the overall cell abstraction well mass flux equality of t3a water flux to the cell abstraction rate also being assumed spatial chemical concentrations interpolated from t2a t3a were assumed fixed throughout the calibration process albeit recognizing similar to k these may not fully represent actual conditions summary residual statistics root mean square error rmse and residual bias represented the overall model fit these statistics were calculated using results from both monitoring wells for all chemical components and operations 1 rmse o 1 7 c 1 3 w 1 2 y ocw y ocw 2 42 2 bias o 1 7 c 1 3 w 1 2 y ocw y ocw 42 where o is the operation 1 7 c is the chlorinated ethene component tce cdce or vc w is the monitoring well sw70 or sw75 y ocw is the modelled sample value for a particular operation chemical and monitoring well and y ocw the observed sample value the field protocol involved sw70 and sw75 being purged for a minimum of 3 well volumes typically 4 screen volumes with inline water quality parameters allowed to stabilize before sampling with hence some variation of purge times possible model simulations simply assumed a purging time greater than the time to remove 3 well volumes c 24 min being a typical timeframe for each set of model parameters calibration results were reported at 5 min intervals assuming purging times between 25 and 60 min plotted simulated estimates used the purging time result at which overall residual summary statistics were minimised 2 2 3 predictive modelling predictive modelling using a non exhaustive range of scenarios table 2 was undertaken with the aim to investigate the effect pumping rate pumping time and pump intake position might have had on monitoring well sample concentrations in the sabre cell pumping rates were selected to span a range from low flow 0 3 l min to higher 1 and 2 5 l min but not untypical rates used to sample 3 m screen monitoring wells predictive modelling was undertaken using the final calibrated k distribution resulting from the observed monitoring well data fits 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed mls transect and monitoring well data orders of magnitude variation in concentration was observed across the mls transects t2a fig 3 and t3a fig 4 both spatially and with time proximity to the heterogeneous dnapl source and weakness of transverse dispersion are probable key factors leading to this high level of variability total not shown and individual chlorinated ethenes could locally and sometimes extensively approach literature tce molar solubility values c 8400 to 10 700 μm and accords with close proximity of mls points to the dnapl source zone t3a generally exhibited greater concentrations at depth 4 m bgl with t2a presenting a more complex distribution with low concentrations of tce above 4 m bgl contrasting with elevated cdce values the reverse distribution is observed below 4 m bgl chlorinated ethene concentrations remained relatively stable during the baseline period operations 1 3 whilst daughter products were observed in both transects their relative occurrence was variable across the cell a comparative absence of tce above 4 m bgl in t2a was observed fig 3 with increased cdce by contrast below 4 m bgl relatively high tce concentrations remained with daughter products making up a much smaller contribution to total chlorinated ethene mass variation laterally across transects was marked in some cases and absent in others where concentration appeared more layered monitoring well concentrations were relatively stable over the baseline period fig 3 and 4 op1 op3 sw 70 concentrations of tce at 1765 1826 μm were elevated compared to cdce at 649 835 μm and vc at 176 320 μm the relative increase in daughter products in the upper half of t2a during the baseline conditions was not reflected in sw70 samples fig 3 sw75 baseline samples were similarly reflective of the higher chlorinated ethene concentrations observed in the lower half of t3a rather than the low concentrations observed above 4 m bgl fig 4 total molar chlorinated ethene concentrations at both sw70 and sw75 during the baseline not shown were 10 of the tce molar solubility and hence provided some endorsement of the so called 1 10 solubility rule of thumb pankow and cherry 1996 us epa 1992 often used by practitioners to be indicative of possible presence of dnapl upgradient during bioremediation enrichment in dechlorination daughter products and depletion of tce were observed in both monitoring wells and mls transects figs 3 and 4 op4 op7 total chlorinated ethene molar concentrations observed even in monitoring well samples approached or exceeded tce molar solubility this could potentially reflect enhanced dissolution effects at the site rivett et al 2014 k distributions measured at t2a and t3a were heterogeneous fig 3 and fig 4 hydraulic conductivity was generally greater within transect t2a 1 to 28 m d than within transect t3a 0 1 to 14 m d values were also generally larger in the upper alluvium above 2 m bgl marked variation in k was apparent in the poorly sorted river terrace gravels at depth with an area of higher k observed in both transects at 5 m bgl this high k zone appeared restricted to the right hand side of the cell at t2a but extends the full width of the cell at t3a 3 2 provenance of monitoring well samples pumped monitoring well samples as a first approximation may be expected to yield a fwa of adjacent formation concentrations occasional observations were made of monitoring well concentrations approaching minimum or maximum concentrations recorded within adjacent transects figs 3 and 4 it is usefully inferred from such occurrences that sample provenance must be strongly biased towards similarly high or low concentration zones found in the adjacent formation with little contribution to the sample concentration from other parts of the transect hence sw70 sample provenance was strongly biased towards the highly conductive zone towards the lower right hand side of the cell although less clear for sw75 the data generally support sample provenance was from the more permeable formation at depth but less strongly biased towards the right hand side of the cell than encountered for sw70 the provenance of monitoring well samples is further evaluated in fig 5 where observed monitoring well concentrations are plotted against calculated well concentrations based on mls transect k weighted concentrations k weighted concentration estimates from the mls ports directly down gradient spanning the vertical screen interval solid circles in fig 5b and g that potentially represented the most appropriate fwa concentration estimate available provided only moderate prediction of observed sw70 and sw75 sample concentrations fig 5c and h k weighted concentrations using selectively sampled concentrations drawn from the high k zones in both t2a and t3a dashed circles in fig 5b and g provided much improved predictions of observed monitoring well concentrations for chlorinated ethenes fig 5d and i as well as for chloride and sulfate fig 5e and j for which a particularly good fit was observed with very low rmse and bias values calculated our preliminary conclusion is that well inflows were more complex than can be judged from simplistic consideration of the k distribution corresponding to projected location of the well on the upgradient transect the monitoring well sample is likely to have contributions from across the screen interval however k contrasts are such that these contributions appear to be dominated by inflows from the highest k zone s at depth furthermore 2 or 3 dimensional rather than simple 1 dimensional information is required to assess the sampling interaction of the monitoring well with its surrounding formation 3 3 monitoring well sample bias towards preferential transport pathways temporal variance across sampling operations was not uniform in space fig 5b and g particularly for t2a and to a lesser extent t3a areas of the mls transect associated with smaller changes in concentration with time generally coincided with areas of lower k fig 5a and f and conversely greater temporal changes were generally associated with zones of higher k the more permeable horizons act as preferential pathways for transport away from the source zone and thus reflect enhanced concentration variation resulting from changes to dnapl dissolution caused by bioremediation because monitoring well results are weighted to reflect conditions within preferential transport pathways sw70 and sw75 likewise sample concentrations exhibiting a relatively high temporal variance fig 5 note coloration of well screen depicts temporal variance of well samples such monitoring well observations further underscore the importance of the high k zones contributing to monitoring well sample provenance and suggest that the monitoring wells usefully reflect concentrations occurring in pathways that are important to voc transport through the test cell the significance of spatial continuity of the high k zone at c 5 m bgl towards the lower right side of t2a is further highlighted by the bromide tracer test contoured in fig 6 breakthrough supplementary material video v1 fastest breakthrough at t2a 0 25 d fig 6 and peak tracer concentrations were each observed in this high k zone analysis of a plume longitudinal snapshot sample along the cell length at 6 days not shown confirmed tracer had migrated 25 m down the cell and confirmed maximum and mean cell velocities of 3 4 m d and 2 1 m d respectively rivett et al 2014 such velocities resulted in estimates of minimum and mean travel times between sw70 and the abstraction well of 4 25 5 d and 8 1 d respectively travel times from sw75 to the abstraction well are approximately one quarter of those from sw70 to the abstraction well these times are much shorter than those predicted from the nominal cell pore volume calculation earlier and again point to the continuity and significance of localized preferential flow paths along the cell length the concentrations as total moles of parent and daughter products measured at abstraction wells that captured the cell effluent and hence expected to be indicative of a k weighted average concentration moving through the bulk cell reasonably compared to those measured at sw70 and sw75 during both the baseline and bioremediation phases fig 7a this is noteworthy given the orders of magnitude variation in concentration observed within the t2a and t3a transect points and provides a further line of evidence that the monitoring well samples may be reasonably representative of the overall bulk concentration dissolving from the dnapl source zone and transported through the cell 3 4 numerical modelling results numerical modelling of individual monitoring well capture zones provided additional insights into sample provenance simulated sample concentrations for purge times of 24 to 60 min were compared with observed data not shown the best match to monitoring well sample concentrations was obtained after 30 min of simulated pumping and is shown in fig 8c g for cell simulations based on the observed uncalibrated k distribution interpolated extrapolated from t2a and t3a data for sw70 the matches with observed tce and vc were generally good however cdce concentrations were overestimated for sw75 tce concentrations were underestimated particularly in operations 4 to 7 model predictions using the observed k distribution were similar to those obtained by averaging directly upgradient port concentrations fig 5c and h insufficient weighting importance appeared to be allocated to well inflows from the high k zone at 5 m bgl to generate the concentrations observed at the monitoring wells use of calibration model k distributions section 2 2 2 allowed improved monitoring well concentration matches to be obtained fig 8 transect t2a k calibration used for well sw70 predictions was constrained by use of the tracer test velocity estimates fig 6 and t3a k calibration used for well sw75 simulations by improved prediction of the overall cell abstraction mass flux from t3a mass flux data fig 7b the calibrated model k distributions achieved are shown fig 8b f to retain the style for the most part of the field observed k distributions fig 8a e see later discussion of t3a departure improved simulation of observed concentrations using the calibrated k model fig 8c compared to fig 8d fig 8g compared to fig 8h was largely ascribed to the relative accentuation of flows to monitoring wells from the inferred preferential flow zones located to the lower right side of each transect in the calibrated model compared to flow regimes simulated with the observed k distribution the accentuation of preferential flows invoked within this part of the t2a transect is corroborated by the rapid breakthrough of much of the tracer in this zone at 1 2 d fig 6 this time compares to the calibrated model estimate of 2 7 d but is significantly below the observed k distribution model estimate of 7 9 d the difference in monitoring well simulated capture zones between observed and calibrated model k distributions assumed is shown in fig 9 the difference is more significant in sw70 compare fig 9a and b and illustrates the k distribution caused the majority of the sample to be drawn from the lower half of the screen interval even after 60 min after 15 min of pumping removal of 2 5 screen volumes from sw70 and sw75 the well capture zone had still not spread to encompass the entire screen interval the elapsed time as screen volumes purged until a screen integrated sample is achieved depends on the relative volumes of water entering different parts of the screen and translocation to the pump intake this volume is a function of screen inflows and therefore the k distribution sensitivity testing confirmed that the simulated monitoring well concentration was relatively insensitive to the model k distribution in regions not immediately adjacent to the screened interval both laterally and above the screen interval rather it was the local relative contrast in k immediately adjacent to the screen interval that assumed most importance in determining the contribution to sample concentration from different parts of the screen interval the k value of the low k zones adjacent to the upper screen interval in both sw70 and sw75 fig 8a e were similar however the contribution to the pumped sample from the low k zone adjacent to sw70 is much smaller reduced sample distances travelled than that from the low k zone adjacent to sw75 fig 9 this is ascribed to the greater a factor of c 2 permeability contrast adjacent to the screen at depth in sw70 compared to sw75 in determining well inflows it is hence the relative difference in permeabilities occurring across a screen length that is important and not the absolute values the connectivity of the more permeable zones adjacent to the well screen with the distribution and orientation of permeable horizons more remote from the well but immediately surrounding and supplying inflow to these zones is assumed to influence the wider sample provenance observed abstraction well total chlorinated ethenes mass flux rates for all but two of the sampling operations op 5 and op 7 were significantly underestimated using the observed t3a k distribution to provide a darcy flux concentration based estimate of chlorinated ethenes mass flux through this transect fig 7b this was despite a relatively high sampling density at t3a 3 75 points m2 cai et al 2012 observed t3a k distributions excessively weight abstraction well contributions from the top half of the cell improved matches for operations 5 and 7 were attributed to low water levels and corresponding absence of flow and mass from higher elevations a good match to abstraction well mass flux estimates across all operations fig 7b was achieved only after model calibration which almost entirely excluded flows to the abstraction well from the upper half of the cell at t3a by assuming substantially reduced permeability at upper cell elevations of t3a compare fig 8f to fig 8e the probable reality is that continuity of the low k layer in t3a at 3 to 4 m bgl fig 8e limited shallow groundwater flows to the cell abstraction well screen this interpretation is endorsed by distinct chlorinated ethene concentrations above and below 4 m bgl in t3a and cross cell hydraulic heads recorded in t3a where heads were consistently higher above 3 5 m bgl supplementary material fig sm1 it is conceptualized that some leakage of shallow groundwater may occur across the low k layer with associated convergence of flows and contamination into the deeper screened aquifer dominant flows are however through the permeable cell horizons at depth such conceptual understanding is consistent with interpretations hitherto made of flows sampled by the monitoring wells and core lithological data not shown 3 4 1 predictive modelling of alternative sampling strategies simulation of long time 3 screen volumes sv purged sampling suggest that monitoring well sample concentration in sw70 and sw75 was insensitive to the pumping rate and pump intake positions used fig 10 this result is expected given steady state screen inflow rates dependent on the variation in k local to the screen interval as groundwater from contributing horizons reaches the pump intake a quasi steady state mixing is achieved regardless of pumping rate and pump intake location in sw70 and sw75 this is further explained in fig 11a and fig 11b which show similar well inflow profile variability with depth for the various pump rate and positions simulated the exception was if drawdown was sufficient to drop water levels below the screen interval during operations 5 and 7 cell water levels were within the screen interval at sw75 for these two operations the long time screen inflows depended on the pumping induced drawdown in the well and hence the pumping rate fig 11c interestingly while screen inflows varied with pumping rate during operations 5 and 7 in sw75 simulated sw75 monitoring well concentrations varied little fig 10 this lack of simulated sample concentration variation with pumping rate is attributed to the small contribution to total screen inflow from the top half of the screen due to bias towards the high k zone at 5 m bgl convergence of flow from higher up in the formation towards the well as evidenced by the small peaks in the inflow profiles at the water level in fig 11c meaning groundwater from higher in the aquifer still makes a contribution to sample concentration early time 3 sv simulated sample concentration was independent of pumping rate but did depend on the pump intake position fig 10 if a large concentration contrast existed across the screen interval e g op 1 tce fig 3 and fig 4 differences in early time simulated sample concentrations as a function of pump intake position were large where little or no concentration contrast existed with depth e g t3a vc concentrations during op1 3 fig 4 variation in sample concentration with pump intake location was small or negligible fig 10 the variation in simulated sample concentration during very early times was significant particularly over 1 sv purged by 1 2 sv variation was more limited this was also a function of the variation in chlorinated ethene concentration with depth adjacent the screen interval greatest sample variation with time occurred when variation in chlorinated ethene concentration across the screen interval was high e g during ops 1 3 for sw70 fig 3 fig 10 pump intake location can also be important in early time sample variation the greatest change in simulated sample concentration with time occurred when starting concentrations were very different from the k weighted long time average e g sw70 cdce ops 1 3 fig 3 fig 10 it can hence be reasonably inferred monitoring well sample concentrations obtained during low flow purging and indicator chemical parameter stabilization that involves removal of low volumes around 1 sv or less will be very sensitive to pump intake position especially where marked variability of concentrations occurs with depth a default expectation and hence issue for dnapl source zone areas concentration sensitivity over 1 sv purged but extending up to around 2 sv or more is similarly predicted by martin hayden et al 2014 even under homogeneous aquifer conditions alongside secondary sensitivity to the wellbore flow representation modelled in our model the initial well contaminant distribution reflected that found in the immediately upgradient multilevel assuming different initial conditions within the wellbore would clearly influence early time 1sv sampling predictions however the analytical solution of martin hayden 2000 suggests that the relationship between early time sampling variability and near screen vertical stratification in contamination remains even if the wellbore is assumed to be fully mixed this raises the possibility of using early time variations in sample concentration as an indicator of contaminant variability this though is likely impractical due to the inadequate timeframes to complete the collection of multiple early time samples required prior studies suggest purging of 3 sv is likely sufficient to obtain a quasi steady state sample from a monitoring well for example the modelling of martin hayden et al 2014 to account for partial mixing and transport times to the pump and the modelling of mcmillan et al 2014 to account for the delayed arrival of casing water at the pump our predictive model simulations support these prior conclusions after removal of 2 3 sv early time variations in sample concentration due to the influence of pump intake location or vertical contaminant stratification have largely been resolved with relative stability achieved as formation water is drawn from across the screen interval fig 9 furthermore though we also show that in such heterogeneous dnapl source zone environments a lower level of variability may persist beyond 2 3 sv fig 10 this long term variation was attributed to the arrival of more distant formation water of different concentrations to the pump intake location dispersion meant changes with time became less pronounced but it is likely that a truly stable sample concentration may not be attained 4 conclusions establishing the utility of short screen monitoring wells within heterogeneous dnapl source zones is important due to the widespread continued use of wells this is despite the availability of higher resolution technologies where heterogeneity and vertical head gradients are low monitoring well samples are weighted by vertical variations in hydraulic conductivity local to the screen at long sampling times corresponding to 3 screen volumes sv purged a quasi steady state flow condition is approached where the fwa concentration sample becomes independent of pump rate and intake position at early times however purged sample variability depends upon chemical stratification adjacent to the screen and the difference between initial well and long time fwa concentrations in chemically heterogeneous environments true sample chemical stability may never be reached where geological permeability varies over orders of magnitude mass flux from the high permeability zones will tend to dominate and sampled concentrations reflect contamination from these transmissive zones this was the case at the sabre site where monitoring well concentrations sampled the dominant aquifer contaminant flux and provided a representative indicator of dissolution and transport from the dnapl source it is hence concluded that careful well design and the development of bespoke monitoring protocols are needed to validate data from short screen wells used to monitor source zone areas individual well protocols are particularly merited here due to the greater contamination heterogeneity expected relative to areas more distant from the source area although expensive to develop such protocols may ultimately prove cost effective as risks of prolonged employment of inappropriate protocols are lowered samples will exhibit sensitivity to the adopted protocol and the degree of purging undertaken as a consequence of the varying degree of heterogeneity permeability and contaminant adjacent to a well screen pump intake position and water level protocols involving sampling after purging of low screen volumes particularly up to 1 sv and potentially 2 sv may be vulnerable to poor repeatability as a consequence of marked sample concentration variability over these purged volumes this is particularly true where formation contamination varies markedly with depth indeed a default expectation at dnapl sites it is inferred here that zero minimal purge sample concentrations may be sensitive to sampler positioning in the well screen and the presence of any distinct stratification of contamination where high temporal concentration sensitivity is apparent over a 1sv purge and probable at dnapl sites this may not unreasonably translate to an expectation of high sensitivity of zero minimal purge sample concentrations to deployment depths and vice versa there would be an onus to evaluate the degree of in well mixing and contaminant redistribution versus contaminant stratification britt et al 2014 to justify adoption of a depth specific zero minimal purge type sample protocol low flow sampling protocols typically advocate sampling after stabilization of well head parameters as an indicator of representative formation water fluxes us epa 2017 but do not specify a minimum number of screen or well volumes to be purged in view of the lack of sensitivity of typical well head parameters to dissolved phase dnapl contaminant presence we recommend low flow sampling protocols should also routinely record a minimum number of screen volumes to be purged to quantify the degree of purging undertaken this work suggests 1 sv at minimum 2 sv to allow good sample confidence and 3 sv to allow high sample confidence recognizing decreasing time efficiency and cost effectiveness the objective being to ensure sampled water is in quasi steady state interaction with the formation such volumes are consistent with the recommendations of martin hayden et al 2014 who illustrate a partial purge condition may persist over c 3 sv in passing we concur with the recommendation of martin hayden et al and robin and gillham 1987 that where the pump intake is positioned within the well screen and there is insignificant drawdown screen volumes should be used as the unit of measure for quantification of purging as they are technically more defensible than well volumes and constant with time as introduced earlier there is debate between potentially onerous low flow purging of multiple screen volumes and the comparative ease of zero minimal purge sampling but also a recognised need to aim for consistency in monitoring well sampling approaches protocols should aim to capture the key concentration features and avoid undue or unknown sensitivity of concentrations to sample depth or purge time this is challenging in dnapl source zone areas however our generalised recommendations for monitoring well based protocols that are pragmatic for such environments include protocols should be developed bespoke to individual wells but aim to have commonality among wells where possible pumped samples using low flow rates should ideally only be taken after purging at least 1 sv to overcome much of the expected initial sample concentration variability however the potential for concentration temporal variability should be initially and occasionally examined by sampling over 2 3 sv purged or more purged volumes should be recorded to evaluate potential concentration sensitivity to volume variation between sampling events where it is deemed impractical to routinely remove at least 1 sv using low flow rates justification should be demonstrated by an initial validation in which samples are taken after removal of at least 1 sv but ideally up to 3 sv whilst zero minimal purge methods were not used in this study their deployment in dnapl source zones should be used cautiously and demonstrated by appropriate individual well validation e g deployment at several depths the underpinning relationship to purged concentration variation over at least 1 sv should be examined initially and ideally occasionally overall a key utility of monitoring wells is their potential cost effective monitoring of contaminant fluxes immediately down gradient of a dnapl source zone area in particular their proportionately greater sample draw from the more permeable horizons that constitute critical high mobility pathways of contaminant flux to the wider environment monitoring wells thereby capture an important representative fraction of the source mass flux that poses wider risk and may provide a valuable metric of overall bulk source dissolution with increasing source age however availability of complementary higher resolution e g mls data is important to help confirm contamination flux contributions from the less permeable horizons expected to prove increasingly important at late time indeed the additional interpretive understanding demonstrated in this study by acquiring higher resolution monitoring data mls concentration and k data primarily supplemented by a detailed tracer test and integrative pumped cell capture of contaminant fluxes to complement the monitoring well data is significant little of the detailed understanding developed may be discerned from the monitoring well installations alone without reducing to ultra short screen wells c 0 3 m being a realistic practical minimum in summary short screen monitoring wells sampled with validated and informed protocols are shown to have valuable utility in the assessment of dnapl source zone areas and expected to remain a cost effective site assessment tool however it is essential that complementary high resolution site data are acquired via the aforementioned technologies to help inform interpretation of the monitoring well data collected optimising this data partnership is viewed critical to the cost effective advancement of the site conceptual model and for informed remedial design implementation and performance monitoring

unfortunately the use of aops can be limited by these oxidants relatively high reactivities and short half lives these drawbacks can be minimized by partial encapsulation of the oxidants within a

a maximum contaminant level for drinking water mohr et al 2010 toxicological studies suggest that 1 4 d may be harmful and it has been designated as a probable human carcinogen anderson et al 2012 coleman et al 2007 epa 2013 iarc 1999 mohr et al 2010 the properties of 1 4 d that make it useful for solvent stabilization such as the high polarity which results in its high aqueous solubility and low adsorption and volatilization diguiseppi and whitesides 2007 mohr et al 2010 zenker et al 2003 have resulted in extensive wastewater and groundwater contaminant plumes that are often as large as those associated with the chlorinated solvents and make it a challenge for water treatment despite the co disposal and coincidence of plumes 1 4 d is not effectively removed from groundwater through sorption or volatilization technologies typically used for chlorinated co contaminant treatment diguiseppi et al 2016 diguiseppi and whitesides 2007 zenker et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 and the cleanup targets being proposed for 1 4 d are potentially as low as or lower than those for most chlorinated solvents for example biological methods have been shown to be inhibited for 1 4 d in the presence of chlorinated co contaminants mahendra et al 2013 hand et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 in terms of treatment using chemical oxidation mineralization of 1 4 d typically requires strong oxidants i e advanced oxidation processes or aop that have a standard redox potential greater than two electron volts diguiseppi et al 2016 diguiseppi and whitesides 2007 zenker et al 2003 currently the most common method used to remediate 1 4 d involves ex situ treatment using aop e g ozone or o3 and h2o2 diguiseppi et al 2016 diguiseppi and whitesides 2007 zenker et al 2003 o3 eo 2 07 v is

on aqueous chemistry dettmer et al 2017 huling and pivetz 2006a oxidant stabilizers have been proposed to increase oxidant longevity huling and pivetz 2006a and these typically include the complexation of the oxidant stabilizers have been developed mainly for iron i e chelators and h2o2 i e phosphates or organic acids watts et al 2007 these modified fenton reaction methods use a facilitated transport approach to apply the fenton reaction for in situ chemical oxidation isco of organic contaminants lee and lee 2010 lewis et al 2009 lindsey et al 2003 wang and brusseau 1998 various organic acids have proven effective to enhance the lifespan of h2o2 in soil chang et al 2013 jung et al 2013 watts et al 2007 cyclodextrins are cyclic d glucopyranoses bonded through α 1 4 glucosidic linkages the exterior is hydrophilic and they also have a hydrophobic interior into which compounds can partition bender and komiyama 1978 french 1957 szejtli j 1998 reviews have discussed inclusion complexation formation within cyclodextrins boving and mccray 2000 connors 1997 landy et al 2012 the mechanism that is generally accepted for inclusion complex formation within the hpβcd cavities is hydrophobic partitioning and displacement of water molecules from the cavity connors 1997 and this partitioning is generally considered to be a weak attraction force that is generally reversible inclusion complex formation has long been an important area in cyclodextrin research bender and komiyama 1978 connors 1997 saenger 1980 which has had increased interest recently for contaminant remediation landy et al 2012 clathrates such as cyclodextrins have been shown to enhance the solubility transport and extraction of both organic and metal contaminants blanford et al 2014

tick et al 2003 wang and brusseau 1995 cyclodextrins have also been used to complex iron for oxidation stabilization preventing the consumption of h2o2 and precipitation of iron lindsey et al 2003 veignie et al 2009 also demonstrated that various types of cyclodextrin increase contaminant solubility and its degradation by fenton s reagent a ternary complex between hydroxypropyl β cyclodextrin hpβcd fe2 and pollutants has been proposed liang et al 2007 recently dettmer et al 2017 have also documented the inclusion complexation of o3 within hpβcd which seems act as an oxidant stabilizer due to the relatively low solubility and hydrophilicity of o3 it can partition into the hpβcd cavity dettmer et al did observe partial oxidation of the hpβcd whereas there was a portion of hpβcd that was not oxidized and a fraction of o3 that partitioned into the cavity the vast majority of the investigated guest compounds that complex with cyclodextrins have been organic and prior work has not evaluated the inclusion constant of o3 with cyclodextrin or the potential competitive complexation between o3 and 1 4 d and or chlorinated solvent co contaminants a critical area of supramolecular chemistry includes the investigation of host guest complex formation processes and the determination of complexation binding constants k values for aqueous systems connors 1987 which is the equilibrium constant for the aqueous complex formation reaction as follows e g connors 1997 blyshak et al 1991 singer et al 1991 1 guest cd k guest cd here guest or g is the activity of target compound in the aqueous phase cd refers to the activity of cyclodextrin molecules guest cd or g cd is the activity of the inclusion complex when the guest compound has partitioned into the cd cavity and the k is the equilibrium binding i e or formation stability constant which can also be defined as 2 k g cd g cd nmr instruments are capable of obtaining high quality spectra with sub millimolar concentrations routinely as low as 10 4 m 1 for measuring and determining complexation binding constants up to 106 m 1 connors 1987 shirin et al 2003 evaluated several β cyclodextrins derivatives as agents for enhancement of the aqueous solubility of two major organic pollutants e g tce using 1h nmr yang et al 2006 also reported inclusion constants for three different contaminants including tce with two types of cyclodextrins using gas chromatography and partitioning relationships perhaps the most common method for supra molecular titration experiments is uv visible spectroscopy with the right chromospheres host concentrations in the sub micro molar 10 7 m 1 can be used making the determination of binding constants as high as 109 m 1 in simple 1 1 systems connors 1987 for example garcia rio et al 2006 used uv visible spectroscopy to examine competitive binding equilibrium and kinetics for 1 4 d in presence of α cyclodextrin and β cyclodextrin another analytical method that is often used is fluorescence spectroscopy that can determine binding constants with analytes at the micromolar or nanomolar nm ranges connors 1987 however few comparisons of these spectroscopic methods for determining binding constants and inclusion complex stoichiometries have been reported in addition use of these spectroscopic methods can be applied for direct measurement of the binding equilibria as well as indirectly by competition for complexation when more than one guest compound is present connors 1987 johnson and reinsborough 1992 development and application of these competitive methods for k determination has been lacking compared to direct spectroscopic methods and comparisons of these direct and competitive methods are needed for further understanding of method applicability although 1 4 d has typically been released into the environment as a contaminant associated with either tce or tca cyclodextrin complexation k values of 1 4 d and competitive complexation of 1 4 d with these compounds have not been reported k values for o3 with cyclodextrin have also not been reported and a comparison of o3 and contaminant k values would be needed for use of cyclodextrin for either oxidant delivery or contaminant solubilization also enhanced solubilization of o3 and contaminants via cyclodextrin complexation may also enhance aop treatment of wastewater contaminated with 1 4 d and other recalcitrant contaminants the purpose of this investigation was to measure and compare the inclusion binding constant values and complexation stoichiometies for 1 4 d tce tca and o3 with hpβcd using both direct and competitive spectroscopic methods in addition the impacts of aqueous chemistry variability e g ph and ionic strength on k values were examined to evaluate variability within natural water systems in addition to the need for k measurement for these recalcitrant co contaminants and o3 to support water treatment we also examine the applicability and comparability between multiple spectroscopic k measurement methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials cyclodextrins cds used herein included hpβcd 1460 g mol 1 from sigma aldrich with 7 0 loss on drying and 5 0 polypropylene glycol and gamma cyclodextrin or γ cd 1297 g mol 1 from wacke chemie ag company these were selected as they are two of the most commonly used cds and γ cd has a larger cavity and aqueous solubility reagent grade 1 4 d tca and tce were purchased from sigma aldrich with 99 purity reagent grade sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl were purchased from sigma aldrich with 99 purity reagent grade sodium chloride em science 99 purity and 6 p toluidine 2 naphthalenesulfonic acid or tns eastman kodak company with 99 purity were used as described below o3 was generated by in lab ozone generator pacific ozone model no g1110101 serial no 8496 for all experiment a barnstead nanopure ii series 550 dubuque iowa dionization system was used after reverse osmosis to purify water to 18 mω cm which was then used hereafter termed di water for all solutions all experiments were conducted at 22 1 c controlled by thermostat 2 2 chemical analysis all measurements uv and fluorescence were performed with a molecular devices spetramax m2 spectrophotometer aqueous o3 concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 and also with an o3 probe model q46h 64 ati aqueous hpβcd and tns sample concentrations were analyzed by fluorescence methods kondo et al 1976 and the lower detection limit of hpβcd for both fluorescence and uv was 6 8 10 3 mm and upper detection limit was 13 7 mm fluorescence intensities of hpβcd tns γ cd tns and cd tns guest complexes were measured with excitation at 387 nm and emission at 478 nm petter et al 1990 pongsawasdi et al 1997 uv spectroscopy was conducted from 180 to 700 nm kawasaki et al 2001 and garcıa rıo et al 2006 the lower detection limit of tce and tca by uv was 0 075 mm and upper detection limit was 3 0 mm and the lower to upper detection limit of o3 for uv was 0 0208 0 2083 mm all measurements were triplicated and mean and standard deviation intervals are reported 2 3 direct measurement of binding constants uv measurements of solutions with and without the combination of a host and guest indicates inclusion complex through the formation of absorbance shifts magnitude changes and an isosbestic point or the cross over intersection of absorbance versus wavelength spectra connors 1987 stoichiometry and the binding constants of the complexes can be evaluated upon examination of differences in relative level absorbance at the wavelengths between single i e uncomplexed and multiple compound i e complexed solutions our analysis was based on the assumption that the inclusion complex stoichiometry of each guest within hpβcd was 1 1 boving and mccray 2000 connors 1997 landy et al 2012 separate host and guest stock solutions were mixed to create various compositions and spectroscopic measurements were conducted upon equilibration the inclusion complex formation kinetics and time to equilibrium for guest compounds within cd are known to proceed rapidly within seconds nakatani and hiromi 1984 uv spectra of solutions containing hpβcd with and without guest molecules i e 1 4 d tca tce or o3 were measured over a range of hpβcd concentrations 0 08 mm 2 7 mm and at two different concentrations of tce 0 76 and 1 52 mm tca 0 75 mm and 1 5 mm o3 0 03 mm and 0 015 mm and 1 4 d 0 014 m and 0 03 m for tca 1 4 d and tce experiments samples were collected with an air tight syringe hamilton and stored in amber vials without headspace absorption maxima were used to determine absorbance changes and two direct spectroscopic approaches were used to calculate the binding constants one method is the benesi hildebrand approach benesi and hildebrand 1949 the relevant equation is shown as follows 3 b a 1 g i k ɛ l 1 g i ɛ where b is the length of cuvette i e 1 cm a is the change in absorbance due to adding hpβcd g i is the concentration mm of the guest substrate i e tce tca 1 4 d or o3 k mm 1 is the complex formation constant or binding constant ɛ is the extinction coefficient and l is the concentration mm of ligand hpβcd if the plots of 1 a as a function of 1 hpβcd concentration were linear then based on the benesi hildebrand equation binding constants were calculated as the linear regression y intercept divided by the slope connors 1987 the second method is the scott s equation 4 b l a l g i ɛ 1 g i k ɛ where b a g i k ɛ and l are as defined previously a plot of hpβcd concentration divided by the change in absorbance as a function of 1 hpβcd concentration was used with the scott s equation to determine binding constants as the slope divided by the y intercept connors 1987 all experiments were conducted at least three times measurements for hpβcd tce were also conducted three additional times supplementary data and mean and standard deviations for binding constants are reported 2 4 indirect measurement of binding constants two experiments were generally required for measuring the k values for two guest compounds present in the same solution through competitive complexation which included a first experiment with one guest only to determine k for that guest followed by a second experiment with two guests in solution to determine the k for the second guest here we used tns as a competitive guest compound i e the first guest in combination with each of the other individual guest compounds in the first series of experiments i e tns and hpβcd or γ cd a consistent amount of tns was added to a series of hpβcd 0 01 to 10 mm or γ cd 0 048 to 12 34 mm solutions and increases in fluorescence intensity were used to determine the k of the hpβcd and γ cd with tns using eq 3 the second series of experiments were used to determine k values for a second guest in solutions with the first guest i e tns also present and both sets of experiments were conducted with identical concentrations of hpβcd or γ cd and with the identical concentration of tns the solutions for the second series of experiments also contained the additional guest compound o3 tce tca or 1 4 d without dilution of tns and hpβcd or γ cd aqueous stock solutions of tce and tca were prepared with a concentration of 3 mm in 250 ml volatile organic analysis vials and were equilibrated on a shaker table at 400 rmp for 1 week and aqueous stock solution of 1 4 d was prepared at a concentration of 0 11 m in 500 ml volumetric flask a series of hpβcd solutions were prepared from a 11 mm hpβcd aqueous stock the fluorescence titration experimental solutions contained 10 μm or 1 μm of tns and the concentration of hpβcd was from 0 08 to 2 7 mm to avoid dilution experiments were repeated at differing initial ph values i e di was ph 6 and ph was adjusted to 9 by titration using 0 1 m naoh and ionic strengths i e addition of appropriate amounts of nacl to prepare 100 mm and 50 mm solutions to investigate the impact of natural water chemistry variability on these inclusion complexation reactions inclusion binding constant values for hpβcd or γ cd with tns i e k1 and hpβcd or γ cd with the other guest k2 complexes were determined from the following equations here guest g was an additional compound including tce tca 1 4 d or o3 for a cd solution containing both tns and g where both tns and g are competing for complexation with cd the total cd concentration can be observed by the following equation johnson and reinsborough 1992 5 cd i 1 qk 1 g i k 2 q k 1 k 2 tns i q 1 where kl is the inclusion binding constant for the 1 1 cd tns complex k2 the inclusion binding constant for the 1 1 hpβcd or γ cd and g complex g i the initial concentration of guest and tns i the initial concentration of tns q is defined as the ratio of free tns to cd bound tns in terms of fluorescence intensities q equates to i0 i i where i is the observed fluorescence intensity after addition of the guest molecule and i0 is fluorescence due to the 1 1 hpβcd tns or γ cd tns complex when all tns is complexed into the cd cavity from a benesi hildebrand type plot eq 3 of the data from the first experiment with tns but no additional guest present the k1 for the 1 l hpβcd tns or γ cd tns complex was determined from the ratio of the y intercept to the slope the linearity of these plots gives assurance of 1 1 complexes stoichiometry the dilute solution concentration ranges were used here for binding equilibrium measurements whereas higher concentration solutions may develop for applications of cd with o3 for contaminant remediation the relevant equation for solutions containing tns and another guest compound quantifying the competing complexation equilibriums is the following johnson and reinsborough 1992 6 q 1 q 2 q 2 q 1 1 g i k 2 q 2 1 g i k 1 where q1 and q2 denote the q values for the first experiment tns only without competitive guest and second experiment with tns and the competitive guest respectively a linear plot of q1q2 q2 q1 against q2 has a slope of 1 g ik2 the ratio of the y intercept to the slope should be k2 k1 and these plots were used to evaluate the stoichiometry of the complexes and for determination of k2 values all experiments were conducted at least three times competitive measurements for hpβcd tca were also conducted six additional times supplementary data and mean and standard deviations for binding constants are reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 direct spectrophotometric measurement method absorbance changes have been used to investigate aqueous complexation jung et al 2013 liang et al 2007 uv absorbance values generally changes upon addition of hpβcd to solutions of tca tce 1 4 d or o3 which indicates that each of these systems forms inclusion complexes fig s1 supplementary data illustrates the uv absorbance as a function of wavelength data with and without hpβcd figs 1 and 2 show the benesi hildebrand plots and scott s plots respectively used to determine stoichiometry and k values the linear regressions r2 0 99 0 84 for o3 tca and tce experiments in these two plots benesi hildebrand and scott s plot indicated a 1 1 stoichiometry for inclusion complexation the average inclusion constants from benesi hildebrand plots for o3 tce and tca were 0 5 mm 1 3 5 mm 1 and 2 6 mm 1 respectively the average values from scott s plot for o3 tce and tca were 1 7 mm 1 3 8 mm 1 and 2 6 mm 1 respectively table 1 presents the resulting k mean and standard deviation values from the uv spectroscopic method calculated from both types of plots at different ionic strengths i e di water 50 mm nacl and 100 mm of nacl and ph i e values 6 and 9 figs 1 and 2 also include data from experiments conducted at different ionic strengths for tce which can also be compared to results of the experiments conducted with di water salinity variation experiments were also conducted for tca and 1 4 d for binding constant value determination table 1 however the impact of salt additions on o3 complexation were not presented due to the reactivity of o3 with chloride ions to form molecular chlorine increasing salinity showed an increase in the inclusion constants for tce and tca table 1 also lists the inclusion constants for tce and tca at ph 9 and there was an increase in binding constant mean values with the ph increase from ph 6 to 9 for tce and tca inclusion constant values for o3 at ph 9 were unobtainable likely because of rapid o3 reaction with hydroxide and oh radical production at ph 6 and 9 in di water there was no complexation observed for 1 4 d with hpβcd however complexation was repeatedly observed and k was determined for hpβcd 1 4 d upon addition of nacl up to 100 mm eight of the ten experiments i e except tce at ph 9 and o3 at ph 6 had benesi hildebrand and scott s plot results that were statistically similar which suggests a significant similarity between these methods the minor deviations observed between these two methods are expected given experimental variability the level of similarity of the benesi hildebrand and scott s plot results suggest comparability between these methods 3 2 competitive complex measurement method tns was selected as the competitive guest compound because the complexation of tns with hpβcd with quantification by fluorescence spectroscopy is well known kondo et al 1976 fig 3 presents the changes in fluorescence intensity with constant tns 10 μm or 1 μm as a function of change in hpβcd and γ cd concentration to determine i0 as the maximum fluorescence intensity for a given tns concentration with increasing cd concentrations which indicates the maximum amount of tns can fit into the hpβcd or γ cd cavity the parameter i0 is required to quantify how much tns can be replaced from hpβcd or γ cd cavity by guest molecule when guest molecule and tns are present in the same solution results indicate that the change in fluorescence intensity became stable above 3 4 mm of hpβcd i0 was 209 fluorescence intensity when 10 μm of tns were added to hpβcd and i0 was 27 fluorescence intensity when 1 μm of tns were added to hpβcd similarly for γ cd i0 was 5 4 for 1 1 complex formation with 1 μm of tns the fluorescence intensity of tns did not change with γ cd as much as it changed with hpβcd because the cavity volume of γ cd 0 427nm3 is two fold larger than the cavity volume of hpβcd 0 261 nm3 yang et al 2006 fig 4 is the benesi hildebrand plot of 1 i versus 1 hpβcd or 1 γ cd for experiments with tns and hpβcd or γ cd without additional competing guest compounds the increasing trends of the data were well described with linear regression analysis as in fig 4 r2 0 98 0 99 which confirms 1 1 stoichiometry of tns with both cds the guest concentrations for the experiments presented here were low enough to avoid other complexation stoichiometries the mean k values for hpβcd tns complexes were 4 2 mm 1 at ph 6 and 5 7 mm 1 at ph 9 and the k for γ cd tns was 0 8 mm 1 at ph 6 table 2 these results are comparable to previously reported k values for hpβcd tns 4 5 mm 1 and γ cd tns 0 11 mm 1 johnson and reinsborough 1992 experimental results including 1 i versus 1 hpβcd at ph 9 and at two different ionic strengths 100 mm and 50 mm of nacl used for determining k of hpβcd tns are also shown in fig 4 for comparison to experiments conducted in di water k values for tns increased with increasing initial ph values from 6 to 9 and there was also a significant difference observed in binding constant of hpβcd tns with increasing ionic strength i e nacl addition the mean binding constant increased from 4 2 mm 1 di water to 7 4 mm 1 at 50 mm of nacl and also increased to 11 9 mm 1 at 100 mm table 2 the increases observed in k measured with increases in initial ph value may be related to the salt additions used to modify the initial ph this increasing binding constant trend with increasing salinity is similar to the observations obtained for tce and tca table 1 these k1 values for tns with hpβcd were then used to determine k2 values using data from experiments containing hpβcd tns and an additional competitive guest compound eq 6 the plot of q1q2 q2 q1 versus q2 which is the ratio of free tns to the cd bound tns in absence and presence of additional guest molecule is shown in fig 5 the data indicate increasing trends except for the γ cd experiment linear regression results with r2 0 88 0 99 confirm inclusion complex formation and indicated 1 1 stoichiometries of hpβcd o3 hpβcd tce and hpβcd tca the resulting mean k values for tce tca and o3 with hpβcd at ph 6 were 3 0 mm 1 1 8 mm 1 0 6 mm 1 respectively table 2 however the negative slope indicated for the γ cd tca resulted in negative k values estimates which suggests that there may not be a complex or the γ cd inclusion complexation may be near the lower limit for these measurement methods data from experiments at initial ph 9 for comparison with those at initial ph 6 are presented in fig 5 linear regression results indicate 1 1 stoichiometries of tce tca and o3 with hpβcd at ph 9 the mean k values of tce tca and o3 at ph 9 were 5 5 mm 1 3 8 mm 1 and 1 2 mm 1 respectively table 2 and these values were increased compared to those for experiments conducted at initial ph 6 noted above which may be attributed to changes in ph and or naoh concentrations used to alter the ph the trends in k values increasing with initial ph values are consistent for both the direct and competitive methods tables 1 and 2 fig 6 is the plot of q1q2 q2 q1 versus q2 for tca and tce competitive complexation in the presence of tns linear regression with r2 0 82 0 97 except tca with 50 mm of nacl which has a low r2 confirmed complexation and 1 1 stoichiometry fig 6 the binding constant mean values determined for tce and tca with hpβcd in di water were 3 0 mm 1 and 1 8 mm 1 respectively at 50 mm of nacl were 3 6 mm 1 and 2 1 mm 1 respectively and at 100 mm of nacl were 7 7 mm 1 and 8 4 mm 1 respectively table 2 these values generally increased with increasing salinity which was also the trend observed for tns and tce and tca using the uv spectroscopy method tables 1 and 2 acquiring k values for hpβcd o3 at different nacl concentrations was not possible because o3 reacts with cl fig 7 presents hpβcd 1 4 d complexation data from a series of experiments in di water 50 mm nacl and 100 mm nacl there was a decreasing slope observed for hpβcd 1 4 d in di water and 50 mm of nacl which resulted in negative k values estimates indicated no measureable complexation of 1 4 d with hpβcd however this decreasing trend was reversed and there was an increasing slope observed for hpβcd 1 4 d with 100 mm of nacl which indicated complexation of 1 4 d with hpβcd was only measureable at the higher salt content the mean k for hpβcd 1 4 d was 2 3 mm 1 in 100 mm of nacl table 2 this binding constant is comparable to the 2 9 and 3 8 mm 1 mean values obtained using the direct methods i e benesi hildebrand and scott s plot and the overlapping standard deviations suggest that the estimates are statistically similar for both direct and competitive methods k was only measureable upon addition of salt at a concentration of 100 mm nacl tables 1 and 2 we attribute this to a negligible or a not measureable amount of complexation at low salinity due to the relatively high polarity and solubility of 1 4 d compared to tce and tca this suggests that complexation may have been enabled with increased salt concentration due to salting out effects and creating a sufficient decrease in 1 4 d compound aqueous solubility 3 3 methods comparison and implications mean k measurement results obtained from the uv direct method table 1 were comparable to results from competitive method table 2 both competitive and direct spectroscopic methods provided reasonable and consistent k values and confirmed 1 1 stoichiometry which supports validity of the results and applicability of the spectroscopic methods the standard deviation values presented in the tables and figure error bars provide quantification of both the bulk k estimation and sample analysis variability respectively this variability was significant and was at times on the order of the mean values however the most appropriate or sensitive methods can be selected for measuring binding constants based on physical and chemical properties of ligand and substrate for example using spectrometry analysis compounds with low solubility and distinct uv absorbance ability will tend to provide more reasonable measurement results connors 1987 o3 and tce have low solubilities and have distinct uv absorbance peaks see supplementary data whereas tca has a low solubility and no specific absorbance peaks on the other hand 1 4 d is highly soluble and it does not have distinct uv absorbance peaks o3 and tce are sensitive to both competitive and direct methods for tca and 1 4 d the competitive methods are more accurate than the direct method generally the direct or uv method had larger standard deviation values compared to the competitive method for the compounds evaluated herein the measured binding constant values did vary between each of the guest compounds investigated herein however the variability was not unexpected or anomalous given the variability in the composition and structures of the guest compounds in general the mean values for k did not vary by orders of magnitude for the compounds investigated and excluding tns the mean values in table 2 tend to vary by factors of 2 to 5 and k value variability between compounds can be over multiple orders of magnitude in fact the binding constant values measured herein did typically fall above the mean but within a previously published statistical distribution i e mean k 0 5 mm 1 and the 1st standard deviation k above the mean 4 mm 1 for hpβcd with several different types of chemicals connors 1997 the vast majority of guest compounds investigated for inclusion complexation with hpβcd have been hydrophobic organics e g pharmaceuticals however researchers have recently discovered that several different types of compounds including ionic organics can complex with cd in aqueous systems ondo et al 2011 which is consistent with the 1 4 d complexation results at elevated salt content even though it is not an organic molecule results presented herein confirms that o3 does also form inclusion complexes with hpβcd partitioning of o3 into the hpβcd cavity may also be attributed to the water expulsion and hydrophobic partitioning mechanisms noted previously because of the relative hydrophobicity and low aqueous solubility of o3 the binding constant results reported herein also do not vary significantly from prior reports for some of the same compounds assuming 1 1 binding was observed and considered in the binding constant determination for example shirin et al 2003 used 1h nmr titration method and reported the tce stability constant range was 3 120 m 1 for β cd and this large range varied by the type and degree of substitution within β cd molecules yang et al 2006 reported the binding constant of tce with various cds both individually and within contaminant mixtures using gc fid they found the binding constant of hpβcd tce was 0 119 mm 1 for tce alone and 0 143 mm 1 for multiple contaminant systems the previously reported average k of tce with hpβcd was lower than binding constant observed herein for hpβcd tce shirin et al 2003 yang et al 2006 the binding constant of tce determined in this study was consistent with a 1 1 complex formation of hpβcd tce whereas these prior studies mentioned above used different methods analysis and assumed 1 2 complex formation upon data reanalysis of the binding constant of hpβcd tce shirin et al 2003 reported with the assumption of 1 1 complexation the k value is larger i e k 2 1 mm 1 which is comparable to the k measured for hpβcd tce herein estimated k values for γ cd were not obtained for o3 or any contaminants considered herein the cavity volume of hpβcd 0 262 nm3 is almost two fold smaller than cavity volume of γ cd 0 426 nm3 although the cavity volume is larger for γ cd k values were able to be determined for hpβcd and not for γ cd using these spectroscopic methods which suggests that the smaller cavity of hpβcd has a stronger attraction presumably due to the increased hydrophobicity with lower volume for water molecules and hydrogen bonding in the cavity additionally the guest compound molar volume variability is relatively low compared to the variability in the k values and would not likely be a controlling factor for the measured variability in k values between guest compounds fig 8 is a plot of the binding constant values at different salinities and or ionic strengths for contaminants considered in this investigation and results from both direct and competitive methods are also presented for comparison comparing values for a particular guest compound illustrates the similarity of the two methods compared in fig 8 i e uv for direct method and fl or fluorescence for the competitive method with tns the direct and competitive methods had statistically similar results for both 1 4 d and tce whereas the methods varied significantly for tca upon salt additions the trend of increasing binding constants with nacl noted earlier concentration is evident and consistent increasing salt concentration in the solution likely caused a decrease in guest aqueous solubility i e salting out blanford et al 2014 schwarzenbach et al 2003 solubility of o3 10 mg l 1 is lower than tce 1083 mg l 1 and tca 1550 mg l 1 and the solubility for 1 4 d is much larger than tca the trend in fig 8 mentioned above for binding constant values 1 4 d tca tce is the opposite of the trend for the guest compound aqueous solubility 1 4 d tca tce typically hydrophobicity of organics is inversely correlated to aqueous solubility schwarzenbach et al 2003 and hydrophobicity correlates with partitioning of guests into cd molecules blanford et al 2014 o3 and tns did not follow the trend of k value inversely related to aqueous solubility which was likely due to the ionic properties of these compounds even though the solubility of o3 is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than tce the k value for o3 was consistently lower than that of tce however aqueous solubility of many compounds typically has an inverse relationship between the binding constant of cd complex formation blanford et al 2014 boving and mccray 2000 decreasing solubility increases the binding constant values for partitioning into the hydrophobic cavity of hpβcd and this was likely the cause of the increases in k with increasing salinity thus solubility and or hydrophobicity of guest compounds has a significant impact on binding constant values for hpβcd complexation the development of these spectroscopic methods for aqueous complex binding constant measurement has implications for water treatment and groundwater remediation applications as well this work illustrates multiple binding constant measurement methods that are easily applied in the laboratory binding constants are the thermodynamic equilibrium data needed to quantify aqueous complexes and they are commonly used within reactive solute transport models i e if equilibrium geochemistry is considered geochemical models i e aqueous complex speciation or other engineering design calculations i e reagent application for design of groundwater contamination remediation application of this technology for 1 4 d and co contaminants in wastewater or groundwater systems is especially attractive as typical remediation methods are not effective for transformation of 1 4 d as noted previously bioremediation is inhibited with chlorinated co contaminants mahendra et al 2013 which are generally found in groundwater with 1 4 d oxidation with low strength oxidants such as permanganate is ineffective and sorption and volatilization are ineffective for removal to low concentrations diguiseppi and whitesides 2007 mohr et al 2010 zenker et al 2003 chemical oxidation using o3 represents one of the only methods to rapidly destroy 1 4 d and co contaminants to the low concentrations targeted by regulators in addition to above ground wastewater treatment system application the results reported in this study have implications for development of facilitated transport enabled isco using aop for the treatment of groundwater contaminated with recalcitrant compounds such as 1 4 d and chlorinated co contaminants aqueous o3 encapsulation within hpβcd acts to stabilize o3 extending its reactivity for transforming contaminants in groundwater and wastewater systems the potential for ternary complexation with co inclusion of o3 and contaminants within the cavity is evident from the competitive binding results and this suggests potential for enhancement of the oxidation reactions with increased proximity of reactants this spectroscopic evaluation of hpβcd complexation indicates that o3 would compete for inclusion complexation with multiple contaminants commonly found at chlorinated solvent contamination sites which demonstrates the applicability of hpβcd for o3 stabilization and use for treatment of wastewater and contaminated groundwater cyclodextrin complexation with contaminants has been developed previously for enhancing the extraction of contaminants from subsurface soils and groundwater now cyclodextrin complexation of a water treatment reagent i e o3 demonstrates the potential for reagent delivery into the subsurface and reagent stabilization for increasing contact time within wastewater treatment systems one significant cost benefit of subsurface co injection of hpβcd with aqueous o3 would result from not needing to pump transport store and dispose of groundwater with a transition to in situ treatment hpβcd is generally resistant to biological decay for a period of at least a few months wang et al 1998 however hpβcd should be expected to degrade over the long term by most indigenous microbial populations blanford et al 2018 hpβcd has negligible toxicity due to the glucose based structure wang et al 1998 and hpβcd has been injected into contaminated groundwater systems previously mccray and brusseau 1998 blanford et al 2001 tick et al 2003 boving et al 2008 use of hpβcd to stabilize o3 in aqueous solutions could enhance the oxidant lifespan and prolong oxidant reactivity for days and thereby improve oxidant delivery within treatment systems or increase transport distance of co injected hpβcd with o3 into groundwater 4 summary inclusion complexation of o3 1 4 d and chlorinated co contaminants tce and tca with hpβcd and γ cd was examined to quantify binding constant values and compare the applicability of multiple spectroscopic methods for binding constant determination multiple spectroscopic methods including uv and fluorescence for direct and competitive complexation produced comparable results although method applicability and accuracy can vary with guest compound analysis properties although we were not able to measure any k values for γ cd with contaminants examined herein we found that tce and tca both complex with hpβcd at ph 6 and 9 1 4 d complexation with hpβcd was not measureable within di water whereas the 1 4 d complexation with hpβcd was measureable at increased salinity levels i e 100 mm nacl and o3 complex k values with hpβcd were measured at ph 6 and 9 all three contaminants tce tca and 1 4 d and tns had higher k values with increased salt concentrations with changes in salinity and ionic strength the polarity of the aqueous system changes which in turn alters guest aqueous solubility and complexation within the hydrophobic cd cavity this study also confirmed 1 1 stoichiometries for all of the hpβcd complexes and guest aqueous solubility seemed to be a controlling factor for k values these results illustrate versatility of cds for inclusion complexation with various types of compounds binding measurement methods are applicable to a wide range aqueous complexation equilibria applications and such processes have implications for both extraction of contaminants and delivery of reagents for treatment of contaminants in wastewater or contaminated groundwater acknowledgements this research was

1677,recalcitrant organic contaminants such as 1 4 dioxane typically require advanced oxidation process aop oxidants such as ozone o3 for their complete mineralization during water treatment unfortunately the use of aops can be limited by these oxidants relatively high reactivities and short half lives these drawbacks can be minimized by partial encapsulation of the oxidants within a cyclodextrin cavity to form inclusion complexes we determined the inclusion complexes of o3 and three common co contaminants trichloroethene 1 1 1 trichloroethane and 1 4 dioxane as guest compounds within hydroxypropyl β cyclodextrin both direct ultraviolet or uv and competitive fluorescence changes with 6 p toluidine 2 naphthalenesulfonic acid as the probe methods were used which gave comparable results for the inclusion constants of these species impacts of changing ph and nacl concentrations were also assessed binding constants increased with ph and with ionic strength which was attributed to variations in guest compound solubility the results illustrate the versatility of cyclodextrins for inclusion complexation with various types of compounds binding measurement methods are applicable to a wide range of applications and have implications for both extraction of contaminants and delivery of reagents for treatment of contaminants in wastewater or contaminated groundwater

as a byproduct of polyester production and disposal of various consumer products diguiseppi and whitesides 2007 mohr et al 2010 zenker et al 2003 the solvent stabilizer 1 4 d has emerged in the environmental remediation arena as an unexpected and recalcitrant wastewater and groundwater contaminant even though it is not currently classified as a u s epa priority pollutant and it does not have a maximum contaminant level for drinking water mohr et al 2010 toxicological studies suggest that 1 4 d may be harmful and it has been designated as a probable human carcinogen anderson et al 2012 coleman et al 2007 epa 2013 iarc 1999 mohr et al 2010 the properties of 1 4 d that make it useful for solvent stabilization such as the high polarity which results in its high aqueous solubility and low adsorption and volatilization diguiseppi and whitesides 2007 mohr et al 2010 zenker et al 2003 have resulted in extensive wastewater and groundwater contaminant plumes that are often as large as those associated with the chlorinated solvents and make it a challenge for water treatment despite the co disposal and coincidence of plumes 1 4 d is not effectively removed from groundwater through sorption or volatilization technologies typically used for chlorinated co contaminant treatment diguiseppi et al 2016 diguiseppi and whitesides 2007 zenker et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 and the cleanup targets being proposed for 1 4 d are potentially as low as or lower than those for most chlorinated solvents for example biological methods have been shown to be inhibited for 1 4 d in the presence of chlorinated co contaminants mahendra et al 2013 hand et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 in terms of treatment using chemical oxidation mineralization of 1 4 d typically requires strong oxidants i e advanced oxidation processes or aop that have a standard redox potential greater than two electron volts diguiseppi et al 2016 diguiseppi and whitesides 2007 zenker et al 2003 currently the most common method used to remediate 1 4 d involves ex situ treatment using aop e g ozone or o3 and h2o2 diguiseppi et al 2016 diguiseppi and whitesides 2007 zenker et al 2003 o3 eo 2 07 v is

or ex situ huling and pivetz 2006b zenker et al 2003 a key limitation to implement aop wastewater treatment of recalcitrant contaminants is the short half lives i e up to 1 h for aqueous o3 depending on aqueous chemistry dettmer et al 2017 huling and pivetz 2006a oxidant stabilizers have been proposed to increase oxidant longevity huling and pivetz 2006a and these typically include the

various organic acids have proven effective to enhance the lifespan of h2o2 in soil chang et al 2013 jung et al 2013 watts et al 2007 cyclodextrins are cyclic d glucopyranoses bonded through α 1 4 glucosidic linkages the exterior is hydrophilic and they also have a hydrophobic interior into which compounds can partition bender and komiyama 1978 french 1957 szejtli j 1998 reviews have discussed inclusion complexation formation within cyclodextrins boving and mccray 2000 connors 1997 landy et al 2012 the mechanism that is generally accepted for inclusion complex formation within the hpβcd cavities is hydrophobic partitioning and displacement of water molecules from the cavity connors 1997 and this partitioning is generally considered to be a weak attraction force that is generally reversible inclusion complex formation has long been an important area in cyclodextrin research bender and komiyama 1978 connors 1997 saenger 1980 which has had increased interest recently for contaminant remediation landy et al 2012 clathrates such as cyclodextrins have been shown to enhance the solubility transport and extraction of both organic and metal contaminants blanford et al 2014

tick et al 2003 wang and brusseau 1995 cyclodextrins have also been used to complex iron for oxidation stabilization preventing the consumption of h2o2 and precipitation of iron lindsey et al 2003 veignie et al 2009 also demonstrated that various types of cyclodextrin increase contaminant solubility and its degradation by fenton s reagent a ternary complex between hydroxypropyl β cyclodextrin hpβcd fe2 and pollutants has been proposed liang et al 2007 recently dettmer et al 2017 have also documented the inclusion complexation of o3 within hpβcd which seems act as an oxidant stabilizer due to the relatively low solubility and hydrophilicity of o3 it can partition into the hpβcd cavity dettmer et al did observe partial oxidation of the hpβcd whereas there was a portion of hpβcd that was not oxidized and a fraction of o3 that partitioned into the cavity the vast majority of the investigated guest compounds that complex with cyclodextrins have been organic and prior work has not evaluated the inclusion constant of o3 with cyclodextrin or the potential competitive complexation between o3 and 1 4 d and or chlorinated solvent co contaminants a critical area of supramolecular chemistry includes the investigation of host guest complex formation processes and the determination of complexation binding constants k values for aqueous systems connors 1987 which is the equilibrium constant for the aqueous complex formation reaction as follows e g connors 1997 blyshak et al 1991 singer et al 1991 1 guest cd k guest cd here guest or g is the activity of target compound in the aqueous phase cd refers to the activity of cyclodextrin molecules guest cd or g cd is the activity of the inclusion complex when the guest compound has partitioned into the cd cavity and the k is the equilibrium binding i e or formation stability constant which can also be defined as 2 k g cd g cd nmr instruments are capable of obtaining high quality spectra with sub millimolar concentrations routinely as low as 10 4 m 1 for measuring and determining complexation binding constants up to 106 m 1 connors 1987 shirin et al 2003 evaluated several β cyclodextrins derivatives as agents for enhancement of the aqueous solubility of two major organic pollutants e g tce using 1h nmr yang et al 2006 also reported inclusion constants for three different contaminants including tce with two types of cyclodextrins using gas chromatography and partitioning relationships perhaps the most common method for supra molecular titration experiments is uv visible spectroscopy with the right chromospheres host concentrations in the sub micro molar 10 7 m 1 can be used making the determination of binding constants as high as 109 m 1 in simple 1 1 systems connors 1987 for example garcia rio et al 2006 used uv visible spectroscopy to examine competitive binding equilibrium and kinetics for 1 4 d in presence of α cyclodextrin and β cyclodextrin another analytical method that is often used is fluorescence spectroscopy that can determine binding constants with analytes at the micromolar or nanomolar nm ranges connors 1987 however few comparisons of these spectroscopic methods for determining binding constants and inclusion complex stoichiometries have been reported in addition use of these spectroscopic methods can be applied for direct measurement of the binding equilibria as well as indirectly by competition for complexation when more than one guest compound is present connors 1987 johnson and reinsborough 1992 development and application of these competitive methods for k determination has been lacking compared to direct spectroscopic methods and comparisons of these direct and competitive methods are needed for further understanding of method applicability although 1 4 d has typically been released into the environment as a contaminant associated with either tce or tca cyclodextrin complexation k values of 1 4 d and competitive complexation of 1 4 d with these compounds have not been reported k values for o3 with cyclodextrin have also not been reported and a comparison of o3 and contaminant k values would be needed for use of cyclodextrin for either oxidant delivery or contaminant solubilization also enhanced solubilization of o3 and contaminants via cyclodextrin complexation may also enhance aop treatment of wastewater contaminated with 1 4 d and other recalcitrant contaminants the purpose of this investigation was to measure and compare the inclusion binding constant values and complexation stoichiometies for 1 4 d tce tca and o3 with hpβcd using both direct and competitive spectroscopic methods in addition the impacts of aqueous chemistry variability e g ph and ionic strength on k values were examined to evaluate variability within natural water systems in addition to the need for k measurement for these recalcitrant co contaminants and o3 to support water treatment we also examine the applicability and comparability between multiple spectroscopic k measurement methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials cyclodextrins cds used herein included hpβcd 1460 g mol 1 from sigma aldrich with 7 0 loss on drying and 5 0 polypropylene glycol and gamma cyclodextrin or γ cd 1297 g mol 1 from wacke chemie ag company these were selected as they are two of the most commonly used cds and γ cd has a larger cavity and aqueous solubility reagent grade 1 4 d tca and tce were purchased from sigma aldrich with 99 purity reagent grade sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl were purchased from sigma aldrich with 99 purity reagent grade sodium chloride em science 99 purity and 6 p toluidine 2 naphthalenesulfonic acid or tns eastman kodak company with 99 purity were used as described below o3 was generated by in lab ozone generator pacific ozone model no g1110101 serial no 8496 for all experiment a barnstead nanopure ii series 550 dubuque iowa dionization system was used after reverse osmosis to purify water to 18 mω cm which was then used hereafter termed di water for all solutions all experiments were conducted at 22 1 c controlled by thermostat 2 2 chemical analysis all measurements uv and fluorescence were performed with a molecular devices spetramax m2 spectrophotometer aqueous o3 concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 and also with an o3 probe model q46h 64 ati aqueous hpβcd and tns sample concentrations were analyzed by fluorescence methods kondo et al 1976 and the lower detection limit of hpβcd for both fluorescence and uv was 6 8 10 3 mm and upper detection limit was 13 7 mm fluorescence intensities of hpβcd tns γ cd tns and cd tns guest complexes were measured with excitation at 387 nm and emission at 478 nm petter et al 1990 pongsawasdi et al 1997 uv spectroscopy was conducted from 180 to 700 nm kawasaki et al 2001 and garcıa rıo et al 2006 the lower detection limit of tce and tca by uv was 0 075 mm and upper detection limit was 3 0 mm and the lower to upper detection limit of o3 for uv was 0 0208 0 2083 mm all measurements were triplicated and mean and standard deviation intervals are reported 2 3 direct measurement of binding constants uv measurements of solutions with and without the combination of a host and guest indicates inclusion complex through the formation of absorbance shifts magnitude changes and an isosbestic point or the cross over intersection of absorbance versus wavelength spectra connors 1987 stoichiometry and the binding constants of the complexes can be evaluated upon examination of differences in relative level absorbance at the wavelengths between single i e uncomplexed and multiple compound i e complexed solutions our analysis was based on the assumption that the inclusion complex stoichiometry of each guest within hpβcd was 1 1 boving and mccray 2000 connors 1997 landy et al 2012 separate host and guest stock solutions were mixed to create various compositions and spectroscopic measurements were conducted upon equilibration the inclusion complex formation kinetics and time to equilibrium for guest compounds within cd are known to proceed rapidly within seconds nakatani and hiromi 1984 uv spectra of solutions containing hpβcd with and without guest molecules i e 1 4 d tca tce or o3 were measured over a range of hpβcd concentrations 0 08 mm 2 7 mm and at two different concentrations of tce 0 76 and 1 52 mm tca 0 75 mm and 1 5 mm o3 0 03 mm and 0 015 mm and 1 4 d 0 014 m and 0 03 m for tca 1 4 d and tce experiments samples were collected with an air tight syringe hamilton and stored in amber vials without headspace absorption maxima were used to determine absorbance changes and two direct spectroscopic approaches were used to calculate the binding constants one method is the benesi hildebrand approach benesi and hildebrand 1949 the relevant equation is shown as follows 3 b a 1 g i k ɛ l 1 g i ɛ where b is the length of cuvette i e 1 cm a is the change in absorbance due to adding hpβcd g i is the concentration mm of the guest substrate i e tce tca 1 4 d or o3 k mm 1 is the complex formation constant or binding constant ɛ is the extinction coefficient and l is the concentration mm of ligand hpβcd if the plots of 1 a as a function of 1 hpβcd concentration were linear then based on the benesi hildebrand equation binding constants were calculated as the linear regression y intercept divided by the slope connors 1987 the second method is the scott s equation 4 b l a l g i ɛ 1 g i k ɛ where b a g i k ɛ and l are as defined previously a plot of hpβcd concentration divided by the change in absorbance as a function of 1 hpβcd concentration was used with the scott s equation to determine binding constants as the slope divided by the y intercept connors 1987 all experiments were conducted at least three times measurements for hpβcd tce were also conducted three additional times supplementary data and mean and standard deviations for binding constants are reported 2 4 indirect measurement of binding constants two experiments were generally required for measuring the k values for two guest compounds present in the same solution through competitive complexation which included a first experiment with one guest only to determine k for that guest followed by a second experiment with two guests in solution to determine the k for the second guest here we used tns as a competitive guest compound i e the first guest in combination with each of the other individual guest compounds in the first series of experiments i e tns and hpβcd or γ cd a consistent amount of tns was added to a series of hpβcd 0 01 to 10 mm or γ cd 0 048 to 12 34 mm solutions and increases in fluorescence intensity were used to determine the k of the hpβcd and γ cd with tns using eq 3 the second series of experiments were used to determine k values for a second guest in solutions with the first guest i e tns also present and both sets of experiments were conducted with identical concentrations of hpβcd or γ cd and with the identical concentration of tns the solutions for the second series of experiments also contained the additional guest compound o3 tce tca or 1 4 d without dilution of tns and hpβcd or γ cd aqueous stock solutions of tce and tca were prepared with a concentration of 3 mm in 250 ml volatile organic analysis vials and were equilibrated on a shaker table at 400 rmp for 1 week and aqueous stock solution of 1 4 d was prepared at a concentration of 0 11 m in 500 ml volumetric flask a series of hpβcd solutions were prepared from a 11 mm hpβcd aqueous stock the fluorescence titration experimental solutions contained 10 μm or 1 μm of tns and the concentration of hpβcd was from 0 08 to 2 7 mm to avoid dilution experiments were repeated at differing initial ph values i e di was ph 6 and ph was adjusted to 9 by titration using 0 1 m naoh and ionic strengths i e addition of appropriate amounts of nacl to prepare 100 mm and 50 mm solutions to investigate the impact of natural water chemistry variability on these inclusion complexation reactions inclusion binding constant values for hpβcd or γ cd with tns i e k1 and hpβcd or γ cd with the other guest k2 complexes were determined from the following equations here guest g was an additional compound including tce tca 1 4 d or o3 for a cd solution containing both tns and g where both tns and g are competing for complexation with cd the total cd concentration can be observed by the following equation johnson and reinsborough 1992 5 cd i 1 qk 1 g i k 2 q k 1 k 2 tns i q 1 where kl is the inclusion binding constant for the 1 1 cd tns complex k2 the inclusion binding constant for the 1 1 hpβcd or γ cd and g complex g i the initial concentration of guest and tns i the initial concentration of tns q is defined as the ratio of free tns to cd bound tns in terms of fluorescence intensities q equates to i0 i i where i is the observed fluorescence intensity after addition of the guest molecule and i0 is fluorescence due to the 1 1 hpβcd tns or γ cd tns complex when all tns is complexed into the cd cavity from a benesi hildebrand type plot eq 3 of the data from the first experiment with tns but no additional guest present the k1 for the 1 l hpβcd tns or γ cd tns complex was determined from the ratio of the y intercept to the slope the linearity of these plots gives assurance of 1 1 complexes stoichiometry the dilute solution concentration ranges were used here for binding equilibrium measurements whereas higher concentration solutions may develop for applications of cd with o3 for contaminant remediation the relevant equation for solutions containing tns and another guest compound quantifying the competing complexation equilibriums is the following johnson and reinsborough 1992 6 q 1 q 2 q 2 q 1 1 g i k 2 q 2 1 g i k 1 where q1 and q2 denote the q values for the first experiment tns only without competitive guest and second experiment with tns and the competitive guest respectively a linear plot of q1q2 q2 q1 against q2 has a slope of 1 g ik2 the ratio of the y intercept to the slope should be k2 k1 and these plots were used to evaluate the stoichiometry of the complexes and for determination of k2 values all experiments were conducted at least three times competitive measurements for hpβcd tca were also conducted six additional times supplementary data and mean and standard deviations for binding constants are reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 direct spectrophotometric measurement method absorbance changes have been used to investigate aqueous complexation jung et al 2013 liang et al 2007 uv absorbance values generally changes upon addition of hpβcd to solutions of tca tce 1 4 d or o3 which indicates that each of these systems forms inclusion complexes fig s1 supplementary data illustrates the uv absorbance as a function of wavelength data with and without hpβcd figs 1 and 2 show the benesi hildebrand plots and scott s plots respectively used to determine stoichiometry and k values the linear regressions r2 0 99 0 84 for o3 tca and tce experiments in these two plots benesi hildebrand and scott s plot indicated a 1 1 stoichiometry for inclusion complexation the average inclusion constants from benesi hildebrand plots for o3 tce and tca were 0 5 mm 1 3 5 mm 1 and 2 6 mm 1 respectively the average values from scott s plot for o3 tce and tca were 1 7 mm 1 3 8 mm 1 and 2 6 mm 1 respectively table 1 presents the resulting k mean and standard deviation values from the uv spectroscopic method calculated from both types of plots at different ionic strengths i e di water 50 mm nacl and 100 mm of nacl and ph i e values 6 and 9 figs 1 and 2 also include data from experiments conducted at different ionic strengths for tce which can also be compared to results of the experiments conducted with di water salinity variation experiments were also conducted for tca and 1 4 d for binding constant value determination table 1 however the impact of salt additions on o3 complexation were not presented due to the reactivity of o3 with chloride ions to form molecular chlorine increasing salinity showed an increase in the inclusion constants for tce and tca table 1 also lists the inclusion constants for tce and tca at ph 9 and there was an increase in binding constant mean values with the ph increase from ph 6 to 9 for tce and tca inclusion constant values for o3 at ph 9 were unobtainable likely because of rapid o3 reaction with hydroxide and oh radical production at ph 6 and 9 in di water there was no complexation observed for 1 4 d with hpβcd however complexation was repeatedly observed and k was determined for hpβcd 1 4 d upon addition of nacl up to 100 mm eight of the ten experiments i e except tce at ph 9 and o3 at ph 6 had benesi hildebrand and scott s plot results that were statistically similar which suggests a significant similarity between these methods the minor deviations observed between these two methods are expected given experimental variability the level of similarity of the benesi hildebrand and scott s plot results suggest comparability between these methods 3 2 competitive complex measurement method tns was selected as the competitive guest compound because the complexation of tns with hpβcd with quantification by fluorescence spectroscopy is well known kondo et al 1976 fig 3 presents the changes in fluorescence intensity with constant tns 10 μm or 1 μm as a function of change in hpβcd and γ cd concentration to determine i0 as the maximum fluorescence intensity for a given tns concentration with increasing cd concentrations which indicates the maximum amount of tns can fit into the hpβcd or γ cd cavity the parameter i0 is required to quantify how much tns can be replaced from hpβcd or γ cd cavity by guest molecule when guest molecule and tns are present in the same solution results indicate that the change in fluorescence intensity became stable above 3 4 mm of hpβcd i0 was 209 fluorescence intensity when 10 μm of tns were added to hpβcd and i0 was 27 fluorescence intensity when 1 μm of tns were added to hpβcd similarly for γ cd i0 was 5 4 for 1 1 complex formation with 1 μm of tns the fluorescence intensity of tns did not change with γ cd as much as it changed with hpβcd because the cavity volume of γ cd 0 427nm3 is two fold larger than the cavity volume of hpβcd 0 261 nm3 yang et al 2006 fig 4 is the benesi hildebrand plot of 1 i versus 1 hpβcd or 1 γ cd for experiments with tns and hpβcd or γ cd without additional competing guest compounds the increasing trends of the data were well described with linear regression analysis as in fig 4 r2 0 98 0 99 which confirms 1 1 stoichiometry of tns with both cds the guest concentrations for the experiments presented here were low enough to avoid other complexation stoichiometries the mean k values for hpβcd tns complexes were 4 2 mm 1 at ph 6 and 5 7 mm 1 at ph 9 and the k for γ cd tns was 0 8 mm 1 at ph 6 table 2 these results are comparable to previously reported k values for hpβcd tns 4 5 mm 1 and γ cd tns 0 11 mm 1 johnson and reinsborough 1992 experimental results including 1 i versus 1 hpβcd at ph 9 and at two different ionic strengths 100 mm and 50 mm of nacl used for determining k of hpβcd tns are also shown in fig 4 for comparison to experiments conducted in di water k values for tns increased with increasing initial ph values from 6 to 9 and there was also a significant difference observed in binding constant of hpβcd tns with increasing ionic strength i e nacl addition the mean binding constant increased from 4 2 mm 1 di water to 7 4 mm 1 at 50 mm of nacl and also increased to 11 9 mm 1 at 100 mm table 2 the increases observed in k measured with increases in initial ph value may be related to the salt additions used to modify the initial ph this increasing binding constant trend with increasing salinity is similar to the observations obtained for tce and tca table 1 these k1 values for tns with hpβcd were then used to determine k2 values using data from experiments containing hpβcd tns and an additional competitive guest compound eq 6 the plot of q1q2 q2 q1 versus q2 which is the ratio of free tns to the cd bound tns in absence and presence of additional guest molecule is shown in fig 5 the data indicate increasing trends except for the γ cd experiment linear regression results with r2 0 88 0 99 confirm inclusion complex formation and indicated 1 1 stoichiometries of hpβcd o3 hpβcd tce and hpβcd tca the resulting mean k values for tce tca and o3 with hpβcd at ph 6 were 3 0 mm 1 1 8 mm 1 0 6 mm 1 respectively table 2 however the negative slope indicated for the γ cd tca resulted in negative k values estimates which suggests that there may not be a complex or the γ cd inclusion complexation may be near the lower limit for these measurement methods data from experiments at initial ph 9 for comparison with those at initial ph 6 are presented in fig 5 linear regression results indicate 1 1 stoichiometries of tce tca and o3 with hpβcd at ph 9 the mean k values of tce tca and o3 at ph 9 were 5 5 mm 1 3 8 mm 1 and 1 2 mm 1 respectively table 2 and these values were increased compared to those for experiments conducted at initial ph 6 noted above which may be attributed to changes in ph and or naoh concentrations used to alter the ph the trends in k values increasing with initial ph values are consistent for both the direct and competitive methods tables 1 and 2 fig 6 is the plot of q1q2 q2 q1 versus q2 for tca and tce competitive complexation in the presence of tns linear regression with r2 0 82 0 97 except tca with 50 mm of nacl which has a low r2 confirmed complexation and 1 1 stoichiometry fig 6 the binding constant mean values determined for tce and tca with hpβcd in di water were 3 0 mm 1 and 1 8 mm 1 respectively at 50 mm of nacl were 3 6 mm 1 and 2 1 mm 1 respectively and at 100 mm of nacl were 7 7 mm 1 and 8 4 mm 1 respectively table 2 these values generally increased with increasing salinity which was also the trend observed for tns and tce and tca using the uv spectroscopy method tables 1 and 2 acquiring k values for hpβcd o3 at different nacl concentrations was not possible because o3 reacts with cl fig 7 presents hpβcd 1 4 d complexation data from a series of experiments in di water 50 mm nacl and 100 mm nacl there was a decreasing slope observed for hpβcd 1 4 d in di water and 50 mm of nacl which resulted in negative k values estimates indicated no measureable complexation of 1 4 d with hpβcd however this decreasing trend was reversed and there was an increasing slope observed for hpβcd 1 4 d with 100 mm of nacl which indicated complexation of 1 4 d with hpβcd was only measureable at the higher salt content the mean k for hpβcd 1 4 d was 2 3 mm 1 in 100 mm of nacl table 2 this binding constant is comparable to the 2 9 and 3 8 mm 1 mean values obtained using the direct methods i e benesi hildebrand and scott s plot and the overlapping standard deviations suggest that the estimates are statistically similar for both direct and competitive methods k was only measureable upon addition of salt at a concentration of 100 mm nacl tables 1 and 2 we attribute this to a negligible or a not measureable amount of complexation at low salinity due to the relatively high polarity and solubility of 1 4 d compared to tce and tca this suggests that complexation may have been enabled with increased salt concentration due to salting out effects and creating a sufficient decrease in 1 4 d compound aqueous solubility 3 3 methods comparison and implications mean k measurement results obtained from the uv direct method table 1 were comparable to results from competitive method table 2 both competitive and direct spectroscopic methods provided reasonable and consistent k values and confirmed 1 1 stoichiometry which supports validity of the results and applicability of the spectroscopic methods the standard deviation values presented in the tables and figure error bars provide quantification of both the bulk k estimation and sample analysis variability respectively this variability was significant and was at times on the order of the mean values however the most appropriate or sensitive methods can be selected for measuring binding constants based on physical and chemical properties of ligand and substrate for example using spectrometry analysis compounds with low solubility and distinct uv absorbance ability will tend to provide more reasonable measurement results connors 1987 o3 and tce have low solubilities and have distinct uv absorbance peaks see supplementary data whereas tca has a low solubility and no specific absorbance peaks on the other hand 1 4 d is highly soluble and it does not have distinct uv absorbance peaks o3 and tce are sensitive to both competitive and direct methods for tca and 1 4 d the competitive methods are more accurate than the direct method generally the direct or uv method had larger standard deviation values compared to the competitive method for the compounds evaluated herein the measured binding constant values did vary between each of the guest compounds investigated herein however the variability was not unexpected or anomalous given the variability in the composition and structures of the guest compounds in general the mean values for k did not vary by orders of magnitude for the compounds investigated and excluding tns the mean values in table 2 tend to vary by factors of 2 to 5 and k value variability between compounds can be over multiple orders of magnitude in fact the binding constant values measured herein did typically fall above the mean but within a previously published statistical distribution i e mean k 0 5 mm 1 and the 1st standard deviation k above the mean 4 mm 1 for hpβcd with several different types of chemicals connors 1997 the vast majority of guest compounds investigated for inclusion complexation with hpβcd have been hydrophobic organics e g pharmaceuticals however researchers have recently discovered that several different types of compounds including ionic organics can complex with cd in aqueous systems ondo et al 2011 which is consistent with the 1 4 d complexation results at elevated salt content even though it is not an organic molecule results presented herein confirms that o3 does also form inclusion complexes with hpβcd partitioning of o3 into the hpβcd cavity may also be attributed to the water expulsion and hydrophobic partitioning mechanisms noted previously because of the relative hydrophobicity and low aqueous solubility of o3 the binding constant results reported herein also do not vary significantly from prior reports for some of the same compounds assuming 1 1 binding was observed and considered in the binding constant determination for example shirin et al 2003 used 1h nmr titration method and reported the tce stability constant range was 3 120 m 1 for β cd and this large range varied by the type and degree of substitution within β cd molecules yang et al 2006 reported the binding constant of tce with various cds both individually and within contaminant mixtures using gc fid they found the binding constant of hpβcd tce was 0 119 mm 1 for tce alone and 0 143 mm 1 for multiple contaminant systems the previously reported average k of tce with hpβcd was lower than binding constant observed herein for hpβcd tce shirin et al 2003 yang et al 2006 the binding constant of tce determined in this study was consistent with a 1 1 complex formation of hpβcd tce whereas these prior studies mentioned above used different methods analysis and assumed 1 2 complex formation upon data reanalysis of the binding constant of hpβcd tce shirin et al 2003 reported with the assumption of 1 1 complexation the k value is larger i e k 2 1 mm 1 which is comparable to the k measured for hpβcd tce herein estimated k values for γ cd were not obtained for o3 or any contaminants considered herein the cavity volume of hpβcd 0 262 nm3 is almost two fold smaller than cavity volume of γ cd 0 426 nm3 although the cavity volume is larger for γ cd k values were able to be determined for hpβcd and not for γ cd using these spectroscopic methods which suggests that the smaller cavity of hpβcd has a stronger attraction presumably due to the increased hydrophobicity with lower volume for water molecules and hydrogen bonding in the cavity additionally the guest compound molar volume variability is relatively low compared to the variability in the k values and would not likely be a controlling factor for the measured variability in k values between guest compounds fig 8 is a plot of the binding constant values at different salinities and or ionic strengths for contaminants considered in this investigation and results from both direct and competitive methods are also presented for comparison comparing values for a particular guest compound illustrates the similarity of the two methods compared in fig 8 i e uv for direct method and fl or fluorescence for the competitive method with tns the direct and competitive methods had statistically similar results for both 1 4 d and tce whereas the methods varied significantly for tca upon salt additions the trend of increasing binding constants with nacl noted earlier concentration is evident and consistent increasing salt concentration in the solution likely caused a decrease in guest aqueous solubility i e salting out blanford et al 2014 schwarzenbach et al 2003 solubility of o3 10 mg l 1 is lower than tce 1083 mg l 1 and tca 1550 mg l 1 and the solubility for 1 4 d is much larger than tca the trend in fig 8 mentioned above for binding constant values 1 4 d tca tce is the opposite of the trend for the guest compound aqueous solubility 1 4 d tca tce typically hydrophobicity of organics is inversely correlated to aqueous solubility schwarzenbach et al 2003 and hydrophobicity correlates with partitioning of guests into cd molecules blanford et al 2014 o3 and tns did not follow the trend of k value inversely related to aqueous solubility which was likely due to the ionic properties of these compounds even though the solubility of o3 is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than tce the k value for o3 was consistently lower than that of tce however aqueous solubility of many compounds typically has an inverse relationship between the binding constant of cd complex formation blanford et al 2014 boving and mccray 2000 decreasing solubility increases the binding constant values for partitioning into the hydrophobic cavity of hpβcd and this was likely the cause of the increases in k with increasing salinity thus solubility and or hydrophobicity of guest compounds has a significant impact on binding constant values for hpβcd complexation the development of these spectroscopic methods for aqueous complex binding constant measurement has implications for water treatment and groundwater remediation applications as well this work illustrates multiple binding constant measurement methods that are easily applied in the laboratory binding constants are the thermodynamic equilibrium data needed to quantify aqueous complexes and they are commonly used within reactive solute transport models i e if equilibrium geochemistry is considered geochemical models i e aqueous complex speciation or other engineering design calculations i e reagent application for design of groundwater contamination remediation application of this technology for 1 4 d and co contaminants in wastewater or groundwater systems is especially attractive as typical remediation methods are not effective for transformation of 1 4 d as noted previously bioremediation is inhibited with chlorinated co contaminants mahendra et al 2013 which are generally found in groundwater with 1 4 d oxidation with low strength oxidants such as permanganate is ineffective and sorption and volatilization are ineffective for removal to low concentrations diguiseppi and whitesides 2007 mohr et al 2010 zenker et al 2003 chemical oxidation using o3 represents one of the only methods to rapidly destroy 1 4 d and co contaminants to the low concentrations targeted by regulators in addition to above ground wastewater treatment system application the results reported in this study have implications for development of facilitated transport enabled isco using aop for the treatment of groundwater contaminated with recalcitrant compounds such as 1 4 d and chlorinated co contaminants aqueous o3 encapsulation within hpβcd acts to stabilize o3 extending its reactivity for transforming contaminants in groundwater and wastewater systems the potential for ternary complexation with co inclusion of o3 and contaminants within the cavity is evident from the competitive binding results and this suggests potential for enhancement of the oxidation reactions with increased proximity of reactants this spectroscopic evaluation of hpβcd complexation indicates that o3 would compete for inclusion complexation with multiple contaminants commonly found at chlorinated solvent contamination sites which demonstrates the applicability of hpβcd for o3 stabilization and use for treatment of wastewater and contaminated groundwater cyclodextrin complexation with contaminants has been developed previously for enhancing the extraction of contaminants from subsurface soils and groundwater now cyclodextrin complexation of a water treatment reagent i e o3 demonstrates the potential for reagent delivery into the subsurface and reagent stabilization for increasing contact time within wastewater treatment systems one significant cost benefit of subsurface co injection of hpβcd with aqueous o3 would result from not needing to pump transport store and dispose of groundwater with a transition to in situ treatment hpβcd is generally resistant to biological decay for a period of at least a few months wang et al 1998 however hpβcd should be expected to degrade over the long term by most indigenous microbial populations blanford et al 2018 hpβcd has negligible toxicity due to the glucose based structure wang et al 1998 and hpβcd has been injected into contaminated groundwater systems previously mccray and brusseau 1998 blanford et al 2001 tick et al 2003 boving et al 2008 use of hpβcd to stabilize o3 in aqueous solutions could enhance the oxidant lifespan and prolong oxidant reactivity for days and thereby improve oxidant delivery within treatment systems or increase transport distance of co injected hpβcd with o3 into groundwater 4 summary inclusion complexation of o3 1 4 d and chlorinated co contaminants tce and tca with hpβcd and γ cd was examined to quantify binding constant values and compare the applicability of multiple spectroscopic methods for binding constant determination multiple spectroscopic methods including uv and fluorescence for direct and competitive complexation produced comparable results although method applicability and accuracy can vary with guest compound analysis properties although we were not able to measure any k values for γ cd with contaminants examined herein we found that tce and tca both complex with hpβcd at ph 6 and 9 1 4 d complexation with hpβcd was not measureable within di water whereas the 1 4 d complexation with hpβcd was measureable at increased salinity levels i e 100 mm nacl and o3 complex k values with hpβcd were measured at ph 6 and 9 all three contaminants tce tca and 1 4 d and tns had higher k values with increased salt concentrations with changes in salinity and ionic strength the polarity of the aqueous system changes which in turn alters guest aqueous solubility and complexation within the hydrophobic cd cavity this study also confirmed 1 1 stoichiometries for all of the hpβcd complexes and guest aqueous solubility seemed to be a controlling factor for k values these results illustrate versatility of cds for inclusion complexation with various types of compounds binding measurement methods are applicable to a wide range aqueous complexation equilibria applications and such processes have implications for both extraction of contaminants and delivery of reagents for treatment of contaminants in wastewater or contaminated groundwater acknowledgements this research was

author non pumping reactive wells nprws filled by zero valent iron zvi can be utilized for the remediation of groundwater contamination of deep aquifers the efficiency of nprws mainly depends on the hydraulic contact time hct of the pollutant with the reactive materials the extent of the well capture zone wcz and the relative hydraulic conductivity of aquifer and reactive material kr we investigated nitrate removal from groundwater using nprws filled by zvi in nano and micro scales and examined the effect of nprws orientations i e vertical slanted and horizontal on hct and wcz the dependence of hct on wcz for different kr values was derived theoretically for a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer and verified using particle tracking simulations performed using the semi analytical particle tracking and pathlines model pmpath nine batch experiments were then performed to investigate the impact of mixed nano zvi nzvi 0 to 2 g l 1 and micro zvi mzvi 0 to 4 g l 1 on the nitrate removal rate with initial no 3 132 mg l 1 the nprws system was tested in a bench scale sand medium 60 cm length 40 cm width 25 cm height for three orientations of nprws vertical horizontal and slanted with inclination angle of 45 a mixture of nano micro zvi was used applying constant conditions of pore water velocity 0 024 mm s 1 and initial nitrate concentration 128 mg l 1 for five pore volumes the results of the batch tests showed that mixing nano and micro fe0 outperforms these individual materials in nitrate removal rates the final products of nitrate degradation in both batch and bench scale experiments were no 2 nh 4 and n2 gas the results of sand box experiments indicated that the slanted nprws have a higher nitrate reduction rate 57 in comparison with vertical 38 and horizontal 41 configurations the results also demonstrated that three factors have pivotal roles in expected hct and wcz namely the contrast between the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer and reactive materials within the wells the mass of fe0 in the nprws and the orientation of nprws adopted a trade off between these factors should be considered to increase the efficiency of remediation using the nprws

2013 the installation of horizontal and slanted wells has become popular since the 1930s in the petroleum industry and recently for the recovery of contaminated groundwater collecting non aqueous phase liquids and soil vapor from the subsurface drainage and mine dewatering hantush and papadopulos 1962 tsou et al 2010 bearing in mind the higher cost of drilling horizontal wells they have some advantages over vertical wells their geometry improves the contact with contaminated groundwater and they are suitable to install in thin aquifers zhan and zlotnik 2002 horizontal and slanted wells produce less pronounced drawdown cones and are more suitable for groundwater flow with significant vertical velocity component and pronounced fluctuations of the water table morgan 1992 kompani zare et al 2005 huang et al 2011 drilling operations of horizontal and slanted wells are a more doable option when surface structures e g buildings are present at the surface furthermore due to the significant advances of the directional drilling technology over the last two decades and the cost reduction in their installation procedures liang et al 2016 interest in the application of horizontal and slant pumping wells has been reignited to date the horizontal and slant pumping wells are commonly installed in shallow aquifers to withdraw a large amount of groundwater bear 1979 or to remove a large amount of contaminant sawyer and lieuallen dulam 1998 readers are encouraged to refer to yeh and chang 2013 for a recent and comprehensive review of groundwater flow hydraulics modeling of the horizontal and slant pumping wells to the best of our knowledge in spite of the aforementioned advantages of slanted or horizontal wells no previous work could be found that investigates the efficiency of these wells for the emplacement of the reactive materials for groundwater remediation there are a very limited number of studies that investigate the efficiency of vertical nprws as reactive barriers high removal rate of chromate from contaminated groundwater at north carolina puls et al 1999 and chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds at denver federal center colorado wilkin et al

application of biochemical remediation of a nitrate contaminated bench scale aquifer by emplacing a combination of nzvi and carbon substrates in an array of vertical nprws the motivation of this study is to answer these questions are the aforementioned advantages of horizontal and slanted pumping wells also extendable when these wells serve as non pumping reactive wells to remediate nitrate contaminated groundwater precisely how would the progress of the denitrification process through nprws be influenced by different well orientations in the presence of nano and micro fe0 particles as reactive materials to answer these questions and to gain an understanding on the applicability of slanted nprws systems connection between hydraulic parameters of aquifer chemical reduction of no 3 by mixing nzvi and mzvi and orientation of nprws should be analyzed in this study nitrate removal process was investigated in vertical horizontal and slant nprws filled by mixing nano micro zvi positioned in a homogeneous and isotropic bench scale sand medium batch experiments were also performed to investigate the effect of mass of zvi particles type of reagents i e micro or nano or a mixture of both on the denitrification process under constant initial nitrate concentration the main focus of bench scale experiments was to modify the contact time of nitrate and reactive materials by changing nprws orientation whereas other factors e g initial nitrate concentration mass of fe0 pore water velocity were considered constant this paper is organized as follows fig 1 we first

system is composed of plexiglass cylinder inner diameter 30 mm outer diameter 40 mm and length 250 mm with numerous openings embedded in its wall diameter and distance between openings are 1 mm and 10 mm respectively spaced equally along the cylinder each well contains a certain amount of nzvi mzvi mixed with very coarse sand with d50 1 70 mm ρ b 1 68 g cm 3 ρ s 2 49 g cm 3 n rm 0 32 k rm 3 28 mm s 1 283 4 m d 1 and α l 5 7 mm to provide adequate hydraulic conductivity contrast between the aquifer medium and reagent materials within wells the value of α l is obtained by tracer study using nacl mixing ratio and mass of nzvi and mzvi used in each nprw were selected based on the results of batch tests two sets of piezometers were placed upstream up and downstream dp1 dp2 and dp3 the nprw array respectively at distance of 15 cm and 45 cm from the model inlet for water sampling three downstream piezometers dp1 dp2 and dp3 were placed in different depths fig 4 to monitor the treated effluent plume from the nprws the number of wells distance between wells and wells diameter for the nprw array in the bench scale model were predetermined by numerical simulations using pmpath pollock 1994 as discussed in section 3 1 during the experiments three samples were taken from the upstream one sample and downstream two samples to obtain the values of no 3 no 2 nh 4 ec ph in the groundwater 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of hydraulic contact time computation using the flow field solved by groundwater modeling system modflow and the semi analytical particle tracking tool pmpath pollock 1994 the boundary conditions constant head for upper and lower boundaries and no flow for the other boundaries and hydraulic properties of bench scale setup the optimal number of wells in nprws system to capture all contaminated groundwater plume was determined to be 6 the diameter of the wells used in the simulations was predefined 0 03 m according to available plexiglas cylinders to delineate the capture zone of the wells 200 particles were tracked forward by several running the pmpath from the upstream boundaries while the number of wells were varied in each run the median length of the streamlines passed through the nprw l med was also estimated from pmpath as 0 6 of d w fig 5 shows the variation of factor f i e w cz d w versus relative hydraulic conductivity k r for a vertical nprw obtained from eqs 8 and 9 and the numerical model pmpath the results indicate that by increasing the contrast between the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer and reagent materials within nprws i e k r more contaminated groundwater moves through the well the maximum value of the factor f i e k r is equal to 2 for eq 9 1 9 for eq 8 and 1 85 for pmpath the final value of 1 85 for factor f is also reported by naftz et al 2002 interestingly the width of the capture zone of nprw increases with increasing the contrast between k rm and k aq i e k r up to 80 but then remains constant for larger values of k r due to dominant influence of i r as shown in eq 8 wilson et al 1997 and freethey et al 2002 also reported the optimum width of capture zone for a vertical well filled by reactive materials to be 1 8 to 1 9 times of well diameter when the k rm within reactive materials is 80 to 200 times greater than k aq of aquifer formation adjacent to the well variation of median contact time t c between contaminated plume and reagent material within the nprw with configurations of horizontal slanted θ 45 and vertical for different values of k r and pore water velocity v aq obtained by eq 10 are shown in fig 6 it is observed that as pore water velocity or relative hydraulic conductivity increases the hydraulic contact time between contaminated plume and reactive materials decreased exponentially horizontal and vertical nprws produce the maximum and minimum t c values respectively as the pore water velocity v aq or relative hydraulic conductivity k r increases the effect of nprw configuration is reduced the range of pore water velocity in natural aquifers e g 0 08 to 0 8 m d 1 johnson et al 2009 are shown in fig 6 for real world applications the effects of nprws orientation e g vertical horizontal and slated on the upgradient capture zone area of the nprw a cz in a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer were also evaluated using eq 12 fig 7 reports the variations of a cz versus different relative hydraulic conductivity k r in the case that pore water velocity within the aquifer v is 0 005 mm s 1 0 43 m d 1 well diameter d w is 0 03 m and well length l w is 1 m the results reveal that the vertical orientation of nprws i e θ 0 yields the maximum area of capture zone this is a suitable pattern for a large plume of contaminated groundwater which does not need to be treated completely on the other hand horizontal nprws can be more suitable for groundwater contaminated by high risk pollutants but with small plume or thin aquifer the hydrogeological properties of the aquifer e g type of formation and practical aspects of well drilling may significantly influence the selection of the appropriate nprw orientation a trade off between the extent of the capture zone a cz and the contact time between the contaminated plume and reagent materials t c could be found in a slanted well 0 θ 90 same results could also be obtained as shown in fig 7 for various values of v d w and l w 3 2 results of batch experiments the initial concentrations of no 3 no 2 nh 4 ec ph and dissolved oxygen do in the solutions of nine treatment were 131 2 mg l 1 52 mg l 1 0 82 mg l 1 570 μs cm 1 7 15 0 1 and 8 0 2 mg l 1 respectively the concentration of no 3 no 2 nh 4 as well the values of ec and ph were measured in nine batch tests over time up to 160 h table 1 and fig 8 the amount of unbalanced nitrogen nub in each time are also calculated by adjusting the mass balance of nitrogen species respect to the initial concentrations as shown in fig 8 a i the trend of nitrate concentration for treatments containing only nzvi a and b decreased exponentially whereas the nitrate reduction rate for treatments c and d containing only mzvi followed first order kinetics exponential nitrate reduction trend is also valid for other treatments including nzvi e f g h and i this indicates the nzvi outperforms mzvi in no3 reduction the reaction rate of denitrification through different treatments is discussed in section 3 2 1 the efficiency of no3 removal increases as the nzvi content of the solution increases e g treatments d and h compared with c according to the following equation su et al 2014a 13 no 3 aq 4 fe 0 s 7 h 2 o 4 fe 2 aq nh 4 aq 10 oh the nitrate reduction rate in the batch containing only mzvi was slow treatment c but almost constant over time this is consistent with previous findings of huang et al 1998 who reported that the rate of nitrate reduction by micro sized fe0 is negligible for neutral ph but gradually continues conversely the presence of mzvi along with nzvi has a significant influence on the nitrate reduction treatment e compared with a but a slight enhancement in nitrate reduction was observed when the concentration of mzvi was further increased treatments i and f compared with e based on the findings obtained in this study the stoichiometric ratio of fe0 to no3 especially when mixing nzvi mzvi plays a key role in denitrification process through the batch tests the minimum half life time for no3 removal of 40 h was observed for treatments h and a during the anaerobic denitrification process by the nzvi mzvi nearly all possible forms of n by products including no 3 no 2 and nh 4 were observed in the solution with a predominant nh 4 production flis 1991 reported that the chemical reduction of no 3 produces no 2 n2 gas and nh3 depending on the reaction conditions agrawal and tratnyek 1996 reported the formation of nh3 and n2 gas and no2 as the major intermediate product during nitrate reduction by zvi choe et al 2000 reported that n2 gas is the only end product of no3 reduction by nzvi in anaerobic condition ambient temperate and no ph control whereas nh3 is the only product of no 3 reduction in presence of mzvi ss 0 063 m2 g 1 westerhoff and james 2003 reported that in the presence of milimetric zvi and anaerobic conditions 70 of initial nitrate was converted to ammonium yang and lee 2005 reported that the final products of no3 reduction by nzvi in anaerobic condition are nh4 and n2 gas without detection of no2 in a previous study hosseini and tosco 2015 also reported nh4 and n2 gas are the end products of denitrification process by nzvi in anaerobic condition and neutral ph in the early stages of reaction i e 20 h a decreasing trend was observed for nitrite concentrations in all treatments e g fig 8b and i this suggests that the elemental fe0 s can be oxidized to ferrous and ferric following the half reaction shown in eqs 14 and 15 cook 2009 no 2 may be reduced to nh 4 and n2 gas through eqs 16 and 17 hu et al 1999 sun et al 2006 14 fe 0 s fe 2 aq 2 e aq 15 fe 0 s fe 3 aq 3 e aq 16 2 no 2 aq 8 h aq 6 e aq n 2 g 4 h 2 o 17 no 2 aq 8 h aq 3 e aq nh 4 aq 2 h 2 o this study assumed that the reduced mass of nitrite in the early reaction time transforms into ammonium as discussed in the section 3 2 1 the increase in no 2 concentration observed after a certain reaction time for all treatments fig 8 could be due to intermediate production of this ion during nitrate reduction vavilin and rytov 2015 interestingly in batch tests containing a high mass of nzvi e g treatments e and h a delay for the initiation of no3 reduction was observed compare the concave shape of no3 curves in fig 8 this behavior was not observed for treatments containing only mzvi i e treatments c and d this can be explained assuming that in aerobic conditions when adding the nzvi powder to the aqueous solution protons are first reduced by fe0 to form atomic hydrogen this reduced form of hydrogen induces the no3 reduction by fe0 or transforms to h2 gas according to following reactions adeleye et al 2013 18 2 fe 0 s 4 h aq o 2 aq 2 fe 2 aq 2 h 2 o 19 fe 0 s 2 h 2 o fe 2 aq h 2 gas 2 oh aq the corrosion rate of fe0 by water second reaction is very slow at neutral ph the gaseous h2 may be sorbed at the iron surface as individual hydrogen atom and act as catalyst to transfer electron and as an inhibitor of further fe0 corrosion westerhoff and james 2003 a threshold amount of sorbed hydrogen is needed to start the no3 reduction especially when the dry powder of zvi was immersed in the solution reardon 1995 this is the responsible mechanism for slow reaction rate or significant lag phase of nitrate removal at the begging of reactions alowitz and scherer 2002 according to these findings a conceptual model is proposed for denitrification process in presence of mixing mzvi nzvi particles in two stages of early and late of reaction in fig 9 according to this conceptual model the main processes occurring at the nzvi surface in the early stage of reaction include adsorbing aqueous nitrate nitrite and ammonium to the boundary layer of fe0 surface diffusing the adsorbed n species along the boundary layer chemical reduction of n species by giving electron from fe desorption of reduced form of n from fe surface production of dissolved hydrogen via cathodic depolarization in the late stage of reaction the main mechanisms are iron corrosion and formation of non crystal oxide layer on the fe surface and therefore decreasing the rate of electron transfer catalytic reduction of n species by adsorbed hydrogen on the fe surface increasing the ph of solution by production of oh and electrostatic repulsion of cathodic n products e g nh 4 from iron surface in all batch tests the ammonium concentrations increased over reaction time up to a constant value which depended on the quantity of fe0 dosage used in the solution maximum and minimum ammonium production were observed for treatment h and a respectively equal to 25 8 and 4 6 mg l 1 at the end of experiment in all cases the ammonium concentration remained constant at the end of the increase in solution ph mostly occurring at 80 h the kinetics of the ammonium production process is discussed further in the section 3 2 1 in all treatments the solution ph rose rapidly from an initial value of 7 15 0 1 to 8 after 40 h the rate of ph increase for batches with mixed nzvi mzvi treatments e f g h and i was greater than treatments where nzvi or mzvi alone was used treatments a b c and d the connection between no 3 removal and increasing ph as shown in fig 8j can be described by the high consumption of protons for nitrate reaction 10 1 mol yang and lee 2005 20 no 3 10 h 4 fe 0 nh 4 3 h 2 o 4 fe 2 additionally in aerobic conditions fe0 is able to react with dissolved oxygen in water and produces ferrous and hydroxide karn et al 2009 21 2 fe 0 s 4 h aq o 2 aq 2 fe 2 aq 2 h 2 o in anoxic condition fe0 can react with water according to the following equation su et al 2014b 22 fe 0 s 2 h 2 o fe 2 aq h 2 g 2 oh aq ferrous ions are further oxidized to ferric ions in the presence of oxygen 23 4 fe 2 aq 4 h aq o 2 aq 4 fe 3 aq 2 h 2 o the four above reactions lead to increasing of solution ph treatments with higher dose of fe0 resulted in a higher increase in ph at the end of reaction time the increase in solution ph is negligible due to consuming hydroxyl ions which lead to appearance of greenish suspended rust inactivation of fe0 content and absence of no 2 accumulation huang et al 1998 choe et al 2004 as also shown in fig 9 a smaller increase in ph in solutions containing mzvi as only reagent treatments a and b is linked with the lower denitrification rate of these treatments as discussed before it is also worth noting that high ph conditions i e high ph at the end of the tests could stimulate mineral precipitation e g iron hydroxide on the fe0 surface and hinder longevity of the reagents by limiting the electron transfer process see also fig 9b an incomplete mass balance of n i e sum of no 3 no 2 and nh 4 were less than initial n load is observed in all treatments it can be explained by the volatilization of ammonium through transformation into ammonia production of n2 gas and probably n2o gas and sorption of nitrogen products onto the positively charged surface of precipitated iron oxides especially at high ph conditions ph 8 as shown also in fig 8 the kind of unbalanced n mass nub in the solutions during the reaction time are not detected in this study the electrical conductivity ec decreases exponentially in all treatments over time except those containing only the nzvi batches a to d in this case a decrease in ec is observed after a weak peak for treatments a and b and later on for treatments c and d it is evident that the increase in solutions ec is probably due to accumulation of oxided species of iron i e fe2 and fe3 in the solution which generate in higher rates through nzvi rapid decreasing of ec can be described by the consumption of nitrate and adsorption co precipitation of different ions containing n on the corrosion products of iron i e ferrous and ferric after a certain time depends on the fe0 content both the reduction reaction and adsorption reach to equilibrium and therefore ec is stabilized e g treatments e f and g these findings consistent with those reported by tang et al 2012 a limited increase of ec was observed at the end of the experiments for treatments g and h which may be due to higher ph conditions of these solutions as shown in fig 8 j the values of no 3 no 2 nh 4 ec and ph for all treatments at the end of the tests 1200 h are given in table 2 for better comparison the concentrations of these parameters at beginning of experiments are also given in table 2 the closure n mass balance recovered as no 3 1 9 to 9 4 of initial n no 2 15 to 18 of initial n nh 4 14 to 21 of initial n and nub 62 to 68 of initial n complete no3 removal 98 2 was obtained for treatment h whereas 90 of the initial no3 was reduced for treatment c the decrease of no 2 was in the range 54 to 62 for all treatments the partial removal is supposed to be due to the competition of this ion with nitrate for its reduction or to partial sorption onto fe0 surface siantar et al 1996 the long term concentrations of nh 4 ranged between 18 and 28 mg l 1 showed a significant increase compared with those observed at a shorter time e g 160 h when values in the range 4 5 to 26 mg l 1 were observed conversely the ec did not significantly change over the longer period compared with values at 160 h the high ph of solutions tended to rise up slowly of 0 2 for treatments e to i to 1 5 ph units for treatment c and corresponded always to an increase in nh 4 concentration these findings may be useful in the implications of zvi fate on the denitrification process for drinking water treatment 3 2 1 kinetic analysis of nitrate nitrite reduction and ammonium stripping in order to analyze the influence of the micro and nano zvi particles on the denitrification rate a kinetic analysis of the no 3 and no 2 degradation and nh 4 production and stripping was conducted on the recorded data during the nine experimental tests for each operating conditions tested pseudo first order kinetic models were used liang et al 2008 hwang et al 2011 hosseini and tosco 2013 24 d c no 3 dt k 1 c no 3 25 d c no 2 dt k 3 c no 2 for t t 1 26 d c nh 4 dt k 1 c no 3 0 c no 3 k 3 c no 2 0 c no 2 k 2 c nh 4 for t t 1 k 1 c no 3 0 c no 3 k 2 c nh 4 k 3 c no 2 for t t 1 where k 1 t 1 k 2 t 1 and k 3 t 1 are the constants of nitrate reduction ammonia stripping and nitrite reduction respectively dividing the variations of ammonium concentration during time right hand side of eq 26 in two parts is due to the nitrite reduction occurs in the early time of reaction i e t 1 20 h and then nitrite produces in all treatments integrating eqs 24 to 26 with respect to time t and considering the initial concentrations c no3 0 c no2 0 and c nh4 0 as the initial conditions the function of no 3 no 2 for t t 1

nitrite and ammonium concentrations at time t respectively c no3 0 c no2 0 and c nh4 0 are the initial nitrate nitrite and ammonium concentrations respectively it is noteworthy that the eqs the kinetic constants k 1 k 2 and k 3 were optimized by fitting the experimental data of nitrate nitrite and ammonium concentrations in the batch tests to eqs 27 to 30 as shown in table 3 the increase in solution ph as shown in fig 8j and the coating of fe0 surface by precipitates may both significantly affect the values of k 1 k 2 and k 3 during the reaction consequently in order to obtain a more accurate model estimation of the experimental results fitting was performed for different reaction times separately sparis et al 2013 regarding the number of measured data as shown in fig 8 the values of k 1 and k 2 for all treatments are obtained for two reaction steps fast frs up to 45 h and slow srs 45 h conversely the values of k 3 were obtained only for the frs since no 2 concentration increased during the sls the necessity of calculating the nitrate reduction constants for the two reaction steps in varying ph media was also reported in previous works e g comba et al 2012 the results of fitted k 1 k 2 and k 3 values are presented in table 3 the significant agreement between the experimental results and theoretical predictions r 2 values in table 3 indicates a good validation of the proposed kinetic models which is consistent with the findings of other authors e g liou et al 2005 hwang et al 2011 hosseini and tosco 2015 sparis et al 2013 results show that the k 1 value of the frs in the solution containing nzvi treatments a and b was averagely 3 folds greater than that calculated for the srs conversely this increase was averagely 1 5 folds in the solutions containing mzvi treatments c and d a decrease of nitrate reduction rate k 1 during the last period is also reported by previous researches e g hwang et al 2011 comba et al 2012 results also indicate that the k 2 value of the frs was averagely 16 folds greater than that calculated for the srs mainly due to the reduction of nitrates and nitrites to ammonium according to eqs 17 and 20 the minimum kinetic nitrate nitrite reduction and stripping constants k 1 k 2 and k 3 were obtained for treatments c and d containing only the mzvi while the maximum values of these constant were obtained for treatments a b and h containing the maximum nzvi the abatement curves of nitrite and nitrate during the srs generally showed faster decreasing trends i e higher values of k 1 and k 3 with the fe0 dosage used in the solution the values of k 1 0 002 to 0 16 h 1 and k 2 0 008 to 0 10 h 1 during the srs are consistent with previous works for example hosseini and tosco 2015 obtained values of k 1 and k 2 equal to 0 29 and 2 29 day 1 0 012 and 0 095 h 1 for nitrate reduction with initial concentration of 105 mg l 1 by nzvi 4 g l 1 in batch tests in anaerobic conditions and neutral ph nevertheless the obtained k 1 values in this study are much smaller than ones reported in some studies choe et al 2000 reported the rate constant of nitrate reduction by nzvi ss 31 4 m2 g 1 between 214 and 224 day 1 8 92 to 9 33 h 1 in ambient conditions siantar et al 1996 reported a rate constant of reaction of 300 57 day 1 12 5 2 5 h 1 under anaerobic no 3 reduction in buffered solution with ph 7 by micro fe0 hwang et al 2011 reported the k 1 value between 6 30 and 6 60 h 1 for the buffered solution containing 100 mg l 1 nitrate and 1250 mg l 1 nzvi for the first 15 min of reaction time sparis et al 2013 obtained the k 1 value equal to 1 52 h 1 for the buffered solution containing 200 mg l 1 nitrate and 3330 mg l 1 nzvi for the first 20 min of reaction time difference in selecting the time of changing reaction constant may be the reason of obtained small values of k 1 in this study i e 45 h it is noteworthy the effect of increasing the mass of reagents nzvi or mzvi on the kinetic constants of k 1 and k 2 the effect of the used amount of nano sized zvi on the nitrate and ammonium stripping kinetics is greater than micro sized zvi especially during the srs for a given mzvi concentration e g 2 g l 1 adding a constant mass of nzvi to the solution e g 2 g l 1 in treatments d and h results in an increase of 3 8 times from 0 004 to 0 016 h 1 for k1 and 1 9 times 0 0087 to 0 0169 h 1 for k2 conversely adding 2 g l 1 mzvi to the solution containing 0 5 g l 1 nzvi treatments a and f results only an increasing 1 75 times for k1 0 008 to 0 014 h 1 and 1 73 for k2 0 006 to 0 010 h 1 3 3 nitrate removal through nprws based on the results of batch tests and also numerous pretests conducted in the bench scale sand medium experiments each nprws containing 2 g nzvi 10 g mzvi and 120 g very coarse sand this resulted in relative hydraulic conductivity k r 4 and therefore the factor f will be 1 48 according to fig 5 results of numerical simulations by pmpath reproducing the experimental setup indicated that six wells with inner and outer diameters 0 03 and 0 04 m respectively are suitable to capture all upstream groundwater plume as also shown in fig 4 the concentrations of no 3 no 2 nh 4 ec and ph in the upstream up and downstream piezometers dp1 to dp3 were measured every 10 0 h i e every pore volume time for up to five pore volumes and are shown in fig 10 the monitored nitrogen species and ec in the effluent groundwater of vertical nprws have the same values for three downstream piezometers dp1 to dp3 since the vertical wells collect all the upstream contaminated plume conversely the horizontal and slanted nprws with inclined angle of θ 45 cover 25 and 75 of the contaminated plume respectively in the horizontal nprws only the piezometer dp2 monitored water treated in the wells while water collected at the piezometers dp1 and dp3 was not intercepted by the wells see also fig 4 for the vertical nprws the influent concentration of no 3 i e 128 mg l 1 was reduced down to 36 of the initial value in the first two pvs and then increased fig 10a conversely the no 3 removal for the horizontal monitored in piezometer dp2 and slanted nprws average of three downstream piezometers was 79 and 41 of the influent no 3 respectively during each bench scale experiments i e five pvs approximately 50 l of contaminated groundwater passed through the nprws resulting in a ratio of fe0 to no 3 equal to 5 85 g g 1 the amount of fe0 present in the nprws is comparable with those used in the batch tests i e treatments a and b as shown in table 1 moreover the inflow provided continuously newly contaminated water compared to the batch tests these are the reasons why the effluent nitrate concentration for the nprws increases after a certain number of pvs as a general rule the nitrate removal rate for the slanted nprws was significantly lower than for the two other nprws effluent no 2 and nh 4 concentrations for three nprws orientations increased during the experimental time but in different extents the maximum increase in nitrite and ammonium were observed in the horizontal nprws in piezometer dp2 and slanted nprws respectively fig 10d i this reveals that the effluent concentrations of these ions are directly related to the contact time of contaminant plume with the reagents through the nprws the ec of effluent solution from three nprws systems increased up to a certain value due to production of ions through nitrate reduction process and then remained constant in horizontal nprws or decreased in vertical and slanted nprws as shown in fig 10 j o this behavior can be also explained by the refreshing of influent plume to the nprws by groundwater with less ec an increase of the ec values in the effluent solution of vertical nprws containing the nzvi coarse sand was not observed in the previous work hosseini and tosco 2015 likely due to the different water chemistry used in the experiments variations of solution ph in the effluent rose up and then decreased similarly to the trend of no 3 and ec it should be mentioned that nitrate removal process through the nprws filled by micro nano fe0 accompanied by no 2 and nh 4 production proton consumption i e increasing ph and increasing the ec of effluent solution which was stimulated by the slanted orientation of wells a minor reduction of the permeability of the filling materials in the nprws was observed after completing the experiments likely because the ph of the medium was not sufficiently high 8 to allow significant precipitation of iron oxyhydroxide feooh which was reported in previous works e g gandhi et al 2002 denitrification processes in batch and bench scale experiments indicated conformity in the closure n products i e no 2 nh 4 and n2 g but comparing the n mass balance between two experiments is not possible due to differences in experimental conditions in the bench sand medium tests the do has a significant impact on the nitrate removal process through the nprws systems than the batch tests due to refreshing do content in recycling contaminated water after the experiments the retained mass of mzvi and nzvi particles in each nprw was also measured by weighting the dried contains of each nprw sand mzvi and nzvi averagely 8 1 0 g mass loss is observed in each well this implies that the amount of nzvi and mzvi that leached out of each nprw to the aquifer the initial mass of nzvi and mzvi in each well is 12 0 g since the containing coarse sand in the wells can t be passed through the opening embedded along the cylinder wall however the nzvi particles are stabilized by a thin layer of iron oxide but an insignificant mass of these particles are leached out the nprw 3 4 synthesis of experimental and modeling results the connection between analytical equations i e eqs 12 14 and 16 batch and sand box experiments can be established by coupling the hydraulic contact time t c between contaminant plume and reagents through a nprws system eq 10 and the pseudo first order kinetic model eq 23 for nitrate reduction by the reagent used in the nprws combining these equations yields the percentage of nitrate reduction rate pnr through each nprw with different inclination angle θ 0 90 during the time t c as follows 25 pnr 1 c t c c 0 100 1 e k 1 t c 100 where c 0 and c t c are the nitrate concentrations in upstream and downstream plume of nprws respectively other parameters are defined earlier computing the values of t c within the vertical slanted and horizontal nprws using eq 14 and considering the values of k 1 for treatments a as lower limit and b as upper limit during the srs in the batch experiments i e k 1 0 008 to 0 010 h 1 the variations of pnr can be obtained using eq 29 the values of t c are obtained 380 s 537 s and 4219 s respectively for vertical slanted with θ 45 and horizontal nprw the results obtained using analytical eq 25 and the measured values of pnr through nprws systems in three orientations of vertical slanted and horizontal wells are shown in fig 11 the developed analytical equations can simulate the mean value of pnr observed in the sand box experiments as indicates by open circles in fig 11 in the horizontal nprw and low values of pnr in the slanted and vertical nprws however the higher values of observed pnrs in three configurations of nprw are not enclosed by the analytical solution domain 4 conclusion the efficacy of non pumping reactive wells nprws system in three orientations of vertical slanted with inclination angle θ 45 and horizontal for the degradation of nitrate contaminated groundwater was assessed through laboratory bench scale studies and modeling the reactive material emplaced in the wells was a mixture of nano micro fe0 which was selected based on several batch tests the delineation of steady state capture area for nprws the optimal spacing among the nprws and number of wells in the bench scale model were designed based on flow simulations using the semi analytical particle tracking model pmpath whereas the aquifer is assumed to be a homogeneous and isotropic medium the results obtained in this study can be summarized as follows 1 emplacing the mixture of nano micro fe0 and sand as a reducing agent in non pumping reactive wells nprws is a promising technology for remediation of deep groundwater contaminated by no 3 this approach incorporates both advantages of high reactivity of nzvi and slow but continuous reactivity of mzvi to ensure the longevity and efficiency of the denitrification process in the field scale 2 the presence of the nzvi in the reactive medium not only contributes directly to the no 3 reduction in early reaction time but also stimulates the denitrification rate by mzvi through production of hydrogen which acts as catalyst to electron transfer 3 despite the efficiency of mzvi and nzvi in nitrate reduction the possible generation of toxic by products and greenhouse gasses e g ammonium and n2o may be a limitation of these reagents 4 closure n products of denitrification process by nano and micro zvi in batch tests and bench scale experiments were no 2 nh 4 and unbalanced nitrogen products probably gaseous n2 5 based on the results of batch tests the rate of no 3 removal increases as the mass of fe0 content in the solution increases however using additional mass of fe0 in the nprws may increase the nitrate removal rate but would likely decrease the hydraulic conductivity of the reactive medium by precipitation of iron oxides in long term operations 6 the results of the numerical model pmpath indicated that for a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer a maximum capture width of 1 85 times greater than the nprw diameter is obtained for relative hydraulic conductivity k r 4 increasing the k r 80 does not have a significant effect on the width of the capture zone 7 a trade off between the hydraulic conductivity of reactive materials mass of fe0 used in the nprws and orientation of nprws should be considered to increase the capture area of wells from upgradient contaminated plumes and also nitrate removal rates 8 the hydraulic contact time of influent contaminated plume with reagent materials can be controlled by tuning the inclination angle of nprws with respect to groundwater flow direction 9 horizontal nprws filled by reactive materials provide adequate hydraulic contact time between the contamination and reagent materials and are applicable for the remediation of groundwater plume with limited size and dimensions or thin aquifers contaminated by high risk and toxic pollutants which need to be completely attenuated a higher efficiency of the horizontal nprws can be obtained when groundwater velocity has a significant vertical component additionally implementing the low reactivity and time consuming degradation mechanism e g biodegradation can be also operated in the horizontal nprws 10 the vertical nprws system is appropriate for remediation of deep contaminated groundwater where moderate degradation is needed however the efficiency of vertical nprws for pollutant degradation can be enhanced by drilling more consecutive arrays of wells slanted nprws system is an appropriate choice for treatment of deeply extended contamination plume as well the degree of pollutant degradation can be managed by changing the inclination angle of wells 11 concentrating the reactive materials i e nzvi and mzvi in the nprw system may reduce the risk of particle release in the environment over long time frames even if the mobility of bare non stabilized nzvi is very limited under natural flow conditions 12 pivotal issues including heterogeneity of aquifer media transient nature of groundwater hydraulics and geochemistry should be considered in the design and up scaling of nprws system as a remediation systems from batch to laboratory and then to pilot scale the authors are aware that this practical approach makes more complicated the full comprehension of the reaction mechanisms occurring in the batch and the bench scale model but provides more reliable results for the up scaling of the technology to the field the main focus of this study was to modify the hydraulic contact time of nitrate with reagents i e nzvi mzvi and area of well capture zone by changing the orientations of nprws while other affected factors e g initial ph initial do and initial no 3 pore water velocity aquifer medium were considered constant more studies to investigate the effects of these factors on the efficiency of nprws with

author non pumping reactive wells nprws filled by zero valent iron zvi can be utilized for the remediation of groundwater contamination of deep aquifers the efficiency of nprws mainly depends on the hydraulic contact time hct of the pollutant with the reactive materials the extent of the well capture zone wcz and the relative hydraulic conductivity of aquifer and reactive material kr we investigated nitrate removal from groundwater using nprws filled by zvi in nano and micro scales and examined the effect of nprws orientations i e vertical slanted and horizontal on hct and wcz the dependence of hct on wcz for different kr values was derived theoretically for a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer and verified using particle tracking simulations performed using the semi analytical particle tracking and pathlines model pmpath nine batch experiments were then performed to investigate the impact of mixed nano zvi nzvi 0 to 2 g l 1 and micro zvi mzvi 0 to 4 g l 1 on the nitrate removal rate with initial no 3 132 mg l 1 the nprws system was tested in a bench scale sand medium 60 cm length 40 cm width 25 cm height for three orientations of nprws vertical horizontal and slanted with inclination angle of 45 a mixture of nano micro zvi was used applying constant conditions of pore water velocity 0 024 mm s 1 and initial nitrate concentration 128 mg l 1 for five pore volumes the results of the batch tests showed that mixing nano and micro fe0 outperforms these individual materials in nitrate removal rates the final products of nitrate degradation in both batch and bench scale experiments were no 2 nh 4 and n2 gas the results of sand box experiments indicated that the slanted nprws have a higher nitrate reduction rate 57 in comparison with vertical 38 and horizontal 41 configurations the results also demonstrated that three factors have pivotal roles in expected hct and wcz namely the contrast between the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer and reactive materials within the wells the mass of fe0 in the nprws and the orientation of nprws adopted a trade off between these factors should be considered to increase the efficiency of remediation using the nprws

2013 the installation of horizontal and slanted wells has become popular since the 1930s in the petroleum industry and recently for the recovery of contaminated groundwater collecting non aqueous phase liquids and soil vapor from the subsurface drainage and mine dewatering hantush and papadopulos 1962 tsou et al 2010 bearing in mind the higher cost of drilling horizontal wells they have some advantages over vertical wells their geometry improves the contact with contaminated groundwater and they are suitable to install in thin aquifers zhan and zlotnik 2002 horizontal and slanted wells produce less pronounced drawdown cones and are more suitable for groundwater flow with significant vertical velocity component and pronounced fluctuations of the water table morgan 1992 kompani zare et al 2005 huang et al 2011 drilling operations of horizontal and slanted wells are a more doable option when surface structures e g buildings are present at the surface furthermore due to the significant advances of the directional drilling technology over the last two decades and the cost reduction in their installation procedures liang et al 2016 interest in the application of horizontal and slant pumping wells has been reignited to date the horizontal and slant pumping wells are commonly installed in shallow aquifers to withdraw a large amount of groundwater bear 1979 or to remove a large amount of contaminant sawyer and lieuallen dulam 1998 readers are encouraged to refer to yeh and chang 2013 for a recent and comprehensive review of groundwater flow hydraulics modeling of the horizontal and slant pumping wells to the best of our knowledge in spite of the aforementioned advantages of slanted or horizontal wells no previous work could be found that investigates the efficiency of these wells for the emplacement of the reactive materials for groundwater remediation there are a very limited number of studies that investigate the efficiency of vertical nprws as reactive barriers high removal rate of chromate from contaminated groundwater at north carolina puls et al 1999 and chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds at denver federal center colorado wilkin et al

application of biochemical remediation of a nitrate contaminated bench scale aquifer by emplacing a combination of nzvi and carbon substrates in an array of vertical nprws the motivation of this study is to answer these questions are the aforementioned advantages of horizontal and slanted pumping wells also extendable when these wells serve as non pumping reactive wells to remediate nitrate contaminated groundwater precisely how would the progress of the denitrification process through nprws be influenced by different well orientations in the presence of nano and micro fe0 particles as reactive materials to answer these questions and to gain an understanding on the applicability of slanted nprws systems connection between hydraulic parameters of aquifer chemical reduction of no 3 by mixing nzvi and mzvi and orientation of nprws should be analyzed in this study nitrate removal process was investigated in vertical horizontal and slant nprws filled by mixing nano micro zvi positioned in a homogeneous and isotropic bench scale sand medium batch experiments were also performed to investigate the effect of mass of zvi particles type of reagents i e micro or nano or a mixture of both on the denitrification process under constant initial nitrate concentration the main focus of bench scale experiments was to modify the contact time of nitrate and reactive materials by changing nprws orientation whereas other factors e g initial nitrate concentration mass of fe0 pore water velocity were considered constant this paper is organized as follows fig 1 we first consider the hydrodynamic aspects related to the nprws presenting analytical equations for computing the hydraulic contact time and capture area for a nprw in three orientations vertical horizontal

fe0 n on no 3 reduction by micro nano and mixing micro and nano fe0 batch experiments were conducted the nzvi particles nanofer star nanoiron czech republic have a fe0 content of 90 are stabilized by a thin layer of iron oxide and have an average diameter of 50 nm specific surface area of 20 25 m2 g as reported by the manufacturer see also http nanoiron cz aqueous solutions with initial no3 concentration of 131 2 mg l 1 were prepared by dissolving desired amount of kno3 in tap water 250 ml of the prepared aqueous no3 solution was put in nine glass beakers nine treatments named a to i containing different mass of micro and nano zvi were considered to investigate the effect of each micro and nano particles dose individually and of the mixing ratio on the nitrate removal rate table 1 provides the concentration of nzvi and mzvi used in the nine treatments the fe no3 mass ratios were also calculated and listed in table 1 the batch experiments were continuously operated for 1200 h 50 days to investigate the fate of denitrification processes in reducing producing nitrogen species the beakers were shaken continuously in a slow speed stirrer from the beginning of the experiment up to 160 h and then they were kept in ambient conditions with one hour shaking per day in order to obtain a homogeneous mixing of reagent and solution the head space was filled with ar gas samples of 10 ml each were collected with a syringe at fixed times up to 160 h after adding the particles and then filtered through a 0 2 μm filter paper just before analysis by photometer for measuring the absorbance values of the sample immediately after the analysis of each sample the corresponding headspace was filled by an aqueous solution with the same concentration of nitrate of the extracted solution and the residue mass of fe on filter paper is also added to the solution to keep constant the ration of zvi nitrate ratio throughout reaction time the collected samples were passed through a 0 5 μm membrane filter and analyzed for no 3 no 2 nh 4 ec tds and ph no 3 no 2 and nh 4 were measured by standard methods using a multi parameters photometer hi 83300 usa the ec and ph variation in the solutions were also monitored using ec and resistivity portable meter hi 87314 usa and ph portable meter hi 99151 usa respectively all analyses were conducted in duplicate to check the reproducibility of the experimental data experiments were conducted at ambient temperature 25 2 c 2 3 bench scale experimental setup the bench scale laboratory setup was fabricated in plexiglas box with dimensions of 60 cm length 40 cm width 25 cm height as shown schematically in fig 4 the box was packed with homogeneous uncontaminated coarse sand from iranian silica sand mfg company with measured bulk density ρb

the inlet and outlet to establish a uniform flow through the soil fig 4 the water level in the outlet reservoir was kept at the same level as the top of the sand in order to maintain saturated conditions through the experiments a peristaltic pump b v series etatron d s italy was used to feed the contaminated water at constant rate of 0 30 l min 1 i e pore water velocity v aq 0 025 0 02 mm s

confirmed experimentally by conducting a tracer study using nacl ambient tap water no 3 15 mg l 1 ph 7 15 0 1 i s 40 mm do 8 0 2 mg l 1 was spiked with kno3 to reach a total concentration of 130 mg l 1 no 3 and passed through the sand medium for several pore volumes pvs to provide a homogeneous steady state distribution of the contaminated water in the sand medium an array of nprws was emplaced in three different orientations vertical θ 90 horizontal θ 0 and slanted θ 45 perpendicular to groundwater flow direction at a distance of 28 cm from the entrance of the model fig 4 each well in nprw system is composed of plexiglass cylinder inner diameter 30 mm outer diameter 40 mm and length 250 mm with numerous openings embedded in its wall diameter and distance between openings are 1 mm and 10 mm respectively spaced equally along the cylinder each well contains a certain amount of nzvi mzvi mixed with very coarse sand with d50 1 70 mm ρ b 1 68 g cm 3 ρ s 2 49 g cm 3 n rm 0 32 k rm 3 28 mm s 1 283 4 m d 1 and α l 5 7 mm to provide adequate hydraulic conductivity contrast between the aquifer medium and reagent materials within wells the value of α l is obtained by tracer study using nacl mixing ratio and mass of nzvi and mzvi used in each nprw were selected based on the results of batch tests two sets of piezometers were placed upstream up and downstream dp1 dp2 and dp3 the nprw array respectively at distance of 15 cm and 45 cm from the model inlet for water sampling three downstream piezometers dp1 dp2 and dp3 were placed in different depths fig 4 to monitor the treated effluent plume from the nprws the number of wells distance between wells and wells diameter for the nprw array in the bench scale model were predetermined by numerical simulations using pmpath pollock 1994 as discussed in section 3 1 during the experiments three samples were taken from the upstream one sample and downstream two samples to obtain the values of no 3 no 2 nh 4 ec ph in the groundwater 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of hydraulic contact time computation using the flow field solved by groundwater modeling system modflow and the semi analytical particle tracking tool pmpath pollock 1994 the boundary conditions constant head for upper and lower boundaries and no flow for the other boundaries and hydraulic properties of bench scale setup the optimal number of wells in nprws system to capture all contaminated groundwater plume was determined to be 6 the diameter of the wells used in the simulations was predefined 0 03 m according to available plexiglas cylinders to delineate the capture zone of the wells 200 particles were tracked forward by several running the pmpath from the upstream boundaries while the number of wells were varied in each run the median length of the streamlines passed through the nprw l med was also estimated from pmpath as 0 6 of d w fig 5 shows the variation of factor f i e w cz d w versus relative hydraulic conductivity k r for a vertical nprw obtained from eqs 8 and 9 and the numerical model pmpath the results indicate that by increasing the contrast between the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer and reagent materials within nprws i e k r more contaminated groundwater moves through the well the maximum value of the factor f i e k r is equal to 2 for eq 9 1 9 for eq 8 and 1 85 for pmpath the final value of 1 85 for factor f is also reported by naftz et al 2002 interestingly the width of the capture zone of nprw increases with increasing the contrast between k rm and k aq i e k r up to 80 but then remains constant for larger values of k r due to dominant influence of i r as shown in eq 8 wilson et al 1997 and freethey et al 2002 also reported the optimum width of capture zone for a vertical well filled by reactive materials to be 1 8 to 1 9 times of well diameter when the k rm within reactive materials is 80 to 200 times greater than k aq of aquifer formation adjacent to the well variation of median contact time t c between contaminated plume and reagent material within the nprw with configurations of horizontal slanted θ 45 and vertical for different values of k r and pore water velocity v aq obtained by eq 10 are shown in fig 6 it is observed that as pore water velocity or relative hydraulic conductivity increases the hydraulic contact time between contaminated plume and reactive materials decreased exponentially horizontal and vertical nprws produce the maximum and minimum t c values respectively as the pore water velocity v aq or relative hydraulic conductivity k r increases the effect of nprw configuration is reduced the range of pore water velocity in natural aquifers e g 0 08 to 0 8 m d 1 johnson et al 2009 are shown in fig 6 for real world applications the effects of nprws orientation e g vertical horizontal and slated on the upgradient capture zone area of the nprw a cz in a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer were also evaluated using eq 12 fig 7 reports the variations of a cz versus different relative hydraulic conductivity k r in the case that pore water velocity within the aquifer v is 0 005 mm s 1 0 43 m d 1 well diameter d w is 0 03 m and well length l w is 1 m the results reveal that the vertical orientation of nprws i e θ 0 yields the maximum area of capture zone this is a suitable pattern for a large plume of contaminated groundwater which does not need to be treated completely on the other hand horizontal nprws can be more suitable for groundwater contaminated by high risk pollutants but with small plume or thin aquifer the hydrogeological properties of the aquifer e g type of formation and practical aspects of well drilling may significantly influence the selection of the appropriate nprw orientation a trade off between the extent of the capture zone a cz and the contact time between the contaminated plume and reagent materials t c could be found in a slanted well 0 θ 90 same results could also be obtained as shown in fig 7 for various values of v d w and l w 3 2 results of batch experiments the initial concentrations of no 3 no 2 nh 4 ec ph and dissolved oxygen do in the solutions of nine treatment were 131 2 mg l 1 52 mg l 1 0 82 mg l 1 570 μs cm 1 7 15 0 1 and 8 0 2 mg l 1 respectively the concentration of no 3 no 2 nh 4 as well the values of ec and ph were measured in nine batch tests over time up to 160 h table 1 and fig 8 the amount of unbalanced nitrogen nub in each time are also calculated by adjusting the mass balance of nitrogen species respect to the initial concentrations as shown in fig 8 a i the trend of nitrate concentration for treatments containing only nzvi a and b decreased exponentially whereas the nitrate reduction rate for treatments c and d containing only mzvi followed first order kinetics exponential nitrate reduction trend is also valid for other treatments including nzvi e f g h and i this indicates the nzvi outperforms mzvi in no3 reduction the reaction rate of denitrification through different treatments is discussed in section 3 2 1 the efficiency of no3 removal increases as the nzvi content of the solution increases e g treatments d and h compared with c according to the following equation su et al 2014a 13 no 3 aq 4 fe 0 s 7 h 2 o 4 fe 2 aq nh 4 aq 10 oh the nitrate reduction rate in the batch containing only mzvi was slow treatment c but almost constant over time this is consistent with previous findings of huang et al 1998 who reported that the rate of nitrate reduction by micro sized fe0 is negligible for neutral ph but gradually continues conversely the presence of mzvi along with nzvi has a significant influence on the nitrate reduction treatment e compared with a but a slight enhancement in nitrate reduction was observed when the concentration of mzvi was further increased treatments i and f compared with e based on the findings obtained in this study the stoichiometric ratio of fe0 to no3 especially when mixing nzvi mzvi plays a key role in denitrification process through the batch tests the minimum half life time for no3 removal of 40 h was observed for treatments h and a during the anaerobic denitrification process by the nzvi mzvi nearly all possible forms of n by products including no 3 no 2 and nh 4 were observed in the solution with a predominant nh 4 production flis 1991 reported that the chemical reduction of no 3 produces no 2 n2 gas and nh3 depending on the reaction conditions agrawal and tratnyek 1996 reported the formation of nh3 and n2 gas and no2 as the major intermediate product during nitrate reduction by zvi choe et al 2000 reported that n2 gas is the only end product of no3 reduction by nzvi in anaerobic condition ambient temperate and no ph control whereas nh3 is the only product of no 3 reduction in presence of mzvi ss 0 063 m2 g 1 westerhoff and james 2003 reported that in the presence of milimetric zvi and anaerobic conditions 70 of initial nitrate was converted to ammonium yang and lee 2005 reported that the final products of no3 reduction by nzvi in anaerobic condition are nh4 and n2 gas without detection of no2 in a previous study hosseini and tosco 2015 also reported nh4 and n2 gas are the end products of denitrification process by nzvi in anaerobic condition and neutral ph in the early stages of reaction i e 20 h a decreasing trend was observed for nitrite concentrations in all treatments e g fig 8b and i this suggests that the elemental fe0 s can be oxidized to ferrous and ferric following the half reaction shown in eqs 14 and 15 cook 2009 no 2 may be reduced to nh 4 and n2

assumed that the reduced mass of nitrite in the early reaction time transforms into ammonium as discussed in the section 3 2 1 the increase in no 2 concentration observed after a certain reaction time

e and h a delay for the initiation of no3 reduction was observed compare the concave shape of no3 curves in fig 8 this behavior was not observed for treatments containing only mzvi i e treatments c and d this can be explained assuming that in aerobic conditions when adding the nzvi powder to the aqueous solution protons are first reduced by fe0 to form atomic hydrogen this reduced form of hydrogen induces the no3 reduction by fe0 or transforms to h2 gas according to following reactions adeleye et al 2013 18 2 fe 0 s 4 h aq o 2 aq 2 fe 2 aq 2 h 2 o 19 fe 0 s 2 h 2 o fe 2 aq h 2 gas 2 oh aq the corrosion rate of fe0 by water second reaction is very slow at neutral ph the gaseous h2 may be sorbed at the iron surface as individual hydrogen atom and act as catalyst to transfer electron and as an inhibitor of further fe0 corrosion westerhoff and james 2003 a threshold amount of sorbed hydrogen is needed to start the no3 reduction especially when the dry powder of zvi was immersed in the solution reardon 1995 this is the responsible mechanism for slow reaction rate or significant lag phase of nitrate removal at the begging of reactions alowitz and scherer 2002 according to these findings a conceptual model is proposed for denitrification process in presence of mixing mzvi nzvi particles in two stages of early and late of reaction in fig 9 according to this conceptual model the main processes occurring at the nzvi surface in the early stage of reaction include adsorbing aqueous nitrate nitrite and ammonium to the boundary layer of fe0 surface diffusing the adsorbed n species along the boundary layer chemical reduction of n species by giving electron from fe desorption of reduced form of n from fe surface production of dissolved hydrogen via cathodic depolarization in the late stage of reaction the main mechanisms are iron corrosion and formation of non crystal oxide layer on the fe surface and therefore decreasing the rate of electron transfer catalytic reduction of n species by adsorbed hydrogen on the fe surface increasing the ph of solution by production of oh and electrostatic repulsion of cathodic n products e g nh 4 from iron surface in all batch tests the ammonium concentrations increased over reaction time up to a constant value which depended on the quantity of fe0 dosage used in the solution maximum and minimum ammonium production were observed for treatment h and a respectively equal to 25 8 and 4 6 mg l 1 at the end of experiment in all cases the ammonium concentration remained constant at the end of the increase in solution ph mostly occurring at 80 h the kinetics of the ammonium production process is discussed further in the section 3 2 1 in all treatments the solution ph rose rapidly from an initial value of 7 15 0 1 to 8 after 40 h the rate of ph increase for batches with mixed nzvi mzvi treatments e f g h and i was greater than treatments where nzvi or mzvi alone was used treatments a b c and d the connection between no 3 removal and increasing ph as shown in fig 8j can be described by the high consumption of protons for nitrate reaction 10 1 mol yang and lee 2005 20 no 3 10 h 4 fe 0 nh 4 3 h 2 o 4 fe 2 additionally in aerobic conditions fe0 is able to react with dissolved oxygen in water and produces ferrous and hydroxide karn et al 2009 21 2 fe 0 s 4 h aq o 2 aq 2 fe 2 aq 2 h 2 o in anoxic condition fe0 can react with water according to the following equation su et al 2014b 22 fe 0 s 2 h 2 o fe 2 aq h 2 g 2 oh aq ferrous ions are further oxidized to ferric ions in the presence of oxygen 23 4 fe 2 aq 4 h aq o 2 aq 4 fe 3 aq 2 h 2 o the four above reactions lead to increasing of solution ph treatments with higher dose of fe0 resulted in a higher increase in ph at the end of reaction time the increase in solution ph is negligible due to consuming hydroxyl ions which lead to appearance of greenish suspended rust inactivation of fe0 content and absence of no 2 accumulation huang et al 1998 choe et al 2004 as also shown in fig 9 a smaller increase in ph in solutions containing mzvi as only reagent treatments a and b is linked with the lower denitrification rate of these treatments as discussed before it is also worth noting that high ph conditions i e high ph at the end of the tests could stimulate mineral precipitation e g iron hydroxide on the fe0 surface and hinder longevity of the reagents by limiting the electron transfer process see also fig 9b an incomplete mass balance of n i e sum of no 3 no 2 and nh 4 were less than initial n load is observed in all treatments it can be explained by the volatilization of ammonium through transformation into ammonia production of n2 gas and probably n2o gas and sorption of nitrogen products onto the positively charged surface of precipitated iron oxides especially at high ph conditions ph 8 as shown also in fig 8 the kind of unbalanced n mass nub in the solutions during the reaction time are not detected in this study the electrical conductivity ec decreases exponentially in all treatments over time except those containing only the nzvi batches a to d in this case a decrease in ec is observed after a weak peak for treatments a and b and later on for treatments c and d it is evident that the increase in solutions ec is probably due to accumulation of oxided species of iron i e fe2 and fe3 in the solution which generate in higher rates through nzvi rapid decreasing of ec can be described by the consumption of nitrate and adsorption co precipitation of different ions containing n on the corrosion products of iron i e ferrous and ferric after a certain time depends on the fe0 content both the reduction reaction and adsorption reach to equilibrium and therefore ec is stabilized e g treatments e f and g these findings consistent with those reported by tang et al 2012 a limited increase of ec was observed at the end of the experiments for treatments g and h which may be due to higher ph conditions of these solutions as shown in fig 8 j the values of no 3 no 2 nh 4 ec and ph for all treatments at the end of the tests 1200 h are given in table 2 for better comparison the concentrations of these parameters at beginning of experiments are also given in table 2 the closure n mass balance recovered as no 3 1 9 to 9 4 of initial n no 2 15 to 18 of initial n nh 4 14 to 21 of initial n and nub 62 to 68 of initial n complete no3 removal 98 2 was obtained for treatment h whereas 90 of the initial no3 was reduced for treatment c the decrease of no 2 was in the range 54 to 62 for all treatments the partial removal is supposed to be due to the competition of this ion with nitrate for its reduction or to partial sorption onto fe0 surface siantar et al 1996 the long term concentrations of nh 4 ranged between 18 and 28 mg l 1 showed a significant increase compared with those observed at a shorter time e g 160 h when values in the range 4 5 to 26 mg l 1 were observed conversely the ec did not significantly change over the longer period compared with values at 160 h the high ph of solutions tended to rise up slowly of 0 2 for treatments e to i to 1 5 ph units for treatment c and corresponded always to an increase in nh 4 concentration these findings may be useful in the implications of zvi fate on the denitrification process for drinking water treatment 3 2 1 kinetic analysis of nitrate nitrite reduction and ammonium stripping in order to analyze the influence of the micro and nano zvi particles on the denitrification rate a kinetic analysis of the no 3 and no 2 degradation and nh 4 production and stripping was conducted on the recorded data during the nine experimental tests for each operating conditions tested pseudo first order kinetic models were used liang et al 2008 hwang et al 2011 hosseini and tosco 2013 24 d c no 3 dt k 1 c no 3 25 d c no 2 dt k 3 c no 2 for t t 1 26 d c nh 4 dt k 1 c no 3 0 c no 3 k 3 c no 2 0 c no 2 k 2 c nh 4 for t t 1 k 1 c no 3 0 c no 3 k 2 c nh 4 k 3 c no 2 for t t 1 where k 1 t 1 k 2 t 1 and k 3 t 1 are the constants of nitrate reduction ammonia stripping and nitrite reduction respectively dividing the variations of ammonium concentration during time right hand side of eq 26 in two parts is due to the nitrite reduction occurs in the early time of reaction i e t 1 20 h and then nitrite produces in all treatments integrating eqs 24 to 26 with respect to time t and considering the initial concentrations c no3 0 c no2 0 and c nh4 0 as the initial conditions the function of no 3 no 2 for t t 1

kinetic constants k 1 k 2 and k 3 were optimized by fitting the experimental data of nitrate nitrite and ammonium concentrations in the batch tests to eqs 27 to 30 as shown in table 3 the increase in solution ph as shown in fig 8j and the coating of fe0 surface by precipitates may both significantly affect the values of k 1 k 2 and k 3 during the reaction consequently in order to obtain a more accurate model estimation of the experimental results fitting was performed for different reaction times separately sparis et al 2013 regarding the number of measured data as shown in fig 8 the values of k 1 and k 2 for all treatments are obtained for two reaction steps fast frs up to 45 h and slow srs 45 h conversely the values of k 3 were obtained only for the frs since no 2 concentration increased during the sls the necessity of calculating the nitrate reduction constants for the two reaction steps in varying ph media was also reported in previous works e g comba et al 2012 the results of fitted k 1 k 2 and k 3 values are presented in table 3 the significant agreement between the experimental results and theoretical predictions r 2 values in table 3 indicates a good validation of the proposed kinetic models which is consistent with the findings of other authors e g liou et al 2005 hwang et al 2011 hosseini and tosco 2015 sparis et al 2013 results show that the k 1 value of the frs in the solution containing nzvi treatments a and b was averagely 3 folds greater than that calculated for the srs conversely this increase was averagely 1 5 folds in the solutions containing mzvi treatments c and d a decrease of nitrate reduction rate k 1 during the last period is also reported by previous researches e g hwang et al 2011 comba et al 2012 results also indicate that the k 2 value of the frs was averagely 16 folds greater than that calculated for the srs mainly due to the reduction of nitrates and nitrites to ammonium according to eqs 17 and 20 the minimum kinetic nitrate nitrite reduction and stripping constants k 1 k 2 and k 3 were obtained for treatments c and d containing only the mzvi while the maximum values of these constant were obtained for treatments a b and h containing the maximum nzvi the abatement curves of nitrite and nitrate during the srs generally showed faster decreasing trends i e higher values of k 1 and k 3 with the fe0 dosage used in the solution the values of k 1 0 002 to 0 16 h 1 and k 2 0 008 to 0 10 h 1 during the srs are consistent with previous works for example hosseini and tosco 2015 obtained values of k 1 and k 2 equal to 0 29 and 2 29 day 1 0 012 and 0 095 h 1 for nitrate reduction with initial concentration of 105 mg l 1 by nzvi 4 g l 1 in batch tests in anaerobic conditions and neutral ph nevertheless the obtained k 1 values in this study are much smaller than ones reported in some studies choe et al 2000 reported the rate constant of nitrate reduction by nzvi ss 31 4 m2 g 1 between 214 and 224 day 1 8 92 to 9 33 h 1 in ambient conditions siantar et al 1996 reported a rate constant of reaction of 300 57 day 1 12 5 2 5 h 1 under anaerobic no 3 reduction in buffered solution with ph 7 by micro fe0 hwang et al 2011 reported the k 1 value between 6 30 and 6 60 h 1 for the buffered solution containing 100 mg l 1 nitrate and 1250 mg l 1 nzvi for the first 15 min of reaction time sparis et al 2013 obtained the k 1 value equal to 1 52 h 1 for the buffered solution containing 200 mg l 1 nitrate and 3330 mg l 1 nzvi for the first 20 min of reaction time difference in selecting the time of changing reaction constant may be the reason of obtained small values of k 1 in this study i e 45 h it is noteworthy the effect of increasing the mass of reagents nzvi or mzvi on the kinetic constants of k 1 and k 2 the effect of the used amount of nano sized zvi on the nitrate and ammonium stripping kinetics is greater than micro sized zvi especially during the srs for a given mzvi concentration e g 2 g l 1 adding a constant mass of nzvi to the solution e g 2 g l 1 in treatments d and h results in an increase of 3 8 times from 0 004 to 0 016 h 1 for k1 and 1 9 times 0 0087 to 0 0169 h 1 for k2 conversely adding 2 g l 1 mzvi to the solution containing 0 5 g l 1 nzvi treatments a and f results only an increasing 1 75 times for k1 0 008 to 0 014 h 1 and 1 73 for k2 0 006 to 0 010 h 1 3 3 nitrate removal through nprws based on the results of batch tests and also numerous pretests conducted in the bench scale sand medium experiments each nprws containing 2 g nzvi 10 g mzvi and 120 g very coarse sand this resulted in relative hydraulic conductivity k r 4 and therefore the factor f will be 1 48 according to fig 5 results of numerical simulations by pmpath reproducing the experimental setup indicated that six wells with inner and outer diameters 0 03 and 0 04 m respectively are suitable to capture all upstream groundwater plume as also shown in fig 4 the concentrations of no 3 no 2 nh 4 ec and ph in the upstream up and downstream piezometers dp1 to dp3 were measured every 10 0 h i e every pore volume time for up to five pore volumes and are shown in fig 10 the monitored nitrogen species and ec in the effluent groundwater of vertical nprws have the same values for three downstream piezometers dp1 to dp3 since the vertical wells collect all the upstream contaminated plume conversely the horizontal and slanted nprws with inclined angle of θ 45 cover 25 and 75 of the contaminated plume respectively in the horizontal nprws only the piezometer dp2 monitored water treated in the wells while water collected at the piezometers dp1 and dp3 was not intercepted by the wells see also fig 4 for the vertical nprws the influent concentration of no 3 i e 128 mg l 1 was reduced down to 36 of the initial value in the first two pvs and then increased fig 10a conversely the no 3 removal for the horizontal monitored in piezometer dp2 and slanted nprws average of three downstream piezometers was 79 and 41 of the influent no 3 respectively during each bench scale experiments i e five pvs approximately 50 l of contaminated groundwater passed through the nprws resulting in a ratio of fe0 to no 3 equal to 5 85 g g 1 the amount of fe0 present in the nprws is comparable with those used in the batch tests i e treatments a and b as shown in table 1 moreover the inflow provided continuously newly contaminated water compared to the batch tests these are the reasons why the effluent nitrate concentration for the nprws increases after a certain number of pvs as a general rule the nitrate removal rate for the slanted nprws was significantly lower than for the two other nprws effluent no 2 and nh 4 concentrations for three nprws orientations increased during the experimental time but in different extents the maximum increase in nitrite and ammonium were observed in the horizontal nprws in piezometer dp2 and slanted nprws respectively fig 10d i this reveals that the effluent concentrations of these ions are directly related to the contact time of contaminant plume with the reagents through the nprws the ec of effluent solution from three nprws systems increased up to a certain value due to production of ions through nitrate reduction process and then remained constant in horizontal nprws or decreased in vertical and slanted nprws as shown in fig 10 j o this behavior can be also explained by the refreshing of influent plume to the nprws by groundwater with less ec an increase of the ec values in the effluent solution of vertical nprws containing the nzvi coarse sand was not observed in the previous work hosseini and tosco 2015 likely due to the different water chemistry used in the experiments variations of solution ph in the effluent rose up and then decreased similarly to the trend of no 3 and ec it should be mentioned that nitrate removal process through the nprws filled by micro nano fe0 accompanied by no 2 and nh 4 production proton consumption i e increasing ph and increasing the ec of effluent solution which was stimulated by the slanted orientation of wells a minor reduction of the permeability of the filling materials in the nprws was observed after completing the experiments likely because the ph of the medium was not sufficiently high 8 to allow significant precipitation of iron oxyhydroxide feooh which was reported in previous works e g gandhi et al 2002 denitrification processes in batch and bench scale experiments indicated conformity in the closure n products i e no 2 nh 4 and n2 g but comparing the n mass balance between two experiments is not possible due to differences in experimental conditions in the bench sand medium tests the do has a significant impact on the nitrate removal process through the nprws systems than the batch tests due to refreshing do content in recycling contaminated water after the experiments the retained mass of mzvi and nzvi particles in each nprw was also measured by weighting the dried contains of each nprw sand mzvi and nzvi averagely 8 1 0 g mass loss is observed in each well this implies that the amount of nzvi and mzvi that leached out of each nprw to the aquifer the initial mass of nzvi and mzvi in each well is 12 0 g since the containing coarse sand in the wells can t be passed through the opening embedded along the cylinder wall however the nzvi particles are stabilized by a thin layer of iron oxide but an insignificant mass of these particles are leached out the nprw 3 4 synthesis of experimental and modeling results the connection between analytical equations i e eqs 12 14 and 16 batch and sand box experiments can be established by coupling the hydraulic contact time t c between contaminant plume and reagents through a nprws system eq 10 and the pseudo first order kinetic model eq 23 for nitrate reduction by the reagent used in the nprws combining these equations yields the percentage of nitrate reduction rate pnr through each nprw with different inclination angle θ 0 90 during the time t c as follows 25 pnr 1 c t c c 0 100 1 e k 1 t c 100 where c 0 and c t c are the nitrate concentrations in upstream and downstream plume of nprws respectively other parameters are defined earlier computing the values of t c within the vertical slanted and horizontal nprws using eq 14 and considering the values of k 1 for treatments a as lower limit and b as upper limit during the srs in the batch experiments i e k 1 0 008 to 0 010 h 1 the variations of pnr can be obtained using eq 29 the values of t c are obtained 380 s 537 s and 4219 s respectively for vertical slanted with θ 45 and horizontal nprw the results obtained using analytical eq 25 and the measured values of pnr through nprws systems in three orientations of vertical slanted and horizontal wells are shown in fig 11 the developed analytical equations can simulate the mean value of pnr observed in the sand box experiments as indicates by open circles in fig 11 in the horizontal nprw and low values of pnr in the slanted and vertical nprws however the higher values of observed pnrs in three configurations of nprw are not enclosed by the analytical solution domain 4 conclusion the efficacy of non pumping reactive wells nprws system in three orientations of vertical slanted with inclination angle θ 45 and horizontal for the degradation of nitrate contaminated groundwater was assessed through laboratory bench scale studies and modeling the reactive material emplaced in the wells was a mixture of nano micro fe0 which was selected based on several batch tests the delineation of steady state capture area for nprws the optimal spacing among the nprws and number of wells in the bench scale model were designed based on flow simulations using the semi analytical particle tracking model pmpath whereas the aquifer is assumed to be a homogeneous and isotropic medium the results obtained in this study can be summarized as follows 1 emplacing the mixture of nano micro fe0 and sand as a reducing agent in non pumping reactive wells nprws is a promising technology for remediation of deep groundwater contaminated by no 3 this approach incorporates both advantages of high reactivity of nzvi and slow but continuous reactivity of mzvi to ensure the longevity and efficiency of the denitrification process in the field scale 2 the presence of the nzvi in the reactive medium not only contributes directly to the no 3 reduction in early reaction time but also stimulates the denitrification rate by mzvi through production of hydrogen which acts as catalyst to electron transfer 3 despite the efficiency of mzvi and nzvi in nitrate reduction the possible generation of toxic by products and greenhouse gasses e g ammonium and n2o may be a limitation of these reagents 4 closure n products of denitrification process by nano and micro zvi in batch tests and bench scale experiments were no 2 nh 4 and unbalanced nitrogen products probably gaseous n2 5 based on the results of batch tests the rate of no 3 removal increases as the mass of fe0 content in the solution increases however using additional mass of fe0 in the nprws may increase the nitrate removal rate but would likely decrease the hydraulic conductivity of the reactive medium by precipitation of iron oxides in long term operations 6 the results of the numerical model pmpath indicated that for a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer a maximum capture width of 1 85 times greater than the nprw diameter is obtained for relative hydraulic conductivity k r 4 increasing the k r 80 does not have a significant effect on the width of the capture zone 7 a trade off between the hydraulic conductivity of reactive materials mass of fe0 used in the nprws and orientation of nprws should be considered to increase the capture area of wells from upgradient contaminated plumes and also nitrate removal rates 8 the hydraulic contact time of influent contaminated plume with reagent materials can be controlled by tuning the inclination angle of nprws with respect to groundwater flow direction 9 horizontal nprws filled by reactive materials provide adequate hydraulic contact time between the contamination and reagent materials and are applicable for the remediation of groundwater plume with limited size and dimensions or thin aquifers contaminated by high risk and toxic pollutants which need to be completely attenuated a higher efficiency of the horizontal nprws can be obtained when groundwater velocity has a significant vertical component additionally implementing the low reactivity and time consuming degradation mechanism e g biodegradation can be also operated in the horizontal nprws 10 the vertical nprws system is appropriate for remediation of deep contaminated groundwater where moderate degradation is needed however the efficiency of vertical nprws for pollutant degradation can be enhanced by drilling more consecutive arrays of wells slanted nprws system is an appropriate choice for treatment of deeply extended contamination plume as well the degree of pollutant degradation can be managed by changing the inclination angle of wells 11 concentrating the reactive materials i e nzvi and mzvi in the nprw system may reduce the risk of particle release in the environment over long time frames even if the mobility of bare non stabilized nzvi is very limited under natural flow conditions 12 pivotal issues including heterogeneity of aquifer media transient nature of groundwater hydraulics and geochemistry should be considered in the design and up scaling of nprws system as a remediation systems from batch to laboratory and then to pilot scale the authors are aware that this practical approach makes more complicated the full comprehension of the reaction mechanisms occurring in the batch and the bench scale model but provides more reliable results for the up scaling of the technology to the field the main focus of this study was to modify the hydraulic contact time of nitrate with reagents i e nzvi mzvi and area of well capture zone by changing the orientations of nprws while other affected factors e g initial ph initial do and initial no 3 pore water velocity aquifer medium were considered constant more studies to investigate the effects of these factors on the efficiency of nprws with different orientations are useful future research directions furthermore tracking different kinds of n byproducts in the solutions especially associated with the production of greenhouse gasses e g n2o during the reaction time of nitrate with zvi is suggested for the future studies acknowledgement the authors wish to thank the editor in chief professor charles werth and four anonymous reviewers

1679,a previous study has reported that knudsen diffusion coefficients obtained by tracer experiments conducted with a binary gas system and a porous medium are consistently smaller than those obtained by permeability experiments conducted with a single gas system and a porous medium to date however that study is the only one in which tracer experiments have been conducted with a binary gas system therefore to confirm this difference in knudsen diffusion coefficients we used a method we had developed previously to conduct tracer experiments with a binary carbon dioxide nitrogen gas system and five porous media with permeability coefficients ranging from 10 13 to 10 11 m2 the results showed that the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 d n2 cm2 s was related to the effective permeability coefficient k e m2 as d n2 7 39 107 k e 0 767 thus the knudsen diffusion coefficients of n2 obtained by our tracer experiments were consistently 1 27 of those obtained by permeability experiments conducted with many porous media and air by other researchers by using an inversion simulation to fit the advection diffusion equation to the distribution of concentrations at observation points calculated by mathematically solving the equation we confirmed that the method used to obtain the knudsen diffusion coefficient in this study yielded accurate values moreover because the knudsen diffusion coefficient did not differ when columns with two different lengths 900 and 1500 mm were used this column property did not influence the flow of gas in the column the equation of the dusty gas model already includes obstruction factors for knudsen diffusion and molecular diffusion which relate to medium heterogeneity and tortuosity and depend only on the structure of the porous medium furthermore there is no need to take account of any additional correction factor for molecular diffusion except the obstruction factor because molecular diffusion is only treated in a multicomponent gas system thus molecular diffusion considers only the obstruction factor related to tortuosity therefore we introduced a correction factor for a multicomponent gas system into the dgm equation multiplying the knudsen diffusion coefficient which includes the obstruction factor related to tortuosity by this correction factor from the present experimental results the value of this correction factor was 1 27 and it depended only on the structure of the gas system in the porous medium keywords knudsen diffusion tracer experiment permeability experiment binary gas system dusty gas model 1 introduction mass transfer of chemical substances in the gas phase through soil is necessary to purify soil and groundwater contaminated with volatile organic chemicals or fuel oil e g amos et al 2005 bekins et al 2001 fitts 2002 molecular diffusion knudsen diffusion nonequimolar fluxes and viscous fluxes are dominantly responsible for the migration of chemical substances in a porous medium e g a soil or catalyst do 1998 fick s law has generally been used to mathematically describe the migration of a chemical substance in the gas phase through a porous medium because this equation is simpler and easier to deal with than those of other models however in actual soils multicomponent gas systems are typical and in contaminated soils the gas system often includes several toxic chemical substances fick s law can deal only with molecular diffusion in a binary gas system and it cannot take account of other diffusion or flux mechanisms in contrast the stefan maxwell equation can be applied to a multicomponent gas system that lacks walls and solid particles and can deal with a nonequimolar flux that is a binary gas system in which the flux of chemical component a to that of chemical component b is not equal to the inverse flux of chemical component b to that of chemical component a because the molecular weights of components a and b differ mason et al 1967 developed the dusty gas model dgm on the basis of chapman enskog gas theory to take account of the effect of walls and solid particles the dgm is a comprehensive gas transport model that takes account of molecular diffusion knudsen diffusion and nonequimolar fluxes in a multicomponent gas system with solid particles cunningham and williams 1980 mason and malinauskas 1983 further the dgm can account for the relation between knudsen diffusion which occurs by collisions of molecules with the surfaces of solid particles and the slip effect that is a non zero gas velocity at the surfaces of solid particles klinkenberg 1941 found that the measured apparent permeability of a medium is larger to a gas than to a liquid this phenomenon is called the klinkenberg effect and occurs because gas flow in a porous medium is not zero at the surfaces of the particles composing the porous medium whereas the velocity of a liquid is zero at the surfaces of particles because of the viscosity of the liquid gas molecules occupying the voids of a porous medium collide with each other and with the particles of the medium moreover they are more likely to collide with the particles of the porous medium when the average pore radius of the medium is smaller because the total volume of the voids in the porous medium is thereby reduced as a result the velocity is not zero at the surfaces of the particles of the medium and a slip flux or effect as noted above occurs thus both knudsen diffusion and the slip effect occur because the gas molecules collide with the surfaces of solid particles and knudsen diffusion is related to the slip effect by the klinkenberg parameter effective permeability and gas pressure although the dgm takes account of several of the main mechanisms governing the transfer of chemical substances in a porous medium the dgm equations are very complex therefore they have not yet been used in numerical simulations of the mass transfer of chemical substances in a multicomponent gas system with a porous medium abriola et al 1992 and webb and pruess 2003 however have developed a numerical simulation method based on the dgm for a binary gas system in porous media furthermore sleep 1998 hibi 2008 and hibi et al 2009 developed numerical simulation models based on the dgm to predict the movements of chemical substances in a multicomponent gas system in a porous medium hibi 2008 and hibi et al 2009 took account of knudsen diffusion while simulating the migration of oxygen nitrogen and methane in a three component gas system in sandy soil and the concentrations of each component predicted by their numerical simulation were consistent with those obtained by column experiments therefore they confirmed that the dgm can be applied to a multicomponent gas system in a porous medium characterized by knudsen diffusion and nonequimolar fluxes massmann and farrier 1992 and thorstenson and pollock 1989 pointed out that the flux predicted by advection diffusion in accordance with fick s law is different from that predicted by multicomponent dgm equations when the intrinsic permeability of the porous medium is 1 0 10 14 m2 further abriola et al 1992 confirmed that there was a difference between the distribution of the molar fraction of the gas system components obtained by fick s law and that obtained by the dgm even when the intrinsic permeability was 1 0 10 10 m2 and the difference was larger when the intrinsic permeability was 1 0 10 16 m2 therefore the influence of knudsen diffusion on the mass transport of chemical components in a gas system in a porous medium increases as the intrinsic permeability decreases thus knudsen diffusion should be taken into account in the mass transfer of a chemical substance in a gas system in a porous medium with an intrinsic permeability of 1 0 10 10 m2 therefore it is important to investigate the distinctive characteristics of knudsen diffusion coefficients for both molecular diffusion and knudsen diffusion are included in the dgm and in practical applications of the model they are multiplied by tortuosity tortuosity a factor that has been proposed to account for the obstruction of the migration diffusion of molecules by the particles of a porous medium has been extensively used in modeling the diffusion of a chemical substance in either the aqueous phase or gas phase through a porous medium knudsen diffusion occurs when the molecules collide with the surfaces of the particles that compose the porous medium and those collisions may influence the diffusion of gas phase chemical components in a porous medium to date only a few studies have empirically determined the knudsen diffusion coefficient by conducting tracer experiments with a binary gas system abed and rinker 1974 chen and rinker 1979 and abu el sha r and abriola 1997 conducted permeability experiments with a single gas system in a porous medium and tracer experiments in several porous media and reported that the knudsen diffusion coefficients obtained from the tracer experiments binary gas system were smaller than those obtained from the permeability experiments single gas system chen and rinker 1979 showed that the knudsen diffusion coefficient obtained by a tracer experiment is consistent with that obtained by a permeability experiment when the volumetric average of the knudsen diffusion coefficient for different pore radiuses in the porous medium and a tortuosity factor for pores of a given radius are incorporated into the original dgm they considered these additions to be reasonable because the original dgm was derived by assuming an ideal parallel pore arrangement and a uniform pore size this modified dgm is generally used to simulate the movement of chemical substances in porous media with binary gas or multi gas systems hibi 2008 hibi et al 2009 in fact a single gas system can surround a binary gas system such that the gas system changes continuously from a single gas to a binary gas system at the boundary between the two systems if tortuosity is constant and independent of the number of chemical components in the gas system the difference in knudsen diffusion coefficients between single and binary gas systems reported by abed and rinker 1974 abu el sha r and abriola 1997 and chen and rinker 1979 implies that the knudsen diffusion coefficient must change suddenly at this boundary however a sudden change in the knudsen diffusion coefficient at the boundary between a single and a binary gas system cannot occur in an actual gas system thus it is necessary to confirm and explain the cause of this difference between a knudsen diffusion coefficient obtained by tracer experiments with a binary gas system and that obtained by permeability experiments with a single gas system to our knowledge no tracer experiments have been reported since the studies of chen and rinker 1979 and of abu el sha r and abriola 1997 however hibi and taguchi 2011 and hibi et al 2012 developed an original procedure for a tracer experiment that can be used to obtain the molecular diffusion coefficient with tortuosity the knudsen diffusion coefficient and the mechanical dispersion coefficient dispersivity the aim of the present study is to use their procedure to experimentally confirm the difference between the knudsen diffusion coefficient obtained by permeability experiments and that obtained by tracer experiments we therefore conducted permeability experiments with nitrogen to obtain the permeability coefficients of five porous media and tracer experiments with a binary carbon dioxide nitrogen gas system and five porous media to obtain the knudsen diffusion coefficient of nitrogen we employed the method developed by hibi and taguchi 2011 and hibi et al 2012 for obtaining the knudsen diffusion coefficient from the distribution of concentrations measured by tracer experiments then we compared knudsen diffusion coefficients measured by permeability experiments conducted by other researchers with those obtained from the results of the tracer experiments conducted in this study 2 theory and method for calculating the knudsen diffusion coefficient 2 1 permeability experiment darcy s law can be applied to gas flow in a porous medium when gravity is neglected the darcy equation can be expressed as follows 1 q k a μ g dp g dx where q is the gas flux l t k a is the apparent permeability coefficient l2 p g is the total gas pressure m lt2 and μ g is the viscosity m lt slip flux that is the non zero velocity at the surfaces of particles occurs in the porous medium klinkenberg 1941 derived the following equation to take account of the slip flux and relate the effective permeability coefficient k e l2 to the apparent permeability coefficient 2 k a k e bk e p where b is the klinkenberg parameter m lt2 and p is the average gas pressure m lt2 the klinkenberg parameter b can be expressed as follows 3 b cκt 2 0 5 πr 3 where r is the average pore radius l κ is the boltzmann constant l2m t2k c is a proportionality factor k l3 and t is absolute temperature k therefore the klinkenberg effect dominates the gas flow in a porous medium with a small average pore radius when the average pressure is low and the temperature is high the mass conservation equation for the steady flow of a gas in a porous medium in a one dimensional coordinate system can be expressed as follows 4 d ρ g q d x 0 where ρ g is the density of the gas m l3 and x is the distance from the injection point of the gas if atmospheric pressure and atmospheric density are p atm and ρ atm respectively and gas pressure is p g the density of gas ρ g can be expressed as follows 5 ρ g p g ρ atm p atm eq 5 is applicable to a compressible fluid in a porous medium the governing equation for the movement of a compressible gas in a porous medium can be obtained by substituting eqs 1 and 5 into eq 4 6 d p g ρ atm p atm k a μ g dp g d x dx 0 furthermore when ρ atm p atm k a and μ g are constant the following simple equation for gas flow in a porous medium can be derived 7 d p g p g x dx 0 by integrating both sides of eq 7 the following equation is derived in which c is the integration constant that satisfies the boundary condition 8 p g p g x c if the measured gas flux is q and the measured gas pressure is p 2 at the discharge point of gas x 2 dp g dx c p 2 is derived by dividing eq 8 by p 2 and dp g dx qμ g k a is derived by dividing eq 1 by k a μ g at x 2 the integration constant c is determined by the equation c qμ g p 2 k a therefore the differential equation p g p g x qμ g p 2 k a is obtained by substituting c qμ g p 2 k a in eq 8 the left side of this differential equation is integrated from the gas pressure at the injection point p 1 to that at the discharge point p 2 and the right side is integrated from the coordinate of injection point x 1 to that of discharge point x 2 as follows 9 p 1 p 2 p g d p g qμgp 2 ka x 1 x 2 dx in the case of a compressible fluid in a porous medium the apparent permeability coefficient k a l2 in the porous medium can be obtained from eq 10 which is derived from eq 9 as follows 10 k a q p 1 2 p 2 2 2 lμ g p 2 where l is the distance between the discharge point x 2 and the injection point x 1 l furthermore it is clear from eq 2 that a plot of k a against 1 p should yield a straight line with slope bk e and intercept k e 2 2 tracer experiment the dgm which was developed by mason et al 1967 can take account of the molecular diffusion flux the knudsen diffusion flux and nonequimolar fluxes and it can solve the migration of chemical substances in a porous medium with a multicomponent gas system the stefan maxwell equation can also deal with a multicomponent gas system in porous media without particles i e no solids obstruct the migration of chemical substances as in an atmospheric system the dgm equation can be derived from the stefan maxwell equation if one component of the multicomponent gas system is assumed to consist of large solid particles that do not move and collide with other components the stefan maxwell equation includes only molecular diffusion and nonequimolar fluxes but to derive the dgm the knudsen diffusion flux is added to the stefan maxwell equation by making the above assumption when knudsen diffusion occurs in a porous medium the gas velocity is not zero at the surfaces of the particles composing the porous medium and the gas molecules collide with the particles of the porous medium if a gas flowing horizontally in a column filled with dry soil and a background gas is assumed then the effect of gravity can be omitted from the equations for the migration of a gas in the gas phase of a soil gas system in a binary gas system the dgm system equations are as follows when gravity is neglected 11a x a n d b x b n d a q m d ab n d a q p d a p a rt 11b x b n d a x a n d b q m d ab n d b q p d b p b rt where x a and x b are molar fractions dimensionless n d a and n d b are molar fluxes mol l2t and p a and p b are the partial pressures m lt2 of components a and b respectively r is the gas constant ml2 molkt2 t is absolute temperature k d ab is the molecular diffusion coefficient between components a and b l2 t d a and d b are the knudsen diffusion coefficients l2 t of components a and b respectively and q m and q p are the obstruction factors of molecular diffusion and knudsen diffusion respectively abriola et al 1992 mason and malinauskas 1983 webb and pruess 2003 q m and q p are calculated from the tortuosity for molecular diffusion τ m and the tortuosity for knudsen diffusion τ p respectively and the gas filled porosity θ g 12a q m τ m θ g 12b q p τ p θ g where the tortuosity for molecular diffusion is the ratio of the molecular diffusion coefficient of the porous medium to that in the absence of any obstruction by solid particles and the tortusity for knudsen diffusion is the ratio of knudsen diffusion coefficient in the modified dgm for a real porous medium to knudsen diffusion coefficient in the original dgm developed for an ideal parallel pore arrangement and a uniform pore size by mason et al 1967 furthermore for chemical component i the knudsen diffusion coefficient is related to the klinkenberg parameter as d i k e b i μg where b i is the klinkenberg parameter of component i thorstenson and pollock 1989 the molar concentrations of components a and b c a and c b respectively mol l3 are derived from the equation of state for an ideal gas c a p a rt and c b p b rt respectively n d a d a n d b d b q p p g rt is obtained by summing the two sides of eqs 11a and 11b therefore by rearranging eqs 11a and 11b n d a and n d b become 13a n d a d a c a d a p g q p d b q m d ab p g c a 13b n d b d b c b d b p g q p d a q m d ab p g c b where the compound diffusion coefficients d a and d b are defined as in eqs 14a and 14b l2 t 14a d a 1 d b d a x a q m d ab x b q m d ab 1 q p d a 14b d b 1 d a d b x b q m d ab x a q m d ab 1 q p d a the total flux of component a n t a is calculated from its diffusion flux n d a eq 11a and advection flux c a k a p g μgmix as follows 15 n t a d a c a v ga c a where μ gmix is the viscosity of the gas mixture consisting of components b and a m lt and v ga compound velocity l t is defined as in eq 16 16 v ga d a p g q p d b q m d ab k a μ gmix p g the advection diffusion equation of the dgm for component a is derived from eq 16 and the mass conservation equation as follows 17 c a t v ga c a d a c a where d a d a θ and v ga v ga θ are the effective compound diffusion coefficient and the effective compound velocity respectively the reciprocal of eq 14a is equal to eq 18 below in which α d b d a is the ratio of the knudsen diffusion coefficients of components a and b 18 1 d a α 1 x a τ m d ab 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d a likewise for component b eq 19 is the reciprocal of eq 14b 19 1 d b 1 α 1 x b τ m d ab 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d b if it is assumed that dispersion in the gas phase of a soil is mechanical dispersion d mech then the dispersion coefficient d disp a in this gas system is expressed by eq 20 under the assumption of sleep 1998 that such dispersion is similar to that of chemical components dissolved in groundwater bear 1972 20 d disp a 1 d b d a x a τ m d ab x b τ m d a b 1 τ p d a d mech by substituting x b 1 x a and α d b d a into eq 20 the reciprocal of eq 20 becomes 21 1 d disp a α 1 x a τ m d ab 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d a 1 d mech α 1 x a τ m d ab 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d a it is clear from eq 21 that if x a is not proportional to 1 d disp a then eq 21 cannot be used to obtain τ m d ab τ p d a and τ p d b if x a is considered proportional to 1 d disp a and the slope of the regression line between x a and 1 d disp a is constant independent of any difference in gas pressure as was shown by the experiments of hibi and taguchi 2011 then the dispersion coefficient d disp a is related only to the intercept of the regression line to satisfy these conditions the relation between x a and 1 d disp a must be 22 1 d disp a α 1 x a τ m d ab 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d a δ mech similarly the relation between x b and the reciprocal of the dispersion coefficient of component b 1 d disp b is 23 1 d disp b 1 α 1 x b τ m d ab 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d b δ mech where δmech is a parameter that we call the difference coefficient with mechanical dispersion the value of which depends on the properties of the porous medium if considering eq 22 and c a c x a where c is the total molar concentration mol l3 and is constant the effective compound diffusion d a in eq 17 is replaced with d disp a then eq 17 expresses the advection dispersion relation with mechanical dispersion as follows 24 x a t v ga x a d disp a x a eq 24 can be applied to the case that the porosity in a porous medium is first filled with component b background gas and then component b is replaced with component a tracer gas d disp a and v ga are obtained by using the isccfem adq inversion simulator which was developed by hibi and colleagues hibi 2008 hibi and taguchi 2011 hibi et al 2012 to fit the advection dispersion equation to the molar fraction distribution of the tracer gas this inversion simulator employs a conjugate direction method powell 1964 for the fitting and a characteristic finite element scheme fujinawa 1986 for the discretization of the simulation region the one dimensional domain for the inversion simulation has a length of 90 or 150 cm according to the length of the column used and is divided into four blocks block 1 molar fraction 0 0 25 block 2 molar fraction 0 25 0 50 block 3 molar fraction 0 50 0 75 and block 4 molar fraction 0 75 1 0 if the grid is composed of cells each with a length of 5 mm then the finite element grid consists of 181 nodes and 180 elements when the length of the domain is 90 cm and it consists of 301 nodes and 300 elements when the length of the domain is 150 cm the inversion simulation is conducted for each block and then the effective compound dispersion coefficient and the effective compound velocity in that block are obtained from the concentrations within the molar fraction range of the block e g the molar fraction range of block 1 is 0 0 to 0 25 the number of time steps is 70 from the initial distribution of the observed distribution of concentrations d disp b and v gb effective compound velocity of component b can be similarly obtained by using the isccfem adq inversion simulator with the advection diffusion equation for component b when the background gas is component a and the tracer gas is component b if x a and x b are proportional to 1 d disp a and 1 d disp b respectively then the slope of the proportional relationship between x a and 1 d disp a is m a and that between x b and 1 d disp b is m b thus m a α 1 τ m d ab and m b 1 α α τ m d ab and τ m d ab can be obtained from the slopes of these respective relations as follows 25 τ m d ab m a m b m a m b and α can be calculated from m a and τ m d ab as follows 26 α m a τ m d ab 1 the intercepts of the regression lines between x a and 1 d disp a and between x b and 1 d disp b are defined as y a 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d a δmech and y b 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d b δmech respectively thus τ p d a can be calculated as follows 27 τ p d a α 1 α y a y b and τ p d b can be calculated from τ p d a and α 28 τ p d b ατ p d a eq 16 for the compound velocity of component a can be transformed to the following eq 29 by considering the one dimensional gas flow and the compound velocity of component a v ga 29 v ga μ gmix p g τ p d b τ m d ab p g μ gmix d a k a d disp a is similar to d a when δmech which is related to the dispersion coefficient is small and d a θd disp a by considering d a θd a then v ga and d a are calculated by using v ga θv ga and d a θd disp a and a plot of v ga μ gmix p g against μ gmix d a should yield a straight line with slope τ p d b τ m d ab p g and intercept k a if p g is constant because τ p d b τ m d ab is constant independent of the molar fraction of the tracer gas provided that neither the tracer gas nor the background gas is replaced with a different gas 3 methodology of the tracer and permeability experiments as porous media we used 0 4 and 0 2 mm glass beads each with a particle density of 2 5 g cm3 and a field soil collected at inazawa city japan with a particle density of 2 61 g cm3 we mixed bentonite with a particle density of 2 6 g cm3 into field soil at a mass ratio of field soil to bentonite of 3 1 and used this mixture of the field soil and the bentonite further toyoura sand which was collected in yamaguchi prefecture japan with a particle density of 2 65 g cm3 and controlled for particle size was mixed with the bentonite at a mass ratio of the toyoura sand to the bentonite of 3 1 and was also used in the present experiments we then conducted the tracer and permeability experiments indicated in table 1 the field soil and toyoura sand were oven dried before the experiments the porosities of all porous media ranged from 0 346 to 0 549 with those of the two media containing field soil being highest the particle size distributions of the 0 4 and 0 2 mm glass beads were narrow but the field soil had a broad particle size distribution range moreover the particle size distribution of the field soil bentonite mixture was wider than that of the field soil alone in addition the particle size distribution of the toyoura sand bentonite mixture differed from those of the other porous media because it could be divided into particles greater than and those 0 1 mm in size fig 1 two columns made of acrylic resin were used in each tracer and permeability experiment one of the columns had an outer diameter of 7 cm an inner diameter of 5 cm and a length of 150 cm fig 2 this column was equipped with seven electrical pressure gauges tokyo sokki kenkyujo co ltd pw 100 kpa range 0 100 kpa accuracy 0 005 kpa and 43 gas sample ports each of which consisted of a connector koyo co ltd rgb 05818 and a septum hamilton 9 mm dia 12 pk fig 2 the other column was 90 cm long with the same outer and inner diameters it was equipped with five electrical pressure gauges which were installed at intervals of 20 cm between 5 and 85 cm from one end of the column and 17 gas sample ports installed at intervals of 5 cm from one end of the column for each column the pressure gauges were connected to a data logger tokyo sokki kenkyujo co ltd tds 303 and the gas pressure in the column was measured automatically the gases were injected via pressure regulators fairchild model 10 range 0 15 kpa into the column from gas tanks fig 2 right side the gases flowed through the column from the right side to the left side in fig 2 and were released to the atmosphere fig 2 left side after first passing through a flow meter horiba stc co ltd sec n100 maximum discharge 300 cm3 min accuracy 0 1 cm3 min and a backpressure regulator fairchild model 10bp maximum pressure 15 kpa both the tracer and permeability experiments were conducted at a temperature of 20 c and a humidity of 50 each column was filled by placing it vertically with cover plates and flow meter removed on the laboratory floor the mass of the porous medium to be packed into the column was calculated from the volume of the column and the particle density of the porous medium so that the porosity would equal a predetermined value this mass was divided into aliquots such that each would have a thickness of 5 cm in the column then one aliquot of dry porous medium was dropped into the column and compacted by vibrating the column until the porous medium thickness in the column was 5 cm this dropping and compacting procedure was repeated with each aliquot until the porous medium was packed between the stainless steel screens at either end of the column finally the column was tightly closed with the cover plates and placed horizontally on a table 3 1 permeability experiments gas permeability tests were conducted after nitrogen gas with 99 9 purity was confirmed to have filled the void volume in the porous medium by analyzing gases sampled from the column with gas chromatography gl sciences inc gc 3200 with a thermal conductivity detector carrier gas helium oven temperature 50 c temperature in the injector 50 c temperature in the detector 70 c gas pressures at the inlet and outlet were adjusted to predetermined values by means of a gas pressure regulator installed at the inlet fig 2 right side and a gas backpressure regulator installed at the outlet fig 2 left side thus gas flowed from the right side of the column as depicted in fig 2 to the left side to obtain the effective permeability coefficients 10 to 21 gas pressure differences were imposed in the porous medium gas pressure barometric pressure and the discharge of gas from the column q l3 t were measured by the electrical pressure gauges a barometer isuzu seisakusho co ltd aneroid barometer b 180 no range 930 1070 hpa accuracy 1 hpa and the flow meter respectively until the gas pressures and the gas discharge had been constant for 5 min the steady flux of gas q was calculated by dividing the gas discharge q when q had been constant for 5 min by the cross sectional area of the column first p 1 2 p 2 2 2lμg p 2 was calculated from the gas pressures at the inlet and outlet p 1 and p 2 respectively once they had been constant for 5 min the length of the porous medium sample l and the viscosity of gas μ g then q was plotted against p 1 2 p 2 2 2lμ g p 2 and a straight regression line was fitted to these data by the method of least squares the slope of this regression line is equal to the apparent permeability k a next the average gas pressure p p 1 p 2 2 was calculated k a was plotted against 1 p and a regression line was fitted to these data by the method of least squares the slope and the intercept of the regression line thus obtained are bk e and the effective permeability k e respectively 3 2 tracer experiments in each experiment the background gas nitrogen with 99 9 purity or carbon dioxide gas with 99 999 purity was injected first via a three way valve installed after the pressure regulators fig 2 right side then the specific gas pressures at the column inlet and outlet were regulated by the pressure regulator and the backpressure regulator to create the desired pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet the gas in the column was sampled with a syringe sge analytical science maximum volume 1 0 ml minimum volume 0 02 ml and analyzed by gas chromatography to confirm that the background gas filled the column after the column was confirmed to be filled with the background gas the tracer gas nitrogen with 99 9 purity or carbon dioxide gas with 99 999 purity was injected into the column via the three way valve for each porous medium two to five tracer experiments were conducted with each tracer gas for each of two to five gas pressure differences in each experiment syringes were used to withdraw 0 15 ml samples of gas via the gas sample ports at a specific time for each specific pressure difference the samples were analyzed immediately by gas chromatography to determine the molar fractions of the background and tracer gases at the time of sampling the gas sampling did not affect the flow of the tracer gas in the column because only 0 15 ml of gas was sampled from each gas sample port immediately before the end of each experiment after the experiments were conducted with the first tracer gas the tracer gas and the background gas were exchanged and the tracer experiments were conducted again as described above d disp co2 and v gco2 of the tracer gas co2 were obtained by fitting the advection diffusion equation to the distribution of the molar fraction of the tracer gas co2 by means of the isccfem adq inversion simulator 1 d disp co2 was plotted against the molar fraction of the tracer gas co2 and a regression line was fitted to the relation between the molar fraction of the tracer gas co2 and 1 d disp co2 by the method of least squares then the slope and the intercept of this regression line were obtained as m co2 m a in eq 25 and y co2 y a in eq 27 similarly d disp n2 and v gn2 of the tracer gas n2 were obtained by using the isccfem adq inversion simulator to fit the advection diffusion equation to the distribution of the molar fraction of the tracer gas n2 and the slope and the intercept of the regression line of the relation between the molar fraction of the tracer gas n2 and 1 d disp n2 were obtained as m n2 m b in eq 25 and y n2 y b in eq 27 respectively then eq 25 was used to calculate τ m d co2 n2 from m co2 and m n2 and eq 26 was used to calculate α which is equal to the ratio of the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 to that of co2 from m co2 and τ m d co2 n2 finally eq 27 was used to calculate the knudsen diffusion coefficient of co2 τ p d co2 from y co2 y n2 and α and the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 τ p d n2 was calculated by multiplying τ p d co2 by α because the distribution of the molar fraction of the tracer gas n2 was wide in the two porous media with low permeability toyoura sand mixed with bentonite and the field soil mixed with bentonite the longer column 1500 mm was used for the tracer experiments with these porous media furthermore the use of columns of two different lengths allowed the influence of column length on the flow of gas in a column to be investigated 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparisons of gas permeability between the permeability and tracer experiments as indicated in section 2 2 the apparent gas permeability can be obtained from the relationship between μgmixd and v μ gmix p values obtained by the tracer experiments we thus plotted v μ gmix p against μ gmix d values obtained from the tracer experiments and fitted straight lines to the data by the method of least squares in the tracer experiment results μ gmix d was directly proportional to v μgmix p and the coefficient of determination r 2 between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p ranged from 0 53 to 0 66 except in the experiments with the toyoura sand bentonite mixture fig 3 thus the tracer experiment results showed a correlation between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p in 0 4 mm glass beads 0 2 mm glass beads and field soil in contrast r 2 for this relationship with the toyoura sand bentonite mixture was only 0 33 μ gmix d values obtained by the tracer experiments with the toyoura sand bentonite mixture were therefore not strongly correlated with the v μ gmix p values in the experiments with 0 2 mm glass beads fig 3b but not in those with the other porous media fig 3a c and d the relation between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p was dependent on the pressure difference eq 29 implies that the relation between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p is dependent on the gas pressure however the apparent permeability k a depends on the average gas pressure as shown in eq 2 the r 2 value of 0 33 for the relationship between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p with the toyoura sand bentonite mixture was obtained by using the results of all of the tracer experiments with that medium which were conducted using two gas pressure differences 3 kpa and 5 kpa table 1 in contrast the r 2 value for the relationship between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p based on the results of only those experiments conducted with a pressure difference of 5 0 kpa was larger at 0 587 fig 4 thus the data with the wide scatter in fig 3d were obtained when the pressure difference was 3 kpa the apparent permeability i e the intercept of the regression line between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p was 1 44 10 12 m2 when all data were plotted and 1 431 10 12 m2 when only data for the pressure difference of 5 kpa were plotted thus the apparent permeability was similar regardless of whether the data obtained with a pressure difference of 3 kpa were included when the tracer gas was co2 and the porous medium was the field soil bentonite mixture fig 5a r 2 for the relationship between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p was 0 65 and μ gmix d was directly proportional to v μ gmix p in contrast with this medium when the tracer gas was n2 and the pressure difference was 1 0 kpa or 1 5 kpa r 2 for the relationship between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p was very low at 0 0502 fig 5b when we plotted only the data for the pressure difference of 1 5 kpa fig 6 however the resulting r 2 value was 0 915 thus the more scattered data fig 5b were those obtained when the pressure difference was 1 0 kpa therefore μ gmix d was strongly correlated with v μ gmix p only when the pressure difference was 1 5 kpa when the tracer gas and the pressure difference were n2 and 1 5 kpa respectively the apparent permeability of the field soil bentonite mixture was 4 97 10 13 m2 fig 6 the intercept of the regression line for the relationship between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p was slightly different between the experiment with co2 as the tracer gas 6 75 10 13 cm2 and that with n2 as the tracer gas 4 97 10 13 cm2 fig 5a and 6 when the porous medium was field soil or the toyoura sand bentonite mixture which had low permeability coefficients and the pressure difference was small the relation between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p could not be accurately determined by the tracer experiments with n2 as the tracer gas the reason might be that the gas did not flow uniformly across the section of the column because of its very slow velocity when the pressure difference was small eq 2 implies that the apparent permeability coefficient k a is directly proportional to the reciprocal of the average gas pressure and indeed in the permeability experiment results the apparent permeability coefficient k a was directly proportional to 1 p the coefficients of determination of the regression of k a against 1 p were in the range 0 241 0 569 for all porous media except that for the field soil bentonite mixture which was very low at 0 046 fig 7 for all porous media the dispersion of the apparent permeability coefficients was narrow the effective permeability coefficient is equal to the intercept of the regression line of k a against 1 p we conducted the permeability experiments using an average gas pressure range from 104 kpa to 111 kpa values close to atmospheric pressure in this average gas pressure range the second term on the right side of eq 2 bk e p which expresses the slip effect greatly influences the apparent permeability furthermore the average gas pressure employed in the permeability experiments to obtain the effective permeability was low and the range of the average gas pressure was narrow as a result the coefficient of determination of the regression of k a against 1 p was not very high to address this problem some permeability experiments should be conducted with higher gas pressures than were used in the present series of permeability experiments the effective or apparent permeability values shown in table 2 were obtained from intercepts of the regression lines shown in figs 3 to 7 the apparent permeabilities obtained by the tracer experiments k a were about 2 to 6 times the effective permeabilities obtained by the permeability experiments k e fig 8 therefore it is plausible that the actual permeability might be larger than those obtained by the permeability experiments in this study but it is unlikely that it would be smaller the porous media used in this study had permeabilities that ranged from 10 13 to 10 11 m2 in a porous medium knudsen diffusion mainly dominates when the permeability is 1 0 10 14 m2 massmann and farrier 1992 because such a regime is characterized by free molecular flow in which molecule wall interactions are more frequent than molecule molecule interactions thus in a flow system with permeability between 10 13 and 10 11 m2 the flow should be transitional between a free molecular flow regime with frequent molecule wall interactions and a viscous flow regime in which molecule molecule interactions are more frequent than molecule wall interactions such a transitional regime should show the effects of both molecule wall and molecule molecule interactions zhang et al 2015 4 2 knudsen diffusion coefficients of the porous media to obtain the molecular diffusion coefficient between carbon dioxide and nitrogen τd co2 n2 and the knudsen diffusion coefficients for carbon dioxide d co2 and nitrogen d n2 we plotted the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion coefficient obtained from the tracer experiments against the molar fraction of the tracer gas figs 9 and 10 and fitted straight lines to the data by the method of least squares the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion coefficient was directly proportional to the molar fraction of the tracer gas and it increased as the molar fraction of co2 increased in contrast the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion decreased as the molar fraction of n2 increased for all porous media except field soil the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion coefficient was correlated with the molar fraction of co2 r 2 range 0 53 0 90 fig 9 and the standard deviation of the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion coefficients of the porous media ranged from 0 50 to 4 99 s cm2 table 3 when the tracer gas was n2 r 2 values of this relation ranged from 0 45 to 0 97 fig 9 and they were lower range 0 45 0 52 for 0 2 mm glass beads than for the other porous media the absolute values of the correlation coefficients for the 0 2 mm glass beads calculated by taking the square root of the coefficients of determination ranged from 0 67 to 0 72 therefore the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion coefficient for 0 2 mm glass beads was also correlated with the molar fraction of n2 similarly the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion for field soil increased as the molar fraction of the tracer gas co2 increased but decreased as the molar fraction of the tracer gas n2 increased fig 10 though the coefficients of determination between the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion and the molar fraction of the tracer gas co2 ranged from 0 49 to 0 51 and were lower than those for the tracer gas n2 range 0 51 0 79 the absolute values of the correlation coefficients calculated from the coefficients of determination for the tracer gas co2 ranged from 0 69 to 0 72 moreover the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion for field soil with the tracer gas n2 was also correlated with the molar fraction of n2 r 2 0 51 fig 10 the standard deviation of the effective compound dispersion of field soil ranged from 3 46 to 4 18 s cm2 for the tracer gas co2 and from 0 82 to 2 54 s cm2 for the tracer gas n2 the slopes of the regression lines between the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion of field soil and the molar fraction of the tracer gas ranged from 10 644 to 12 715 s cm2 for the tracer gas co2 and from 5 381 to 8 203 s cm2 for the tracer gas n2 fig 10 in the case of field soil the slopes did not vary with the pressure difference fig 10 for all other porous media except 0 2 mm glass beads the slopes of the regression lines differed by 9 to 34 relative to the maximum absolute slope of the porous medium however for 0 2 mm glass beads the slopes of the regression lines for each tracer gas when the pressure difference was 0 03 kpa were about three times those when the pressure difference was 0 1 kpa fig 9c d knudsen diffusion coefficients of co2 obtained by the tracer experiments with 0 4 mm glass beads were 0 162 to 0 223 cm2 s and those obtained with 0 2 mm glass beads were 0 122 to 0 408 cm2 s these values are greater than those obtained with the other porous media in contrast the knudsen diffusion coefficients of co2 obtained with the toyoura sand bentonite mixture were 0 00709 to 0 0107 cm2 s and those obtained with the field soil bentonite mixture were 0 00767 to 0 0192 cm2 s these values are smaller than those for the other porous media table 3 the tendencies of the knudsen diffusion coefficients were similar between n2 and co2 in this study those for the tracer gas co2 ranged from 0 00709 to 0 408 cm2 s and those for the tracer gas n2 ranged from 0 00844 to 0 707 cm2 s in these flow systems with effective permeabilities between 3 48 10 13 and 1 81 10 11 m2 table 2 the flow regime is expected to be transitional between one with frequent molecule wall interactions and a viscous flow regime in which molecule molecule interactions are more frequent the value of α obtained by the tracer experiments where α d n2 d co2 ranged from 1 10 to 1 73 for all porous media except 1 the 0 2 mm glass beads when the pressure difference was 0 1 kpa 2 the toyoura sand bentonite mixture when the pressure difference was 1 5 kpa and 3 the field soil when the pressure difference was 3 0 or 4 5 kpa in these three cases α ranged from 1 96 to 2 52 do 1998 derived the following equation for α in a single gas system with a porous medium 30 α m co2 m n2 1 2 where m co2 and m n2 are the molecular weights of carbon dioxide and nitrogen respectively if eq 30 and the molecular weights of carbon dioxide 44 0 g mol and nitrogen 28 0 g mol are used to calculate α then its value should be 1 25 in a single gas system though most values of α obtained in this study were 1 25 the value of α for the field soil bentonite mixture never exceeded 1 25 reinecke and sleep 2002 reported the following relationship between the knudsen diffusion coefficient and the effective permeability coefficient on the basis of permeability experiments conducted with several porous media 31 d air 4 03 10 9 ke 0 794 where d air is the knudsen diffusion coefficient of air cm2 s fig 11 the regression expressions for the relation between the knudsen diffusion coefficients of the tracer gas n2 and the tracer gas co2 and the effective permeability coefficients obtained from the results of the tracer experiments and the permeability experiments in this study are as follows fig 11 32a d n2 7 39 10 7 k e 0 767 32b d co2 4 60 10 7 k e 0 768 the coefficients of determination of these regression expressions for n2 and co2 are 0 70 and 0 73 respectively thus in our data the effective permeability coefficient was strongly correlated with the knudsen diffusion coefficient of co2 or n2 because the value of the exponent in eq 32a for n2 is similar to that in eq 32b for co2 the regression lines are parallel to each other thus the ratio of the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 to that of co2 i e the value of α calculated from eqs 32a and 32b is 1 65 when the effective permeability is 5 0 10 12 m2 which is greater than α m co2 m n2 1 2 1 25 although the value of the exponent in eq 32a for n2 is also similar to that in eq 31 for air for an effective permeability of 5 0 10 12 m2 the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 obtained by the tracer experiments in this study is 1 27 the knudsen diffusion coefficient of air obtained by reinecke and sleep 2002 given a molecular weight of air m air 29 0 g mol and the molecular weight of n2 m n2 28 0 g mol the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 should be very close to that of air because α m n2 m air 1 2 is 0 98 therefore the results of this study confirm the difference between knudsen diffusion coefficients obtained by tracer experiments and those obtained by permeability experiments reported by abed and rinker 1974 we estimated the accuracy of the method that we used to obtain the knudsen diffusion coefficients from the tracer gas results to verify this difference in the knudsen diffusion coefficient between tracer and permeability experiments ogata and banks 1961 mathematically solved the following one dimensional advection diffusion equation with the boundary conditions that the concentration was c 0 at x 0 and t 0 and 0 0 at x and t 0 and the initial condition that the concentration was 0 0 at x 0 and t 0 where x is the distance from the gas inlet and t is the elapsed time from the injection of gas 33 c c 0 2 erfc x vt 2 dt 1 2 exp vx d erfc x vt 2 dt 1 2 where c is the concentration of the gas d is the diffusion coefficient and v is the velocity of the gas the concentration calculated with eq 33 should have no numerical noise unlike solutions obtained by numerical simulation we used the isccfem adq inversion simulator see section 2 1 to obtain the diffusion coefficient from the distributions of concentrations calculated by eq 33 with c0 1 0 the diffusion coefficient obtained by the inversion simulation should thus be equal to the diffusion coefficient d used in eq 33 for calculating the distribution of the concentrations therefore the difference between the diffusion coefficient obtained by the inversion simulation and that used for calculating the distribution of concentrations is the error in the method we used to obtain the knudsen diffusion coefficient from the tracer experiment results the length of the one dimensional domain the range used to divide the molar fraction into blocks the cell size of the grid and the number of time steps used in the inversion simulation were the same as those in the tracer experiment the length of the simulation domain was equal to 90 cm the length of the column used in the tracer experiments the inversion simulation was conducted for each block and then the diffusion coefficient of each block was obtained from the concentrations calculated with eq 33 the observation points for the inversion simulations were arranged at x 10 20 and 25 cm and then at intervals of 2 5 cm for x 30 cm consistent with the locations of the gas sampling points in the tracer experiments the distribution of concentrations was calculated for three cases a velocity of 0 05 cm s a diffusion coefficient of 0 1 cm2 s and an elapsed time from the injection of 1200 s case 1 a velocity of 0 02 cm s a diffusion coefficient of 0 02 cm2 s and an elapsed time from the injection of 2000 s case 2 and a velocity of 0 005 cm s a diffusion coefficient 0 01 cm2 s and an elapsed time from the injection of 8000 s case 3 these conditions were chosen with reference to the results of the inversion simulations for the tracer experiments concentrations obtained by the numerical inversion simulation were then fitted to the concentrations calculated with eq 33 at the indicated observation points as a result the diffusion coefficients obtained by the inversion simulation differed from those used to compute eq 33 by 0 2 the f statistic value which is equal to the sum of the squares of the differences between the concentrations calculated by eq 33 and those obtained by the inversion simulation at the observation points ranged from 4 62 10 9 to 1 55 10 5 therefore the isccfem adq inversion simulator used in this study was able to accurately simulate the diffusion coefficient table 4 the slope of the regression line between the molar fraction of the tracer gas and the reciprocal of the compound dispersion coefficient is an important parameter in the procedure used in this study to obtain the knudsen diffusion coefficient in eq 33 the diffusion coefficient is constant independent of the molar fraction of the tracer gas in cases 1 and 2 the reciprocal of the diffusion coefficient was not correlated with the molar fraction of the gas but was constant everywhere and the slopes of the regression lines were 0 0168 and 0 338 s cm2 respectively fig 12 the slope of the regression line of case 3 for all data was 2 51 s cm2 however the slope of the regression line of case 3 for data of blocks 1 3 only 1 13 was much smaller than the absolute value of the slope for all case 3 data table 4 and fig 12 consequently these results confirmed that the error of the slope of the regression line between the molar fraction of the tracer gas and the reciprocal of the compound dispersion coefficient obtained by the method used in this study was small therefore the fact that the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 obtained by the tracer experiments was 1 27 that of air as reported by reinecke and sleep 2002 is not due to the error of the method used for obtaining the knudsen diffusion coefficient in this study which yields accurate results in our tracer experiments we used three columns two with a length of 900 mm and the third with a length of 1500 mm but because the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 did not depend on column length tables 1 and 3 and fig 11 this column property did not influence the flow of gas in the column it is well known that nitrogen gas is inert furthermore in our experiments the carbon dioxide gas was inert because the porous media did not include water therefore nitrogen and carbon dioxide might not be adsorbed on surfaces of soil particles and the acrylic resin of which the column was made we estimated the adsorption onto the surfaces of the soil particles and the acrylic resin by introducing a retardation factor r into eq 24 for movement of gas component a in the porous media when r is constant as follows 34 x a t v ga r x a d disp a r x a the effective compound diffusion coefficient with a retardation factor is derived by dividing the reciprocal of eq 22 by r as follows 35 d disp a r 1 d b d a x a r τ m d ab x b r τ m d ab r τ p d a r δ mech thus if the retardation factor influences d disp a r then r should exceed 1 0 however r should be 1 0 if it has no influence we calculated tortuosities for the molecular diffusion in the porous media as the ratio of the molecular diffusion coefficients obtained by the present tracer experiments to the nitrogen carbon dioxide molecular diffusion coefficient without the obstruction of the soil particles 0 149 cm2 s poling et al 2001 as a result the tortuosities for the molecular diffusion obtained from the present tracer experiments ranged from 0 040 to 0 653 except that when the porous medium was 0 2 mm glass beads and the pressure difference was 0 1 kpa the tortuosity was 1 16 the tortuosity of the 0 2 mm glass beads exceeded 1 0 when the pressure difference was 0 1 kpa because the slopes of the regression lines between the molar fraction and the reciprocal of effective compound dispersion for both tracer gases were small the reason for the small slopes was that the distribution of the molar fraction could not accurately be measured near the two ends of the column thus the tortuosity of the 0 2 mm glass beads should be 0 277 of the pressure difference 0 03 kpa millington and quirk 1961 currie 1970 and lai et al 1976 reported that tortuosity to be equal to n 4 3 n 3 2 or n 5 3 respectively where n is porosity the tortuosity obtained by using n 4 3 from the porosities shown in table 1 ranged from 0 243 to 0 450 the tortuosity n 3 2 ranged from 0 120 to 0 301 and the tortuosity n 5 3 ranged from 0 029 to 0 135 these values are similar to the tortuosities of the porous media except that for the field soil mixed with bentonite obtained by the present tracer experiments table 5 these results indicate that the molecular diffusion coefficient was not influenced by adsorption on the porous media except with the field soil mixed with bentonite medium similarly the knudsen diffusion coefficient might not be influenced by adsorption the tortuosity of the field soil mixed with bentonite obtained by the tracer experiments was slightly smaller than that calculated by n 5 3 0 135 which yielded the smallest values among the three tortuosity models however because the tortuosity of the field soil mixed with bentonite obtained by the present tarcer experiments was about 2 to 18 times the value of 1 27 of the tortuosity which calculated by three tortuosity models from the porosity of the field soil mixed with bentonite the knudsen diffusion coefficient of field soil mixed with bentonite might not be influenced by adsorption either thus adsorption cannot explain why the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 obtained by the tracer experiments was 1 27 that of air reported by reinecke and sleep 2002 4 3 correction factor for knudsen diffusion coefficients in porous media this study found that the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 obtained by the tracer experiments was 1 27 that of air as reported by reinecke and sleep 2002 and thereby confirmed the difference between the knudsen diffusion coefficient in a binary gas system and that in a single gas system reported by chen and rinker 1979 chen and rinker 1979 introduced a diffusion flow correction factor and a slip flow correction factor into the dgm equation to eliminate this discrepancy and then they fitted the dgm equation to gas transport regimes of real porous media with pores having a wide range of radii in the dgm as modified by chen and rinker 1979 the effective compound diffusion coefficient on the right side of eq 17 dgm equation was multiplied by the diffusion flow correction factor and the first term on the right side of the effective compound velocity equation eq 16 was multiplied by the slip flow correction factor chen and rinker 1979 explained that they introduced these correction factors because of the heterogeneity of the porous media based on the concept that the heterogeneity can be expressed by the ratio of the effective volume mean transport coefficient to the transport coefficient obtained from the effective volume radius mean radius and tortuosity the dgm equation was originally derived by assuming a homogeneous porous medium such as a cylindrical pore with a constant diameter and length and mason et al 1967 already incorporated obstruction factors of molecular diffusion and knudsen diffusion that take account of tortuosity in the dgm equation these obstruction factors depend only on the structure of the porous medium and also take account of the heterogeneity of the porous medium the results of both tracer experiments with a binary gas system and permeability experiments with a single gas system should reflect the heterogeneity and the tortuosity of the media however as noted above there is a discrepancy between the knudsen diffusion coefficient obtained in a single gas system compared with that obtained in a binary gas system the obstruction factor for knudsen diffusion in the diffusion term the first term on the right side of eq 15 might be similar to that in the advection term the second term on the right side of eq 15 as noted above the obstruction factor for the knudsen diffusion coefficient that was actually obtained in the binary gas system was smaller than that obtained in the single gas system these obstruction factors depend only on the structure of the porous medium and are independent of the gas system chen and rinker 1979 modified the advection diffusion formulation transformed from the dgm equation by multiplying the diffusion term and the advection term by different correction factors and these correction factors depended on the diffusion regime or the gas system these correction factors as defined by chen and rinker 1979 cannot exactly explain the discrepancy in the knudsen diffusion coefficient or in the obstruction factor as noted above because it is not obvious whether chen and rinker 1979 used a correction factor for the knudsen diffusion coefficient accordingly we introduced a correction factor for a multicomponent gas system s multi for the knudsen diffusion coefficient into the diffusion term of eq 15 to account for this discrepancy in knudsen diffusion or the obstruction factor as follows 36a d a 1 d b d a x a q m d ab x b q m d ab 1 s multi q p d a considering that q p d a k e b a μgmix where b a is the klinkenberg parameter of component a we rearranged eq 16 which was included in the advection term of eq 15 as follows 36b v ga d a p g s multi q p d b q m d ab k e μ g mix q p d a p p g the value of s multi is 1 27 based on the experimental results shown in fig 11 furthermore because the regression line for the relation between the knudsen diffusion coefficients of n2 and the effective permeability coefficients obtained by the present tracer experiments is parallel to that obtained by the permeability experiments of reinecke and sleep 2002 this correction factor might depend only on the structure of the gas system in the porous medium and it might be independent of the structure of the porous medium and the intrinsic permeability however these characteristics of s multi need to be confirmed by conducting more experiments there is no need to take account of any additional correction factor for molecular diffusion except the obstruction factor noted above because molecular diffusion is not treated in the permeability experiment with the single gas system and it should be only treated in the multicomponent gas system thus molecular diffusion considers only the obstruction factor that relates to tortuosity as in fick s law because the knudsen diffusion coefficient obtained by the permeability experiments is consistent with that in the third term on the right side of eq 36b the correction factor for a multicomponent gas system should not be considered in the advection term except in d a and s multi q p d b in the first term on the right side of eq 36b 5 conclusion in this study by conducting permeability experiments we obtained permeability coefficients ranging from 10 13 to 10 11 m2 for the five porous media used in the tracer experiments the relationship between the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 d n2 and the effective permeability coefficient k e obtained by the tracer experiments was d n2 7 39 107 k e 0 767 whereas reinecke and sleep 2002 obtained the relationship d air 4 03 109 k e 0 794 by means of permeability experiments thus the knudsen diffusion coefficients of n2 that we obtained by tracer experiments with five porous media in a co2 n2 binary gas system were consistently 1 27 of those obtained by permeability experiments for many porous media and air conducted by other researchers we confirmed the accuracy of the method that we used for obtaining the knudsen diffusion coefficient in the tracer experiments by mathematically solving the one dimensional advection diffusion equation derived by ogata and banks 1961 by using an inversion simulation to fit the advection diffusion equation to the distribution of concentrations at observation points calculated by solving the equation of ogata and banks 1961 we showed that the diffusion coefficient obtained by the inversion simulation used in this study included an error of no 0 2 relative to that used for calculating the concentrations thus the method we used to obtain the knudsen diffusion coefficient in this study was not inaccurate moreover we used columns of two different lengths 900 and 1500 mm in this study and we found that the knudsen diffusion coefficient was not dependent on the column used therefore this column property did not influence the flow of gas in the column this discrepancy between the knudsen diffusion coefficient obtained by the tracer experiments with a binary gas system and the permeability experiments with a single gas system should be taken account of in the dgm equation the dgm equation already includes obstruction factors for knudsen diffusion and molecular diffusion that relate to heterogeneity and tortuosity and depend only on the structure of the porous medium furthermore there is no need to add a correction factor for molecular diffusion in addition to the obstruction factor because the molecular diffusion is not treated in permeability experiments with a single gas system and it should be only treated is effective in a multicomponent gas system thus molecular diffusion considers only the obstruction factor that relates to tortuosity therefore we introduced a correction factor for a multicomponent gas system s multi into the diffusion term and the advection term of eq 15 to account for this discrepancy in the knudsen diffusion coefficient or in the obstruction factor and multiplied the knudsen diffusion coefficient with the obstruction factor related to the tortuosity by s multi in the present experimental results s multi was 1 27 furthermore because the regression line for the relation between the knudsen diffusion coefficients of n2 and the effective permeability coefficients obtained by the present tracer experiments was parallel to that obtained by the permeability experiments of reinecke and sleep 2002 this correction factor for a multicomponent gas system might depend only on the structure of the gas system in the porous medium and be independent of the structure of the porous medium however these characteristics of s multi need to be confirmed by conducting more experiments acknowledgments we thank yuuya morishita koichi matuda and ryo

1679,a previous study has reported that knudsen diffusion coefficients obtained by tracer experiments conducted with a binary gas system and a porous medium are consistently smaller than those obtained by permeability experiments conducted with a single gas system and a porous medium to date however that study is the only one in which tracer experiments have been conducted with a binary gas system therefore to confirm this difference in knudsen diffusion coefficients we used a method we had developed previously to conduct tracer experiments with a binary carbon dioxide nitrogen gas system and five porous media with permeability coefficients ranging from 10 13 to 10 11 m2 the results showed that the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 d n2 cm2 s was related to the effective permeability coefficient k e m2 as d n2 7 39 107 k e 0 767 thus the knudsen diffusion coefficients of n2 obtained by our tracer experiments were consistently 1 27 of those obtained by permeability experiments conducted with many porous media and air by other researchers by using an inversion simulation to fit the advection diffusion equation to the distribution of concentrations at observation points calculated by mathematically solving the equation we confirmed that the method used to obtain the knudsen diffusion coefficient in this study yielded accurate values moreover because the knudsen diffusion coefficient did not differ when columns with two different lengths 900 and 1500 mm were used this column property did not influence the flow of gas in the column the equation of the dusty gas model already includes obstruction factors for knudsen diffusion and molecular diffusion which relate to medium heterogeneity and tortuosity and depend only on the structure of the porous medium furthermore there is no need to take account of any additional correction factor for molecular diffusion except the obstruction factor because molecular diffusion is only treated in a multicomponent gas system thus molecular diffusion considers only the obstruction factor related to tortuosity therefore we introduced a correction factor for a multicomponent gas system into the dgm equation multiplying the knudsen diffusion coefficient which includes the obstruction factor related to tortuosity by this correction factor from the present experimental results the value of this correction factor was 1 27 and it depended only on the structure of the gas system in the porous medium keywords knudsen diffusion tracer experiment permeability experiment binary gas system dusty gas model 1 introduction mass transfer of chemical substances in the gas phase through soil is necessary to purify soil and groundwater contaminated with volatile organic chemicals or fuel oil e g amos et al 2005 bekins et al 2001 fitts 2002 molecular diffusion knudsen diffusion nonequimolar fluxes and viscous fluxes are dominantly responsible for the migration of chemical substances in a porous medium e g a soil or catalyst do 1998 fick s law has generally been used to mathematically describe the migration of a chemical substance in the gas phase through a porous medium because this equation is simpler and easier to deal with than those of other models however in actual soils multicomponent gas systems are typical and in contaminated soils the gas system often includes several toxic chemical substances fick s law can deal only with molecular diffusion in a binary gas system and it cannot take account of other diffusion or flux mechanisms in contrast the stefan maxwell equation can be applied to a multicomponent gas system that lacks walls and solid particles and can deal with a nonequimolar flux that is a binary gas system in which the flux of chemical component a to that of chemical component b is not equal to the inverse flux of chemical component b to that of chemical component a because the molecular weights of components a and b differ mason et al 1967 developed the dusty gas model dgm on the basis of chapman enskog gas theory to take account of the effect of walls and solid particles the dgm is a comprehensive gas transport model that takes account of molecular diffusion knudsen diffusion and nonequimolar fluxes in a multicomponent gas system with solid particles cunningham and williams 1980 mason and malinauskas 1983 further the dgm can account for the relation between knudsen diffusion which occurs by collisions of molecules with the surfaces of solid particles and the slip effect that is a non zero gas velocity at the surfaces of solid particles klinkenberg 1941 found that the measured apparent permeability of a medium is larger to a gas than to a liquid this phenomenon is called the klinkenberg effect and occurs because gas flow in a porous medium is not zero at the surfaces of the particles composing the porous medium whereas the velocity of a liquid is zero at the surfaces of particles because of the viscosity of the liquid gas molecules occupying the voids of a porous medium collide with each other and with the particles of the medium moreover they are more likely to collide with the particles of the porous medium when the average pore radius of the medium is smaller because the total volume of the voids in the porous medium is thereby reduced as a result the velocity is not zero at the surfaces of the particles of the medium and a slip flux or effect as noted above occurs thus both knudsen diffusion and the slip effect occur because the gas molecules collide with the surfaces of solid particles and knudsen diffusion is related to the slip effect by the klinkenberg parameter effective permeability and gas pressure although the dgm takes account of several of the main mechanisms governing the transfer of chemical substances in a porous medium the dgm equations are very complex therefore they have not yet been used in numerical simulations of the mass transfer of chemical substances in a multicomponent gas system with a porous medium abriola et al 1992 and webb and pruess 2003 however have developed a numerical simulation method based on the dgm for a binary gas system in porous media furthermore sleep 1998 hibi 2008 and hibi et al 2009 developed numerical simulation models based on the dgm to predict the movements of chemical substances in a multicomponent gas system in a porous medium hibi 2008 and hibi et al 2009 took account of knudsen diffusion while simulating the migration of oxygen nitrogen and methane in a three component gas system in sandy soil and the concentrations of each component predicted by their numerical simulation were consistent with those obtained by column experiments therefore they confirmed that the dgm can be applied to a multicomponent gas system in a porous medium characterized by knudsen diffusion and nonequimolar fluxes massmann and farrier 1992 and thorstenson and pollock 1989 pointed out that the flux predicted by advection diffusion in accordance with fick s law is different from that predicted by multicomponent dgm equations when the intrinsic permeability of the porous medium is 1 0 10 14 m2 further abriola et al 1992 confirmed that there was a difference between the distribution of the molar fraction of the gas system components obtained by fick s law and that obtained by the dgm even when the intrinsic permeability was 1 0 10 10 m2 and the difference was larger when the intrinsic permeability was 1 0 10 16 m2 therefore the influence of knudsen diffusion on the mass transport of chemical components in a gas system in a porous medium increases as the intrinsic permeability decreases thus knudsen diffusion should be taken into account in the mass transfer of a chemical substance in a gas system in a porous medium with an intrinsic permeability of 1 0 10 10 m2 therefore it is important to investigate the distinctive characteristics of knudsen diffusion coefficients for both molecular diffusion and knudsen diffusion are included in the dgm and in practical applications of the model they are multiplied by tortuosity tortuosity a factor that has been proposed to account for the obstruction of the migration diffusion of molecules by the particles of a porous medium has been extensively used in modeling the diffusion of a chemical substance in either the aqueous phase or gas phase through a porous medium knudsen diffusion occurs when the molecules collide with the surfaces of the particles that compose the porous medium and those collisions may influence the diffusion of gas phase chemical components in a porous medium to date only a few studies have empirically determined the knudsen diffusion coefficient by conducting tracer experiments with a binary gas system abed and rinker 1974 chen and rinker 1979 and abu el sha r and abriola 1997 conducted permeability experiments with a single gas system in a porous medium and tracer experiments in several porous media and reported that the knudsen diffusion coefficients obtained from the tracer experiments binary gas system were smaller than those obtained from the permeability experiments single gas system chen and rinker 1979 showed that the knudsen diffusion coefficient obtained by a tracer experiment is consistent with that obtained by a permeability experiment when the volumetric average of the knudsen diffusion coefficient for different pore radiuses in the porous medium and a tortuosity factor for pores of a given radius are incorporated into the original dgm they considered these additions to be reasonable because the original dgm was derived by assuming an ideal parallel pore arrangement and a uniform pore size this modified dgm is generally used to simulate the movement of chemical substances in porous media with binary gas or multi gas systems hibi 2008 hibi et al 2009 in fact a single gas system can surround a binary gas system such that the gas system changes continuously from a single gas to a binary gas system at the boundary between the two systems if tortuosity is constant and independent of the number of chemical components in the gas system the difference in knudsen diffusion coefficients between single and binary gas systems reported by abed and rinker 1974 abu el sha r and abriola 1997 and chen and rinker 1979 implies that the knudsen diffusion coefficient must change suddenly at this boundary however a sudden change in the knudsen diffusion coefficient at the boundary between a single and a binary gas system cannot occur in an actual gas system thus it is necessary to confirm and explain the cause of this difference between a knudsen diffusion coefficient obtained by tracer experiments with a binary gas system and that obtained by permeability experiments with a single gas system to our knowledge no tracer experiments have been reported since the studies of chen and rinker 1979 and of abu el sha r and abriola 1997 however hibi and taguchi 2011 and hibi et al 2012 developed an original procedure for a tracer experiment that can be used to obtain the molecular diffusion coefficient with tortuosity the knudsen diffusion coefficient and the mechanical dispersion coefficient dispersivity the aim of the present study is to use their procedure to experimentally confirm the difference between the knudsen diffusion coefficient obtained by permeability experiments and that obtained by tracer experiments we therefore conducted permeability experiments with nitrogen to obtain the permeability coefficients of five porous media and tracer experiments with a binary carbon dioxide nitrogen gas system and five porous media to obtain the knudsen diffusion coefficient of nitrogen we employed the method developed by hibi and taguchi 2011 and hibi et al 2012 for obtaining the knudsen diffusion coefficient from the distribution of concentrations measured by tracer experiments then we compared knudsen diffusion coefficients measured by permeability experiments conducted by other researchers with those obtained from the results of the tracer experiments conducted in this study 2 theory and method for calculating the knudsen diffusion coefficient 2 1 permeability experiment darcy s law can be applied to gas flow in a porous medium when gravity is neglected the darcy equation can be expressed as follows 1 q k a μ g dp g dx where q is the gas flux l t k a is the apparent permeability coefficient l2 p g is the total gas pressure m lt2 and μ g is the viscosity m lt slip flux that is the non zero velocity at the surfaces of particles occurs in the porous medium klinkenberg 1941 derived the following equation to take account of the slip flux and relate the effective permeability coefficient k e l2 to the apparent permeability coefficient 2 k a k e bk e p where b is the klinkenberg parameter m lt2 and p is the average gas pressure m lt2 the klinkenberg parameter b can be expressed as follows 3 b cκt 2 0 5 πr 3 where r is the average pore radius l κ is the boltzmann constant l2m t2k c is a proportionality factor k l3 and t is absolute temperature k therefore the klinkenberg effect dominates the gas flow in a porous medium with a small average pore radius when the average pressure is low and the temperature is high the mass conservation equation for the steady flow of a gas in a porous medium in a one dimensional coordinate system can be expressed as follows 4 d ρ g q d x 0 where ρ g is the density of the gas m l3 and x is the distance from the injection point of the gas if atmospheric pressure and atmospheric density are p atm and ρ atm respectively and gas pressure is p g the density of gas ρ g can be expressed as follows 5 ρ g p g ρ atm p atm eq 5 is applicable to a compressible fluid in a porous medium the governing equation for the movement of a compressible gas in a porous medium can be obtained by substituting eqs 1 and 5 into eq 4 6 d p g ρ atm p atm k a μ g dp g d x dx 0 furthermore when ρ atm p atm k a and μ g are constant the following simple equation for gas flow in a porous medium can be derived 7 d p g p g x dx 0 by integrating both sides of eq 7 the following equation is derived in which c is the integration constant that satisfies the boundary condition 8 p g p g x c if the measured gas flux is q and the measured gas pressure is p 2 at the discharge point of gas x 2 dp g dx c p 2 is derived by dividing eq 8 by p 2 and dp g dx qμ g k a is derived by dividing eq 1 by k a μ g at x 2 the integration constant c is determined by the equation c qμ g p 2 k a therefore the differential equation p g p g x qμ g p 2 k a is obtained by substituting c qμ g p 2 k a in eq 8 the left side of this differential equation is integrated from the gas pressure at the injection point p 1 to that at the discharge point p 2 and the right side is integrated from the coordinate of injection point x 1 to that of discharge point x 2 as follows 9 p 1 p 2 p g d p g qμgp 2 ka x 1 x 2 dx in the case of a compressible fluid in a porous medium the apparent permeability coefficient k a l2 in the porous medium can be obtained from eq 10 which is derived from eq 9 as follows 10 k a q p 1 2 p 2 2 2 lμ g p 2 where l is the distance between the discharge point x 2 and the injection point x 1 l furthermore it is clear from eq 2 that a plot of k a against 1 p should yield a straight line with slope bk e and intercept k e 2 2 tracer experiment the dgm which was developed by mason et al 1967 can take account of the molecular diffusion flux the knudsen diffusion flux and nonequimolar fluxes and it can solve the migration of chemical substances in a porous medium with a multicomponent gas system the stefan maxwell equation can also deal with a multicomponent gas system in porous media without particles i e no solids obstruct the migration of chemical substances as in an atmospheric system the dgm equation can be derived from the stefan maxwell equation if one component of the multicomponent gas system is assumed to consist of large solid particles that do not move and collide with other components the stefan maxwell equation includes only molecular diffusion and nonequimolar fluxes but to derive the dgm the knudsen diffusion flux is added to the stefan maxwell equation by making the above assumption when knudsen diffusion occurs in a porous medium the gas velocity is not zero at the surfaces of the particles composing the porous medium and the gas molecules collide with the particles of the porous medium if a gas flowing horizontally in a column filled with dry soil and a background gas is assumed then the effect of gravity can be omitted from the equations for the migration of a gas in the gas phase of a soil gas system in a binary gas system the dgm system equations are as follows when gravity is neglected 11a x a n d b x b n d a q m d ab n d a q p d a p a rt 11b x b n d a x a n d b q m d ab n d b q p d b p b rt where x a and x b are molar fractions dimensionless n d a and n d b are molar fluxes mol l2t and p a and p b are the partial pressures m lt2 of components a and b respectively r is the gas constant ml2 molkt2 t is absolute temperature k d ab is the molecular diffusion coefficient between components a and b l2 t d a and d b are the knudsen diffusion coefficients l2 t of components a and b respectively and q m and q p are the obstruction factors of molecular diffusion and knudsen diffusion respectively abriola et al 1992 mason and malinauskas 1983 webb and pruess 2003 q m and q p are calculated from the tortuosity for molecular diffusion τ m and the tortuosity for knudsen diffusion τ p respectively and the gas filled porosity θ g 12a q m τ m θ g 12b q p τ p θ g where the tortuosity for molecular diffusion is the ratio of the molecular diffusion coefficient of the porous medium to that in the absence of any obstruction by solid particles and the tortusity for knudsen diffusion is the ratio of knudsen diffusion coefficient in the modified dgm for a real porous medium to knudsen diffusion coefficient in the original dgm developed for an ideal parallel pore arrangement and a uniform pore size by mason et al 1967 furthermore for chemical component i the knudsen diffusion coefficient is related to the klinkenberg parameter as d i k e b i μg where b i is the klinkenberg parameter of component i thorstenson and pollock 1989 the molar concentrations of components a and b c a and c b respectively mol l3 are derived from the equation of state for an ideal gas c a p a rt and c b p b rt respectively n d a d a n d b d b q p p g rt is obtained by summing the two sides of eqs 11a and 11b therefore by rearranging eqs 11a and 11b n d a and n d b become 13a n d a d a c a d a p g q p d b q m d ab p g c a 13b n d b d b c b d b p g q p d a q m d ab p g c b where the compound diffusion coefficients d a and d b are defined as in eqs 14a and 14b l2 t 14a d a 1 d b d a x a q m d ab x b q m d ab 1 q p d a 14b d b 1 d a d b x b q m d ab x a q m d ab 1 q p d a the total flux of component a n t a is calculated from its diffusion flux n d a eq 11a and advection flux c a k a p g μgmix as follows 15 n t a d a c a v ga c a where μ gmix is the viscosity of the gas mixture consisting of components b and a m lt and v ga compound velocity l t is defined as in eq 16 16 v ga d a p g q p d b q m d ab k a μ gmix p g the advection diffusion equation of the dgm for component a is derived from eq 16 and the mass conservation equation as follows 17 c a t v ga c a d a c a where d a d a θ and v ga v ga θ are the effective compound diffusion coefficient and the effective compound velocity respectively the reciprocal of eq 14a is equal to eq 18 below in which α d b d a is the ratio of the knudsen diffusion coefficients of components a and b 18 1 d a α 1 x a τ m d ab 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d a likewise for component b eq 19 is the reciprocal of eq 14b 19 1 d b 1 α 1 x b τ m d ab 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d b if it is assumed that dispersion in the gas phase of a soil is mechanical dispersion d mech then the dispersion coefficient d disp a in this gas system is expressed by eq 20 under the assumption of sleep 1998 that such dispersion is similar to that of chemical components dissolved in groundwater bear 1972 20 d disp a 1 d b d a x a τ m d ab x b τ m d a b 1 τ p d a d mech by substituting x b 1 x a and α d b d a into eq 20 the reciprocal of eq 20 becomes 21 1 d disp a α 1 x a τ m d ab 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d a 1 d mech α 1 x a τ m d ab 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d a it is clear from eq 21 that if x a is not proportional to 1 d disp a then eq 21 cannot be used to obtain τ m d ab τ p d a and τ p d b if x a is considered proportional to 1 d disp a and the slope of the regression line between x a and 1 d disp a is constant independent of any difference in gas pressure as was shown by the experiments of hibi and taguchi 2011 then the dispersion coefficient d disp a is related only to the intercept of the regression line to satisfy these conditions the relation between x a and 1 d disp a must be 22 1 d disp a α 1 x a τ m d ab 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d a δ mech similarly the relation between x b and the reciprocal of the dispersion coefficient of component b 1 d disp b is 23 1 d disp b 1 α 1 x b τ m d ab 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d b δ mech where δmech is a parameter that we call the difference coefficient with mechanical dispersion the value of which depends on the properties of the porous medium if considering eq 22 and c a c x a where c is the total molar concentration mol l3 and is constant the effective compound diffusion d a in eq 17 is replaced with d disp a then eq 17 expresses the advection dispersion relation with mechanical dispersion as follows 24 x a t v ga x a d disp a x a eq 24 can be applied to the case that the porosity in a porous medium is first filled with component b background gas and then component b is replaced with component a tracer gas d disp a and v ga are obtained by using the isccfem adq inversion simulator which was developed by hibi and colleagues hibi 2008 hibi and taguchi 2011 hibi et al 2012 to fit the advection dispersion equation to the molar fraction distribution of the tracer gas this inversion simulator employs a conjugate direction method powell 1964 for the fitting and a characteristic finite element scheme fujinawa 1986 for the discretization of the simulation region the one dimensional domain for the inversion simulation has a length of 90 or 150 cm according to the length of the column used and is divided into four blocks block 1 molar fraction 0 0 25 block 2 molar fraction 0 25 0 50 block 3 molar fraction 0 50 0 75 and block 4 molar fraction 0 75 1 0 if the grid is composed of cells each with a length of 5 mm then the finite element grid consists of 181 nodes and 180 elements when the length of the domain is 90 cm and it consists of 301 nodes and 300 elements when the length of the domain is 150 cm the inversion simulation is conducted for each block and then the effective compound dispersion coefficient and the effective compound velocity in that block are obtained from the concentrations within the molar fraction range of the block e g the molar fraction range of block 1 is 0 0 to 0 25 the number of time steps is 70 from the initial distribution of the observed distribution of concentrations d disp b and v gb effective compound velocity of component b can be similarly obtained by using the isccfem adq inversion simulator with the advection diffusion equation for component b when the background gas is component a and the tracer gas is component b if x a and x b are proportional to 1 d disp a and 1 d disp b respectively then the slope of the proportional relationship between x a and 1 d disp a is m a and that between x b and 1 d disp b is m b thus m a α 1 τ m d ab and m b 1 α α τ m d ab and τ m d ab can be obtained from the slopes of these respective relations as follows 25 τ m d ab m a m b m a m b and α can be calculated from m a and τ m d ab as follows 26 α m a τ m d ab 1 the intercepts of the regression lines between x a and 1 d disp a and between x b and 1 d disp b are defined as y a 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d a δmech and y b 1 τ m d ab 1 τ p d b δmech respectively thus τ p d a can be calculated as follows 27 τ p d a α 1 α y a y b and τ p d b can be calculated from τ p d a and α 28 τ p d b ατ p d a eq 16 for the compound velocity of component a can be transformed to the following eq 29 by considering the one dimensional gas flow and the compound velocity of component a v ga 29 v ga μ gmix p g τ p d b τ m d ab p g μ gmix d a k a d disp a is similar to d a when δmech which is related to the dispersion coefficient is small and d a θd disp a by considering d a θd a then v ga and d a are calculated by using v ga θv ga and d a θd disp a and a plot of v ga μ gmix p g against μ gmix d a should yield a straight line with slope τ p d b τ m d ab p g and intercept k a if p g is constant because τ p d b τ m d ab is constant independent of the molar fraction of the tracer gas provided that neither the tracer gas nor the background gas is replaced with a different gas 3 methodology of the tracer and permeability experiments as porous media we used 0 4 and 0 2 mm glass beads each with a particle density of 2 5 g cm3 and a field soil collected at inazawa city japan with a particle density of 2 61 g cm3 we mixed bentonite with a particle density of 2 6 g cm3 into field soil at a mass ratio of field soil to bentonite of 3 1 and used this mixture of the field soil and the bentonite further toyoura sand which was collected in yamaguchi prefecture japan with a particle density of 2 65 g cm3 and controlled for particle size was mixed with the bentonite at a mass ratio of the toyoura sand to the bentonite of 3 1 and was also used in the present experiments we then conducted the tracer and permeability experiments indicated in table 1 the field soil and toyoura sand were oven dried before the experiments the porosities of all porous media ranged from 0 346 to 0 549 with those of the two media containing field soil being highest the particle size distributions of the 0 4 and 0 2 mm glass beads were narrow but the field soil had a broad particle size distribution range moreover the particle size distribution of the field soil bentonite mixture was wider than that of the field soil alone in addition the particle size distribution of the toyoura sand bentonite mixture differed from those of the other porous media because it could be divided into particles greater than and those 0 1 mm in size fig 1 two columns made of acrylic resin were used in each tracer and permeability experiment one of the columns had an outer diameter of 7 cm an inner diameter of 5 cm and a length of 150 cm fig 2 this column was equipped with seven electrical pressure gauges tokyo sokki kenkyujo co ltd pw 100 kpa range 0 100 kpa accuracy 0 005 kpa and 43 gas sample ports each of which consisted of a connector koyo co ltd rgb 05818 and a septum hamilton 9 mm dia 12 pk fig 2 the other column was 90 cm long with the same outer and inner diameters it was equipped with five electrical pressure gauges which were installed at intervals of 20 cm between 5 and 85 cm from one end of the column and 17 gas sample ports installed at intervals of 5 cm from one end of the column for each column the pressure gauges were connected to a data logger tokyo sokki kenkyujo co ltd tds 303 and the gas pressure in the column was measured automatically the gases were injected via pressure regulators fairchild model 10 range 0 15 kpa into the column from gas tanks fig 2 right side the gases flowed through the column from the right side to the left side in fig 2 and were released to the atmosphere fig 2 left side after first passing through a flow meter horiba stc co ltd sec n100 maximum discharge 300 cm3 min accuracy 0 1 cm3 min and a backpressure regulator fairchild model 10bp maximum pressure 15 kpa both the tracer and permeability experiments were conducted at a temperature of 20 c and a humidity of 50 each column was filled by placing it vertically with cover plates and flow meter removed on the laboratory floor the mass of the porous medium to be packed into the column was calculated from the volume of the column and the particle density of the porous medium so that the porosity would equal a predetermined value this mass was divided into aliquots such that each would have a thickness of 5 cm in the column then one aliquot of dry porous medium was dropped into the column and compacted by vibrating the column until the porous medium thickness in the column was 5 cm this dropping and compacting procedure was repeated with each aliquot until the porous medium was packed between the stainless steel screens at either end of the column finally the column was tightly closed with the cover plates and placed horizontally on a table 3 1 permeability experiments gas permeability tests were conducted after nitrogen gas with 99 9 purity was confirmed to have filled the void volume in the porous medium by analyzing gases sampled from the column with gas chromatography gl sciences inc gc 3200 with a thermal conductivity detector carrier gas helium oven temperature 50 c temperature in the injector 50 c temperature in the detector 70 c gas pressures at the inlet and outlet were adjusted to predetermined values by means of a gas pressure regulator installed at the inlet fig 2 right side and a gas backpressure regulator installed at the outlet fig 2 left side thus gas flowed from the right side of the column as depicted in fig 2 to the left side to obtain the effective permeability coefficients 10 to 21 gas pressure differences were imposed in the porous medium gas pressure barometric pressure and the discharge of gas from the column q l3 t were measured by the electrical pressure gauges a barometer isuzu seisakusho co ltd aneroid barometer b 180 no range 930 1070 hpa accuracy 1 hpa and the flow meter respectively until the gas pressures and the gas discharge had been constant for 5 min the steady flux of gas q was calculated by dividing the gas discharge q when q had been constant for 5 min by the cross sectional area of the column first p 1 2 p 2 2 2lμg p 2 was calculated from the gas pressures at the inlet and outlet p 1 and p 2 respectively once they had been constant for 5 min the length of the porous medium sample l and the viscosity of gas μ g then q was plotted against p 1 2 p 2 2 2lμ g p 2 and a straight regression line was fitted to these data by the method of least squares the slope of this regression line is equal to the apparent permeability k a next the average gas pressure p p 1 p 2 2 was calculated k a was plotted against 1 p and a regression line was fitted to these data by the method of least squares the slope and the intercept of the regression line thus obtained are bk e and the effective permeability k e respectively 3 2 tracer experiments in each experiment the background gas nitrogen with 99 9 purity or carbon dioxide gas with 99 999 purity was injected first via a three way valve installed after the pressure regulators fig 2 right side then the specific gas pressures at the column inlet and outlet were regulated by the pressure regulator and the backpressure regulator to create the desired pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet the gas in the column was sampled with a syringe sge analytical science maximum volume 1 0 ml minimum volume 0 02 ml and analyzed by gas chromatography to confirm that the background gas filled the column after the column was confirmed to be filled with the background gas the tracer gas nitrogen with 99 9 purity or carbon dioxide gas with 99 999 purity was injected into the column via the three way valve for each porous medium two to five tracer experiments were conducted with each tracer gas for each of two to five gas pressure differences in each experiment syringes were used to withdraw 0 15 ml samples of gas via the gas sample ports at a specific time for each specific pressure difference the samples were analyzed immediately by gas chromatography to determine the molar fractions of the background and tracer gases at the time of sampling the gas sampling did not affect the flow of the tracer gas in the column because only 0 15 ml of gas was sampled from each gas sample port immediately before the end of each experiment after the experiments were conducted with the first tracer gas the tracer gas and the background gas were exchanged and the tracer experiments were conducted again as described above d disp co2 and v gco2 of the tracer gas co2 were obtained by fitting the advection diffusion equation to the distribution of the molar fraction of the tracer gas co2 by means of the isccfem adq inversion simulator 1 d disp co2 was plotted against the molar fraction of the tracer gas co2 and a regression line was fitted to the relation between the molar fraction of the tracer gas co2 and 1 d disp co2 by the method of least squares then the slope and the intercept of this regression line were obtained as m co2 m a in eq 25 and y co2 y a in eq 27 similarly d disp n2 and v gn2 of the tracer gas n2 were obtained by using the isccfem adq inversion simulator to fit the advection diffusion equation to the distribution of the molar fraction of the tracer gas n2 and the slope and the intercept of the regression line of the relation between the molar fraction of the tracer gas n2 and 1 d disp n2 were obtained as m n2 m b in eq 25 and y n2 y b in eq 27 respectively then eq 25 was used to calculate τ m d co2 n2 from m co2 and m n2 and eq 26 was used to calculate α which is equal to the ratio of the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 to that of co2 from m co2 and τ m d co2 n2 finally eq 27 was used to calculate the knudsen diffusion coefficient of co2 τ p d co2 from y co2 y n2 and α and the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 τ p d n2 was calculated by multiplying τ p d co2 by α because the distribution of the molar fraction of the tracer gas n2 was wide in the two porous media with low permeability toyoura sand mixed with bentonite and the field soil mixed with bentonite the longer column 1500 mm was used for the tracer experiments with these porous media furthermore the use of columns of two different lengths allowed the influence of column length on the flow of gas in a column to be investigated 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparisons of gas permeability between the permeability and tracer experiments as indicated in section 2 2 the apparent gas permeability can be obtained from the relationship between μgmixd and v μ gmix p values obtained by the tracer experiments we thus plotted v μ gmix p against μ gmix d values obtained from the tracer experiments and fitted straight lines to the data by the method of least squares in the tracer experiment results μ gmix d was directly proportional to v μgmix p and the coefficient of determination r 2 between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p ranged from 0 53 to 0 66 except in the experiments with the toyoura sand bentonite mixture fig 3 thus the tracer experiment results showed a correlation between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p in 0 4 mm glass beads 0 2 mm glass beads and field soil in contrast r 2 for this relationship with the toyoura sand bentonite mixture was only 0 33 μ gmix d values obtained by the tracer experiments with the toyoura sand bentonite mixture were therefore not strongly correlated with the v μ gmix p values in the experiments with 0 2 mm glass beads fig 3b but not in those with the other porous media fig 3a c and d the relation between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p was dependent on the pressure difference eq 29 implies that the relation between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p is dependent on the gas pressure however the apparent permeability k a depends on the average gas pressure as shown in eq 2 the r 2 value of 0 33 for the relationship between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p with the toyoura sand bentonite mixture was obtained by using the results of all of the tracer experiments with that medium which were conducted using two gas pressure differences 3 kpa and 5 kpa table 1 in contrast the r 2 value for the relationship between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p based on the results of only those experiments conducted with a pressure difference of 5 0 kpa was larger at 0 587 fig 4 thus the data with the wide scatter in fig 3d were obtained when the pressure difference was 3 kpa the apparent permeability i e the intercept of the regression line between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p was 1 44 10 12 m2 when all data were plotted and 1 431 10 12 m2 when only data for the pressure difference of 5 kpa were plotted thus the apparent permeability was similar regardless of whether the data obtained with a pressure difference of 3 kpa were included when the tracer gas was co2 and the porous medium was the field soil bentonite mixture fig 5a r 2 for the relationship between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p was 0 65 and μ gmix d was directly proportional to v μ gmix p in contrast with this medium when the tracer gas was n2 and the pressure difference was 1 0 kpa or 1 5 kpa r 2 for the relationship between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p was very low at 0 0502 fig 5b when we plotted only the data for the pressure difference of 1 5 kpa fig 6 however the resulting r 2 value was 0 915 thus the more scattered data fig 5b were those obtained when the pressure difference was 1 0 kpa therefore μ gmix d was strongly correlated with v μ gmix p only when the pressure difference was 1 5 kpa when the tracer gas and the pressure difference were n2 and 1 5 kpa respectively the apparent permeability of the field soil bentonite mixture was 4 97 10 13 m2 fig 6 the intercept of the regression line for the relationship between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p was slightly different between the experiment with co2 as the tracer gas 6 75 10 13 cm2 and that with n2 as the tracer gas 4 97 10 13 cm2 fig 5a and 6 when the porous medium was field soil or the toyoura sand bentonite mixture which had low permeability coefficients and the pressure difference was small the relation between μ gmix d and v μ gmix p could not be accurately determined by the tracer experiments with n2 as the tracer gas the reason might be that the gas did not flow uniformly across the section of the column because of its very slow velocity when the pressure difference was small eq 2 implies that the apparent permeability coefficient k a is directly proportional to the reciprocal of the average gas pressure and indeed in the permeability experiment results the apparent permeability coefficient k a was directly proportional to 1 p the coefficients of determination of the regression of k a against 1 p were in the range 0 241 0 569 for all porous media except that for the field soil bentonite mixture which was very low at 0 046 fig 7 for all porous media the dispersion of the apparent permeability coefficients was narrow the effective permeability coefficient is equal to the intercept of the regression line of k a against 1 p we conducted the permeability experiments using an average gas pressure range from 104 kpa to 111 kpa values close to atmospheric pressure in this average gas pressure range the second term on the right side of eq 2 bk e p which expresses the slip effect greatly influences the apparent permeability furthermore the average gas pressure employed in the permeability experiments to obtain the effective permeability was low and the range of the average gas pressure was narrow as a result the coefficient of determination of the regression of k a against 1 p was not very high to address this problem some permeability experiments should be conducted with higher gas pressures than were used in the present series of permeability experiments the effective or apparent permeability values shown in table 2 were obtained from intercepts of the regression lines shown in figs 3 to 7 the apparent permeabilities obtained by the tracer experiments k a were about 2 to 6 times the effective permeabilities obtained by the permeability experiments k e fig 8 therefore it is plausible that the actual permeability might be larger than those obtained by the permeability experiments in this study but it is unlikely that it would be smaller the porous media used in this study had permeabilities that ranged from 10 13 to 10 11 m2 in a porous medium knudsen diffusion mainly dominates when the permeability is 1 0 10 14 m2 massmann and farrier 1992 because such a regime is characterized by free molecular flow in which molecule wall interactions are more frequent than molecule molecule interactions thus in a flow system with permeability between 10 13 and 10 11 m2 the flow should be transitional between a free molecular flow regime with frequent molecule wall interactions and a viscous flow regime in which molecule molecule interactions are more frequent than molecule wall interactions such a transitional regime should show the effects of both molecule wall and molecule molecule interactions zhang et al 2015 4 2 knudsen diffusion coefficients of the porous media to obtain the molecular diffusion coefficient between carbon dioxide and nitrogen τd co2 n2 and the knudsen diffusion coefficients for carbon dioxide d co2 and nitrogen d n2 we plotted the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion coefficient obtained from the tracer experiments against the molar fraction of the tracer gas figs 9 and 10 and fitted straight lines to the data by the method of least squares the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion coefficient was directly proportional to the molar fraction of the tracer gas and it increased as the molar fraction of co2 increased in contrast the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion decreased as the molar fraction of n2 increased for all porous media except field soil the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion coefficient was correlated with the molar fraction of co2 r 2 range 0 53 0 90 fig 9 and the standard deviation of the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion coefficients of the porous media ranged from 0 50 to 4 99 s cm2 table 3 when the tracer gas was n2 r 2 values of this relation ranged from 0 45 to 0 97 fig 9 and they were lower range 0 45 0 52 for 0 2 mm glass beads than for the other porous media the absolute values of the correlation coefficients for the 0 2 mm glass beads calculated by taking the square root of the coefficients of determination ranged from 0 67 to 0 72 therefore the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion coefficient for 0 2 mm glass beads was also correlated with the molar fraction of n2 similarly the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion for field soil increased as the molar fraction of the tracer gas co2 increased but decreased as the molar fraction of the tracer gas n2 increased fig 10 though the coefficients of determination between the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion and the molar fraction of the tracer gas co2 ranged from 0 49 to 0 51 and were lower than those for the tracer gas n2 range 0 51 0 79 the absolute values of the correlation coefficients calculated from the coefficients of determination for the tracer gas co2 ranged from 0 69 to 0 72 moreover the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion for field soil with the tracer gas n2 was also correlated with the molar fraction of n2 r 2 0 51 fig 10 the standard deviation of the effective compound dispersion of field soil ranged from 3 46 to 4 18 s cm2 for the tracer gas co2 and from 0 82 to 2 54 s cm2 for the tracer gas n2 the slopes of the regression lines between the reciprocal of the effective compound dispersion of field soil and the molar fraction of the tracer gas ranged from 10 644 to 12 715 s cm2 for the tracer gas co2 and from 5 381 to 8 203 s cm2 for the tracer gas n2 fig 10 in the case of field soil the slopes did not vary with the pressure difference fig 10 for all other porous media except 0 2 mm glass beads the slopes of the regression lines differed by 9 to 34 relative to the maximum absolute slope of the porous medium however for 0 2 mm glass beads the slopes of the regression lines for each tracer gas when the pressure difference was 0 03 kpa were about three times those when the pressure difference was 0 1 kpa fig 9c d knudsen diffusion coefficients of co2 obtained by the tracer experiments with 0 4 mm glass beads were 0 162 to 0 223 cm2 s and those obtained with 0 2 mm glass beads were 0 122 to 0 408 cm2 s these values are greater than those obtained with the other porous media in contrast the knudsen diffusion coefficients of co2 obtained with the toyoura sand bentonite mixture were 0 00709 to 0 0107 cm2 s and those obtained with the field soil bentonite mixture were 0 00767 to 0 0192 cm2 s these values are smaller than those for the other porous media table 3 the tendencies of the knudsen diffusion coefficients were similar between n2 and co2 in this study those for the tracer gas co2 ranged from 0 00709 to 0 408 cm2 s and those for the tracer gas n2 ranged from 0 00844 to 0 707 cm2 s in these flow systems with effective permeabilities between 3 48 10 13 and 1 81 10 11 m2 table 2 the flow regime is expected to be transitional between one with frequent molecule wall interactions and a viscous flow regime in which molecule molecule interactions are more frequent the value of α obtained by the tracer experiments where α d n2 d co2 ranged from 1 10 to 1 73 for all porous media except 1 the 0 2 mm glass beads when the pressure difference was 0 1 kpa 2 the toyoura sand bentonite mixture when the pressure difference was 1 5 kpa and 3 the field soil when the pressure difference was 3 0 or 4 5 kpa in these three cases α ranged from 1 96 to 2 52 do 1998 derived the following equation for α in a single gas system with a porous medium 30 α m co2 m n2 1 2 where m co2 and m n2 are the molecular weights of carbon dioxide and nitrogen respectively if eq 30 and the molecular weights of carbon dioxide 44 0 g mol and nitrogen 28 0 g mol are used to calculate α then its value should be 1 25 in a single gas system though most values of α obtained in this study were 1 25 the value of α for the field soil bentonite mixture never exceeded 1 25 reinecke and sleep 2002 reported the following relationship between the knudsen diffusion coefficient and the effective permeability coefficient on the basis of permeability experiments conducted with several porous media 31 d air 4 03 10 9 ke 0 794 where d air is the knudsen diffusion coefficient of air cm2 s fig 11 the regression expressions for the relation between the knudsen diffusion coefficients of the tracer gas n2 and the tracer gas co2 and the effective permeability coefficients obtained from the results of the tracer experiments and the permeability experiments in this study are as follows fig 11 32a d n2 7 39 10 7 k e 0 767 32b d co2 4 60 10 7 k e 0 768 the coefficients of determination of these regression expressions for n2 and co2 are 0 70 and 0 73 respectively thus in our data the effective permeability coefficient was strongly correlated with the knudsen diffusion coefficient of co2 or n2 because the value of the exponent in eq 32a for n2 is similar to that in eq 32b for co2 the regression lines are parallel to each other thus the ratio of the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 to that of co2 i e the value of α calculated from eqs 32a and 32b is 1 65 when the effective permeability is 5 0 10 12 m2 which is greater than α m co2 m n2 1 2 1 25 although the value of the exponent in eq 32a for n2 is also similar to that in eq 31 for air for an effective permeability of 5 0 10 12 m2 the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 obtained by the tracer experiments in this study is 1 27 the knudsen diffusion coefficient of air obtained by reinecke and sleep 2002 given a molecular weight of air m air 29 0 g mol and the molecular weight of n2 m n2 28 0 g mol the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 should be very close to that of air because α m n2 m air 1 2 is 0 98 therefore the results of this study confirm the difference between knudsen diffusion coefficients obtained by tracer experiments and those obtained by permeability experiments reported by abed and rinker 1974 we estimated the accuracy of the method that we used to obtain the knudsen diffusion coefficients from the tracer gas results to verify this difference in the knudsen diffusion coefficient between tracer and permeability experiments ogata and banks 1961 mathematically solved the following one dimensional advection diffusion equation with the boundary conditions that the concentration was c 0 at x 0 and t 0 and 0 0 at x and t 0 and the initial condition that the concentration was 0 0 at x 0 and t 0 where x is the distance from the gas inlet and t is the elapsed time from the injection of gas 33 c c 0 2 erfc x vt 2 dt 1 2 exp vx d erfc x vt 2 dt 1 2 where c is the concentration of the gas d is the diffusion coefficient and v is the velocity of the gas the concentration calculated with eq 33 should have no numerical noise unlike solutions obtained by numerical simulation we used the isccfem adq inversion simulator see section 2 1 to obtain the diffusion coefficient from the distributions of concentrations calculated by eq 33 with c0 1 0 the diffusion coefficient obtained by the inversion simulation should thus be equal to the diffusion coefficient d used in eq 33 for calculating the distribution of the concentrations therefore the difference between the diffusion coefficient obtained by the inversion simulation and that used for calculating the distribution of concentrations is the error in the method we used to obtain the knudsen diffusion coefficient from the tracer experiment results the length of the one dimensional domain the range used to divide the molar fraction into blocks the cell size of the grid and the number of time steps used in the inversion simulation were the same as those in the tracer experiment the length of the simulation domain was equal to 90 cm the length of the column used in the tracer experiments the inversion simulation was conducted for each block and then the diffusion coefficient of each block was obtained from the concentrations calculated with eq 33 the observation points for the inversion simulations were arranged at x 10 20 and 25 cm and then at intervals of 2 5 cm for x 30 cm consistent with the locations of the gas sampling points in the tracer experiments the distribution of concentrations was calculated for three cases a velocity of 0 05 cm s a diffusion coefficient of 0 1 cm2 s and an elapsed time from the injection of 1200 s case 1 a velocity of 0 02 cm s a diffusion coefficient of 0 02 cm2 s and an elapsed time from the injection of 2000 s case 2 and a velocity of 0 005 cm s a diffusion coefficient 0 01 cm2 s and an elapsed time from the injection of 8000 s case 3 these conditions were chosen with reference to the results of the inversion simulations for the tracer experiments concentrations obtained by the numerical inversion simulation were then fitted to the concentrations calculated with eq 33 at the indicated observation points as a result the diffusion coefficients obtained by the inversion simulation differed from those used to compute eq 33 by 0 2 the f statistic value which is equal to the sum of the squares of the differences between the concentrations calculated by eq 33 and those obtained by the inversion simulation at the observation points ranged from 4 62 10 9 to 1 55 10 5 therefore the isccfem adq inversion simulator used in this study was able to accurately simulate the diffusion coefficient table 4 the slope of the regression line between the molar fraction of the tracer gas and the reciprocal of the compound dispersion coefficient is an important parameter in the procedure used in this study to obtain the knudsen diffusion coefficient in eq 33 the diffusion coefficient is constant independent of the molar fraction of the tracer gas in cases 1 and 2 the reciprocal of the diffusion coefficient was not correlated with the molar fraction of the gas but was constant everywhere and the slopes of the regression lines were 0 0168 and 0 338 s cm2 respectively fig 12 the slope of the regression line of case 3 for all data was 2 51 s cm2 however the slope of the regression line of case 3 for data of blocks 1 3 only 1 13 was much smaller than the absolute value of the slope for all case 3 data table 4 and fig 12 consequently these results confirmed that the error of the slope of the regression line between the molar fraction of the tracer gas and the reciprocal of the compound dispersion coefficient obtained by the method used in this study was small therefore the fact that the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 obtained by the tracer experiments was 1 27 that of air as reported by reinecke and sleep 2002 is not due to the error of the method used for obtaining the knudsen diffusion coefficient in this study which yields accurate results in our tracer experiments we used three columns two with a length of 900 mm and the third with a length of 1500 mm but because the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 did not depend on column length tables 1 and 3 and fig 11 this column property did not influence the flow of gas in the column it is well known that nitrogen gas is inert furthermore in our experiments the carbon dioxide gas was inert because the porous media did not include water therefore nitrogen and carbon dioxide might not be adsorbed on surfaces of soil particles and the acrylic resin of which the column was made we estimated the adsorption onto the surfaces of the soil particles and the acrylic resin by introducing a retardation factor r into eq 24 for movement of gas component a in the porous media when r is constant as follows 34 x a t v ga r x a d disp a r x a the effective compound diffusion coefficient with a retardation factor is derived by dividing the reciprocal of eq 22 by r as follows 35 d disp a r 1 d b d a x a r τ m d ab x b r τ m d ab r τ p d a r δ mech thus if the retardation factor influences d disp a r then r should exceed 1 0 however r should be 1 0 if it has no influence we calculated tortuosities for the molecular diffusion in the porous media as the ratio of the molecular diffusion coefficients obtained by the present tracer experiments to the nitrogen carbon dioxide molecular diffusion coefficient without the obstruction of the soil particles 0 149 cm2 s poling et al 2001 as a result the tortuosities for the molecular diffusion obtained from the present tracer experiments ranged from 0 040 to 0 653 except that when the porous medium was 0 2 mm glass beads and the pressure difference was 0 1 kpa the tortuosity was 1 16 the tortuosity of the 0 2 mm glass beads exceeded 1 0 when the pressure difference was 0 1 kpa because the slopes of the regression lines between the molar fraction and the reciprocal of effective compound dispersion for both tracer gases were small the reason for the small slopes was that the distribution of the molar fraction could not accurately be measured near the two ends of the column thus the tortuosity of the 0 2 mm glass beads should be 0 277 of the pressure difference 0 03 kpa millington and quirk 1961 currie 1970 and lai et al 1976 reported that tortuosity to be equal to n 4 3 n 3 2 or n 5 3 respectively where n is porosity the tortuosity obtained by using n 4 3 from the porosities shown in table 1 ranged from 0 243 to 0 450 the tortuosity n 3 2 ranged from 0 120 to 0 301 and the tortuosity n 5 3 ranged from 0 029 to 0 135 these values are similar to the tortuosities of the porous media except that for the field soil mixed with bentonite obtained by the present tracer experiments table 5 these results indicate that the molecular diffusion coefficient was not influenced by adsorption on the porous media except with the field soil mixed with bentonite medium similarly the knudsen diffusion coefficient might not be influenced by adsorption the tortuosity of the field soil mixed with bentonite obtained by the tracer experiments was slightly smaller than that calculated by n 5 3 0 135 which yielded the smallest values among the three tortuosity models however because the tortuosity of the field soil mixed with bentonite obtained by the present tarcer experiments was about 2 to 18 times the value of 1 27 of the tortuosity which calculated by three tortuosity models from the porosity of the field soil mixed with bentonite the knudsen diffusion coefficient of field soil mixed with bentonite might not be influenced by adsorption either thus adsorption cannot explain why the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 obtained by the tracer experiments was 1 27 that of air reported by reinecke and sleep 2002 4 3 correction factor for knudsen diffusion coefficients in porous media this study found that the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 obtained by the tracer experiments was 1 27 that of air as reported by reinecke and sleep 2002 and thereby confirmed the difference between the knudsen diffusion coefficient in a binary gas system and that in a single gas system reported by chen and rinker 1979 chen and rinker 1979 introduced a diffusion flow correction factor and a slip flow correction factor into the dgm equation to eliminate this discrepancy and then they fitted the dgm equation to gas transport regimes of real porous media with pores having a wide range of radii in the dgm as modified by chen and rinker 1979 the effective compound diffusion coefficient on the right side of eq 17 dgm equation was multiplied by the diffusion flow correction factor and the first term on the right side of the effective compound velocity equation eq 16 was multiplied by the slip flow correction factor chen and rinker 1979 explained that they introduced these correction factors because of the heterogeneity of the porous media based on the concept that the heterogeneity can be expressed by the ratio of the effective volume mean transport coefficient to the transport coefficient obtained from the effective volume radius mean radius and tortuosity the dgm equation was originally derived by assuming a homogeneous porous medium such as a cylindrical pore with a constant diameter and length and mason et al 1967 already incorporated obstruction factors of molecular diffusion and knudsen diffusion that take account of tortuosity in the dgm equation these obstruction factors depend only on the structure of the porous medium and also take account of the heterogeneity of the porous medium the results of both tracer experiments with a binary gas system and permeability experiments with a single gas system should reflect the heterogeneity and the tortuosity of the media however as noted above there is a discrepancy between the knudsen diffusion coefficient obtained in a single gas system compared with that obtained in a binary gas system the obstruction factor for knudsen diffusion in the diffusion term the first term on the right side of eq 15 might be similar to that in the advection term the second term on the right side of eq 15 as noted above the obstruction factor for the knudsen diffusion coefficient that was actually obtained in the binary gas system was smaller than that obtained in the single gas system these obstruction factors depend only on the structure of the porous medium and are independent of the gas system chen and rinker 1979 modified the advection diffusion formulation transformed from the dgm equation by multiplying the diffusion term and the advection term by different correction factors and these correction factors depended on the diffusion regime or the gas system these correction factors as defined by chen and rinker 1979 cannot exactly explain the discrepancy in the knudsen diffusion coefficient or in the obstruction factor as noted above because it is not obvious whether chen and rinker 1979 used a correction factor for the knudsen diffusion coefficient accordingly we introduced a correction factor for a multicomponent gas system s multi for the knudsen diffusion coefficient into the diffusion term of eq 15 to account for this discrepancy in knudsen diffusion or the obstruction factor as follows 36a d a 1 d b d a x a q m d ab x b q m d ab 1 s multi q p d a considering that q p d a k e b a μgmix where b a is the klinkenberg parameter of component a we rearranged eq 16 which was included in the advection term of eq 15 as follows 36b v ga d a p g s multi q p d b q m d ab k e μ g mix q p d a p p g the value of s multi is 1 27 based on the experimental results shown in fig 11 furthermore because the regression line for the relation between the knudsen diffusion coefficients of n2 and the effective permeability coefficients obtained by the present tracer experiments is parallel to that obtained by the permeability experiments of reinecke and sleep 2002 this correction factor might depend only on the structure of the gas system in the porous medium and it might be independent of the structure of the porous medium and the intrinsic permeability however these characteristics of s multi need to be confirmed by conducting more experiments there is no need to take account of any additional correction factor for molecular diffusion except the obstruction factor noted above because molecular diffusion is not treated in the permeability experiment with the single gas system and it should be only treated in the multicomponent gas system thus molecular diffusion considers only the obstruction factor that relates to tortuosity as in fick s law because the knudsen diffusion coefficient obtained by the permeability experiments is consistent with that in the third term on the right side of eq 36b the correction factor for a multicomponent gas system should not be considered in the advection term except in d a and s multi q p d b in the first term on the right side of eq 36b 5 conclusion in this study by conducting permeability experiments we obtained permeability coefficients ranging from 10 13 to 10 11 m2 for the five porous media used in the tracer experiments the relationship between the knudsen diffusion coefficient of n2 d n2 and the effective permeability coefficient k e obtained by the tracer experiments was d n2 7 39 107 k e 0 767 whereas reinecke and sleep 2002 obtained the relationship d air 4 03 109 k e 0 794 by means of permeability experiments thus the knudsen diffusion coefficients of n2 that we obtained by tracer experiments with five porous media in a co2 n2 binary gas system were consistently 1 27 of those obtained by permeability experiments for many porous media and air conducted by other researchers we confirmed the accuracy of the method that we used for obtaining the knudsen diffusion coefficient in the tracer experiments by mathematically solving the one dimensional advection diffusion equation derived by ogata and banks 1961 by using an inversion simulation to fit the advection diffusion equation to the distribution of concentrations at observation points calculated by solving the equation of ogata and banks 1961 we showed that the diffusion coefficient obtained by the inversion simulation used in this study included an error of no 0 2 relative to that used for calculating the concentrations thus the method we used to obtain the knudsen diffusion coefficient in this study was not inaccurate moreover we used columns of two different lengths 900 and 1500 mm in this study and we found that the knudsen diffusion coefficient was not dependent on the column used therefore this column property did not influence the flow of gas in the column this discrepancy between the knudsen diffusion coefficient obtained by the tracer experiments with a binary gas system and the permeability experiments with a single gas system should be taken account of in the dgm equation the dgm equation already includes obstruction factors for knudsen diffusion and molecular diffusion that relate to heterogeneity and tortuosity and depend only on the structure of the porous medium furthermore there is no need to add a correction factor for molecular diffusion in addition to the obstruction factor because the molecular diffusion is not treated in permeability experiments with a single gas system and it should be only treated is effective in a multicomponent gas system thus molecular diffusion considers only the obstruction factor that relates to tortuosity therefore we introduced a correction factor for a multicomponent gas system s multi into the diffusion term and the advection term of eq 15 to account for this discrepancy in the knudsen diffusion coefficient or in the obstruction factor and multiplied the knudsen diffusion coefficient with the obstruction factor related to the tortuosity by s multi in the present experimental results s multi was 1 27 furthermore because the regression line for the relation between the knudsen diffusion coefficients of n2 and the effective permeability coefficients obtained by the present tracer experiments was parallel to that obtained by the permeability experiments of reinecke and sleep 2002 this correction factor for a multicomponent gas system might depend only on the structure of the gas system in the porous medium and be independent of the structure of the porous medium however these characteristics of s multi need to be confirmed by conducting more experiments acknowledgments we thank yuuya morishita koichi matuda and ryo
