18240,there is increasing recognition that functional bioindicators are needed for ecosystem health assessments in this perspective cotton strip assays are widely considered as a standard method to account for organic matter decomposition in streams however cotton cultivation and manufacture raise both environmental and societal dramatic issues that are in our opinion irreconcilable with the objectives of bioindication in this study we assessed the relevance of four alternative eco friendly textiles made of organic cotton hemp and linen by comparing their chemical composition and

surprisingly high nutrient 0 49 n contents occurred in the conventional cotton strips compared with the organic textiles n 0 12 all textiles provided similar degradation rates across the six streams

from fertilizers and chemicals used for cotton cultivation boquet and breitenbeck 2000 ferrigno et al 2017 but also from fiber processing and textile finishing babu et al 2007 lower contents of

18241,diverse taxa of cyanobacteria dinoflagellates and diatoms produce β n methylamino l alanine bmaa a non lipophilic non protein amino acid bmaa is a neurotoxin in mammals its ingestion may be linked to human neurodegenerative diseases namely the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinsonism dementia complex based on epidemiological evidence from regions where cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms occur frequently in controlled environments cyanobacteria produce bmaa in response to ecophysiological cues such as nutrient availability which may explain the elevated bmaa concentrations in freshwater environments that receive nutrient rich agricultural runoff this critical review paper summarizes what is known about how bmaa supports ecophysiological functions like nitrogen metabolism photosyntheis and provides a competitive advantage to cyanobacteria in controlled and natural environments we explain how bmaa production affected competitive interactions among the n2 fixing and non n2 fixing populations in a freshwater cyanobacterial bloom that was stimulated by nutrient loading from the surrounding agricultural landscape better control of nutrients in agricultural fields is an excellent strategy to avoid the negative environmental consequences and public health concerns related to bmaa production graphical abstract image 1 keywords neurotoxin β n methylamino l alanine production cyanohabs ecophysiological role agricultural nutrients best management practices 1 introduction the neurotoxin β n methylamino l alanine bmaa a non protein amino acid that is a suspected causative agent of human neurodegenerative diseases is produced by diverse cyanobacteria dinoflagellates and diatoms cox et al 2005 lage et al 2014 réveillon et al 2014 evidence of the connection between bmaa and the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinsonism dementia complex was first documented in guam where local residents who consumed cycad flour and flying foxes containing bmaa had 100 times greater incidence of these neurological disorders than the global baseline cox and sacks 2002 cox et al 2016 humans are exposed to bmaa through ingestion and dermal contact with contaminated water and food or inhalation of dust containing bmaa but the greatest environmental health risk is from cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohabs because of their global occurrence huisman et al 2018 merel et al 2013 this perspective is supported by eco epidemiological modelling showing that sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is associated with bmaa produced by cyanohabs snyder et al 2009 torbick et al 2014 most cyanobacteria could produce bmaa whether they are plant symbionts in mats growing in ponds and on sediments or in biological soil crusts and surface soil 0 2 cm cox et al 2005 jungblut et al 2018 metcalf et al 2015 richer et al 2015 however detection of bmaa production in cyanohabs is alarming due to the increasing frequency magnitude and duration of cyanohabs in fresh water systems worldwide especially in watersheds where nutrient loading occurs due to urban and rural activities huisman et al 2018 in controlled studies cyanobacteria produce bmaa in response to ecophysiological cues including nutrient availability we postulate that nutrients in agricultural runoff triggers bmaa production in cyanohabs but this requires nutrient loading to occur in the right proportions at the right time and possibly in combination with other factors that induce bmaa production by cyanobacteria the objective of this critical review paper is to present evidence of the connection between nutrient loading from agricultural runoff and bmaa production in cyanohabs in freshwater environments we begin by discussing the metabolic and ecological functions of bmaa for cyanobacteria populations and the factors that trigger bmaa production then we describe the known and hypothesized connections between nutrients in agricultural runoff and bmaa production by freshwater cyanohabs finally we discuss the opportunities and limitations of agricultural best management practices to reduce the environmental and public health risks associated with the cyanotoxin bmaa 2 bmaa production and its ecophysiological role in cyanobacteria understanding bmaa synthesis and functions in cyanobacteria remains challenging since it may exist as a free amino acid be associated with or incorporated into protein or complexed with metal ions cao et al 2019 this section summarizes the factors influencing bmaa production and its ecophysiological role in cyanobacteria 2 1 factors contributing to bmaa production cyanobacteria produce several forms of bmaa through distinct biosynthesis pathways cyanobacteria could biosynthesize the free amino acid form keto acid β n methylaminopyruvate directly by methylation of free 2 3 diaminopropionic acid dap or by enzymatic hydrolysis of bmaa associated with proteins downing et al 2011 tripathi and gottesman 2016 alternatively the cyanobacteria synechocystis pcc6803 may biosynthesize bmaa through hydrolysis of a cyclic urea compound downing and downing 2016 the genetic basis for bmaa biosynthesis in the cycad cyanobacteria symbiosis is associated with glutamate receptor like genes brenner et al 2003 ongoing research into bmaa stereochemistry and molecular transcriptomics should improve understanding of bmaa biosynthesis pathways in cyanobacteria diaz parga et al 2018 popova et al 2018 like other cyanotoxins the free amino acid form of bmaa probably exists in the nucleoplasmic region thylakoid area cell wall and sheath of cyanobacteria cells vega and bell 1967 it also associates with membrane bound peptides or proteins in the cytoplasm faassen et al 2016 after cyanobacteria biosynthesize bmaa the bmaa molecule remains in the cell during its lifespan dead or damaged cyanobacteria cells lyse and release bmaa into the environment therefore bmaa appearing in the environment originated from a de novo bmaa biosynthesis in the cell and b bmaa released into the environment through cellular lysis pernil et al 2015 main et al 2018 under nitrogen n deficient conditions both non n2 fixing and n2 fixing cyanobacteria can synthesize bmaa monteiro et al 2017 however the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria are expected to produce more bmaa than n2 fixing cyanobacteria in n limited environments scott et al 2014 downing et al 2011 downing et al 2012 monteiro et al 2017 popova et al 2018 n concentrations of 0 40 μm in the nh4 and no3 forms trigger bmaa production by the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria are growing in a bloom and laboratory cultures table 1 in addition to de novo bmaa biosynthesis cyanobacteria can absorb exgeneous bmaa from the environment berntzon et al 2013 downing et al 2011 absorbed bmaa could be biodegraded within the cell or it could be re released into the environment after cell death and lysis in laboratory cultures cyanobacteria populations are viable for about 30 days nizan et al 1986 but the generation time could be as short as 7 days in cyanohabs during summer months bidle and falkowski 2004 or as long as 90 days in biological soil crusts mugnai et al 2018 apoptosis necrosis and senescence are the main forms of cell death bidle and falkowski 2004 followed by lysis of the plasma membrane by viral enzymatic or osmotic mechanisms abiotic stressors that induce cellular lysis include nutrient stress due to excess deficiency of phosphorus or iron bidle 2016 berman frank et al 2004 popova et al 2018 salt stress ning et al 2002 high light stress berman frank et al 2007 and oxidative stress ross et al 2006 in addition biotic stress due to viral and bacteriophage infections as well as predation from animal like protists flagellates and other microbiota cause cellular lysis haraldsson et al 2018 2 2 ecophysiological role of bmaa since there is an energetic cost to synthesize cyanotoxins including bmaa there must be an evolutionary advantage for cyanobacteria that retained bmaa biosynthesis capacity this molecule may ensure the organism s functional niche ecological advantage or improve its fitness physiological efficiency based on the literature we suggest three ecological roles and two physiological roles of bmaa for cyanobacteria fig 1 other ecophysiological functions of bmaa may be discovered in the future interspecific competition n availabilty plays a critical role in the production of bmaa by cyanobacteria agawin et al 2007 downing et al 2011 monteiro et al 2017 when the available nitrate concentration falls below 0 3 0 4 μm n2 fixing cyanobacteria initiate the n2 fixing reaction which is energetically costly requiring 18 molecules of atp and 8 low potential electrons per molecule of n2 fixed canfield et al 2010 ferber et al 2004 this metabolic process requires p for energy and several elements fe mo s o to build the electron donating iron molybdenum cofactor in nitrogenase thereby depleting these essential nutrients from the environment under n deficient conditions both non n2 fixing and n2 fixing cyanobacteria can synthesize bmaa cox et al 2005 main et al 2018 monteiro et al 2017 rodgers et al 2018 violi et al 2019 however the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria are expected to produce more bmaa than n2 fixing cyanobacteria in n limited environments this statement is consistent with the observation that the non n2 fixing microcystis aeruginosa had 7 times higher bmaa concentration in a reservoir with 1 μm no3 than when the environment contained 40 μm no3 scott et al 2014 furthermore n deprivation induced higher bmaa production in synechocystis and microcystis non n2 fixing cyanobacteria in laboratory experiments downing et al 2011 downing et al 2012 popova et al 2018 in contrast there was 4 fold less bmaa produced by nostoc sp n2 fixing cyanobacteria in a n free cultures than in n containing medium the actual n concentration in the culture media is not reported in the paper monteiro et al 2017 together these reports suggest that non n2 fixing cyanobacteria are the dominant bmaa producers in n deficient conditions the bmaa produced by non n2 fixing cyanobacteria under n starvation could be absorbed by n2 fixing cyanobacteria and inhibit their nitrogenase activity thus altering the competition interactions among non n2 fixing and n2 fixing cyanobacteria berntzon et al 2013 popova et al 2018 for example non n2 fixing microcystis outcompeted the n2 fixing aphanizomenon when the soluble n concentration was 0 5 2 mg n l in the freshwater lake mendota located in wisconsin usa beversdorf et al 2013 the competitive advantage permitted the non n2 fixing microcystis population to increase from 103 cells ml to 106 cells ml while the population of n2 fixing aphanizomenon declined from 106 cells ml to 105 cells ml from july to september beversdorf et al 2013 although these authors did not evaluate bmaa production by the microcystis population we posit that if the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria produced bmaa it could have two benefits for their population first bmaa kills some of the n2 fixing cyanobacteria and nutrients released from their lysed cells can be recycled by the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria population second bmaa blocks nitrogenase activity and constrains the growth of n2 fixing cyanobacteria thereby reducing their population size and liberating resources such as space and oxygen needed by the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria population we also know that n2 fixing cyanobacteria produce bmaa and can have a high bmaa concentration in laboratory cultures and cyanohabs cox et al 2005 main et al 2018 however we do not know whether the high bmaa concentration in n2 fixing cyanobacteria is due to in vivo synthesis of the molecule or whether the bmaa was originally produced by another organism and assimilated by the n2 fixing cyanobacteria population how environmental conditions particularly n availability affect bmaa production by n2 fixing cyanobacteria still remains to be understood we believe that cyanobacteria have physiological adaptations that allow them to bioaccumulate and sequester bmaa in their organelles to avoid toxic effects although we do not know the threshold for bmaa tolerance within organelles this possibility offers hope for the development of genetic and biochemical therapies to treat humans and mammals exposed to bmaa it could also explain the co existance of non n2 fixing and n2 fixing cyanobacteria in freshwater environments despite the ability of both groups to produce lethal bmaa doubtless each group has adapted to the selective pressure of the bmaa molecule and developed strategies to maintain their functional niche after millenia of co evolution signal molecule bmaa has chemical characteristics that are analagous to other signal molecules produced by prokaryotes such as high hydrophibility logkow 4 00 molecular weight of 118 da and diffusion coefficient of 0 78 diaz parga et al 2018 most cyanobacteria taxa seem to produce bmaa and it is postulated to be a signal molecule responsible for communication among cyanobacteria species cox et al 2005 other non protein amino acids that are chemically similar to bmaa such as γ aminobutyric acid gaba accumulate rapidly in plants under stress and initiate defense pathways against drought and insect herbivory bown and shelp 2016 if bmaa is a gaba analogue it may regulate the cyanobacteria metabolism in response to stress or be an adaptive response to mitigate stress but this still remains to be determined pcd programmed cell death participator like other prokaryotes cyanobacteria initiate pcd under stressful environmental conditions the genetic basis for pcd are the metacaspases which initiate targeted protein degradation in the apoptotic pcd pathways with high catalytic efficiencies and strict substrate specificities asplund samuelsson et al 2016 phylogenetic analysis of n2 fixing cyanobacteria with 16s rna analysis revealed metacaspase orthologues which suggests that cyanobacteria initiate pcd when they encounter stressful conditions bidle and falkowski 2004 bar zeev et al 2013 he et al 2016 ross et al 2006 the presence of exogenous bmaa is an indication that cyanobacteria cells are dying and being lysed by abiotic and biotic stressors described in section 2 1 bishop et al 2018 monteiro et al 2017 thus an increase in exogenous bmaa concentration could induce the expression of metacaspase genes and initiate pcd as a negative feedback to control the size of cyanobacteria populations nitrogen metabolism as described previously bmaa biosynthesis is associated with cellular n stress holtcamp 2012 popova et al 2018 downing et al 2011 cultures grown under n starvation conditions 10 μm may produce bmaa to initiate the ionotropic glutamate receptors iglurs and thus activate glutamate receptor cation ca2 channels which controls ca2 movement and maintains the integrity of cellular membranes berntzon et al 2013 brenner et al 2000 another possible role for bmaa is to initiate the incorporation of ca2 into the carbon skeleton of 2 oxoglutarate after enzymatic reduction weiland et al 2015 although it seems counter intuitive to use limited n resources to synthesize a non protein amino acid like bmaa there is evidence that the primary amino n group in bmaa can be redistributed to glumate and glutamine via transamination of the enzyme glutamine synthetase glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase gogat martı n figueroa et al 2000 downing et al 2011 therefore bmaa has important physiological functions that maintain the integrity of cyanobacteria cells under n starvation conditions this implies that cyanobacteria have cellular mechanisms to reassimilate the amino n portions of the bmaa molecule once the protective glutamate pathways are initiated photosynthesis regulation cyanobacteria are photosynthetic organisms that must protect their photosynthetic apparatus from damage by photooxidation and this could be assisted by the bmaa molecule first bmaa acts as a glutamate receptor agonist that alters the cell membrane potential of the model plant arabidopsis thus affecting the light signal transduction brenner et al 2000 the glutamate receptor of arabidopsis is highly homologous with the same receptor in the cyanobacteria synechocystis sp chen et al 1999 it is thought that bmaa regulates oxygenic photosynthesis by blocking light signal transduction to protect cyanobacteria from oxidative damage when photosynthesis occurs under high light intensity and limited n availability downing et al 2015 second bmaa might regulate chlorophyll a activity to avoid its photooxidation since bmaa is produced under n starvation conditions that induce chlorosis and the degradation of photosynthetic pigments it would be logical for bmaa to protect pigments used in the xanthophyll cycle to dissipate light radiation before it damages the chloroplast or to inhibit the activity of chlorophyll a as proposed by downing and downing 2016 and berntzon et al 2013 3 contribution of agricultural nutrients to bmaa production in freshwater environments virtually every cyanohabs in a freshwater environment is associated with elevated nutrient concentrations in the waterbody the exponential growth that is characteristic of an algal bloom will not occur if the cyanobacteria are lacking in phosphorus 0 2 mg total p l and n 0 8 mg total n l paerl et al 2011 xu et al 2014 schindler et al 2008 nitrogen may originate from biogeochemical cycling within the aquatic system but also enters as runoff from upstream terrestrial environments intrusion of n rich groundwater and via atmospheric deposition gruber and galloway 2008 elser and bennett 2011 as an example we critically review the specific case of the eleventh largest freshwater lake by area in the world lake winnipeg in manitoba canada in lake winnipeg the total n budget is 96 000 ton yr where 29 of n comes from in lake processes and the remaining 71 is derived from sources outside the aquatic system board 2006 at least 49 of the exogeneous n is delivered in runoff from the surrounding agricultural land rattan et al 2017 agricultural runoff is responsible for n levels of up to 18 5 mg total n l and phophorous levels as high as 4 mg total p l which simulate and sustain the high biomass bloom in excess of 20 μg cells l in lake winnipeg braun 2007 rattan et al 2017 paerl et al 2011 hamilton et al 2016 michalak et al 2013 agricultural activities contribute to nutrient loading because fertilizer manure and other nutrient rich materials applied for crop production release dissolved and particulate associated nutrients that are susceptible to transport from farm fields li et al 2018 castellano et al 2019 whalen et al 2019 however the n transfer from agroecosystems to downstream rivers and lakes is seasonally variable because it is influenced by climatic conditions hydrologic processes within the watershed and agricultural management dissolved and particulate nutrients are readily transported during snowmelt in spring and after rainfall events in the early growing season that have enough intensity and or duration to generate overland flow and these nutrient sources are associated with the emergence and exponential growth phases in cyanohabs chen et al 2010 schneider et al 2019 zhang et al 2012 smith et al 2007 nutrient transfers decline during late summer to late fall because rainfall is more sporatic at this time of year so agricultural fields are drier and receiving little or no fertilizer as crops mature and are harvested the late summer to late fall period is a time when cyanohabs go into decline and collapse reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 the dynamics of cyanohabs depend on many factors including n loading from agroecosystems but we hypothesize that relationships exist between the cyanohabs growth phase bmaa concentration and n loading in lake winnipeg from emergence to the bloom phase the bmaa concentration ranged from undetectable to low and this increased approximately 20 fold to as much as 306 μg bmaa l during the decline and collapse phases in late fall pip et al 2016 bishop et al 2018 main et al 2018 zguna et al 2019 we posit that agricultural runoff triggers bmaa production because it influences the n entering the lake at different phases of bloom we can evaluate these relationships in lake winnipeg because data exists on the temporal variation in bmaa production and cyanohabs as well as the n loading into this lake the next sections discuss the known and hypothesized connections between the recurrent cyanohabs in lake winnipeg and agricultural activities in its 982 900 km2 watershed which includes three us states north dakota south dakota and minnesota and four canadian provinces alberta saskatchewan ontario and manitoba 3 1 lake winnipeg a freshwater lake where bmaa is produced by cyanohabs detection of bmaa production in cyanohabs was reported in british freshwater lakes and brackish waterbodies metcalf et al 2008 the baltic sea jonasson et al 2010 several freshwater environments in south floria brand et al 2010 lake taihu china jiao et al 2014 lake houston the us holtcamp 2012 thau lagoon french mediterranean sea réveillon et al 2015 and lake winnipeg canada bishop et al 2018 pip et al 2016 the specific example of lake winnipeg canada is compelling because this freshwater environment has experienced regular cyanohabs since the late 1990s due to anthropogenic forces primarily agricultural activities lake winnipeg is located in the cold humid temperate region of manitoba canada and covers an area of 24 514 km2 with two distinct basins the south basin and the north basin wassenaar and rao 2012 zhang and rao 2012 the cyanohabs in this lake often cover thousands of square kilometers benoy et al 2016 from 2002 to 2011 extensive blooms covered as much as 93 of the lake surface zhang and rao 2012 binding et al 2018 this represents a 5 fold increase in nuisance blooms of heterocystous cyanobacteria from the 1990s wassenaar and rao 2012 in 2016 bmaa was present in about 25 of cyanohabs in lake winnipeg bishop et al 2018 pip et al 2016 temporally the bmaa production occurrred during the cyanobacterial bloom forming season from early summer to late fall we do not know what cyanobacteria are responsible for bmaa production in lake winnipeg but bmaa could be associated with the toxic non n2 fixing cyanobacteria such as planktothrix and microcystis in the past decade these genera have emerged as co dominant populations together with the n2 fixing cyanobacteria aphanizomenon and dolichospermum which historically dominated the cyanohabs this widespread community level change in cyanohabs was attributed to the elevated n and phosphorus concentrations in lakes kling et al 2011 mckindles et al 2019 furthermore phosphorus rich lakes that receive exogenous n inputs can see a 500 increase in cyanobacteria production and toxicity leavitt et al 2006 donald et al 2011 vogt et al 2017 therefore temporal variation in bmaa production may be due to the emergence of toxic non n2 fixing cyanobacteria within the cyanohabs pip et al 2016 but a simpler explanation may be that bmaa production in this lake is responding to n availability a major driver of bmaa production in controlled studies 3 2 lake winnipeg a freshwater lake where bmaa production is associated with agricultural nutrient loading lake winnipeg s biggest problem stems from its large watershed the high drainage to surface area ratio and the change in surrounding land use board 2006 benoy et al 2016 agriculture expansion occurred throughout the 20th century particularly in the southern region of the lake winnipeg watershed from 1990 to 2010 there was an intensification of hog production more annual crop production and overall increase in livestock density bunting et al 2011 liu et al 2014 at the same time much of the post glacial terrain was systematically drained through the creation of surface ditches and channels to accelerate drainage on agricultural land in southern manitoba rattan et al 2017 this also involved filling or draining wetlands to expand agricultural production schindler et al 2012 the spatially referenced regressions on watershed attributes sparrow model indicates that about 65 of the total phosphorus load and approximately 75 of the total n load entering lake winnipeg originated from agricultural sources benoy et al 2016 approximately 7900 t phosphorus year and 96 000 t n year enter the watershed primarily during snowmelt and spring runoff events mccullough et al 2012 schindler et al 2012 the n concentration in lake winnipeg varies seasonally and corresponds to the loading pattern of agricultural nutrients schindler et al 2012 bunting et al 2016 the highest n concentrations are recorded in late spring and summer months mayer and wassenaar 2012 soto et al 2019 from late summer to fall nutrient loading from agricultural land is limited because fertilizer is not applied at the pre post harvest stage and there are fewer rainfall events that could induce n loss from agroecosystems during development of the cyanobactrial bloom the in lake n concentration declines to 0 1 mg total n l in late autumn mayer and wassenaar 2012 pip et al 2016 furthermore there is spatial variability in the no3 concentrations of lake winnipeg the south basin receives about 69 more of the n load than the north basin in april and may prior to the emergence and bloom phases of cyanohabs environment and climate change canada 2016 by early july the south basin becomes dominated by several non n2 fixing microcystis and planktothrix kling et al 2011 mckindles et al 2019 in an average flow year nutrients in south basin are transmitted to the north basin after two or three months in time to support the bloom that peaks in summer in both basins zhang and rao 2012 binding et al 2018 consequently the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria begin to experience n starvation during late summer and autumn in both basins bishop et al 2018 orihel et al 2012 in lake n dynamics are negatively related to the bmaa concentration pip et al 2016 pick 2016 vo duy et al 2019 which is expected to be lowest in the early summer bloom emergence and increasing from summer to autumn with the peak bmaa concentration occurring just before bloom collapse fig 2 overall the allochthonous agricultural nutrients may trigger bmaa production by influencing the composition of potentially toxic cyanobacteria species and the n level in lake winnipeg 4 controlling nutrients in agricultural fields to reduce human health risks from bmaa production in cyanohabs detection of bmaa in freshwater lakes many of which are drinking water sources is an emerging public health issue craighead et al 2009 esterhuizen and downing 2008 compared to other environmental sources the bmaa concentration in freshwater lakes is high and represents an important exposure pathway table 2 spatial analysis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases and lakes with a history of cyanobacterial blooms in new hampshire revealed that people living within 1 km of cyanobacteria contaminated lakes had a 2 3 times greater risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and inhabitants of lake mascoma had up to 25 times greater risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis than the general population caller et al 2009 relatively low exposure to bmaa is damaging based on in vitro studies showing that bmaa causes selective motor neuron demise at concentrations as low as 30 μm rao et al 2006 and damages motor neurons at concentrations of 10 μm lobner et al 2007 still bmaa needs to be understood as a chronic neurotoxin because it binds with proteins and has a long latency period before the proteins degrade and slowly release free bmaa into human brain tissues holtcamp 2012 the public health risk from long term exposure to bmaa in freshwater environments should not be underestimated 4 1 managing agricultural nutrients to prevent cyanohabs and the associated bmaa production since bmaa production occurs during the cyanohabs collapse phase and is fueled by n availability during the entire bloom the most efficient way to eliminate bmaa production in freshwater environments is to prevent cyanohabs this will involve preventative measures from multiple anthropogenic actors that contribute to n loading into vulnerable watersheds due to the influence of n availability on cyanobacteria species succession and cyanohabs collapse fig 3 agricultural best management practices that control the diffuse sources of nitrogen and phosphorus will be critical and these focus on controlling the transport processes and sources of excess nutrients as illustrated in fig 3 interventions that enhance natural attenuation processes in water and solute transport pathways as well as those that constrain the rate and time that n and phosphorus are applied to agricultural fields are two critical ways to reduce n loading to freshwater bodies hamilton et al 2016 end of field treatments with buffer strips bioreactors and wetland restoration should be implemented to slow hydrologic processes and capture nutrients before they enter the freshwater system precision agriculture approaches that combine remote sensing with judicious fertilizer use should prove effective in delivering n phosphorus and other nutrients to agricultural fields in the quantities needed by crops during the growing season fall fertilization should be strongly discouraged since crop nutrient demand is low in autumn and the residual nutrients are susceptible to loss during winter and early spring when most of the agricultural runoff occurs in cold humid temperate regions of the world in the short term we cautiously suggest that one strategy to reduce bmaa production could be to avoid n starvation of the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria this would be accomplished by inhibiting the growth and biomass accumulation of cyanobacteria by controlling the p input and adding n to prevent the de novo bmaa production by the n limited non n2 fixing cyanobacteria fig 3 this possibility needs to be verified experimentally before attempting any intervention in freshwater bodies as it is simplistic to assume that n concentrations in the lake are the sole trigger of bmaa production in cyanohabs 5 conclusion this synthesis suggests reasons why cyanobacteria have evolved bmaa biosynthesis as a cellular function and discusses the environmental stimuli that induce bmaa production for non n2 fixing cyanobacteria populations bmaa production gives them a competitive advantage and guarantees their co existence with n2 fixing cyanobacteria seasonal nutrient loading from agricultural land triggers and increases the production of bmaa by increasing the biomass of toxic cyanobacteria and altering the n availability in the freshwater environment however most of current understanding about bmaa production in cyanobacteria is still based on controlled laboratory work most field studies did not monitor the relationship between n availability and bmaa production which makes it difficult to compare the lab and field work long term monitoring is needed to confirm the relationship between agricultural nutrients cyanohabs and bmaa production for instance it is of utmost importance to identify the role of n availability on bmaa production in freshwater environments understanding the patterns of n loading from agricultural land along with the change in bmaa concentration cyanobacterial community dynamics and toxicity will eventually lead to more efficient agricultural management plans for preventing bmaa dual control of phosphorus and n inputs from agricultural land as well as measures to limit the n recycling in freshwater could be the optimal strategies to inhibit the growth of toxic cyanobacterial strains and control bmaa production bmaa is associated with acute and chronic neurotoxicity in humans leading to disorders in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinsonism dementia complex that are costly and burdensome for individuals families and the health care profession reducing human health risk from bmaa production in cyanohabs will require close collaboration between biochemists hydrologists ecologists agronomists and policy makers to deal with this global problem public health officials must be attentive to the fact that bmaa is produced in cyanohabs which are occurring more frequently with longer duration and larger size due to global warming and more anthropogenic nutrient loading in waterways around the world merel et al 2013 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 part of the solution will be more aggressive strategies to stop agricultural nutrient loading in lakes we need policies that clearly state the responsibilities of various stakeholders as well as financial commitments from governments and citizens to manage eutrophic watersheds we need to use our knowledge of cyanobacteria biology to control their populations and to prevent cyanohabs that produce bmaa so we can preserve the freshwater environments that are critically connected to our long term public health declaration of competing

18241,diverse taxa of cyanobacteria dinoflagellates and diatoms produce β n methylamino l alanine bmaa a non lipophilic non protein amino acid bmaa is a neurotoxin in mammals its ingestion may be linked to human neurodegenerative diseases namely the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinsonism dementia complex based on epidemiological evidence from regions where cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms occur frequently in controlled environments cyanobacteria produce bmaa in response to ecophysiological cues such as nutrient availability which may explain the elevated bmaa concentrations in freshwater environments that receive nutrient rich agricultural runoff this critical review paper summarizes what is known about how bmaa supports ecophysiological functions like nitrogen metabolism photosyntheis and provides a competitive advantage to cyanobacteria in controlled and natural environments we explain how bmaa production affected competitive interactions among the n2 fixing and non n2 fixing populations in a freshwater cyanobacterial bloom that was stimulated by nutrient loading from the surrounding agricultural landscape better control of nutrients in agricultural fields is an excellent strategy to avoid the negative environmental consequences and public health concerns related to bmaa production graphical abstract image 1 keywords neurotoxin β n methylamino l alanine production cyanohabs ecophysiological role agricultural nutrients best management practices 1 introduction the neurotoxin β n methylamino l alanine bmaa a non protein amino acid that is a suspected causative agent of human neurodegenerative diseases is produced by diverse cyanobacteria dinoflagellates and diatoms cox et al 2005 lage et al 2014 réveillon et al 2014 evidence of the connection between bmaa and the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinsonism dementia complex was first documented in guam where local residents who consumed cycad flour and flying foxes containing bmaa had 100 times greater incidence of these neurological disorders than the global baseline cox and sacks 2002 cox et al 2016 humans are exposed to bmaa through ingestion and dermal contact with contaminated water and food or inhalation of dust containing bmaa but the greatest environmental health risk is from cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms cyanohabs because of their global occurrence huisman et al 2018 merel et al 2013 this perspective is supported by eco epidemiological modelling showing that sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is associated with bmaa produced by cyanohabs snyder et al 2009 torbick et al 2014 most cyanobacteria could produce bmaa whether they are plant symbionts in mats growing in ponds and on sediments or in biological soil crusts and surface soil 0 2 cm cox et al 2005 jungblut et al 2018 metcalf et al 2015 richer et al 2015 however detection of bmaa production in cyanohabs is alarming due to the increasing frequency magnitude and duration of cyanohabs in fresh water systems worldwide especially in watersheds where nutrient loading occurs due to urban and rural activities huisman et al 2018 in controlled studies cyanobacteria produce bmaa in response to ecophysiological cues including nutrient availability we postulate that nutrients in agricultural runoff triggers bmaa production in cyanohabs but this requires nutrient loading to occur in the right proportions at the right time and possibly in combination with other factors that induce bmaa production by cyanobacteria the objective of this critical review paper is to present evidence of the connection between nutrient loading from agricultural runoff and bmaa production in cyanohabs in freshwater environments we begin by discussing the metabolic and ecological functions of bmaa for cyanobacteria populations and the factors that trigger bmaa production then we describe the known and hypothesized connections between nutrients in agricultural runoff and bmaa production by freshwater cyanohabs finally we discuss the opportunities and limitations of agricultural best management practices to reduce the environmental and public health risks associated with the cyanotoxin bmaa 2 bmaa production and its ecophysiological role in cyanobacteria understanding bmaa synthesis and functions in cyanobacteria remains challenging since it may exist as a free amino acid be associated with or incorporated into protein or complexed with metal ions cao et al 2019 this section summarizes the factors influencing bmaa production and its ecophysiological role in cyanobacteria 2 1 factors contributing to bmaa production cyanobacteria produce several forms of bmaa through distinct biosynthesis pathways cyanobacteria could biosynthesize the free amino acid form keto acid β n methylaminopyruvate directly by methylation of free 2 3 diaminopropionic acid dap or by enzymatic hydrolysis of bmaa associated with proteins downing et al 2011 tripathi and gottesman 2016 alternatively the cyanobacteria synechocystis pcc6803 may biosynthesize bmaa through hydrolysis of a cyclic urea compound downing and downing 2016 the genetic basis for bmaa biosynthesis in the cycad cyanobacteria symbiosis is associated with glutamate receptor like genes brenner et al 2003 ongoing research into bmaa stereochemistry and molecular transcriptomics should improve understanding of bmaa biosynthesis pathways in cyanobacteria diaz parga et al 2018 popova et al 2018 like other cyanotoxins the free amino acid form of bmaa probably exists in the nucleoplasmic region thylakoid area cell wall and sheath of cyanobacteria cells vega and bell 1967 it also associates with membrane bound peptides or proteins in the cytoplasm faassen et al 2016 after cyanobacteria biosynthesize bmaa the bmaa molecule remains in the cell during its lifespan dead or damaged cyanobacteria cells lyse and release bmaa into the environment therefore bmaa appearing in the environment originated from a de novo bmaa biosynthesis in the cell and b bmaa released into the environment through cellular lysis pernil et al 2015 main et al 2018 under nitrogen n deficient conditions both non n2 fixing and n2 fixing cyanobacteria can synthesize bmaa monteiro et al 2017 however the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria are expected to produce more bmaa than n2 fixing cyanobacteria in n limited environments scott et al 2014 downing et al 2011 downing et al 2012 monteiro et al 2017 popova et al 2018 n concentrations of 0 40 μm in the nh4 and no3 forms trigger bmaa production by the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria are growing in a bloom and laboratory cultures table 1 in addition to de novo bmaa biosynthesis cyanobacteria can absorb exgeneous bmaa from the environment berntzon et al 2013 downing et al 2011 absorbed bmaa could be biodegraded within the cell or it could be re released into the environment after cell death and lysis in laboratory cultures cyanobacteria populations are viable for about 30 days nizan et al 1986 but the generation time could be as short as 7 days in cyanohabs during summer months bidle and falkowski 2004 or as long as 90 days in biological soil crusts mugnai et al 2018 apoptosis necrosis and senescence are the main forms of cell death bidle and falkowski 2004 followed by lysis of the plasma membrane by viral enzymatic or osmotic mechanisms abiotic stressors that induce cellular lysis include nutrient stress due to excess deficiency of phosphorus or iron bidle 2016 berman frank et al 2004 popova et al 2018 salt stress ning et al 2002 high light stress berman frank et al 2007 and oxidative stress ross et al 2006 in addition biotic stress due to viral and bacteriophage infections as well as predation from animal like protists flagellates and other microbiota cause cellular lysis haraldsson et al 2018 2 2 ecophysiological role of bmaa since there is an energetic cost to synthesize cyanotoxins including bmaa there must be an evolutionary advantage for cyanobacteria that retained bmaa biosynthesis capacity this molecule may ensure the organism s functional niche ecological advantage or improve its fitness physiological efficiency based on the literature we suggest three ecological roles and two physiological roles of bmaa for cyanobacteria fig 1 other ecophysiological functions of bmaa may be discovered in the future interspecific competition n availabilty plays a critical role in the production of bmaa by cyanobacteria agawin et al 2007 downing et al 2011 monteiro et al 2017 when the available nitrate concentration falls below 0 3 0 4 μm n2 fixing cyanobacteria initiate the n2 fixing reaction which is energetically costly requiring 18 molecules of atp and 8 low potential electrons per molecule of n2 fixed canfield et al 2010 ferber et al 2004 this metabolic process requires p for energy and several elements fe mo s o to build the electron donating iron molybdenum cofactor in nitrogenase thereby depleting these essential nutrients from the environment under n deficient conditions both non n2 fixing and n2 fixing cyanobacteria can synthesize bmaa cox et al 2005 main et al 2018 monteiro et al 2017 rodgers et al 2018 violi et al 2019 however the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria are expected to produce more bmaa than n2 fixing cyanobacteria in n limited environments this statement is consistent with the observation that the non n2 fixing microcystis aeruginosa had 7 times higher bmaa concentration in a reservoir with 1 μm no3 than when the environment contained 40 μm no3 scott et al 2014 furthermore n deprivation induced higher bmaa production in synechocystis and microcystis non n2 fixing cyanobacteria in laboratory experiments downing et al 2011 downing et al 2012 popova et al 2018 in contrast there was 4 fold less bmaa produced by nostoc sp n2 fixing cyanobacteria in a n free cultures than in n containing medium the actual n concentration in the culture media is not reported in the paper monteiro et al 2017 together these reports suggest that non n2 fixing cyanobacteria are the dominant bmaa producers in n deficient conditions the bmaa produced by non n2 fixing cyanobacteria under n starvation could be absorbed by n2 fixing cyanobacteria and inhibit their nitrogenase activity thus altering the competition interactions among non n2 fixing and n2 fixing cyanobacteria berntzon et al 2013 popova et al 2018 for example non n2 fixing microcystis outcompeted the n2 fixing aphanizomenon when the soluble n concentration was 0 5 2 mg n l in the freshwater lake mendota located in wisconsin usa beversdorf et al 2013 the competitive advantage permitted the non n2 fixing microcystis population to increase from 103 cells ml to 106 cells ml while the population of n2 fixing aphanizomenon declined from 106 cells ml to 105 cells ml from july to september beversdorf et al 2013 although these authors did not evaluate bmaa production by the microcystis population we posit that if the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria produced bmaa it could have two benefits for their population first bmaa kills some of the n2 fixing cyanobacteria and nutrients released from their lysed cells can be recycled by the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria population second bmaa blocks nitrogenase activity and constrains the growth of n2 fixing cyanobacteria thereby reducing their population size and liberating resources such as space and oxygen needed by the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria population we also know that n2 fixing cyanobacteria produce bmaa and can have a high bmaa concentration in laboratory cultures and cyanohabs cox et al 2005 main et al 2018 however we do not know whether the high bmaa concentration in n2 fixing cyanobacteria is due to in vivo synthesis of the molecule or whether the bmaa was originally produced by another organism and assimilated by the n2 fixing cyanobacteria population how environmental conditions particularly n availability affect bmaa production by n2 fixing cyanobacteria still remains to be understood we believe that cyanobacteria have physiological adaptations that allow them to bioaccumulate and sequester bmaa in their organelles to avoid toxic effects although we do not know the threshold for bmaa tolerance within organelles this possibility offers hope for the development of genetic and biochemical therapies to treat humans and mammals exposed to bmaa it could also explain the co existance of non n2 fixing and n2 fixing cyanobacteria in freshwater environments despite the ability of both groups to produce lethal bmaa doubtless each group has adapted to the selective pressure of the bmaa molecule and developed strategies to maintain their functional niche after millenia of co evolution signal molecule bmaa has chemical characteristics that are analagous to other signal molecules produced by prokaryotes such as high hydrophibility logkow 4 00 molecular weight of 118 da and diffusion coefficient of 0 78 diaz parga et al 2018 most cyanobacteria taxa seem to produce bmaa and it is postulated to be a signal molecule responsible for communication among cyanobacteria species cox et al 2005 other non protein amino acids that are chemically similar to bmaa such as γ aminobutyric acid gaba accumulate rapidly in plants under stress and initiate defense pathways against drought and insect herbivory bown and shelp 2016 if bmaa is a gaba analogue it may regulate the cyanobacteria metabolism in response to stress or be an adaptive response to mitigate stress but this still remains to be determined pcd programmed cell death participator like other prokaryotes cyanobacteria initiate pcd under stressful environmental conditions the genetic basis for pcd are the metacaspases which initiate targeted protein degradation in the apoptotic pcd pathways with high catalytic efficiencies and strict substrate specificities asplund samuelsson et al 2016 phylogenetic analysis of n2 fixing cyanobacteria with 16s rna analysis revealed metacaspase orthologues which suggests that cyanobacteria initiate pcd when they encounter stressful conditions bidle and falkowski 2004 bar zeev et al 2013 he et al 2016 ross et al 2006 the presence of exogenous bmaa is an indication that cyanobacteria cells are dying and being lysed by abiotic and biotic stressors described in section 2 1 bishop et al 2018 monteiro et al 2017 thus an increase in exogenous bmaa concentration could induce the expression of metacaspase genes and initiate pcd as a negative feedback to control the size of cyanobacteria populations nitrogen metabolism as described previously bmaa biosynthesis is associated with cellular n stress holtcamp 2012 popova et al 2018 downing et al 2011 cultures grown under n starvation conditions 10 μm may produce bmaa to initiate the ionotropic glutamate receptors iglurs and thus activate glutamate receptor cation ca2 channels which controls ca2 movement and maintains the integrity of cellular membranes berntzon et al 2013 brenner et al 2000 another possible role for bmaa is to initiate the incorporation of ca2 into the carbon skeleton of 2 oxoglutarate after enzymatic reduction weiland et al 2015 although it seems counter intuitive to use limited n resources to synthesize a non protein amino acid like bmaa there is evidence that the primary amino n group in bmaa can be redistributed to glumate and glutamine via transamination of the enzyme glutamine synthetase glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase gogat martı n figueroa et al 2000 downing et al 2011 therefore bmaa has important physiological functions that maintain the integrity of cyanobacteria cells under n starvation conditions this implies that cyanobacteria have cellular mechanisms to reassimilate the amino n portions of the bmaa molecule once the protective glutamate pathways are initiated photosynthesis regulation cyanobacteria are photosynthetic organisms that must protect their photosynthetic apparatus from damage by photooxidation and this could be assisted by the bmaa molecule first bmaa acts as a glutamate receptor agonist that alters the cell membrane potential of the model plant arabidopsis thus affecting the light signal transduction brenner et al 2000 the glutamate receptor of arabidopsis is highly homologous with the same receptor in the cyanobacteria synechocystis sp chen et al 1999 it is thought that bmaa regulates oxygenic photosynthesis by blocking light signal transduction to protect cyanobacteria from oxidative damage when photosynthesis occurs under high light intensity and limited n availability downing et al 2015 second bmaa might regulate chlorophyll a activity to avoid its photooxidation since bmaa is produced under n starvation conditions that induce chlorosis and the degradation of photosynthetic pigments it would be logical for bmaa to protect pigments used in the xanthophyll cycle to dissipate light radiation before it damages the chloroplast or to inhibit the activity of chlorophyll a as proposed by downing and downing 2016 and berntzon et al 2013 3 contribution of agricultural nutrients to bmaa production in freshwater environments virtually every cyanohabs in a freshwater environment is associated with elevated nutrient concentrations in the waterbody the exponential growth that is characteristic of an algal bloom will not occur if the cyanobacteria are lacking in phosphorus 0 2 mg total p l and n 0 8 mg total n l paerl et al 2011 xu et al 2014 schindler et al 2008 nitrogen may originate from biogeochemical cycling within the aquatic system but also enters as runoff from upstream terrestrial environments intrusion of n rich groundwater and via atmospheric deposition gruber and galloway 2008 elser and bennett 2011 as an example we critically review the specific case of the eleventh largest freshwater lake by area in the world lake winnipeg in manitoba canada in lake winnipeg the total n budget is 96 000 ton yr where 29 of n comes from in lake processes and the remaining 71 is derived from sources outside the aquatic system board 2006 at least 49 of the exogeneous n is delivered in runoff from the surrounding agricultural land rattan et al 2017 agricultural runoff is responsible for n levels of up to 18 5 mg total n l and phophorous levels as high as 4 mg total p l which simulate and sustain the high biomass bloom in excess of 20 μg cells l in lake winnipeg braun 2007 rattan et al 2017 paerl et al 2011 hamilton et al 2016 michalak et al 2013 agricultural activities contribute to nutrient loading because fertilizer manure and other nutrient rich materials applied for crop production release dissolved and particulate associated nutrients that are susceptible to transport from farm fields li et al 2018 castellano et al 2019 whalen et al 2019 however the n transfer from agroecosystems to downstream rivers and lakes is seasonally variable because it is influenced by climatic conditions hydrologic processes within the watershed and agricultural management dissolved and particulate nutrients are readily transported during snowmelt in spring and after rainfall events in the early growing season that have enough intensity and or duration to generate overland flow and these nutrient sources are associated with the emergence and exponential growth phases in cyanohabs chen et al 2010 schneider et al 2019 zhang et al 2012 smith et al 2007 nutrient transfers decline during late summer to late fall because rainfall is more sporatic at this time of year so agricultural fields are drier and receiving little or no fertilizer as crops mature and are harvested the late summer to late fall period is a time when cyanohabs go into decline and collapse reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 the dynamics of cyanohabs depend on many factors including n loading from agroecosystems but we hypothesize that relationships exist between the cyanohabs growth phase bmaa concentration and n loading in lake winnipeg from emergence to the bloom phase the bmaa concentration ranged from undetectable to low and this increased approximately 20 fold to as much as 306 μg bmaa l during the decline and collapse phases in late fall pip et al 2016 bishop et al 2018 main et al 2018 zguna et al 2019 we posit that agricultural runoff triggers bmaa production because it influences the n entering the lake at different phases of bloom we can evaluate these relationships in lake winnipeg because data exists on the temporal variation in bmaa production and cyanohabs as well as the n loading into this lake the next sections discuss the known and hypothesized connections between the recurrent cyanohabs in lake winnipeg and agricultural activities in its 982 900 km2 watershed which includes three us states north dakota south dakota and minnesota and four canadian provinces alberta saskatchewan ontario and manitoba 3 1 lake winnipeg a freshwater lake where bmaa is produced by cyanohabs detection of bmaa production in cyanohabs was reported in british freshwater lakes and brackish waterbodies metcalf et al 2008 the baltic sea jonasson et al 2010 several freshwater environments in south floria brand et al 2010 lake taihu china jiao et al 2014 lake houston the us holtcamp 2012 thau lagoon french mediterranean sea réveillon et al 2015 and lake winnipeg canada bishop et al 2018 pip et al 2016 the specific example of lake winnipeg canada is compelling because this freshwater environment has experienced regular cyanohabs since the late 1990s due to anthropogenic forces primarily agricultural activities lake winnipeg is located in the cold humid temperate region of manitoba canada and covers an area of 24 514 km2 with two distinct basins the south basin and the north basin wassenaar and rao 2012 zhang and rao 2012 the cyanohabs in this lake often cover thousands of square kilometers benoy et al 2016 from 2002 to 2011 extensive blooms covered as much as 93 of the lake surface zhang and rao 2012 binding et al 2018 this represents a 5 fold increase in nuisance blooms of heterocystous cyanobacteria from the 1990s wassenaar and rao 2012 in 2016 bmaa was present in about 25 of cyanohabs in lake winnipeg bishop et al 2018 pip et al 2016 temporally the bmaa production occurrred during the cyanobacterial bloom forming season from early summer to late fall we do not know what cyanobacteria are responsible for bmaa production in lake winnipeg but bmaa could be associated with the toxic non n2 fixing cyanobacteria such as planktothrix and microcystis in the past decade these genera have emerged as co dominant populations together with the n2 fixing cyanobacteria aphanizomenon and dolichospermum which historically dominated the cyanohabs this widespread community level change in cyanohabs was attributed to the elevated n and phosphorus concentrations in lakes kling et al 2011 mckindles et al 2019 furthermore phosphorus rich lakes that receive exogenous n inputs can see a 500 increase in cyanobacteria production and toxicity leavitt et al 2006 donald et al 2011 vogt et al 2017 therefore temporal variation in bmaa production may be due to the emergence of toxic non n2 fixing cyanobacteria within the cyanohabs pip et al 2016 but a simpler explanation may be that bmaa production in this lake is responding to n availability a major driver of bmaa production in controlled studies 3 2 lake winnipeg a freshwater lake where bmaa production is associated with agricultural nutrient loading lake winnipeg s biggest problem stems from its large watershed the high drainage to surface area ratio and the change in surrounding land use board 2006 benoy et al 2016 agriculture expansion occurred throughout the 20th century particularly in the southern region of the lake winnipeg watershed from 1990 to 2010 there was an intensification of hog production more annual crop production and overall increase in livestock density bunting et al 2011 liu et al 2014 at the same time much of the post glacial terrain was systematically drained through the creation of surface ditches and channels to accelerate drainage on agricultural land in southern manitoba rattan et al 2017 this also involved filling or draining wetlands to expand agricultural production schindler et al 2012 the spatially referenced regressions on watershed attributes sparrow model indicates that about 65 of the total phosphorus load and approximately 75 of the total n load entering lake winnipeg originated from agricultural sources benoy et al 2016 approximately 7900 t phosphorus year and 96 000 t n year enter the watershed primarily during snowmelt and spring runoff events mccullough et al 2012 schindler et al 2012 the n concentration in lake winnipeg varies seasonally and corresponds to the loading pattern of agricultural nutrients schindler et al 2012 bunting et al 2016 the highest n concentrations are recorded in late spring and summer months mayer and wassenaar 2012 soto et al 2019 from late summer to fall nutrient loading from agricultural land is limited because fertilizer is not applied at the pre post harvest stage and there are fewer rainfall events that could induce n loss from agroecosystems during development of the cyanobactrial bloom the in lake n concentration declines to 0 1 mg total n l in late autumn mayer and wassenaar 2012 pip et al 2016 furthermore there is spatial variability in the no3 concentrations of lake winnipeg the south basin receives about 69 more of the n load than the north basin in april and may prior to the emergence and bloom phases of cyanohabs environment and climate change canada 2016 by early july the south basin becomes dominated by several non n2 fixing microcystis and planktothrix kling et al 2011 mckindles et al 2019 in an average flow year nutrients in south basin are transmitted to the north basin after two or three months in time to support the bloom that peaks in summer in both basins zhang and rao 2012 binding et al 2018 consequently the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria begin to experience n starvation during late summer and autumn in both basins bishop et al 2018 orihel et al 2012 in lake n dynamics are negatively related to the bmaa concentration pip et al 2016 pick 2016 vo duy et al 2019 which is expected to be lowest in the early summer bloom emergence and increasing from summer to autumn with the peak bmaa concentration occurring just before bloom collapse fig 2 overall the allochthonous agricultural nutrients may trigger bmaa production by influencing the composition of potentially toxic cyanobacteria species and the n level in lake winnipeg 4 controlling nutrients in agricultural fields to reduce human health risks from bmaa production in cyanohabs detection of bmaa in freshwater lakes many of which are drinking water sources is an emerging public health issue craighead et al 2009 esterhuizen and downing 2008 compared to other environmental sources the bmaa concentration in freshwater lakes is high and represents an important exposure pathway table 2 spatial analysis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases and lakes with a history of cyanobacterial blooms in new hampshire revealed that people living within 1 km of cyanobacteria contaminated lakes had a 2 3 times greater risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and inhabitants of lake mascoma had up to 25 times greater risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis than the general population caller et al 2009 relatively low exposure to bmaa is damaging based on in vitro studies showing that bmaa causes selective motor neuron demise at concentrations as low as 30 μm rao et al 2006 and damages motor neurons at concentrations of 10 μm lobner et al 2007 still bmaa needs to be understood as a chronic neurotoxin because it binds with proteins and has a long latency period before the proteins degrade and slowly release free bmaa into human brain tissues holtcamp 2012 the public health risk from long term exposure to bmaa in freshwater environments should not be underestimated 4 1 managing agricultural nutrients to prevent cyanohabs and the associated bmaa production since bmaa production occurs during the cyanohabs collapse phase and is fueled by n availability during the entire bloom the most efficient way to eliminate bmaa production in freshwater environments is to prevent cyanohabs this will involve preventative measures from multiple anthropogenic actors that contribute to n loading into vulnerable watersheds due to the influence of n availability on cyanobacteria species succession and cyanohabs collapse fig 3 agricultural best management practices that control the diffuse sources of nitrogen and phosphorus will be critical and these focus on controlling the transport processes and sources of excess nutrients as illustrated in fig 3 interventions that enhance natural attenuation processes in water and solute transport pathways as well as those that constrain the rate and time that n and phosphorus are applied to agricultural fields are two critical ways to reduce n loading to freshwater bodies hamilton et al 2016 end of field treatments with buffer strips bioreactors and wetland restoration should be implemented to slow hydrologic processes and capture nutrients before they enter the freshwater system precision agriculture approaches that combine remote sensing with judicious fertilizer use should prove effective in delivering n phosphorus and other nutrients to agricultural fields in the quantities needed by crops during the growing season fall fertilization should be strongly discouraged since crop nutrient demand is low in autumn and the residual nutrients are susceptible to loss during winter and early spring when most of the agricultural runoff occurs in cold humid temperate regions of the world in the short term we cautiously suggest that one strategy to reduce bmaa production could be to avoid n starvation of the non n2 fixing cyanobacteria this would be accomplished by inhibiting the growth and biomass accumulation of cyanobacteria by controlling the p input and adding n to prevent the de novo bmaa production by the n limited non n2 fixing cyanobacteria fig 3 this possibility needs to be verified experimentally before attempting any intervention in freshwater bodies as it is simplistic to assume that n concentrations in the lake are the sole trigger of bmaa production in cyanohabs 5 conclusion this synthesis suggests reasons why cyanobacteria have evolved bmaa biosynthesis as a cellular function and discusses the environmental stimuli that induce bmaa production for non n2 fixing cyanobacteria populations bmaa production gives them a competitive advantage and guarantees their co existence with n2 fixing cyanobacteria seasonal nutrient loading from agricultural land triggers and increases the production of bmaa by increasing the biomass of toxic cyanobacteria and altering the n availability in the freshwater environment however most of current understanding about bmaa production in cyanobacteria is still based on controlled laboratory work most field studies did not monitor the relationship between n availability and bmaa production which makes it difficult to compare the lab and field work long term monitoring is needed to confirm the relationship between agricultural nutrients cyanohabs and bmaa production for instance it is of utmost importance to identify the role of n availability on bmaa production in freshwater environments understanding the patterns of n loading from agricultural land along with the change in bmaa concentration cyanobacterial community dynamics and toxicity will eventually lead to more efficient agricultural management plans for preventing bmaa dual control of phosphorus and n inputs from agricultural land as well as measures to limit the n recycling in freshwater could be the optimal strategies to inhibit the growth of toxic cyanobacterial strains and control bmaa production bmaa is associated with acute and chronic neurotoxicity in humans leading to disorders in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinsonism dementia complex that are costly and burdensome for individuals families and the health care profession reducing human health risk from bmaa production in cyanohabs will require close collaboration between biochemists hydrologists ecologists agronomists and policy makers to deal with this global problem public health officials must be attentive to the fact that bmaa is produced in cyanohabs which are occurring more frequently with longer duration and larger size due to global warming and more anthropogenic nutrient loading in waterways around the world merel et al 2013 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 part of the solution will be more aggressive strategies to stop agricultural nutrient loading in lakes we need policies that clearly state the responsibilities of various stakeholders as well as financial commitments from governments and citizens to manage eutrophic watersheds we need to use our knowledge of cyanobacteria biology to control their populations and to prevent cyanohabs that produce bmaa so we can preserve the freshwater environments that are critically connected to our long term public health declaration of competing

18242,the ability of the tio2 based photocatalysis process to mineralize organic pollutants has attracted attention worldwide for the degradation of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps nevertheless 1 the limited exploitation of the solar spectrum i e activation under uv light only 2 3 of solar spectrum and 2 the high recombination rate of photo generated charge carriers i e electrons and holes have limited its application which can however be improved by developing a tio2 based heterojunction the objective of this critical review paper is to discuss the recent developments 2009 2019 in visible light driven vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation and their degradation mechanisms compared to the conventional heterojunctions schottky and z scheme heterojunctions which are non conventional heterojunctions are found to be more effective for ppcp degradation due to their more efficient separation of charge carriers and the occurrence of redox reactions at a relatively higher redox potential furthermore the enhancement strategies for the development of a vld tio2 based heterojunction are also explored which can be achieved by selecting the 1 highly photocatalytically active 001 facet of anatase tio2 2 synthesis methods governing the structural changes at the junction interface and 3 heterojunction components which can efficiently generate the powerful oh radicals the challenges in practical applications are also discussed which include factors viz cost reduction recycling stability byproducts analysis evaluation of the environmental effectiveness and reactor design and scale up of the vld tio2 based heterojunctions accordingly the prospects of vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation in real environmental applications are discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords heterojunction pharmaceuticals and personal care products photocatalysis visible light titanium dioxide 1 introduction the persistent use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps a diverse group of pharmaceutical drugs and personal care products used in daily life has raised serious concerns regarding the aquatic environment increased population growth and changing lifestyles have result in excessive demand for ppcps and hence their excessive production and use result in their eventual discharge into wastewater treatment plants wwtps the largest sink of ppcps liu and wong 2013 xu et al 2007 zeng 2015 due to their refractory nature ppcps are inefficiently degraded by conventional wwtps and thus these ppcps and their by products finally find their way into the receiving water bodies along with the discharged effluent of the wwtps fung et al 2019 khan et al 2019b kumar et al 2019 the concentration of these ppcps in the aquatic environment is found to be in the range of ng l to μg l which poses serious risks to human health and aquatic life cai et al 2018b kumar et al 2018 rahman et al 2009 the potential risks include acute and chronic toxicity adverse changes due to endocrine disruption and the emanation of antibiotic resistant genes ellis 2006 fent et al 2006 kunisue et al 2012 loos et al 2012 narvaez and jimenez 2012 qiao et al 2011 to mitigate the risks associated with the ppcps conventional treatment processes such as adsorption coagulation biological treatment and filtration have been adopted and are found to be ineffective cai et al 2018b evgenidou et al 2015 however the photocatalysis process has gained considerable attention over the conventional processes due to its ability to mineralize the pollutants into water and carbon dioxide rather than concentrating the pollutants and their by products into the waste stream ever since the discovery of the role of tio2 for environmental pollutant degradation it has become the ideal choice in photocatalysis over other semiconductor materials due to its appealing features viz non toxicity chemical and biological inertness excellent photo chemical corrosion resistance ability to generate the powerful hydroxyl oh radicals and cost effectiveness 1 usd kg asahi et al 2014 djouadi et al 2018 fujishima and zhang 2006 loeb et al 2018 nevertheless some challenges have limited its practical application namely 1 limited exploitation of the solar spectrum i e activated under uv light lower wavelength region which is only 2 3 of the solar spectrum asahi et al 2014 fujishima and zhang 2006 ibhadon and fitzpatrick 2013 and 2 high recombination rate of photo generated charge carriers i e electrons e and holes h which lowers the photocatalytic efficiency li et al 2017 2015 recently the concept of heterojunction photocatalysis has been proposed which can solve the above challenges of tio2 based photocatalysis due to their remarkable features viz 1 ability to extend the light absorption to the higher wavelength region 2 enhanced separation of e h pairs and 3 enhanced photocatalysis due to the introduction of other semiconductor chong et al 2010 fu et al 2018 low et al 2017a ong et al 2016 accordingly the focus of the present critical review paper is to investigate the development and mechanisms of visible light driven vld tio2 based heterojunctions for degradation of ppcps based on the literature published between the years 2009 2019 related to heterojunctions titanium dioxide photocatalysis and visible light the recent developments in the vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation and their challenges in practical application are discussed 2 basics of heterojunction photocatalysis 2 1 photocatalysis and its drawbacks the basic photocatalysis of ppcps on the tio2 surface can be divided into following steps chong et al 2010 fu et al 2018 loeb et al 2018 1 adsorption of ppcps present in the aqueous solution onto the surface of tio2 2 the absorption of light whose photon energy hν is more than or equal to the band gap eg of tio2 i e 3 2 ev and the generation of e h pairs fig 1 a 3 separation of e h pairs and transfer to the surface of tio2 4 generation of reactive oxygen species ros 5 participation of e h and ros in the reaction of ppcps adsorbed on the surface of tio2 via oxidation reduction reactions however the photocatalysis of ppcps on the tio2 surface suffers due to the following inherent drawbacks li et al 2015 ong et al 2016 1 limited absorption of the light spectrum the tio2 only absorbs uv light which consists of a mere 2 3 of the solar spectrum and 2 the recombination of e h pairs the recombination of e h pairs results in the dissipation of useful energy which can be utilized for more efficient photocatalysis 2 2 conventional heterojunction photocatalysts the heterojunction is a contact interface formed as a result of hybridization between two semiconductors metals with dissimilar band and electronic structures low et al 2017b milnes 2012 ong et al 2016 vinodgopal and kamat 1995 for instance upon light irradiation e h pairs are generated on the surface of semiconductor a sa and semiconductor b sb fig 1b however the generated e h pairs still suffer from recombination losses because sa and sb work independently in a heterojunction photocatalyst sa and sb work together in a coordinated fashion which minimizes the recombination losses based on this concept the inherent drawbacks of tio2 based photocatalysis are compensated by the introduction of heterojunction photocatalysis which has the following features fu et al 2018 li et al 2016 low et al 2017b meng et al 2019 milnes 2012 1 the ability to extend the light absorption to the higher wavelength region the major portion of the solar spectrum consists of visible light i e 45 of the solar spectrum lies in the higher wavelength region in comparison to uv light by combining another visible light responsive semiconductor or metal with tio2 i e a tio2 based heterojunction the light absorption can be extended to the higher wavelength region 2 the enhanced separation of e h pairs the components of a heterojunction suffer from recombination losses when they function independently however when they are part of a heterojunction structure the charge carriers migrate in the system due to the interaction of the semiconductor s components and hence results in more separation of the charge carriers 3 enhanced photocatalysis due to the introduction of another semiconductor the tio2 cannot generate the charge carriers under visible light irradiation due to its wide band gap 3 2 ev however during the development of vld tio2 based heterojunctions the tio2 is combined with a visible light responsive semiconductor or metal which enables the whole heterojunction unit to be visible light responsive and hence the generation of charge carriers on the surface of tio2 as well as other components of the heterojunction can be achieved consequently more charge carriers are available in the system and generate more reactive species responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic degradation of ppcps based on the different band and electronic structures typically the heterojunctions can be of three types viz type i straddling gap type ii staggered gap and type iii broken gap heterojunctions fig 2 low et al 2017b ong et al 2016 for type i heterojunctions the level of the conduction band cb and the valence band vb of sa are higher and lower than that of cb and vb of sb respectively thus the e and h migrate to the cb and vb of the sb respectively and the charge carriers cannot separate effectively due to their accumulation on the same semiconductor i e sb fig 2a in type ii heterojunctions the level of cb and the vb of sb are higher than that of cb and vb of sa respectively fig 2b therefore e migrates to the cb of sa and h migrates to the vb of sb which results in spatial charge separation as shown in fig 2c the band structure of type iii heterojunctions is similar to that of the type ii heterojunction except that the staggered gap becomes so wide that the bandgaps do not overlap thus e h migration and separation between sa and sb do not occur it should be noted that the type iii heterojunction does not possess the enhanced separation of e h pairs however their possible development due to the difference in band and electronic structures necessitates its discussion along with the other heterojunctions among these conventional heterojunctions the type ii heterojunction is the most effective due to its spatial migration and separation of e and h 3 recent developments in tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation heterojunctions have been developed for various environmental applications viz pollutant dyes ppcps and other organic and inorganic pollutants degradation kumar et al 2018 qiu et al 2019 sun et al 2012 yang et al 2010 microbial disinfection ganguly et al 2018 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2015 energy generation h2 generation by water splitting rawool et al 2018 wu et al 2018 and co2 reduction cao et al 2018 han et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 as per the needs for the application of a heterojunction their components are selected to generate specific reactive species from the scopus database between the years 2009 2019 it was found that most of the vld tio2 based heterojunctions were developed for the degradation of dyes i e 74 however dyes and pigments are not considered as ideal pollutants to measure the photocatalytic degradation efficiency due to their dye sensitization which interferes with the photocatalytic reactions barbero and vione 2016 accordingly dyes and pigments are not considered as target pollutants in this review and the focus is mainly on the degradation of recalcitrant ppcps by the vld tio2 based heterojunctions 3 1 target ppcps the ppcps include various subgroups of pharmaceuticals viz analgesics and anti inflammatory drugs antibiotics antiepileptic drugs blood lipid regulators β blockers cytosolic drugs etc and chemicals released after using personal care products viz fragrances lotions soaps sunscreens toothpastes etc evgenidou et al 2015 liu and wong 2013 qiao et al 2011 in this review the ppcps used as target pollutants by the vld tio2 based heterojunctions are summarized in table 1 it is observed that the ppcps used as the target pollutants belong to the three subgroups only analgesics and anti inflammatory drugs antibiotics and antiepileptic drugs among these targeted ppcps the most frequently targeted subgroups are the antibiotics and other groups are rarely used as target ppcps by employing conventional treatment processes it was reported that these ppcps are either partially biodegradable or nearly non biodegradable carbamazepine is one such ppcp which is nearly non biodegradable and it was found to be neither adsorbed nor degraded in wastewater treatment processes castiglioni et al 2006 yu et al 2011 nonetheless there are very few reports on the degradation by vld tio2 based heterojunctions in one study after 8 h of irradiation of solar simulated light only 55 83 of 5 mg l carbamazepine was reported to be degraded shahzad et al 2018 therefore more research is required to increase the degradation efficiency of the nearly non biodegradable ppcps 3 2 non conventional tio2 based heterojunctions the types of heterojunction photocatalysts mentioned in the previous sections are the conventional type of heterojunction photocatalysts other than these conventional heterojunctions there are also variants of heterojunctions such as the z scheme p n and schottky heterojunctions to understand the advancement in the development of vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation the focus of this sub section is to review the literature published between the years 2009 2019 the progress in the field of vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation can be understood by the graph in fig 3 which shows continuous increase year by year due to their appealing features to understand the recent developments in the vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation various features of vld tio2 based heterojunctions and the important parameters involved in photocatalysis are summarized in table 1 the features include information about the type of heterojunction materials involved during their synthesis and surface area while the parameters involved in the photocatalytic degradation of ppcp include information about the light source target ppcp initial ppcp concentration photocatalyst dose photocatalytic degradation efficiency and key reactive species involved during ppcp degradation in photocatalysis it is very difficult to compare the performance of two different photocatalysts due to variations in their experimental conditions and their chemical composition however we have taken the utmost effort to extract important information from the literature about the mechanisms of non conventional vld tio2 based heterojunctions and their performance for ppcp degradation which are discussed in this sub section schematic diagram showing the charge transfer mechanism in z scheme p n and schottky heterojunctions are shown in fig 4 the charge carrier migration pathway in the z scheme heterojunction resembles the letter z fig 4a it has the same band alignment as that of the type ii heterojunction however its charge transfer mechanism varies from that of type ii heterojunctions fig 2b the type ii heterojunction has two inherent drawbacks fu et al 2018 li et al 2016 ong et al 2016 1 oxidation occurs on the semiconductor s surface with lower oxidation potential and reduction occurs on the semiconductor s surface with lower reduction potential thus reducing the higher redox capability with dissipation of energy and 2 difficulty in migration of the cb e of a semiconductor to the cb of another semiconductor and the migration of vb h of a semiconductor to the vb of another semiconductor this is due to e e or h h electrostatic repulsion to overcome the drawbacks of type ii heterojunctions the concept of the z scheme heterojunction was introduced in which we can have the oxidation on the semiconductor s surface with higher oxidation potential and reduction on the semiconductor s surface with higher reduction potential thus the oxidation and reduction capabilities of semiconductors are maintained furthermore the charge migration in the z scheme heterojunction is due to the electrostatic attraction between e and h which is easier than the type ii heterojunction wherein the charge migration is relatively difficult due to the e e or h h electrostatic repulsion the components of the z scheme heterojunction other than the tio2 are mostly found to be comprised of carbon based materials viz carbon quantum dots cqds su et al 2017 wang et al 2019a graphene oxide simsek et al 2018 and g c3n4 jo and natarajan 2015 kumar et al 2018 su et al 2017 cqds are a new kind of low cost carbon material with dimensions of less than 10 nm with appealing features such as aqueous dispersibility chemical stability excellent electron transfer and reservoir ability non toxicity and up conversion fluorescence capability wang et al 2019a developed the n doped cqds 001 tio2 z scheme heterojunction for the degradation of diclofenac fig 5 a shows the tem image of uniformly distributed n doped cqds while the 001 tio2 nanosheets can be seen in fig 5b fig 5c shows the n doped cqds 001 tio2 z scheme heterojunction wherein the lattice fringes of both components are clearly visible the n doped cqds exhibit an excellent ability to enhance the broad spectrum sunlight response which result in the increased light absorption to the higher wavelength region and photocatalysis was undertaken in the uv visible near infrared uv vis nir region by the n doped cqds 001 tio2 heterojunction graphene oxide go a two dimensional 2d carbon material with large surface area superior e conductivity and mobility enables additional band gap states in the electronic structure resulting in visible light absorption nie et al 2018 simsek et al 2018 apart from these features the combination of go with the heterojunction mainly prevents agglomeration improves stability and enables the adsorption of pollutants simsek et al 2018 graphitic phase carbon nitride g c3n4 another low cost metal free non toxic carbon material is used as a component for the tio2 based heterojunction due to its appealing optical band gap of 2 70 ev fu et al 2018 ong et al 2016 the p n heterojunction is considered as an advanced type of type ii heterojunction fu et al 2018 low et al 2017a the e on the n type semiconductor near the p n interface tends to diffuse into the p type semiconductor leaving a positively charged species fig 4b similarly the h on the p type semiconductor near the p n interface tends to diffuse into the n type semiconductor leaving a negatively charged species thus the e h diffusion results in an internal electric field at the p n interface the p n heterojunction is able to accelerate the e h migration across the heterojunction by providing an additional electric field and therefore a lower e h recombination compared to the type ii heterojunction fu et al 2018 for instance in co3o4 tio2 go heterojunctions the valence band edge of p type co3o4 evb 2 5 ev vs nhe is more negative than that of n type tio2 evb 2 77 ev vs nhe which creates a p n heterojunction after contact jo et al 2017 after visible light irradiation the e h migration occurs under the influence of an internal electric field at the junction interface however the oxidation occurs on the semiconductor s surface with lower oxidation potential and reduction occurring on the semiconductor s surface with lower reduction potential which still results in the undesirable dissipation of energy thus the migration of charge carriers in the p n heterojunction is better than the type ii heterojunction because the migration occurs in the presence of an internal electric field which is more rapid and effective the schottky barrier is a potential energy barrier for e formed at a semiconductor metal interface which allows the transfer of e from the semiconductor sa to the metal interface but prevents the flow of photogenerated h fig 4c cai et al 2018b wang et al 2019b therefore the barrier effectively prevents the backflow of h from the sa to the metal interface from the literature it is noted that a schottky barrier has been developed with the help of mxenes which are 2d transition metal carbide nitride or carbonitride materials with the appealing features of a electrical conductivity of 4600 1100 s cm with highly anisotropic carrier mobility which allows the smooth mobility of charge carriers b the large number of hydrophilic functional groups on the surface o and oh enables it to be available for strong contact with other semiconductors and c abundantly exposed ti sites on the surface facilitate its strong redox ability cai et al 2018a shahzad et al 2018 wang et al 2019b the development of a schottky barrier between the tio2 and mxene interface acts as a potential energy barrier for the photoexcited e while it allows the flow of h on the heterojunction surface for oxidation reactions after the discussion of various types of vld tio2 based heterojunctions it is obviously desirable from a reader s point of view to know which heterojunction is better for the degradation of ppcps to find the answer to this question all types of heterojunctions should be developed using a similar composition of materials and their photocatalytic degradation efficiency should be determined under similar experimental conditions which was not found in studies during this review therefore we adopted a theoretical approach to answer this question in the z scheme heterojunction the oxidation occurs on the semiconductor s surface with higher oxidation potential and reduction occurs on the semiconductor s surface with higher reduction potential however in type ii or p n heterojunction which is an advanced type of type ii heterojunction the oxidation and reduction occurs at the semiconductor s surface with relatively lower oxidation and reduction potential respectively than the z scheme heterojunction in a schottky junction the reduction potential of e is lowered due to the transfer on the mxene surface while the oxidation potential of h is maintained besides the presence of abundantly exposed ti sites on the surface of mxene enhances its strong redox ability therefore we can conclude that schottky and z scheme heterojunctions are good choices among the heterojunctions and need further exploration regarding their practical application in ppcp degradation under visible light 3 2 1 surface area as discussed in section 2 photocatalysis depends on various factors of which surface area is one of the key factors responsible for the adsorption of ppcps on the surface of heterojunctions chong et al 2010 for instance jo and natarajan 2015 developed a g c3n4 tio2 z scheme heterojunction wherein the increased bet surface area also resulted in the increased photocatalytic degradation efficiency of isoniazid although surface area is not the only parameter to enhance the photocatalytic degradation it is one of the key parameters responsible for the degradation from the reviewed literature it was found that the value of the bet surface area of the tio2 based heterojunctions varies between 10 31 and 165 m2 g table 1 the semiconductors biobr and zno in combination with the tio2 resulted in bet surface areas of 160 8 and 165 m2 g respectively which are found to be suitable candidates for improvement in the surface area rashid et al 2019 tobajas et al 2017 the surface area of the heterojunctions can also be improved by morphological manipulation such as by synthesizing nanosheets nanobelts and nanotubes ren et al 2019 wang et al 2019a therefore the surface area of the tio2 based heterojunctions can be improved by either morphological manipulation or by selecting semiconductors such as biobr and zno in combination with the tio2 3 2 2 reactive species the reactive species generated on the surface of a photocatalyst are key for the degradation of pollutants the primary reactive species such as e and h usually react with the oxygen and water present in the solution to form the respective reactive species o2 and oh four main reactive species e h o2 and oh are responsible for the degradation of ppcps from the literature reviewed table 1 it was found that h o2 and oh are the key reactive species responsible for the degradation of various ppcps by the vld tio2 based heterojunction photocatalysts while the role of e was found to be minimal the redox potentials of various reactive species under standard conditions in water are summarized in table 2 and provides very useful information for the development of a particular heterojunction for targeting certain pollutants copeland and lytle 2014 feng et al 2018 under acidic conditions the redox potential of oh is found to be the highest among other reactive species followed by so4 thus in a typical photocatalysis reaction in water oh is the reactive species with the highest redox potential the oh known as a highly non selective reactive species djouadi et al 2018 can target different types of ppcps while other reactive species such as h and o2 can work in a supporting role the photocatalytic activity of a heterojunction photocatalyst is evaluated by degrading a certain pollutant however in real environmental applications the target pollutants can be of various types therefore for such applications the selection of components of a heterojunction should be in a manner that can generate more oh and can target various pollutants which can be achieved by selecting the semiconductor with a valence band potential more than the 2 4 v vs nhe at ph 7 low et al 2017b 3 3 efficiency enhancement of tio2 based heterojunctions the performance of a photocatalyst depends on its efficiency in the degradation of pollutants in this sub section our focus is to determine the strategies to enhance the efficiency of tio2 based heterojunctions under visible light irradiation during the literature review it was found that there are two possible strategies which can further enhance the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of tio2 based heterojunctions these two efficiency enhancement strategies are discussed below a effect of various tio 2 facets on photocatalytic degradation the physical characteristics of a material viz shape size and structural state governs the properties and applications of that material in the case of crystals it is directly related to the expression of specific crystallographic faces exhibiting different surface structures and atomic configurations the surface atom arrangement and coordination intrinsically determine the adsorption of reactant molecules surface transfer between photoexcited e and reactant molecules and the desorption of product molecules which are the important steps in the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants zuo et al 2012 generally different facets of a single crystal exhibit different physical and chemical properties which invite interest for environmental applications due to the appealing features of facet dependent photocatalysis researchers have investigated the photocatalytic activity of the 101 001 and 010 facets which are the three fundamental low index facets of anatase tio2 crystals liu et al 2010 pan et al 2012 zuo et al 2012 however the order of photocatalysis i e order of generation of ros and separation of e h pairs in aqueous solution was not clearly determined due to two main reasons a co existence of various facets in indefinite proportions imparting synergistic effects which affect the true photocatalytic activity of single facets and b use of organic capping surfactants or fluorine during the synthesis process which alter the true photocatalytic activity by creating vacancies or defects to determine the correct order of photocatalysis of these three low index facets of anatase tio2 crystals the anatase tio2 nanocrystal samples with 101 001 and 010 single facet exposure 90 were synthesized by the hydrothermal method without the use of organic capping surfactants or fluorine ye et al 2013 by determining the photocatalytic reduction o2 generation oxidation oh generation and separation of e h pairs in aqueous solution the order of photocatalysis among these facets was determined the order of photocatalysis was found to be as follows 001 101 010 ye et al 2013 moreover the order of the average surface energy of these facets was found to be as follows γ 001 0 90 j m2 γ 100 0 53 j m2 γ 101 0 44 j m2 roy et al 2013 the high surface energy of 001 facets is considered to be due to the presence of 100 5 fold coordinated titanium atoms ti5c compared to the 50 ti5c on the 101 surface pan et al 2011 vittadini et al 1998 therefore the 001 facet with high surface energy is also proven to be the most photocatalytically active among the 101 001 and 010 facets the higher photocatalytic activity of the 001 facet of anatase has attracted immense interest among researchers for the development of tio2 based heterojunctions exposed with the 001 facet shahzad et al 2018 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2019a due to the higher photocatalytic activity of the 001 facet the efficiency of the tio2 based heterojunctions can be improved further with this idea in mind wang et al 2019a developed a z scheme heterojunction of n doped carbon quantum dots and tio2 nanosheets with high energy 001 facets ncds tns 001 which exhibit a broad spectrum i e uv visible near infrared photocatalysis for the degradation of diclofenac the developed ncds tns 001 heterojunction was able to degrade 90 9 of 10 mg l diclofenac under 60 min of visible light irradiation moreover the heterojunction photocatalyst was also able to degrade 84 and 84 4 of diclofenac present in wwtp s effluent and sea water respectively under 60 min of visible light irradiation which proves the applicability of the ncds tns 001 heterojunction for practical environmental applications similarly wang et al 2017 developed a type ii heterojunction between the 001 faceted tio2 and g c3n4 which was a tio2 g c3n4 core shell quantum heterojunction the complete degradation of 20 mg l tetracycline was achieved within 10 min of visible light irradiation the improved efficiency was believed to be due to the uniform and compact contact interface g c3n4 quantum shell richly available reaction sites more surface adsorbed oh groups and efficient electron transfer between the 001 faceted tio2 and g c3n4 quantum shell shahzad et al 2018 developed a schottky junction between 001 faceted tio2 and titanium carbide ti3c2 nanosheets for the degradation of carbamazepine the efficient degradation was achieved due to the generation of extra e h pairs generated by the 001 faceted tio2 and the schottky junction thus the 001 facet of anatase tio2 with high surface energy and high photocatalytic potential is proven to be a good choice for the efficiency enhancement in tio2 based heterojunctions b effect of bonding at the junction interface the efficient charge transfer between different semiconductors can effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity of a heterojunction the effective charge transfer results in low recombination of charge carriers and hence increased availability of charge carriers for the generation of reactive species responsible for photocatalysis the nature of the contact interface uniform or non uniform strong or weak and bonding physical or chemical between the semiconductors are found to be the key factors responsible for the effective charge transfer at the junction interface chen et al 2016 kočí et al 2017 lu et al 2017 wang et al 2017 the combination of two semiconductors in a heterojunction results in the formation of barriers at the junction interface and thus the smooth migration of charge carriers becomes inevitable to overcome these challenges chen et al 2016 developed a tio2 g c3n4 type ii heterojunction with strong interfacial contact between g c3n4 nanosheets and mesoporous tio2 the steps involved in the development of tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction are shown in fig 6 dicyandiamide the precursor of g c3n4 was melted at 190 c so that it diffused to fill the pores of mesoporous tio2 after carbonization of dicyandiamide at high temperature g c3n4 was formed inside the pores of mesoporous tio2 with controlled coverage and thickness which facilitated the formation of a uniform and strong interfacial contact between tio2 g c3n4 for comparison of the charge transfer between g c3n4 nanosheets and mesoporous tio2 the tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction with the same stoichiometric ratio was synthesized by the physical mixing grinding method the developed tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction exhibited a lower recombination of charge carriers and higher photocurrent response than the one developed by the physical mixing method to reduce the barriers at the junction interface lu et al 2017 developed a c tio2 g c3n4 type ii heterojunction which possessed chemical bonds at the junction interface the chemical bonds between the two semiconductors at the junction interface facilitate effective interfacial charge transfer the effective charge transfer was achieved through the c ti and n ti bonds formed between the g c3n4 and c tio2 at the junction interface the c tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction with c ti and n ti bonds was synthesized through the hydrothermal method for comparison another c tio2 g c3n4 sample with the same stoichiometric ratio was also prepared through the mechanical mixing method the presence of c ti and n ti bonds was verified by the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra of the samples fig 7 the comparison of high resolution n 1s spectra of the c tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction and the sample prepared by the mechanical mixing mixing sample depicted the presence of a n ti bond at a binding energy of 396 1 ev in the c tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction fig 7a furthermore this was also confirmed by the high resolution ti 2p spectra of the c tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction in which other than the two characteristic peaks of tio2 at a binding energy of 458 8 ti 2p3 2 and 464 5 ev ti 2p1 2 two additional peaks at a binding energy of 455 2 and 460 8 ev were found attributed to the c ti bonds however the peaks at a binding energy of 458 8 and 464 5 ev were attributed to the n ti bonds which were absent in the mixing sample fig 7b the high resolution xps analysis of n 1s and ti 2p spectra confirmed the presence of c ti and n ti bonds in the c tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction while these bonds were absent in the mixing sample in the same composition thus the presence of chemical bonds c ti and n ti at the junction interface of c tio2 g c3n4 type ii heterojunction facilitated the effective charge transfer which ultimately resulted in a comparatively higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency than the mixing sample of photocatalyst recently wang et al 2017 developed a new strategy for polymerizing the quantum thick g c3n4 onto the surface of tio2 nanosheets exposed with 001 facets to understand the effect of the nature of contact interface of a heterojunction on the photocatalytic degradation efficiency two types of tio2 g c3n4 core shell type ii quantum heterojunction were developed through restricted polymerization viz compact and uniform cu and loose and non uniform ln heterojunctions the spatial charge separation in the cu heterojunction was found to be more effective than the ln heterojunction due to the compactness between the two semiconductors fig 8 a and b for instance the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of cu was found to be 36 more than the lu heterojunction for degradation of 20 mg l tetracycline fig 8c the increase in photocatalytic efficiency of the cu heterojunction was found to be due to the richly available reaction sites efficient transfer between the tio2 and g c3n4 quantum shell and more surface adsorbed oh groups from the high resolution tem image of a cu heterojunction it is proven that tio2 is covered with amorphous g c3n4 with a thickness of 6 8 nm depicting the quantum shell of g c3n4 and uniform contact interface thus by adopting a new strategy for polymerizing the quantum thick g c3n4 on to the surface of tio2 resulted in a compact and uniform tio2 g c3n4 core shell type ii quantum heterojunction which had a higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency for tetracycline degradation compared with the loose and non uniform heterojunction the application of tio2 based heterojunctions for the degradation of ppcps in real environmental applications is mostly restricted due to its poor degradation efficiency in this sub section we have discussed the new approaches adopted by researchers to enhance the photocatalytic degradation efficiency among the 101 001 and 010 facets of anatase tio2 the 001 facet with high surface energy was found to be the most photocatalytically active and is suggested to be a way forward for the development of highly efficient tio2 based heterojunctions for the photocatalytic degradation of ppcps in conjunction with the above strategy the careful selection of synthesis methods governing the structural changes at the junction interface nature of contact interface uniform or non uniform strong or weak and bonding physical or chemical between the semiconductors also plays a very crucial role in the efficiency improvement 4 challenges in practical applications of tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation the improvement in efficiency of the vld tio2 based heterojunctions has reduced the challenges in the photocatalytic degradation of ppcps however their practical application in real environmental conditions is still a challenge in this section we identify the parameters which can affect the practical applicability of the tio2 based heterojunctions in this regard we first discuss the existing practices adopted by researchers followed by possible solutions 4 1 cost reduction the growing demand for efficient degradation of ppcps using tio2 based heterojunctions has compelled us to discuss the treatment cost of the photocatalysis process which ultimately affects its practical application in heterogeneous photocatalysis being a less chemical intensive and efficient process for the degradation of ppcps the treatment cost mainly depends on the synthesis cost of a photocatalyst awfa et al 2018 since the synthesis cost of a heterojunction photocatalyst is a research area largely untouched by researchers discussion on the cost reduction of tio2 based heterojunctions are mostly based on our own laboratory experience the synthesis cost of tio2 based heterojunctions can be reduced either by selecting low cost materials by adopting low cost synthesis methods or by adopting both approaches which reduces the chemical and energy costs involved in the heterojunction synthesis generally for the development of a heterojunction we synthesize its components separately step 1 thereafter we combine them step 2 to form a heterojunction scenario i fig 9 for instance jo and natarajan 2015 developed a z scheme g c3n4 tio2 heterojunction by the wet impregnation method in which g c3n4 and tio2 were synthesized separately and a heterojunction was formed during the wet impregnation which is an additional step briefly in the wet impregnation method tio2 was added to 50 ml of methanol and sonicated for 30 min thereafter the g c3n4 was added to the above suspension and stirred for 24 h and the obtained solid was dried at 75 c for another 12 h to obtain the g c3n4 tio2 heterojunction however by adopting straightforward synthesis methods i e the synthesis of a heterojunction along with the synthesis of its components can save on resources chemicals and energy cost and time scenario ii fig 9 for instance kumar et al 2018 developed a z scheme g c3n4 tio2 heterojunction while synthesizing tio2 by the sol gel method wherein the additional step of wet impregnation as adopted in scenario i is avoided the adoption of a method in which the g c3n4 can be introduced during the hydrolysis of tio2 will save the extra chemical and energy costs involved during wet impregnation the cost reduction approach adopted in scenario ii can also be adopted during formulation of other synthesis methods for the development of heterojunctions which will ultimately reduce their synthesis cost thus the selection of a cost effective method for the synthesis of tio2 based heterojunctions can ultimately reduce the treatment cost which is more favorable for its practical application moreover further reduction in treatment cost can also be achieved by the efficient reuse of the recycled heterojunctions over multiple cycles the challenges related to the recycling of tio2 based heterojunctions are discussed in sub section 4 2 4 2 recycling recycling is one of the major challenges in the practical applicability of a photocatalyst for environmental applications the recycling of a photocatalyst includes its recovery from a suspension solution after application regeneration and further reuse to understand the challenges and developments in the recycling of vld tio2 based heterojunctions various methods employed are summarized in table 3 as shown in table 3 the heterojunctions were either used as a suspension in solution or attached to the support e g clay or zeolite in the solution the heterojunctions attached to the support i e the immobilized heterojunctions were developed to eliminate the need for separation of the heterojunctions from the solution after their use and to reduce the shear stress on the heterojunctions in the solution loeb et al 2018 for the development of immobilized heterojunctions researchers mostly relied on natural porous supports viz clay or zeolite gou et al 2017 li et al 2018 tobajas et al 2017 however the efficiency of immobilized heterojunctions remains a challenge for practical purposes due to the relatively less surface area available for photocatalysis compared to heterojunctions in suspension in the category of heterojunctions used as suspensions in solution the recovery of heterojunctions was performed in two ways viz a recovery using centrifugation ganguly et al 2019 guo et al 2018 or b magnetic recovery kumar et al 2018 ren et al 2019 recovery using centrifugation seems a feasible approach for the recovery of heterojunctions at the lab scale wherein the heterojunctions are recovered from the solution by applying a strong mechanical force however it could be expensive for practical purposes due to the installation of a large capacity centrifuge the magnetic recovery of heterojunctions is possible in the laboratory using a magnetic or electromagnetic system khan et al 2019a kumar et al 2018 ren et al 2019 however the practical application is also a challenge due to the installation of a large electromagnetic system as shown in table 3 the recovery of heterojunctions are performed at the lab scale only and thus pilot scale studies are required to scale up the recovery process for practical application the regeneration of a photocatalyst is one of the major hurdles in practical applicability the successful regeneration of a photocatalyst leads to further reduction in the treatment cost after the photocatalysis of pollutants the active sites responsible for photocatalysis usually become blocked by the degradation products or the constituents of the solution which ultimately results in decreased photocatalytic efficiency in subsequent cycles cai et al 2018b szczepanik 2017 thus in order to maintain a high photocatalytic efficiency in consecutive cycles heterojunctions are subjected to various regeneration methods in general after the recovery of the photocatalysts they are washed with a regeneration solution to clean the pores thereafter in order to maintain the crystallinity of the photocatalysts they are dried using either vacuum or thermal methods the regeneration methods include washing with a regeneration solution viz de ionized di water simsek et al 2018 tobajas et al 2017 organic solvents ethanol methanol etc hou et al 2017 ren et al 2019 and h2o2 gandhi et al 2012 or treatment with gas viz o3 ateia et al 2018 the treatment with h2o2 or o3 appears to be a less feasible regeneration method for practical applications due to the higher cost and the handling also requires a skilled operator thus it is suggested to explore more practical ways to perform the recycling of heterojunctions from the application point of view furthermore treatment with di water or organic solvents appears to be a relatively more feasible option than the treatment with h2o2 or o3 due to the lower cost and the handling does not require an operator with special handling skills however other than handling and cost considerations the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the regenerated heterojunctions also needs to be ascertained after recycling it was found that the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of most of the heterojunctions decreased as given in table 3 the decrement in the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the recycled heterojunctions is found to be in the range of 0 31 6 the washing of heterojunctions with di water alone followed by drying overnight in a temperature range of 60 100 c resulted in 10 16 22 decrease in photocatalytic efficiency however washing with both di water and ethanol methanol followed by drying overnight at 60 c resulted in 0 4 16 decrease in photocatalytic efficiency it means that washing with both di water and ethanol methanol is a more feasible approach than the washing with di water alone which is due to the minor decrement in photocatalytic degradation efficiency therefore washing of tio2 based heterojunctions with both di water and ethanol methanol followed by drying overnight at 60 c appears to be relatively more feasible approach than the other regeneration methods however pilot scale studies are required before assessing its practical application 4 3 stability in practical applications other than the cost effectiveness and recycling of heterojunctions stability also plays an important role nevertheless the stability of a heterojunction is not well defined in the literature therefore the focus of this sub section is to find out the ways through which the stability of a heterojunction is determined the literature survey reveals that the stability of vld tio2 based heterojunction photocatalysts has been expressed in terms of chemical wang et al 2019b photocatalytic natarajan et al 2018 wang et al 2019b photoelectrochemical shi et al 2019 and structural ganguly et al 2019 stability to determine the chemical stability of a heterojunction photocatalyst the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra of pristine and recycled heterojunctions were compared wang et al 2019a the photocatalytic stability was determined by the recycling performance of a photocatalyst natarajan et al 2018 wang et al 2019b wherein the photocatalysts were characterized before and after the recycling employing characterization techniques viz scanning electron microscopy sem wang et al 2019b transmission electron microscopy tem wang et al 2017 high resolution tem hrtem li et al 2018 and x ray diffraction xrd cai et al 2018a guo et al 2018 wang et al 2017 to determine the photocatalytic stability of the magnetic γ fe2o3 ultrathin nanosheets mesoporous black tio2 hollow sphere γ fe2o3 b tio2 heterojunctions a linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and irradiation time fig 10 was established ren et al 2019 the time dependent fluorescence intensity was recorded at 470 nm in which the oh density of the γ fe2o3 b tio2 heterojunction was found to be much higher than that of the α fe2o3 b tio2 heterojunction the photoelectrochemical stability was determined by the transient photocurrent response recorded after various on off cycles shi et al 2019 recorded the photocurrent response for the tio2 mos2 heterojunction decorated on carbon fiber at a potential bias of 0 2 v after turning on the light the current density jumped up to 7 53 10 6 a cm2 and was found to be stable after five on off cycles fig 11 in a very few studies the structural stability was also determined employing a theoretical approach i e the computational method ganguly et al 2019 the computational method was based on density functional theory dft which theoretically determines the electronic and optical properties of the pristine parent components of the heterojunction based on the obtained results from the dft the properties are compared with the findings obtained by the characterization of samples thus the theoretical approach acts as an additional tool to corroborate the experimental findings 4 4 byproducts analysis although mineralization is a unique feature of the photocatalytic process complete mineralization of ppcps by the photo generated e h and ros remains a challenge the incomplete mineralization of ppcps results in the formation of reaction intermediates and byproducts loeb et al 2018 chemical and toxicological studies of these compounds have revealed their toxicity and in some cases they are found to be even more toxic than their parent compounds hodges et al 2018 kanakaraju et al 2015 thus in such precarious scenarios depending on the particular practical application assessment of eco toxicity or human toxicity of these compounds is found to be a necessary step 4 5 evaluation of environmental effectiveness the treatment of ppcps present in water or wastewater is still a challenging task due to the presence of various ions organic matter and their byproducts which affect the performance of heterojunction photocatalysts mostly the performance of tio2 based heterojunctions is tested in ppcp solution prepared in di water which does not mimic the matrix of real water or wastewater samples however very few researchers have successfully targeted the ppcps present in real wwtp effluent kumar et al 2018 developed a g c3n4 tio2 fe3o4 sio2 z scheme heterojunction which was able to degrade 92 of 2 mg l ibuprofen present in real wwtp effluent after 180 min of visible light irradiation similarly an n doped cqds 001 tio2 z scheme heterojunction for the degradation of diclofenac was developed by wang et al 2019a which was able to degrade 84 of 10 mg l diclofenac present in real wwtp effluent a 6 9 decrease in photocatalytic performance of the heterojunction was found in real wwtp effluent as compared to the diclofenac present in the di water however for the purified drinking water samples the photocatalytic performance of the heterojunction is expected to be better compared to the real wwtp effluent due to the presence of relatively low concentration of ions moreover the factors affecting the environmental effectiveness were investigated and it was found that the significant effect was due to the presence of humic acid fung et al 2019 xia and lo 2016 cations fe3 and cu2 wang et al 2019a and anions po4 3 kumar et al 2018 present in the water matrix humic acid is known for its inhibitory effect towards the tio2 wherein the photocatalysis process is inhibited in two ways a by acting as an inner filter and b by scavenging reactive species the humic acid works as an inner filter in the water matrix which filters the light passing through it thereby decreasing the light absorption on the photocatalyst s surface doll and frimmel 2005 xia and lo 2016 humic acid is also known for its role in scavenging the radical species responsible for photocatalysis viz e h o2 and oh and thus ultimately inhibiting the photocatalysis doll and frimmel 2005 lin and lin 2007 wang et al 2019b xia and lo 2016 moreover in the case of composites of tio2 and the graphene family the competitive adsorption between humic acid and graphene is considered as one of the ways of inhibition in the photocatalysis process the interaction of humic acid with graphene is known to be due to a hydrophobic interaction b π π interaction and c hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interaction of available surface functional groups of the graphene viz oh cooh o groups awfa et al 2018 ersan et al 2017 the fe3 and cu2 inhibits the photocatalysis process by acting as an e scavenger thereby inhibiting the generation of o2 wang et al 2019b due to the strong affinity of po4 3 towards the tio2 po4 3 occupies the reactive sites of tio2 by adsorption and also scavenges the powerful oh kanakaraju et al 2015 kudlek et al 2016 therefore the heterojunctions should be developed in such a way so as to target the ppcps in real water or wastewater samples 4 6 reactor design and scale up in practical applications of the photocatalysis process reactor design and scale up are considered to be the research areas where little attention has been paid in the past hodges et al 2018 loeb et al 2018 suspended particle slurry reactors and fixed catalyst reactors are the two main types of reactor design slurry type reactors are designed to enhance the mass transfer between ppcps and the photocatalysts however the separation of photocatalysts is achieved through the membrane filtration which ultimately increases the cost and complexity of the reactor system the limitations of membrane filtration can be addressed by using fixed catalyst reactors however the mass transfer remains a challenge in such reactors due to the reduction in available surface area for photocatalysis because of the anchorage of the photocatalysts to the support media to address the challenges of mass transfer and separation gravity and magnetic separation strategies have been adopted fung et al 2019 hodges et al 2018 khan et al 2019b however such reactors have not been scaled up beyond the bench or conceptual level due to the complexity involved in large scale reactor systems thus reactor design and scale up are research areas where more attention is required in order to achieve the practical applicability of the vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation 5 conclusions and prospects in the past 10 years the merits of vld tio2 based heterojunction photocatalysts over conventional tio2 based photocatalysts for ppcp degradation have attracted great interest among the researchers in the field based on the different band and electronic structures typically heterojunctions can be of three types viz type i straddling gap type ii staggered gap and type iii broken gap heterojunctions in which the type ii heterojunction is proven to be the most effective due to its spatial migration and separation of e and h moreover the further enhancement in photocatalytic efficiency is achieved by developing the non conventional heterojunction photocatalysts viz z scheme p n and schottky heterojunctions among these non conventional heterojunctions schottky and z scheme heterojunctions are found to be more effective for photocatalysis due to their more efficient separation of charge carriers and the occurrence of redox reactions at a relatively higher redox potential however the literature review revealed that further improvement in photocatalytic efficiency can be achieved by 1 selecting the highly photocatalytically active 001 facet of anatase tio2 2 selecting the synthesis methods governing the structural changes at the junction interface which affects the nature of contact interface uniform or non uniform strong or weak and bonding physical or chemical between the semiconductors and 3 selecting heterojunction components which can efficiently generate the powerful oh moreover apart from the efficiency enhancement less attention has been paid to the degradation of ppcps by tio2 based heterojunctions for practical environmental applications the challenges in practical environmental applications are in the following areas 1 cost the material cost is the most important factor in the practical applicability of tio2 based heterojunctions the material cost can be reduced either by selecting low cost components for the heterojunction other than the tio2 by adopting low cost synthesis methods or by adopting both approaches 2 recycling the recycling of heterojunctions includes recovery regeneration and reuse after the application and successful recycling serves as a further cost reduction approach for practical applicability the recovery of heterojunctions is performed in two ways at the lab scale viz a recovery using centrifugation and b magnetic recovery however the practical application is still a challenge due to the high cost and large size of centrifuge and electromagnetic systems thus pilot scale studies are required in order to scale up the recovery process for practical application among the regeneration methods washing of tio2 based heterojunctions with di water and ethanol methanol followed by drying overnight at 60 c appears to be a relatively more feasible approach than the other regeneration methods overall in recycling being the most challenging aspect of photocatalysis towards the practical application more attention is required in future during the formulation of the recycling method to cater for the demands of practical applications the recycling method is recommended as cost effective practically feasible scalable and simple in operation 3 stability the heterojunction s stability is another factor which is essential for the effective performance in the long run it has been shown that the stability of a heterojunction can be expressed as chemical photocatalytic photoelectrochemical and structural stability by using the various characterization spectroscopic and theoretical techniques 4 byproducts analysis chemical and toxicological studies of reaction intermediates and byproducts have revealed their toxicity and in some cases they are found to be even more toxic than their parent compounds thus in such precarious scenarios depending on the particular practical application assessment of eco toxicity or human toxicity of these compounds is found to be a necessary step 5 evaluation of environmental effectiveness the treatment of ppcps present in water or wastewater effluent is still a challenging task due to the presence of various ions organic matter and their byproducts which affect the performance of the heterojunction photocatalysts some researchers have successfully developed vld tio2 based heterojunctions for the degradation of ppcps in real wwtp effluent their investigation revealed a significant effect on photocatalytic efficiency due to the presence of humic acid fung et al 2019 xia and lo 2016 cations fe3 and cu2 wang et al 2019a and anions po4 3 kumar et al 2018 thus it is recommended to develop heterojunctions in such a way as to target the environmental concentration of ppcps in real wwtp effluent by adopting such experimental conditions the real challenges in practical applications will be identified and will be easier to address 6 reactor design and scale up in practical applications of the photocatalysis process reactor design and scale up are considered to be the research areas where little attention has been paid in the past suspended particle slurry reactors and fixed catalyst reactors are the two main types of reactor design however such reactors have not been scaled up beyond the bench or conceptual level due to the complexity involved in large scale reactor systems thus reactor design and scale up are research areas where more attention is required in order to achieve the practical applicability of the vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation therefore it is suggested to design experiments in a specific manner that can address the challenges of practical applications for ppcp degradation finally the rapid evaluation of the factors mentioned above for the application of vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation can play an important role in addressing the challenges declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18242,the ability of the tio2 based photocatalysis process to mineralize organic pollutants has attracted attention worldwide for the degradation of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps nevertheless 1 the limited exploitation of the solar spectrum i e activation under uv light only 2 3 of solar spectrum and 2 the high recombination rate of photo generated charge carriers i e electrons and holes have limited its application which can however be improved by developing a tio2 based heterojunction the objective of this critical review paper is to discuss the recent developments 2009 2019 in visible light driven vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation and their degradation mechanisms compared to the conventional heterojunctions schottky and z scheme heterojunctions which are non conventional heterojunctions are found to be more effective for ppcp degradation due to their more efficient separation of charge carriers and the occurrence of redox reactions at a relatively higher redox potential furthermore the enhancement strategies for the development of a vld tio2 based heterojunction are also explored which can be achieved by selecting the 1 highly photocatalytically active 001 facet of anatase tio2 2 synthesis methods governing the structural changes at the junction interface and 3 heterojunction components which can efficiently generate the powerful oh radicals the challenges in practical applications are also discussed which include factors viz cost reduction recycling stability byproducts analysis evaluation of the environmental effectiveness and reactor design and scale up of the vld tio2 based heterojunctions accordingly the prospects of vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation in real environmental applications are discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords heterojunction pharmaceuticals and personal care products photocatalysis visible light titanium dioxide 1 introduction the persistent use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps a diverse group of pharmaceutical drugs and personal care products used in daily life has raised serious concerns regarding the aquatic environment increased population growth and changing lifestyles have result in excessive demand for ppcps and hence their excessive production and use result in their eventual discharge into wastewater treatment plants wwtps the largest sink of ppcps liu and wong 2013 xu et al 2007 zeng 2015 due to their refractory nature ppcps are inefficiently degraded by conventional wwtps and thus these ppcps and their by products finally find their way into the receiving water bodies along with the discharged effluent of the wwtps fung et al 2019 khan et al 2019b kumar et al 2019 the concentration of these ppcps in the aquatic environment is found to be in the range of ng l to μg l which poses serious risks to human health and aquatic life cai et al 2018b kumar et al 2018 rahman et al 2009 the potential risks include acute and chronic toxicity adverse changes due to endocrine disruption and the emanation of antibiotic resistant genes ellis 2006 fent et al 2006 kunisue et al 2012 loos et al 2012 narvaez and jimenez 2012 qiao et al 2011 to mitigate the risks associated with the ppcps conventional treatment processes such as adsorption coagulation biological treatment and filtration have been adopted and are found to be ineffective cai et al 2018b evgenidou et al 2015 however the photocatalysis process has gained considerable attention over the conventional processes due to its ability to mineralize the pollutants into water and carbon dioxide rather than concentrating the pollutants and their by products into the waste stream ever since the discovery of the role of tio2 for environmental pollutant degradation it has become the ideal choice in photocatalysis over other semiconductor materials due to its appealing features viz non toxicity chemical and biological inertness excellent photo chemical corrosion resistance ability to generate the powerful hydroxyl oh radicals and cost effectiveness 1 usd kg asahi et al 2014 djouadi et al 2018 fujishima and zhang 2006 loeb et al 2018 nevertheless some challenges have limited its practical application namely 1 limited exploitation of the solar spectrum i e activated under uv light lower wavelength region which is only 2 3 of the solar spectrum asahi et al 2014 fujishima and zhang 2006 ibhadon and fitzpatrick 2013 and 2 high recombination rate of photo generated charge carriers i e electrons e and holes h which lowers the photocatalytic efficiency li et al 2017 2015 recently the concept of heterojunction photocatalysis has been proposed which can solve the above challenges of tio2 based photocatalysis due to their remarkable features viz 1 ability to extend the light absorption to the higher wavelength region 2 enhanced separation of e h pairs and 3 enhanced photocatalysis due to the introduction of other semiconductor chong et al 2010 fu et al 2018 low et al 2017a ong et al 2016 accordingly the focus of the present critical review paper is to investigate the development and mechanisms of visible light driven vld tio2 based heterojunctions for degradation of ppcps based on the literature published between the years 2009 2019 related to heterojunctions titanium dioxide photocatalysis and visible light the recent developments in the vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation and their challenges in practical application are discussed 2 basics of heterojunction photocatalysis 2 1 photocatalysis and its drawbacks the basic photocatalysis of ppcps on the tio2 surface can be divided into following steps chong et al 2010 fu et al 2018 loeb et al 2018 1 adsorption of ppcps present in the aqueous solution onto the surface of tio2 2 the absorption of light whose photon energy hν is more than or equal to the band gap eg of tio2 i e 3 2 ev and the generation of e h pairs fig 1 a 3 separation of e h pairs and transfer to the surface of tio2 4 generation of reactive oxygen species ros 5 participation of e h and ros in the reaction of ppcps adsorbed on the surface of tio2 via oxidation reduction reactions however the photocatalysis of ppcps on the tio2 surface suffers due to the following inherent drawbacks li et al 2015 ong et al 2016 1 limited absorption of the light spectrum the tio2 only absorbs uv light which consists of a mere 2 3 of the solar spectrum and 2 the recombination of e h pairs the recombination of e h pairs results in the dissipation of useful energy which can be utilized for more efficient photocatalysis 2 2 conventional heterojunction photocatalysts the heterojunction is a contact interface formed as a result of hybridization between two semiconductors metals with dissimilar band and electronic structures low et al 2017b milnes 2012 ong et al 2016 vinodgopal and kamat 1995 for instance upon light irradiation e h pairs are generated on the surface of semiconductor a sa and semiconductor b sb fig 1b however the generated e h pairs still suffer from recombination losses because sa and sb work independently in a heterojunction photocatalyst sa and sb work together in a coordinated fashion which minimizes the recombination losses based on this concept the inherent drawbacks of tio2 based photocatalysis are compensated by the introduction of heterojunction photocatalysis which has the following features fu et al 2018 li et al 2016 low et al 2017b meng et al 2019 milnes 2012 1 the ability to extend the light absorption to the higher wavelength region the major portion of the solar spectrum consists of visible light i e 45 of the solar spectrum lies in the higher wavelength region in comparison to uv light by combining another visible light responsive semiconductor or metal with tio2 i e a tio2 based heterojunction the light absorption can be extended to the higher wavelength region 2 the enhanced separation of e h pairs the components of a heterojunction suffer from recombination losses when they function independently however when they are part of a heterojunction structure the charge carriers migrate in the system due to the interaction of the semiconductor s components and hence results in more separation of the charge carriers 3 enhanced photocatalysis due to the introduction of another semiconductor the tio2 cannot generate the charge carriers under visible light irradiation due to its wide band gap 3 2 ev however during the development of vld tio2 based heterojunctions the tio2 is combined with a visible light responsive semiconductor or metal which enables the whole heterojunction unit to be visible light responsive and hence the generation of charge carriers on the surface of tio2 as well as other components of the heterojunction can be achieved consequently more charge carriers are available in the system and generate more reactive species responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic degradation of ppcps based on the different band and electronic structures typically the heterojunctions can be of three types viz type i straddling gap type ii staggered gap and type iii broken gap heterojunctions fig 2 low et al 2017b ong et al 2016 for type i heterojunctions the level of the conduction band cb and the valence band vb of sa are higher and lower than that of cb and vb of sb respectively thus the e and h migrate to the cb and vb of the sb respectively and the charge carriers cannot separate effectively due to their accumulation on the same semiconductor i e sb fig 2a in type ii heterojunctions the level of cb and the vb of sb are higher than that of cb and vb of sa respectively fig 2b therefore e migrates to the cb of sa and h migrates to the vb of sb which results in spatial charge separation as shown in fig 2c the band structure of type iii heterojunctions is similar to that of the type ii heterojunction except that the staggered gap becomes so wide that the bandgaps do not overlap thus e h migration and separation between sa and sb do not occur it should be noted that the type iii heterojunction does not possess the enhanced separation of e h pairs however their possible development due to the difference in band and electronic structures necessitates its discussion along with the other heterojunctions among these conventional heterojunctions the type ii heterojunction is the most effective due to its spatial migration and separation of e and h 3 recent developments in tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation heterojunctions have been developed for various environmental applications viz pollutant dyes ppcps and other organic and inorganic pollutants degradation kumar et al 2018 qiu et al 2019 sun et al 2012 yang et al 2010 microbial disinfection ganguly et al 2018 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2015 energy generation h2 generation by water splitting rawool et al 2018 wu et al 2018 and co2 reduction cao et al 2018 han et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 as per the needs for the application of a heterojunction their components are selected to generate specific reactive species from the scopus database between the years 2009 2019 it was found that most of the vld tio2 based heterojunctions were developed for the degradation of dyes i e 74 however dyes and pigments are not considered as ideal pollutants to measure the photocatalytic degradation efficiency due to their dye sensitization which interferes with the photocatalytic reactions barbero and vione 2016 accordingly dyes and pigments are not considered as target pollutants in this review and the focus is mainly on the degradation of recalcitrant ppcps by the vld tio2 based heterojunctions 3 1 target ppcps the ppcps include various subgroups of pharmaceuticals viz analgesics and anti inflammatory drugs antibiotics antiepileptic drugs blood lipid regulators β blockers cytosolic drugs etc and chemicals released after using personal care products viz fragrances lotions soaps sunscreens toothpastes etc evgenidou et al 2015 liu and wong 2013 qiao et al 2011 in this review the ppcps used as target pollutants by the vld tio2 based heterojunctions are summarized in table 1 it is observed that the ppcps used as the target pollutants belong to the three subgroups only analgesics and anti inflammatory drugs antibiotics and antiepileptic drugs among these targeted ppcps the most frequently targeted subgroups are the antibiotics and other groups are rarely used as target ppcps by employing conventional treatment processes it was reported that these ppcps are either partially biodegradable or nearly non biodegradable carbamazepine is one such ppcp which is nearly non biodegradable and it was found to be neither adsorbed nor degraded in wastewater treatment processes castiglioni et al 2006 yu et al 2011 nonetheless there are very few reports on the degradation by vld tio2 based heterojunctions in one study after 8 h of irradiation of solar simulated light only 55 83 of 5 mg l carbamazepine was reported to be degraded shahzad et al 2018 therefore more research is required to increase the degradation efficiency of the nearly non biodegradable ppcps 3 2 non conventional tio2 based heterojunctions the types of heterojunction photocatalysts mentioned in the previous sections are the conventional type of heterojunction photocatalysts other than these conventional heterojunctions there are also variants of heterojunctions such as the z scheme p n and schottky heterojunctions to understand the advancement in the development of vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation the focus of this sub section is to review the literature published between the years 2009 2019 the progress in the field of vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation can be understood by the graph in fig 3 which shows continuous increase year by year due to their appealing features to understand the recent developments in the vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation various features of vld tio2 based heterojunctions and the important parameters involved in photocatalysis are summarized in table 1 the features include information about the type of heterojunction materials involved during their synthesis and surface area while the parameters involved in the photocatalytic degradation of ppcp include information about the light source target ppcp initial ppcp concentration photocatalyst dose photocatalytic degradation efficiency and key reactive species involved during ppcp degradation in photocatalysis it is very difficult to compare the performance of two different photocatalysts due to variations in their experimental conditions and their chemical composition however we have taken the utmost effort to extract important information from the literature about the mechanisms of non conventional vld tio2 based heterojunctions and their performance for ppcp degradation which are discussed in this sub section schematic diagram showing the charge transfer mechanism in z scheme p n and schottky heterojunctions are shown in fig 4 the charge carrier migration pathway in the z scheme heterojunction resembles the letter z fig 4a it has the same band alignment as that of the type ii heterojunction however its charge transfer mechanism varies from that of type ii heterojunctions fig 2b the type ii heterojunction has two inherent drawbacks fu et al 2018 li et al 2016 ong et al 2016 1 oxidation occurs on the semiconductor s surface with lower oxidation potential and reduction occurs on the semiconductor s surface with lower reduction potential thus reducing the higher redox capability with dissipation of energy and 2 difficulty in migration of the cb e of a semiconductor to the cb of another semiconductor and the migration of vb h of a semiconductor to the vb of another semiconductor this is due to e e or h h electrostatic repulsion to overcome the drawbacks of type ii heterojunctions the concept of the z scheme heterojunction was introduced in which we can have the oxidation on the semiconductor s surface with higher oxidation potential and reduction on the semiconductor s surface with higher reduction potential thus the oxidation and reduction capabilities of semiconductors are maintained furthermore the charge migration in the z scheme heterojunction is due to the electrostatic attraction between e and h which is easier than the type ii heterojunction wherein the charge migration is relatively difficult due to the e e or h h electrostatic repulsion the components of the z scheme heterojunction other than the tio2 are mostly found to be comprised of carbon based materials viz carbon quantum dots cqds su et al 2017 wang et al 2019a graphene oxide simsek et al 2018 and g c3n4 jo and natarajan 2015 kumar et al 2018 su et al 2017 cqds are a new kind of low cost carbon material with dimensions of less than 10 nm with appealing features such as aqueous dispersibility chemical stability excellent electron transfer and reservoir ability non toxicity and up conversion fluorescence capability wang et al 2019a developed the n doped cqds 001 tio2 z scheme heterojunction for the degradation of diclofenac fig 5 a shows the tem image of uniformly distributed n doped cqds while the 001 tio2 nanosheets can be seen in fig 5b fig 5c shows the n doped cqds 001 tio2 z scheme heterojunction wherein the lattice fringes of both components are clearly visible the n doped cqds exhibit an excellent ability to enhance the broad spectrum sunlight response which result in the increased light absorption to the higher wavelength region and photocatalysis was undertaken in the uv visible near infrared uv vis nir region by the n doped cqds 001 tio2 heterojunction graphene oxide go a two dimensional 2d carbon material with large surface area superior e conductivity and mobility enables additional band gap states in the electronic structure resulting in visible light absorption nie et al 2018 simsek et al 2018 apart from these features the combination of go with the heterojunction mainly prevents agglomeration improves stability and enables the adsorption of pollutants simsek et al 2018 graphitic phase carbon nitride g c3n4 another low cost metal free non toxic carbon material is used as a component for the tio2 based heterojunction due to its appealing optical band gap of 2 70 ev fu et al 2018 ong et al 2016 the p n heterojunction is considered as an advanced type of type ii heterojunction fu et al 2018 low et al 2017a the e on the n type semiconductor near the p n interface tends to diffuse into the p type semiconductor leaving a positively charged species fig 4b similarly the h on the p type semiconductor near the p n interface tends to diffuse into the n type semiconductor leaving a negatively charged species thus the e h diffusion results in an internal electric field at the p n interface the p n heterojunction is able to accelerate the e h migration across the heterojunction by providing an additional electric field and therefore a lower e h recombination compared to the type ii heterojunction fu et al 2018 for instance in co3o4 tio2 go heterojunctions the valence band edge of p type co3o4 evb 2 5 ev vs nhe is more negative than that of n type tio2 evb 2 77 ev vs nhe which creates a p n heterojunction after contact jo et al 2017 after visible light irradiation the e h migration occurs under the influence of an internal electric field at the junction interface however the oxidation occurs on the semiconductor s surface with lower oxidation potential and reduction occurring on the semiconductor s surface with lower reduction potential which still results in the undesirable dissipation of energy thus the migration of charge carriers in the p n heterojunction is better than the type ii heterojunction because the migration occurs in the presence of an internal electric field which is more rapid and effective the schottky barrier is a potential energy barrier for e formed at a semiconductor metal interface which allows the transfer of e from the semiconductor sa to the metal interface but prevents the flow of photogenerated h fig 4c cai et al 2018b wang et al 2019b therefore the barrier effectively prevents the backflow of h from the sa to the metal interface from the literature it is noted that a schottky barrier has been developed with the help of mxenes which are 2d transition metal carbide nitride or carbonitride materials with the appealing features of a electrical conductivity of 4600 1100 s cm with highly anisotropic carrier mobility which allows the smooth mobility of charge carriers b the large number of hydrophilic functional groups on the surface o and oh enables it to be available for strong contact with other semiconductors and c abundantly exposed ti sites on the surface facilitate its strong redox ability cai et al 2018a shahzad et al 2018 wang et al 2019b the development of a schottky barrier between the tio2 and mxene interface acts as a potential energy barrier for the photoexcited e while it allows the flow of h on the heterojunction surface for oxidation reactions after the discussion of various types of vld tio2 based heterojunctions it is obviously desirable from a reader s point of view to know which heterojunction is better for the degradation of ppcps to find the answer to this question all types of heterojunctions should be developed using a similar composition of materials and their photocatalytic degradation efficiency should be determined under similar experimental conditions which was not found in studies during this review therefore we adopted a theoretical approach to answer this question in the z scheme heterojunction the oxidation occurs on the semiconductor s surface with higher oxidation potential and reduction occurs on the semiconductor s surface with higher reduction potential however in type ii or p n heterojunction which is an advanced type of type ii heterojunction the oxidation and reduction occurs at the semiconductor s surface with relatively lower oxidation and reduction potential respectively than the z scheme heterojunction in a schottky junction the reduction potential of e is lowered due to the transfer on the mxene surface while the oxidation potential of h is maintained besides the presence of abundantly exposed ti sites on the surface of mxene enhances its strong redox ability therefore we can conclude that schottky and z scheme heterojunctions are good choices among the heterojunctions and need further exploration regarding their practical application in ppcp degradation under visible light 3 2 1 surface area as discussed in section 2 photocatalysis depends on various factors of which surface area is one of the key factors responsible for the adsorption of ppcps on the surface of heterojunctions chong et al 2010 for instance jo and natarajan 2015 developed a g c3n4 tio2 z scheme heterojunction wherein the increased bet surface area also resulted in the increased photocatalytic degradation efficiency of isoniazid although surface area is not the only parameter to enhance the photocatalytic degradation it is one of the key parameters responsible for the degradation from the reviewed literature it was found that the value of the bet surface area of the tio2 based heterojunctions varies between 10 31 and 165 m2 g table 1 the semiconductors biobr and zno in combination with the tio2 resulted in bet surface areas of 160 8 and 165 m2 g respectively which are found to be suitable candidates for improvement in the surface area rashid et al 2019 tobajas et al 2017 the surface area of the heterojunctions can also be improved by morphological manipulation such as by synthesizing nanosheets nanobelts and nanotubes ren et al 2019 wang et al 2019a therefore the surface area of the tio2 based heterojunctions can be improved by either morphological manipulation or by selecting semiconductors such as biobr and zno in combination with the tio2 3 2 2 reactive species the reactive species generated on the surface of a photocatalyst are key for the degradation of pollutants the primary reactive species such as e and h usually react with the oxygen and water present in the solution to form the respective reactive species o2 and oh four main reactive species e h o2 and oh are responsible for the degradation of ppcps from the literature reviewed table 1 it was found that h o2 and oh are the key reactive species responsible for the degradation of various ppcps by the vld tio2 based heterojunction photocatalysts while the role of e was found to be minimal the redox potentials of various reactive species under standard conditions in water are summarized in table 2 and provides very useful information for the development of a particular heterojunction for targeting certain pollutants copeland and lytle 2014 feng et al 2018 under acidic conditions the redox potential of oh is found to be the highest among other reactive species followed by so4 thus in a typical photocatalysis reaction in water oh is the reactive species with the highest redox potential the oh known as a highly non selective reactive species djouadi et al 2018 can target different types of ppcps while other reactive species such as h and o2 can work in a supporting role the photocatalytic activity of a heterojunction photocatalyst is evaluated by degrading a certain pollutant however in real environmental applications the target pollutants can be of various types therefore for such applications the selection of components of a heterojunction should be in a manner that can generate more oh and can target various pollutants which can be achieved by selecting the semiconductor with a valence band potential more than the 2 4 v vs nhe at ph 7 low et al 2017b 3 3 efficiency enhancement of tio2 based heterojunctions the performance of a photocatalyst depends on its efficiency in the degradation of pollutants in this sub section our focus is to determine the strategies to enhance the efficiency of tio2 based heterojunctions under visible light irradiation during the literature review it was found that there are two possible strategies which can further enhance the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of tio2 based heterojunctions these two efficiency enhancement strategies are discussed below a effect of various tio 2 facets on photocatalytic degradation the physical characteristics of a material viz shape size and structural state governs the properties and applications of that material in the case of crystals it is directly related to the expression of specific crystallographic faces exhibiting different surface structures and atomic configurations the surface atom arrangement and coordination intrinsically determine the adsorption of reactant molecules surface transfer between photoexcited e and reactant molecules and the desorption of product molecules which are the important steps in the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants zuo et al 2012 generally different facets of a single crystal exhibit different physical and chemical properties which invite interest for environmental applications due to the appealing features of facet dependent photocatalysis researchers have investigated the photocatalytic activity of the 101 001 and 010 facets which are the three fundamental low index facets of anatase tio2 crystals liu et al 2010 pan et al 2012 zuo et al 2012 however the order of photocatalysis i e order of generation of ros and separation of e h pairs in aqueous solution was not clearly determined due to two main reasons a co existence of various facets in indefinite proportions imparting synergistic effects which affect the true photocatalytic activity of single facets and b use of organic capping surfactants or fluorine during the synthesis process which alter the true photocatalytic activity by creating vacancies or defects to determine the correct order of photocatalysis of these three low index facets of anatase tio2 crystals the anatase tio2 nanocrystal samples with 101 001 and 010 single facet exposure 90 were synthesized by the hydrothermal method without the use of organic capping surfactants or fluorine ye et al 2013 by determining the photocatalytic reduction o2 generation oxidation oh generation and separation of e h pairs in aqueous solution the order of photocatalysis among these facets was determined the order of photocatalysis was found to be as follows 001 101 010 ye et al 2013 moreover the order of the average surface energy of these facets was found to be as follows γ 001 0 90 j m2 γ 100 0 53 j m2 γ 101 0 44 j m2 roy et al 2013 the high surface energy of 001 facets is considered to be due to the presence of 100 5 fold coordinated titanium atoms ti5c compared to the 50 ti5c on the 101 surface pan et al 2011 vittadini et al 1998 therefore the 001 facet with high surface energy is also proven to be the most photocatalytically active among the 101 001 and 010 facets the higher photocatalytic activity of the 001 facet of anatase has attracted immense interest among researchers for the development of tio2 based heterojunctions exposed with the 001 facet shahzad et al 2018 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2019a due to the higher photocatalytic activity of the 001 facet the efficiency of the tio2 based heterojunctions can be improved further with this idea in mind wang et al 2019a developed a z scheme heterojunction of n doped carbon quantum dots and tio2 nanosheets with high energy 001 facets ncds tns 001 which exhibit a broad spectrum i e uv visible near infrared photocatalysis for the degradation of diclofenac the developed ncds tns 001 heterojunction was able to degrade 90 9 of 10 mg l diclofenac under 60 min of visible light irradiation moreover the heterojunction photocatalyst was also able to degrade 84 and 84 4 of diclofenac present in wwtp s effluent and sea water respectively under 60 min of visible light irradiation which proves the applicability of the ncds tns 001 heterojunction for practical environmental applications similarly wang et al 2017 developed a type ii heterojunction between the 001 faceted tio2 and g c3n4 which was a tio2 g c3n4 core shell quantum heterojunction the complete degradation of 20 mg l tetracycline was achieved within 10 min of visible light irradiation the improved efficiency was believed to be due to the uniform and compact contact interface g c3n4 quantum shell richly available reaction sites more surface adsorbed oh groups and efficient electron transfer between the 001 faceted tio2 and g c3n4 quantum shell shahzad et al 2018 developed a schottky junction between 001 faceted tio2 and titanium carbide ti3c2 nanosheets for the degradation of carbamazepine the efficient degradation was achieved due to the generation of extra e h pairs generated by the 001 faceted tio2 and the schottky junction thus the 001 facet of anatase tio2 with high surface energy and high photocatalytic potential is proven to be a good choice for the efficiency enhancement in tio2 based heterojunctions b effect of bonding at the junction interface the efficient charge transfer between different semiconductors can effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity of a heterojunction the effective charge transfer results in low recombination of charge carriers and hence increased availability of charge carriers for the generation of reactive species responsible for photocatalysis the nature of the contact interface uniform or non uniform strong or weak and bonding physical or chemical between the semiconductors are found to be the key factors responsible for the effective charge transfer at the junction interface chen et al 2016 kočí et al 2017 lu et al 2017 wang et al 2017 the combination of two semiconductors in a heterojunction results in the formation of barriers at the junction interface and thus the smooth migration of charge carriers becomes inevitable to overcome these challenges chen et al 2016 developed a tio2 g c3n4 type ii heterojunction with strong interfacial contact between g c3n4 nanosheets and mesoporous tio2 the steps involved in the development of tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction are shown in fig 6 dicyandiamide the precursor of g c3n4 was melted at 190 c so that it diffused to fill the pores of mesoporous tio2 after carbonization of dicyandiamide at high temperature g c3n4 was formed inside the pores of mesoporous tio2 with controlled coverage and thickness which facilitated the formation of a uniform and strong interfacial contact between tio2 g c3n4 for comparison of the charge transfer between g c3n4 nanosheets and mesoporous tio2 the tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction with the same stoichiometric ratio was synthesized by the physical mixing grinding method the developed tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction exhibited a lower recombination of charge carriers and higher photocurrent response than the one developed by the physical mixing method to reduce the barriers at the junction interface lu et al 2017 developed a c tio2 g c3n4 type ii heterojunction which possessed chemical bonds at the junction interface the chemical bonds between the two semiconductors at the junction interface facilitate effective interfacial charge transfer the effective charge transfer was achieved through the c ti and n ti bonds formed between the g c3n4 and c tio2 at the junction interface the c tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction with c ti and n ti bonds was synthesized through the hydrothermal method for comparison another c tio2 g c3n4 sample with the same stoichiometric ratio was also prepared through the mechanical mixing method the presence of c ti and n ti bonds was verified by the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra of the samples fig 7 the comparison of high resolution n 1s spectra of the c tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction and the sample prepared by the mechanical mixing mixing sample depicted the presence of a n ti bond at a binding energy of 396 1 ev in the c tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction fig 7a furthermore this was also confirmed by the high resolution ti 2p spectra of the c tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction in which other than the two characteristic peaks of tio2 at a binding energy of 458 8 ti 2p3 2 and 464 5 ev ti 2p1 2 two additional peaks at a binding energy of 455 2 and 460 8 ev were found attributed to the c ti bonds however the peaks at a binding energy of 458 8 and 464 5 ev were attributed to the n ti bonds which were absent in the mixing sample fig 7b the high resolution xps analysis of n 1s and ti 2p spectra confirmed the presence of c ti and n ti bonds in the c tio2 g c3n4 heterojunction while these bonds were absent in the mixing sample in the same composition thus the presence of chemical bonds c ti and n ti at the junction interface of c tio2 g c3n4 type ii heterojunction facilitated the effective charge transfer which ultimately resulted in a comparatively higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency than the mixing sample of photocatalyst recently wang et al 2017 developed a new strategy for polymerizing the quantum thick g c3n4 onto the surface of tio2 nanosheets exposed with 001 facets to understand the effect of the nature of contact interface of a heterojunction on the photocatalytic degradation efficiency two types of tio2 g c3n4 core shell type ii quantum heterojunction were developed through restricted polymerization viz compact and uniform cu and loose and non uniform ln heterojunctions the spatial charge separation in the cu heterojunction was found to be more effective than the ln heterojunction due to the compactness between the two semiconductors fig 8 a and b for instance the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of cu was found to be 36 more than the lu heterojunction for degradation of 20 mg l tetracycline fig 8c the increase in photocatalytic efficiency of the cu heterojunction was found to be due to the richly available reaction sites efficient transfer between the tio2 and g c3n4 quantum shell and more surface adsorbed oh groups from the high resolution tem image of a cu heterojunction it is proven that tio2 is covered with amorphous g c3n4 with a thickness of 6 8 nm depicting the quantum shell of g c3n4 and uniform contact interface thus by adopting a new strategy for polymerizing the quantum thick g c3n4 on to the surface of tio2 resulted in a compact and uniform tio2 g c3n4 core shell type ii quantum heterojunction which had a higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency for tetracycline degradation compared with the loose and non uniform heterojunction the application of tio2 based heterojunctions for the degradation of ppcps in real environmental applications is mostly restricted due to its poor degradation efficiency in this sub section we have discussed the new approaches adopted by researchers to enhance the photocatalytic degradation efficiency among the 101 001 and 010 facets of anatase tio2 the 001 facet with high surface energy was found to be the most photocatalytically active and is suggested to be a way forward for the development of highly efficient tio2 based heterojunctions for the photocatalytic degradation of ppcps in conjunction with the above strategy the careful selection of synthesis methods governing the structural changes at the junction interface nature of contact interface uniform or non uniform strong or weak and bonding physical or chemical between the semiconductors also plays a very crucial role in the efficiency improvement 4 challenges in practical applications of tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation the improvement in efficiency of the vld tio2 based heterojunctions has reduced the challenges in the photocatalytic degradation of ppcps however their practical application in real environmental conditions is still a challenge in this section we identify the parameters which can affect the practical applicability of the tio2 based heterojunctions in this regard we first discuss the existing practices adopted by researchers followed by possible solutions 4 1 cost reduction the growing demand for efficient degradation of ppcps using tio2 based heterojunctions has compelled us to discuss the treatment cost of the photocatalysis process which ultimately affects its practical application in heterogeneous photocatalysis being a less chemical intensive and efficient process for the degradation of ppcps the treatment cost mainly depends on the synthesis cost of a photocatalyst awfa et al 2018 since the synthesis cost of a heterojunction photocatalyst is a research area largely untouched by researchers discussion on the cost reduction of tio2 based heterojunctions are mostly based on our own laboratory experience the synthesis cost of tio2 based heterojunctions can be reduced either by selecting low cost materials by adopting low cost synthesis methods or by adopting both approaches which reduces the chemical and energy costs involved in the heterojunction synthesis generally for the development of a heterojunction we synthesize its components separately step 1 thereafter we combine them step 2 to form a heterojunction scenario i fig 9 for instance jo and natarajan 2015 developed a z scheme g c3n4 tio2 heterojunction by the wet impregnation method in which g c3n4 and tio2 were synthesized separately and a heterojunction was formed during the wet impregnation which is an additional step briefly in the wet impregnation method tio2 was added to 50 ml of methanol and sonicated for 30 min thereafter the g c3n4 was added to the above suspension and stirred for 24 h and the obtained solid was dried at 75 c for another 12 h to obtain the g c3n4 tio2 heterojunction however by adopting straightforward synthesis methods i e the synthesis of a heterojunction along with the synthesis of its components can save on resources chemicals and energy cost and time scenario ii fig 9 for instance kumar et al 2018 developed a z scheme g c3n4 tio2 heterojunction while synthesizing tio2 by the sol gel method wherein the additional step of wet impregnation as adopted in scenario i is avoided the adoption of a method in which the g c3n4 can be introduced during the hydrolysis of tio2 will save the extra chemical and energy costs involved during wet impregnation the cost reduction approach adopted in scenario ii can also be adopted during formulation of other synthesis methods for the development of heterojunctions which will ultimately reduce their synthesis cost thus the selection of a cost effective method for the synthesis of tio2 based heterojunctions can ultimately reduce the treatment cost which is more favorable for its practical application moreover further reduction in treatment cost can also be achieved by the efficient reuse of the recycled heterojunctions over multiple cycles the challenges related to the recycling of tio2 based heterojunctions are discussed in sub section 4 2 4 2 recycling recycling is one of the major challenges in the practical applicability of a photocatalyst for environmental applications the recycling of a photocatalyst includes its recovery from a suspension solution after application regeneration and further reuse to understand the challenges and developments in the recycling of vld tio2 based heterojunctions various methods employed are summarized in table 3 as shown in table 3 the heterojunctions were either used as a suspension in solution or attached to the support e g clay or zeolite in the solution the heterojunctions attached to the support i e the immobilized heterojunctions were developed to eliminate the need for separation of the heterojunctions from the solution after their use and to reduce the shear stress on the heterojunctions in the solution loeb et al 2018 for the development of immobilized heterojunctions researchers mostly relied on natural porous supports viz clay or zeolite gou et al 2017 li et al 2018 tobajas et al 2017 however the efficiency of immobilized heterojunctions remains a challenge for practical purposes due to the relatively less surface area available for photocatalysis compared to heterojunctions in suspension in the category of heterojunctions used as suspensions in solution the recovery of heterojunctions was performed in two ways viz a recovery using centrifugation ganguly et al 2019 guo et al 2018 or b magnetic recovery kumar et al 2018 ren et al 2019 recovery using centrifugation seems a feasible approach for the recovery of heterojunctions at the lab scale wherein the heterojunctions are recovered from the solution by applying a strong mechanical force however it could be expensive for practical purposes due to the installation of a large capacity centrifuge the magnetic recovery of heterojunctions is possible in the laboratory using a magnetic or electromagnetic system khan et al 2019a kumar et al 2018 ren et al 2019 however the practical application is also a challenge due to the installation of a large electromagnetic system as shown in table 3 the recovery of heterojunctions are performed at the lab scale only and thus pilot scale studies are required to scale up the recovery process for practical application the regeneration of a photocatalyst is one of the major hurdles in practical applicability the successful regeneration of a photocatalyst leads to further reduction in the treatment cost after the photocatalysis of pollutants the active sites responsible for photocatalysis usually become blocked by the degradation products or the constituents of the solution which ultimately results in decreased photocatalytic efficiency in subsequent cycles cai et al 2018b szczepanik 2017 thus in order to maintain a high photocatalytic efficiency in consecutive cycles heterojunctions are subjected to various regeneration methods in general after the recovery of the photocatalysts they are washed with a regeneration solution to clean the pores thereafter in order to maintain the crystallinity of the photocatalysts they are dried using either vacuum or thermal methods the regeneration methods include washing with a regeneration solution viz de ionized di water simsek et al 2018 tobajas et al 2017 organic solvents ethanol methanol etc hou et al 2017 ren et al 2019 and h2o2 gandhi et al 2012 or treatment with gas viz o3 ateia et al 2018 the treatment with h2o2 or o3 appears to be a less feasible regeneration method for practical applications due to the higher cost and the handling also requires a skilled operator thus it is suggested to explore more practical ways to perform the recycling of heterojunctions from the application point of view furthermore treatment with di water or organic solvents appears to be a relatively more feasible option than the treatment with h2o2 or o3 due to the lower cost and the handling does not require an operator with special handling skills however other than handling and cost considerations the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the regenerated heterojunctions also needs to be ascertained after recycling it was found that the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of most of the heterojunctions decreased as given in table 3 the decrement in the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the recycled heterojunctions is found to be in the range of 0 31 6 the washing of heterojunctions with di water alone followed by drying overnight in a temperature range of 60 100 c resulted in 10 16 22 decrease in photocatalytic efficiency however washing with both di water and ethanol methanol followed by drying overnight at 60 c resulted in 0 4 16 decrease in photocatalytic efficiency it means that washing with both di water and ethanol methanol is a more feasible approach than the washing with di water alone which is due to the minor decrement in photocatalytic degradation efficiency therefore washing of tio2 based heterojunctions with both di water and ethanol methanol followed by drying overnight at 60 c appears to be relatively more feasible approach than the other regeneration methods however pilot scale studies are required before assessing its practical application 4 3 stability in practical applications other than the cost effectiveness and recycling of heterojunctions stability also plays an important role nevertheless the stability of a heterojunction is not well defined in the literature therefore the focus of this sub section is to find out the ways through which the stability of a heterojunction is determined the literature survey reveals that the stability of vld tio2 based heterojunction photocatalysts has been expressed in terms of chemical wang et al 2019b photocatalytic natarajan et al 2018 wang et al 2019b photoelectrochemical shi et al 2019 and structural ganguly et al 2019 stability to determine the chemical stability of a heterojunction photocatalyst the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra of pristine and recycled heterojunctions were compared wang et al 2019a the photocatalytic stability was determined by the recycling performance of a photocatalyst natarajan et al 2018 wang et al 2019b wherein the photocatalysts were characterized before and after the recycling employing characterization techniques viz scanning electron microscopy sem wang et al 2019b transmission electron microscopy tem wang et al 2017 high resolution tem hrtem li et al 2018 and x ray diffraction xrd cai et al 2018a guo et al 2018 wang et al 2017 to determine the photocatalytic stability of the magnetic γ fe2o3 ultrathin nanosheets mesoporous black tio2 hollow sphere γ fe2o3 b tio2 heterojunctions a linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and irradiation time fig 10 was established ren et al 2019 the time dependent fluorescence intensity was recorded at 470 nm in which the oh density of the γ fe2o3 b tio2 heterojunction was found to be much higher than that of the α fe2o3 b tio2 heterojunction the photoelectrochemical stability was determined by the transient photocurrent response recorded after various on off cycles shi et al 2019 recorded the photocurrent response for the tio2 mos2 heterojunction decorated on carbon fiber at a potential bias of 0 2 v after turning on the light the current density jumped up to 7 53 10 6 a cm2 and was found to be stable after five on off cycles fig 11 in a very few studies the structural stability was also determined employing a theoretical approach i e the computational method ganguly et al 2019 the computational method was based on density functional theory dft which theoretically determines the electronic and optical properties of the pristine parent components of the heterojunction based on the obtained results from the dft the properties are compared with the findings obtained by the characterization of samples thus the theoretical approach acts as an additional tool to corroborate the experimental findings 4 4 byproducts analysis although mineralization is a unique feature of the photocatalytic process complete mineralization of ppcps by the photo generated e h and ros remains a challenge the incomplete mineralization of ppcps results in the formation of reaction intermediates and byproducts loeb et al 2018 chemical and toxicological studies of these compounds have revealed their toxicity and in some cases they are found to be even more toxic than their parent compounds hodges et al 2018 kanakaraju et al 2015 thus in such precarious scenarios depending on the particular practical application assessment of eco toxicity or human toxicity of these compounds is found to be a necessary step 4 5 evaluation of environmental effectiveness the treatment of ppcps present in water or wastewater is still a challenging task due to the presence of various ions organic matter and their byproducts which affect the performance of heterojunction photocatalysts mostly the performance of tio2 based heterojunctions is tested in ppcp solution prepared in di water which does not mimic the matrix of real water or wastewater samples however very few researchers have successfully targeted the ppcps present in real wwtp effluent kumar et al 2018 developed a g c3n4 tio2 fe3o4 sio2 z scheme heterojunction which was able to degrade 92 of 2 mg l ibuprofen present in real wwtp effluent after 180 min of visible light irradiation similarly an n doped cqds 001 tio2 z scheme heterojunction for the degradation of diclofenac was developed by wang et al 2019a which was able to degrade 84 of 10 mg l diclofenac present in real wwtp effluent a 6 9 decrease in photocatalytic performance of the heterojunction was found in real wwtp effluent as compared to the diclofenac present in the di water however for the purified drinking water samples the photocatalytic performance of the heterojunction is expected to be better compared to the real wwtp effluent due to the presence of relatively low concentration of ions moreover the factors affecting the environmental effectiveness were investigated and it was found that the significant effect was due to the presence of humic acid fung et al 2019 xia and lo 2016 cations fe3 and cu2 wang et al 2019a and anions po4 3 kumar et al 2018 present in the water matrix humic acid is known for its inhibitory effect towards the tio2 wherein the photocatalysis process is inhibited in two ways a by acting as an inner filter and b by scavenging reactive species the humic acid works as an inner filter in the water matrix which filters the light passing through it thereby decreasing the light absorption on the photocatalyst s surface doll and frimmel 2005 xia and lo 2016 humic acid is also known for its role in scavenging the radical species responsible for photocatalysis viz e h o2 and oh and thus ultimately inhibiting the photocatalysis doll and frimmel 2005 lin and lin 2007 wang et al 2019b xia and lo 2016 moreover in the case of composites of tio2 and the graphene family the competitive adsorption between humic acid and graphene is considered as one of the ways of inhibition in the photocatalysis process the interaction of humic acid with graphene is known to be due to a hydrophobic interaction b π π interaction and c hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interaction of available surface functional groups of the graphene viz oh cooh o groups awfa et al 2018 ersan et al 2017 the fe3 and cu2 inhibits the photocatalysis process by acting as an e scavenger thereby inhibiting the generation of o2 wang et al 2019b due to the strong affinity of po4 3 towards the tio2 po4 3 occupies the reactive sites of tio2 by adsorption and also scavenges the powerful oh kanakaraju et al 2015 kudlek et al 2016 therefore the heterojunctions should be developed in such a way so as to target the ppcps in real water or wastewater samples 4 6 reactor design and scale up in practical applications of the photocatalysis process reactor design and scale up are considered to be the research areas where little attention has been paid in the past hodges et al 2018 loeb et al 2018 suspended particle slurry reactors and fixed catalyst reactors are the two main types of reactor design slurry type reactors are designed to enhance the mass transfer between ppcps and the photocatalysts however the separation of photocatalysts is achieved through the membrane filtration which ultimately increases the cost and complexity of the reactor system the limitations of membrane filtration can be addressed by using fixed catalyst reactors however the mass transfer remains a challenge in such reactors due to the reduction in available surface area for photocatalysis because of the anchorage of the photocatalysts to the support media to address the challenges of mass transfer and separation gravity and magnetic separation strategies have been adopted fung et al 2019 hodges et al 2018 khan et al 2019b however such reactors have not been scaled up beyond the bench or conceptual level due to the complexity involved in large scale reactor systems thus reactor design and scale up are research areas where more attention is required in order to achieve the practical applicability of the vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation 5 conclusions and prospects in the past 10 years the merits of vld tio2 based heterojunction photocatalysts over conventional tio2 based photocatalysts for ppcp degradation have attracted great interest among the researchers in the field based on the different band and electronic structures typically heterojunctions can be of three types viz type i straddling gap type ii staggered gap and type iii broken gap heterojunctions in which the type ii heterojunction is proven to be the most effective due to its spatial migration and separation of e and h moreover the further enhancement in photocatalytic efficiency is achieved by developing the non conventional heterojunction photocatalysts viz z scheme p n and schottky heterojunctions among these non conventional heterojunctions schottky and z scheme heterojunctions are found to be more effective for photocatalysis due to their more efficient separation of charge carriers and the occurrence of redox reactions at a relatively higher redox potential however the literature review revealed that further improvement in photocatalytic efficiency can be achieved by 1 selecting the highly photocatalytically active 001 facet of anatase tio2 2 selecting the synthesis methods governing the structural changes at the junction interface which affects the nature of contact interface uniform or non uniform strong or weak and bonding physical or chemical between the semiconductors and 3 selecting heterojunction components which can efficiently generate the powerful oh moreover apart from the efficiency enhancement less attention has been paid to the degradation of ppcps by tio2 based heterojunctions for practical environmental applications the challenges in practical environmental applications are in the following areas 1 cost the material cost is the most important factor in the practical applicability of tio2 based heterojunctions the material cost can be reduced either by selecting low cost components for the heterojunction other than the tio2 by adopting low cost synthesis methods or by adopting both approaches 2 recycling the recycling of heterojunctions includes recovery regeneration and reuse after the application and successful recycling serves as a further cost reduction approach for practical applicability the recovery of heterojunctions is performed in two ways at the lab scale viz a recovery using centrifugation and b magnetic recovery however the practical application is still a challenge due to the high cost and large size of centrifuge and electromagnetic systems thus pilot scale studies are required in order to scale up the recovery process for practical application among the regeneration methods washing of tio2 based heterojunctions with di water and ethanol methanol followed by drying overnight at 60 c appears to be a relatively more feasible approach than the other regeneration methods overall in recycling being the most challenging aspect of photocatalysis towards the practical application more attention is required in future during the formulation of the recycling method to cater for the demands of practical applications the recycling method is recommended as cost effective practically feasible scalable and simple in operation 3 stability the heterojunction s stability is another factor which is essential for the effective performance in the long run it has been shown that the stability of a heterojunction can be expressed as chemical photocatalytic photoelectrochemical and structural stability by using the various characterization spectroscopic and theoretical techniques 4 byproducts analysis chemical and toxicological studies of reaction intermediates and byproducts have revealed their toxicity and in some cases they are found to be even more toxic than their parent compounds thus in such precarious scenarios depending on the particular practical application assessment of eco toxicity or human toxicity of these compounds is found to be a necessary step 5 evaluation of environmental effectiveness the treatment of ppcps present in water or wastewater effluent is still a challenging task due to the presence of various ions organic matter and their byproducts which affect the performance of the heterojunction photocatalysts some researchers have successfully developed vld tio2 based heterojunctions for the degradation of ppcps in real wwtp effluent their investigation revealed a significant effect on photocatalytic efficiency due to the presence of humic acid fung et al 2019 xia and lo 2016 cations fe3 and cu2 wang et al 2019a and anions po4 3 kumar et al 2018 thus it is recommended to develop heterojunctions in such a way as to target the environmental concentration of ppcps in real wwtp effluent by adopting such experimental conditions the real challenges in practical applications will be identified and will be easier to address 6 reactor design and scale up in practical applications of the photocatalysis process reactor design and scale up are considered to be the research areas where little attention has been paid in the past suspended particle slurry reactors and fixed catalyst reactors are the two main types of reactor design however such reactors have not been scaled up beyond the bench or conceptual level due to the complexity involved in large scale reactor systems thus reactor design and scale up are research areas where more attention is required in order to achieve the practical applicability of the vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation therefore it is suggested to design experiments in a specific manner that can address the challenges of practical applications for ppcp degradation finally the rapid evaluation of the factors mentioned above for the application of vld tio2 based heterojunctions for ppcp degradation can play an important role in addressing the challenges declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18243,this study examined the degradation of perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos in an electrochemical system using magnéli phase titanium suboxide ti4o7 as the anode in particular the influence of chloride on the treatment process was examined tests were also conducted with boron doped diamond bdd electrodes for comparison experimental data demonstrated that pfos was effectively degraded by electrochemical oxidation on both bdd and magnéli phase ti4o7 anodes it appeared that pfos degradation occurred via direct electron transfer det in combination with attack by hydroxyl radicals adsorbed on the anode surface ho ads that were formed by anodic oxidation of water the presence of cl inhibited the degradation of the pfos on ti4o7 electrode by suppressing the oxidation of water but accelerated pfos degradation on bdd electrode where the oxidation of cl via det occurred formation of chlorate and perchlorate was slower on ti4o7 than on the bdd anode the mechanisms governing the

used pfaas gallen et al 2017 lindstrom et al 2011 zareitalabad et al 2013 pfos was listed in the international stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants as an annex b substance and pfoa has been named as a candidate under the same framework conder et al 2008 ma et al 2015 conventional treatment technologies and many advanced oxidation processes have been found ineffective to decompose pfaas in particular pfos niu et al 2016 zhuo et al 2012 pfoa can be transformed to shorter chain perfluoroalkyl acids in thermolysis s2o8 2 system sun et al 2016 while reports relating to pfos degradation by advanced oxidation process are limited a few technologies have been reported to degrade pfos such as photo reduction photo oxidation zero valent iron based reduction laccase

suffer various limitations such as harsh treatment conditions high energy consumption and difficulty in scaling up a few studies have demonstrated that electrooxidation eo can mineralize pfos at room

chloride cl is a common anion in natural water whose impact on electrochemical treatment process warrants careful attention radjenovic and sedlak 2015 on one hand cl as an electrolyte may impact anodic potential and thus affect the degradation of organic contaminants on the other hand cl can be oxidized on anode to participate in a series of reactions cl can be converted into reactive chlorine species e g free chlorine and chlorine radicals on anode and further to undesirable chlorate clo3 and perchlorate clo4 which can cause serious health risks to human and animals including

degradation and the formation of chlorate and perchlorate byproducts in solutions containing cl during electrooxidation on magnéli phase ti4o7 anode and compares it to those on bdd anode the findings are relevant in assessing the feasibility of electrochemical degradation of pfas on magnéli phase ti4o7 and bdd anodes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used in the experiments were

plate coated on both sides neocoat switzerland of the same rectangular shape 10 cm 5 cm as the anode two 304 stainless steel plates of the same size were used as the cathode the electrolytic cell was undivided and the two cathodes were placed in parallel to the anode on either side at 2 5 cm gap in each treatment the electrolytic cell contained 200 ml solution containing 2 0 μm pfos and 100 mm na2so4 and or nacl at varying concentrations as supporting electrolytes stirred at 700 rpm the effective electrode surface area submerged in the solution was 78 cm2 a controllable dc power source electro industries inc monticello mn was used to provide electricity at a constant current density of 10 ma cm2 unless specified otherwise the anodic potential was monitored using a chi 660e electrochemical workstation ch instruments inc austin tx with ag agcl reference electrode placed close to the working electrode with the potential drop in solution irs compensated at pre selected time intervals the power source was paused with the solution continuously stirred to ensure homogeneity and then triplicate samples of 0 4 ml each were taken and stored at 4 c for subsequent analysis all experiments were conducted two times or more to ensure consistency and performed at room temperature the solution temperature was monitored and found no obvious change during electrolysis previous studies suggest that anodic polarization with high current density may gradually passivate the ti4o7 electrode surface and decrease its activity geng et al 2015 however no obvious change of degradation rates was observed for replicate experiments conducted before and after the anode was polarized for 12 h under a current density of 20 ma cm 2 in this study fig s2 indicating that passivation was negligible in selected treatments 1 0m meoh or aa was included in the reaction solution as a scavenger of hydroxyl free radicals ho to probe its role in pfos degradation it is known that aa scavenges ho both in bulk solution and bounded on the anode surface because of its neutrophilic π orbitals while meoh only scavenge those in bulk solution barazesh et al 2016 experiments were also performed without applied current as controls to account for any loss of pfos not attributable to electrochemical oxidation e g sorption the steady state concentration of ho ho ss in selected eo systems was quantified using pcba as a probe see text s3 for detail 2 4 quantification of pfas each sample 0 4 ml was mixed with 0 4 ml methanol containing 0 1 μm of m8pfos as the internal standard in 1 5 ml centrifuge tubes centrifuged for 5 min at 7500 rpm and then filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose membranes the concentrations of pfos and other pfaas such as pfoa perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfba and perfluorobutanoic acid pfbs table s1 for a full list were analyzed using a waters acquity uplc system coupled with xevo tqd tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms milford ma with more detail described in supporting information text s4 the standard deviations were usually within 5 10 unless otherwise stated the f in selected samples was quantified using a f selective electrode thermo scientific orion with a reported detection limit of 0 01 mg l by a standard addition method skoog et al 1980 with detail described in text s5 fluoride release ratio fr was calculated using the amount of released fluoride divided by the total fluorine contained in the converted pfos as in the below equation e1 e1 f r c f t c f 0 17 c 0 c t where cf t and cf 0 is the concentration of fluoride ion μm at time t and 0 c0 and ct are the concentrations of pfos μm at time 0 and t respectively and the factor 17 corresponds to the number of fluorine atoms in a pfos molecule the electrical energy required to reduce the concentration of a pollutant by one order of magnitude ee o kwh m 3 was calculated to evaluate the energy efficiency of pfos degradation on ti4o7 and bdd anode by equation e2 e2 e e o u

clo3 and clo4 for selected treatments samples were also collected for determination of free chlorine clo3 and clo4 free chlorine was measured using a method using dpd apha awwa wef 2005 a 2 5 ml aliquot of sample was immediately mixed with 0 25 ml of 8 mm dpd solution dpd is oxidized by free chlorine to show a red color that was measured at 510 nm using a beckman coulter du 800 spectrophotometer brea ca clo3 and clo4 were quantified using the waters acquity uplc ms ms milford ma an acquity uplc beh 1 7 μm c18 column waters milford ma was used for uplc separation the mobile

and clo4 were quantified using multiple reactions monitoring mrm based on the transition m z 83 67 for clo3 and m z 99 83 for clo4 2 6 quantum mechanical simulations density functional theory dft simulations were performed to probe the interactions of cl atom and oh moieties on ti4o7 110 and bdd 001 thus providing insights into the formation of cl and ho radicals on these anodes all calculations were conducted using vienna ab initio simulation package vasp with details given in supporting information text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfos degradation the pfos samples used in this study contains both linear pfos l pfos and branched pfos b pfos with a molar ratio of approximately 16 5 l pfos b pfos as shown in fig 1 a nearly complete removal of both l pfos and b pfos was achieved in 4 h with pfos initial concentration of 20 μm in a 100 mm na2so4 solution with ti4o7 anode no appreciable loss of either species were found in the control experiments without current applied fig s3 thus the removal of pfos was mostly attributed to electrochemical reactions because the degradation behaviors of l pfos and b pfos appeared to be similar our ensuing discussion will be focused on l pfos as the representative the fluoride release ratio fr i e the ratio of fluoride ion recovered to the total fluorine in degraded pfos was over 95 14 in 8 h as shown in fig 1a the used ti4o7 electrodes were characterized by xps to identify f species adsorbed on the surface fig s4 is the xps spectra showing no evident presence of adsorbed f species no shorter chain degradation products could be identified by uplc ms ms these results are similar to our earlier findings in a recent study that no organic fluorine compounds except f could be found during pfos electrooxidation lin et al 2018 eo treatment was also performed with 2 0 μm pfos under different current densities 5 40 ma cm 2 the pseudo first order rate constants were obtained by data fitting based on which the rate constants normalized by the anode surface area k sa and those by the effective electro active surface area k sa were calculated text s7 and shown in fig s5 in relation to the anodic potential measured for each system the pattern of this figure and its comparison to the mass transfer rate constant of pfos calculated from the limiting current density measurement indicates that the eo system was kinetically limited when the current density was below 20 ma cm 2 anodic potential 3 8 v see text s8 for more detail radicals such as ho are usually generated in electrochemical systems meoh which reacts with ho with a second order rate constant of 2 1 109 m 1s 1 gligorovski et al 2015 was applied to determine whether ho was responsible for pfos removal in the electrochemical system it was found that the removal of l pfos pfos initial concentration at 2 0 μm was not affected by the addition of meoh fig s6 this suggests that ho in bulk solution if present did not play an important role in l pfos degradation because meoh only quenches the radicals in bulk solution the degradation was further examined in the presence of aa 1 0 m which quenches ho both in bulk solution and adsorbed on the electrode surface ho ads the results are also shown in fig s6 and the surface area normalized pseudo first order rate constant ksa are displayed in fig 1b as seen in fig 1b the degradation rate of l pfos in the presence of aa reduced significantly the ksa decreased from 1 4 10 4 m s 1 to 2 6 10 5 m s 1 indicating that ho ads was partially responsible for its transformation ho ads is formed when water is oxidized on the anode surface it has been proposed that pfos degradation on ti4o7 anode was caused by a combination of det and ho oxidation on the anode surface lin et al 2018 the mechanism for pfos degradation over ti4o7 ceramic electrode warrants further study lsv performed on 100 mm na2so4 solution containing aa at different scan rate did not exhibit aa current response fig s7 which suggested that det of aa did not occur in the range of the tested electrochemical potential window this confirmed that the inhibited pfos degradation in the presence of aa results mainly from the rapid consumption of ho ads by aa bdd electrode is most widely applied for the degradation of organic pollutants in electrochemical systems degradation of pfos on bdd has also been reported carter and farrell 2008 schaefer et al 2017 zhuo et al 2012 the degradation of pfos on bdd electrode was attributed to det as well carter and farrell 2008 in this study the degradation of pfos on magnéli phase ti4o7 was compared with that on bdd anode by fitting the data with pseudo first order kinetic model the k sa of l pfos on ti4o7 and bdd were determined to be 1 43 10 4 m s 1 and 4 19 10 5 m s 1 respectively at the same current density table 1 the values for b pfos are close to l pfbs for each anode it should be noted that not all commercial and self made bdd electrodes provide the same oxidation efficiency bdd electrodes can be prepared with different structural characteristics by growing diamond films on different substrate materials such as ti si w mo nb and pt via chemical vapor deposition technique garcia segura et al 2015 therefore the si bdd used in this study from neocoat may not necessarily reflect typical oxidation capability of the bdd electrode family the faster degradation of pfos on the ti4o7 ceramic electrode is likely attributed to its unique surface property as a porous material a ti4o7 ceramic electrode offers a greater specific surface area the effective electro active surface area of the electrode was found to be 467 37 cm2 detail in text s2 while its geometric area is 78 cm2 the higher effective electro active surface area would offer more electrocatalytic sites on the electrode surface and thus result in a greater performance the ee o has been calculated using equation e2 for both ti4o7 and bdd anodes based on the pseudo first order rate constants obtained above the estimated energy consumption for removing 90 l pfos on bdd was 19 9 kwh m 3 while that for ti4o7 was 3 6 kwh m 3 at the same current density of 10 ma cm2 3 2 effects of cl on pfos degradation by ti4o7 anode the electrochemical degradation of pfos on ti4o7 was also explored using nacl as the background electrolyte fig 2 a shows the degradation of l pfos at a constant current density of 10 ma cm 2 its degradation in 20 min increased from 85 4 to 98 8 when nacl concentration increased from 20 to 80 mm the values of k sa at varying background nacl concentrations are given in fig 2b the results show that increasing the concentration of cl appeared to have a positive effect on l pfos degradation however the anodic potential decreased with the increase of cl concentration fig 2b for example the k sa of 4 23 10 5 m s 1 and anodic potential of 3 8 v were observed with 20 mm cl the k sa increased to 1 25 10 4 m s 1 and the anodic potential decreased to 3 5 v when cl was elevated to 80 mm the degradation of b pfos in electrochemical oxidation followed a similar trend as the concentration of cl varied fig s8 it is reported that pfos degradation during eo requires both the direct electron transfer det of pfos and the attack of hydroxyl radicals generated by water oxidation lin et al 2018 the decrease in anodic potential in the presence of increasing dosage of chloride could have reduced the det of pfos and the hydroxyl radical generation mostafa et al 2018 and thus led to pfos degradation decrease but it indeed increased these results suggest that cl might facilitate the electrochemical degradation of pfos in certain ways experiments were also performed in 100 mm na2so4 as the background electrolyte with relatively small quantities of cl added the addition of cl altered the conductivity of the solution slightly specifically the conductivity was 16 15 ms cm 1 in the absence of cl while increased to 25 12 ms cm 1 when cl was 50 mm however the anodic potential was relatively constant at the same current density 10 ma cm 2 with cl added fig s9 thus the effects of cl on pfos degradation could be observed at similar anodic potentials fig s10a shows that approximately 99 9 of the l pfos was degraded in 15 min in the absence of cl at the constant current density of 10 ma cm 2 the value decreased to 95 5 and 82 6 when 1 0 mm and 10 mm cl were spiked respectively indicating that cl inhibited the degradation of l pfos however such inhibition mitigated with further increase of cl the degradation of l pfos in 15 min was back to 96 5 when 50 mm cl was spiked the k sa values at varying cl concentrations are reported in fig 3 adding cl did not change the anodic potential significantly fig s9 with the value remaining at approximate 3 6 0 1 v vs she it suggests that the inhibition of l pfos was caused by cl rather than the change of the anodic potential similar effect of cl was also observed in the degradation of b pfos fig s10b the steady state concentration of ho ho ss in the system was probed by pcba which reacts with ho ss at a second order rate constant of 5 2 109 m 1s 1 r1 and e3 peng et al 2016 as reported in fig 3 ho ss concentration of 8 33 10 15 m was observed in the absence of cl the value decreased to 2 47 10 15 and 1 09 10 15 m in the presence of 10 and 50 mm cl respectively because ho ads plays an important role in pfos degradation inhibited degradation of pfos can be explained in part by the decreased steady state concentration of ho ads in the presence of cl r1 ho pcba intermediates k 5 2 10 9 m 1 s 1 e3 k obs pcba pcba k ho pcba pcba ho ss lsv measurement provides more insights into the role of cl in electrooxidation fig 4 a reports the lsv scans of the ti4o7 anode in 100 mm na2so4 solution in the presence of varying cl 0 50 mm the anodic current decreased as the cl concentration increased while the on set potential appeared to shift slightly higher it suggests that cl occupied the reactive sites on the ti4o7 anode surface thus suppressing the oxidation of water mostafa et al 2018 and that cl oxidation due to det on the ti4o7 anode may occur if possible at a higher anodic potential and to a lower extent than water oxidation reduced oxidation of water means reduced generation of ho ads which would reduce pfos degradation in agreement with the data in fig 3 on the other hand cl is known to react with ho rapidly with the bimolecular rate constant as high as 4 3 109 m 1s 1 r2 since both cl and ho ads were present on the anode surface a fraction of ho ads may be consumed by cl which further decreased the concentration of ho ads on the anode surface and thus inhibited the degradation of pfos it should be noted that the reaction between ho ads and cl generates cloh r2 which transforms to cl r3 cl can react immediately with cl yielding cl2 or couple to each other to form free chlorine cl2 hocl r4 r5 and r6 r2 ho cl clho k 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 r3 clho h

shows that the concentration of free chlorine in the electrooxidation system with ti4o7 anode increased continuously and reached 26 01 μm in 6 h chlorine radical species crs are less reactive than ho ads thus allowing for its accumulation to relatively high concentrations this may largely compensate the loss of ho ads and account for the recovered pfos degradation rate in the presence of high concentration of cl fig 3 this also explains the results displayed in fig 2 that pfos degradation rate increased despite the decrease of anodic potential as the cl concentration increased 3 3 effects of cl on pfos degradation on bdd anode the experiment on electrooxidation of pfos with bdd anode in na2so4 solution indicated that the presence of cl facilitated pfos degradation which differs from that on ti4o7 anode as shown in fig 3 l pfos degradation accelerated significantly when cl was included the k sa was 4 19 10 5 m s 1 in the absence of cl and increased to 1 04 10 4 m s 1 in the presence of 10 mm cl with cl concentration further increased such facilitation mitigated when cl was 50 mm the k sa decreased to 3 53 10 5 m s 1 different from the ti4o7 anode the presence of cl changed the anodic potential slightly reducing from 3 5 0 1 v to 3 3 v 0 1 vs she at the constant current density of 10 ma cm 2 fig s9 the decrease of anodic potential may reduce pfos removal but the rate of pfos removal increased after cl was spiked unlike ti4o7 electrode lsv profiles indicated the oxidation of cl via det on bdd a cl oxidation response is evident in fig 4b which increased with the increase of cl concentration inset 1 in fig 4b indicative of a strong cl det on the bdd anode via r7 a linear relationship between the peak currents and cl concentrations was evident inset 2 in fig 4b this differs from ti4o7 electrode but is in accordance with the findings of previous studies on bdd barazesh et al 2016 jung et al 2010 it suggests that cl is preferentially oxidized than water on the bdd direct oxidation of cl on bdd electrode generated cl which also participated in pfos degradation and therefore resulted in higher pfos degradation rate as cl concentration increased however excessive cl may compete with water oxidation and inhibit the generation of ho thus reducing pfos degradation rate in the presence of higher cl concentration such as 50 mm the preferential oxidation of cl would also led to faster generation of free chlorine on bdd than on ti4o7 r8 as the data in fig 5 indicate more free chlorine was generated on bdd than ti4o7 during the first 3 h of electrolysis the concentration increased to a temporal maximum of 8 37 μm at 2 0 h and then decreased as the reaction proceeded which suggests its further oxidation on the bdd anode r9 donaghue and chaplin 2013 r7 s c l k s c l a d s e r8 cl ho h ocl r9 ocl e ho h clo 2 e ho h clo 3 e ho h clo 4 molecular simulation based on density functional theory dft was performed using vasp to specifically probe the interactions of cl atom and oh moieties on ti4o7 110 and bdd 001 thus providing insights into the formation of cl and ho radicals on these anodes the final relaxed bdd 001 and ti4o7 110 surfaces upon the adsorption of cl atom and oh moieties are respectively displayed in figs s11 12 two adsorption locations were considered on the bdd 001 surface whereas one location was addressed on the ti4o7 110 surface table 2 presents the computed adsorption energies of cl and oh adsorbates on ti4o7 110 and bdd 001 surfaces the value of the oh adsorbate on ti4o7 electrode is 5 13 ev considerably lower than those on bdd generally a lower adsorption energy means a higher tendency of desorption to form radicals thus the ho on ti4o7 electrode has a higher reactivity than those on bdd this contributes to the higher pfos removal rate on ti4o7 than on bdd since ho plays an important role on its degradation the data in table 2 also show that the adsorption energy of oh and cl adsorbates are close to each other on ti4o7 110 but on bdd 001 cl adsorbate show significantly lower adsorption energy 4 161 and 3 851 ev than oh adsorbate 7 891 and 8 801 ev this suggests that cl is more easily released than ho on bdd 001 the preferential release of cl on bdd 001 explains its oxidation as indicated by lsv fig 4b the desorbed cl could participate in pfos degradation fig 3 or couple to each other to form free chlorine fig 5 3 4 formation of clo3 and clo4 previous studies have shown that cl can be transformed to clo3 and clo4 in electrooxidation systems lin et al 2016 azizi et al 2011 fig 6 a shows the formation of clo3 and clo4 during degradation of pfos in the presence of 1 mm cl on ti4o7 and bdd anodes clo3 increased first and then decreased as the reaction proceeded while the concentration of clo4 increased continuously in both systems overall the transformation was more rapid on bdd anode as shown in fig 6a clo3 reached its temporal maximum of 427 8 μm in the first 0 5 h and then decreased on bdd anode clo4 concentration increased and reached approximately 1000 μm in 3 0 h formation of clo3 on ti4o7 electrode was slower and reached a temporary maximum of approximate 382 0 μm in 4 0 h and then decreased slowly the formation of clo4 also appeared to be more slowly on ti4o7 electrode taking 25 0 h to reach 950 0 μm previous studies have proposed that clo4 is formed via a multistep pathway r8 and r9 starting with the oxidation of cl to form cl on the anode donaghue and chaplin 2013 jung et al 2010 the lack of det for cl on the ti4o7 anode may have in part led to the slower formation of clo3 and clo4 leaving the formation of cl only via indirect routes r2 and r3 the continuous accumulation of free chlorine fig 5 also suggests it is less readily oxidized in the ti4o7 system via r9 than on the bdd anode the relative slower formation of chlorate and perchlorate on ti4o7 anode than on bdd anode provides the former an advantage in application for eo treatment of wastewater containing persistent organic pollutants like pfos offering more flexibility for identifying treatment conditions that led to contaminant degradation without significant formation of chlorinated byproducts the formation of clo3 and clo4 on ti4o7 anode can be well fitted by the sequential reaction model r10 and e4 assuming steady state attained r10 c l k 1 c l o 3 k 2 c l o 4 e4 c l o 3 k 1 c l 0 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t e k 2 t k 1 and k 2 represent the pseudo first order formation and transformation rate constants of clo3 respectively the values against anodic potential were shown in fig 6b the results showed that the formation rate of clo3 was apparently dependent on the anodic potential as seen in fig 6b k 1 increased from 0 12 to 0 16 h 1 with the anodic potential increasing from 3 1 to 3 9 v and then it increased to 1 05 h 1 as the anodic potential further increased to 4 1 v on ti4o7 anode the k 2 increased gradually to approximately 0 39 h 1 when the anodic potential reached 4 1 v the formation of clo3 is more sensitive to the change of anodic potential than its further transformation although higher anodic potential facilitated pfos degradation on ti4o7 electrode table s2 it also accelerated the formation of clo3 and clo4 in addition higher anodic potential leds to more energy consumption therefore it is of great importance to select a suitable anodic potential for pfos treatment in practical application 4 conclusions the results of this study indicate effective pfos degradation by electrooxidation on both bdd and magnéli phase ti4o7 anode likely via the combination of det and surface absorbed ho oxidation the presence of cl accelerated pfos degradation on bdd anode due to the direct oxidation of cl to generate cl which participated in pfos degradation in contrast the presence of cl inhibited the degradation of the pfos on ti4o7 anode because the oxidation of cl due to det on this electrode was not as effective while cl quenched ho on the electrode surface the presence of cl also led to the formation of free chlorine which further converted to clo3 and clo4 in both bdd and ti4o7 anode systems this transformation process appeared much faster on bdd than ti4o7 anode the slow rates of clo3 and clo4 formation on ti4o7 anode is an advantage for application of this type of anodes overall ti4o7 anode is superior to bdd for the treatment of pfos in environmental matrices containing cl declaration of competing interest a patent application is pending on methods and systems for electrochemical oxidation of polyfluoroalkyl and

18243,this study examined the degradation of perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos in an electrochemical system using magnéli phase titanium suboxide ti4o7 as the anode in particular the influence of chloride on the treatment process was examined tests were also conducted with boron doped diamond bdd electrodes for comparison experimental data demonstrated that pfos was effectively degraded by electrochemical oxidation on both bdd and magnéli phase ti4o7 anodes it appeared that pfos degradation occurred via direct electron transfer det in combination with attack by hydroxyl radicals adsorbed on the anode surface ho ads that were formed by anodic oxidation of water the presence of cl inhibited the degradation of the pfos on ti4o7 electrode by suppressing the oxidation of water but accelerated pfos degradation on bdd electrode where the oxidation of cl via det occurred formation of chlorate and perchlorate was slower on ti4o7 than on the bdd anode the mechanisms governing the behavior of pfos and chloride reactions on bdd and ti4o7 anodes were explored by experiments in combination with density functional theory dft computations keywords perfluorooctanesulfonate

used pfaas gallen et al 2017 lindstrom et al 2011 zareitalabad et al 2013 pfos was listed in the international stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants as an annex b substance and pfoa has been named as a candidate under the same framework conder et al 2008 ma et al 2015 conventional treatment technologies and many advanced oxidation processes have been found ineffective to decompose pfaas in particular pfos niu et al 2016 zhuo et al 2012 pfoa can be transformed to shorter chain perfluoroalkyl acids in thermolysis s2o8 2 system sun et al 2016 while reports relating to pfos degradation by advanced oxidation process are limited a few technologies have been reported to degrade pfos such as photo reduction photo oxidation zero valent iron based reduction laccase

suffer various limitations such as harsh treatment conditions high energy consumption and difficulty in scaling up a few studies have demonstrated that electrooxidation eo can mineralize pfos at room temperature and atmospheric pressure without additional reagents carter and farrell 2008 lin et al 2012 2013 niu et al 2012 schaefer et al 2017 trautmann et al 2015 zhuo et al 2012 the eo process is a

chloride cl is a common anion in natural water whose impact on electrochemical treatment process warrants careful attention radjenovic and sedlak 2015 on one hand cl as an electrolyte may impact anodic potential and thus affect the degradation of organic contaminants on the other hand cl can be oxidized on anode to participate in a series of reactions cl can be converted into reactive chlorine species e g free chlorine and chlorine radicals on anode and further to undesirable chlorate clo3 and perchlorate clo4 which can cause serious health risks to human and animals including disruption of the normal function of the thyroid gland and carcinogenic potential bergmann et al 2014 jung et al 2010 azizi et al 2011 srinivasan and sorial 2009 urbansky 2002 the transformation of cl

polyacrylamide polyvinyl alcohol 95 5 m m to form a slurry that was then spray dried to form ceramic granulates the ceramic granulates were then pressed to make a ceramic preform that was dried and then sintered at 1350 c in a vacuum for 11 h to form a bulk electrode the chemical composition of the magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode was characterized using an x pert pro mrd x ray diffractometer xrd

single junction saturated silver chloride electrode as the reference electrode pine research instruments grove city pa usa all anodic potentials are reported against standard hydrogen electrode she

plate coated on both sides neocoat switzerland of the same rectangular shape 10 cm 5 cm as the anode two 304 stainless steel plates of the same size were used as the cathode the electrolytic cell was undivided and the two cathodes were placed in parallel to the anode on either side at 2 5 cm gap in each treatment the electrolytic cell contained 200 ml solution containing 2 0 μm pfos and 100 mm na2so4 and or nacl at varying concentrations as supporting electrolytes stirred at 700 rpm the effective electrode surface area submerged in the solution was 78 cm2 a controllable dc power source electro industries inc monticello mn was used to provide electricity at a constant current density of 10 ma cm2 unless specified otherwise the anodic potential was monitored using a chi 660e electrochemical workstation ch instruments inc austin tx with ag agcl reference electrode placed close to the working electrode with the potential drop in solution irs compensated at pre selected time intervals the power source was paused with the solution continuously stirred to ensure homogeneity and then triplicate samples of 0 4 ml each were taken and stored at 4 c for subsequent analysis all experiments were conducted two times or more to ensure consistency and performed at room temperature the solution temperature was monitored and found no obvious change during electrolysis previous studies suggest that anodic polarization with high current density may gradually passivate the ti4o7 electrode surface and decrease its activity geng et al 2015 however no obvious change of degradation rates was observed for replicate experiments conducted before and after the anode was polarized for 12 h under a current density of 20 ma cm 2 in this study fig s2 indicating that passivation was negligible in selected treatments 1 0m meoh or aa was included in the reaction solution as a scavenger of hydroxyl free radicals ho to probe its role in pfos degradation it is known that aa scavenges ho both in bulk solution and bounded on the anode surface because of its neutrophilic π orbitals while meoh only scavenge those in bulk solution barazesh et al 2016 experiments were also performed without applied current as controls to account for any loss of pfos not attributable to electrochemical oxidation e g sorption the steady state concentration of ho ho ss in selected eo systems was quantified using pcba as a probe see text s3 for detail 2 4 quantification of pfas each sample 0 4 ml was mixed with 0 4 ml methanol containing 0 1 μm of m8pfos as the internal standard in 1 5 ml centrifuge tubes centrifuged for 5 min at 7500 rpm and then filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose membranes the concentrations of pfos and other pfaas such as pfoa perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfba and perfluorobutanoic acid pfbs table s1 for a full list were analyzed using a waters acquity uplc system coupled with xevo tqd tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms milford ma with more detail

scientific orion with a reported detection limit of 0 01 mg l by a standard addition method skoog et al 1980 with detail described in text s5 fluoride release ratio fr was calculated using the amount of released fluoride divided by the total fluorine contained in the converted pfos as in the below equation e1 e1 f r c f t c f 0 17 c 0 c t where cf t and cf 0 is the concentration of fluoride ion μm at time t and 0 c0 and ct are the concentrations of pfos μm at time 0 and t respectively and the factor 17 corresponds to the number of fluorine atoms in a pfos molecule the electrical energy required to reduce the concentration of a pollutant by one order of magnitude ee o kwh m 3 was calculated to evaluate the energy efficiency of pfos degradation on ti4o7 and bdd anode by equation e2 e2 e e o u

clo3 and clo4 for selected treatments samples were also collected for determination of free chlorine clo3 and clo4 free chlorine was measured using a method using dpd apha awwa wef 2005 a 2 5 ml aliquot of sample was immediately mixed with 0 25 ml of 8 mm dpd solution dpd is oxidized by free chlorine to show a red color that was measured at 510 nm using a beckman coulter du 800

simulations were performed to probe the interactions of cl atom and oh moieties on ti4o7 110 and bdd 001 thus providing insights into the formation of cl and ho radicals on these anodes all calculations were conducted using vienna ab initio simulation package vasp with details given in supporting information text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfos degradation the pfos samples used in this study contains both linear pfos l pfos and branched pfos b pfos with a molar ratio of approximately 16 5 l pfos b pfos as shown in fig 1 a nearly complete removal of both l pfos and b pfos was achieved in 4 h with pfos initial concentration of 20 μm in a 100 mm na2so4 solution with ti4o7 anode no appreciable loss of either species were found in the control experiments without current applied fig s3 thus the removal of pfos was mostly attributed to electrochemical reactions because the degradation behaviors of l pfos and b pfos appeared to be similar our ensuing discussion will be focused on l pfos as the representative the fluoride release ratio fr i e the ratio of fluoride ion recovered to the total fluorine in degraded pfos was over 95 14 in 8 h as shown in fig 1a the used ti4o7 electrodes were characterized by xps to identify f species adsorbed on the surface fig s4 is the xps spectra showing no evident presence of adsorbed f species no shorter chain degradation products could be identified by uplc ms ms these results are similar to our earlier findings in a recent study that no organic fluorine compounds except f could be found during pfos electrooxidation lin et al 2018 eo treatment was also performed with 2 0 μm pfos under different current densities 5 40 ma cm 2 the pseudo first order rate constants were obtained by data fitting based on which the rate constants normalized by the anode surface area k sa and those by the effective electro active surface area k sa were calculated text s7 and shown in fig s5 in relation to the anodic potential measured for each system the pattern of this figure and its comparison to the mass transfer rate constant of pfos calculated from the limiting current density measurement indicates that the eo system was kinetically limited when the current density was below 20 ma cm 2 anodic potential 3 8 v see text s8 for more detail radicals such as ho are usually generated in electrochemical systems meoh which reacts with ho with a second order rate constant of 2 1 109 m 1s 1 gligorovski et al 2015 was applied to determine whether ho was responsible for pfos removal in the electrochemical system it was found that the removal of l pfos pfos initial concentration at 2 0 μm was not affected by the addition of meoh fig s6 this suggests that ho in bulk solution if present did not play an important role in l pfos degradation because meoh only quenches the radicals in bulk solution the degradation was further examined in the presence of aa 1 0 m which quenches ho both in bulk solution and adsorbed on the electrode surface ho ads the results are also shown in fig s6 and the surface area normalized pseudo first order rate constant ksa are displayed in fig 1b as seen in fig 1b the degradation rate of l pfos in the presence of aa reduced significantly the ksa decreased from 1 4 10 4 m s 1 to 2 6 10 5 m s 1 indicating that ho ads was partially responsible for its transformation ho ads is formed when water is oxidized on the anode surface it has been proposed that pfos degradation on ti4o7 anode was caused by a combination of det and ho oxidation on the anode surface lin et al 2018 the mechanism for pfos degradation over ti4o7 ceramic electrode warrants further study lsv performed on 100 mm na2so4 solution containing aa at different scan rate did not exhibit aa current response fig s7 which suggested that det of aa did not occur in the range of the tested electrochemical potential window this confirmed that the inhibited pfos degradation in the presence of aa results mainly from the rapid consumption of ho ads by aa bdd electrode is most widely applied for the degradation of organic pollutants in electrochemical systems degradation of pfos on bdd has also been reported carter and farrell 2008 schaefer et al 2017 zhuo et al 2012 the degradation of pfos on bdd electrode was attributed to det as well carter and farrell 2008 in this study the degradation of pfos on magnéli phase ti4o7 was compared with that on bdd anode by fitting the data with pseudo first order kinetic model the k sa of l pfos on ti4o7 and bdd were determined to be 1 43 10 4 m s 1 and 4 19 10 5 m s 1 respectively at the same current density table 1 the values for b pfos are close to l pfbs for each anode it should be noted that not all commercial and self made bdd electrodes provide the same oxidation efficiency bdd electrodes can be prepared with different structural characteristics by growing diamond films on different substrate materials such as ti si w mo nb and pt via chemical vapor deposition technique garcia segura et al 2015 therefore the si bdd used in this study from neocoat may not necessarily reflect typical oxidation capability of the bdd electrode family the faster degradation of pfos on the ti4o7 ceramic electrode is likely attributed to its unique surface property as a porous material a ti4o7 ceramic electrode offers a greater specific surface area the effective electro active surface area of the electrode was found to be 467 37 cm2 detail in text s2 while its geometric area is 78 cm2 the higher effective electro active surface area would offer more electrocatalytic sites on the electrode surface and thus result in a greater performance the ee o has been calculated using equation e2 for both ti4o7 and bdd anodes based on the pseudo first order rate constants obtained above the estimated energy consumption for removing 90 l pfos on bdd was 19 9 kwh m 3 while that for ti4o7 was 3 6 kwh m 3 at the same current density of 10 ma cm2 3 2 effects of cl on pfos degradation by ti4o7 anode the electrochemical degradation of pfos on ti4o7 was also explored using nacl as the background electrolyte fig 2 a shows the degradation of l pfos at a constant current density of 10 ma cm 2 its degradation in 20 min increased from 85 4 to 98 8 when nacl concentration increased from 20 to 80 mm the values of k sa at varying background nacl concentrations are given in fig 2b the results show that increasing the concentration of cl appeared to have a positive effect on l pfos degradation however the anodic potential decreased with the increase of cl concentration fig 2b for example the k sa of 4 23 10 5 m s 1 and anodic potential of 3 8 v were observed with 20 mm cl the k sa increased to 1 25 10 4 m s 1 and the anodic potential decreased to 3 5 v when cl was elevated to 80 mm the degradation of b pfos in electrochemical oxidation followed a similar trend as the concentration of cl varied fig s8 it is reported that pfos degradation during eo requires both the direct electron transfer det of pfos and the attack of hydroxyl radicals generated by water oxidation lin et al 2018 the decrease in anodic potential in the presence of increasing dosage of chloride could have reduced the det of pfos and the hydroxyl radical generation mostafa et al 2018 and thus led to pfos degradation decrease but it indeed increased these results suggest that cl might facilitate the electrochemical degradation of pfos in certain ways experiments were also performed in 100 mm na2so4 as the background electrolyte with relatively small quantities of cl added the addition of cl altered the conductivity of the solution slightly specifically the conductivity was 16 15 ms cm 1 in the absence of cl while increased to 25 12 ms cm 1 when cl was 50 mm however the anodic potential was relatively constant at the same current density 10 ma cm 2 with cl added fig s9 thus the effects of cl on pfos degradation could be observed at similar anodic potentials fig s10a shows that approximately 99 9 of the l pfos was degraded in 15 min in the absence of cl at the constant current density of 10 ma cm 2 the value decreased to 95 5 and 82 6 when 1 0 mm and 10 mm cl were spiked respectively indicating that cl inhibited the degradation of l pfos however such inhibition mitigated with further increase of cl the degradation of l pfos in 15 min was back to 96 5 when 50 mm cl was spiked the k sa values at varying cl concentrations are reported in fig 3 adding cl did not change the anodic potential significantly fig s9 with the value remaining at approximate 3 6 0 1 v vs she it suggests that the inhibition of l pfos was caused by cl rather than the change of the anodic potential similar effect of cl was also observed in the degradation of b pfos fig s10b the steady state concentration of ho ho ss in the system was probed by pcba which reacts with ho ss at a second order rate constant of 5 2 109 m 1s 1 r1 and e3 peng et al 2016 as reported in fig 3 ho ss concentration of 8 33 10 15 m was observed in the absence of cl the value decreased to 2 47 10 15 and 1 09 10 15 m in the presence of 10 and 50 mm cl respectively because ho ads plays an important role in pfos degradation inhibited degradation of pfos can be explained in part by the decreased steady state concentration of ho ads in the presence of cl r1 ho pcba intermediates k 5 2 10 9 m 1 s 1 e3 k obs pcba pcba k ho pcba pcba ho ss lsv measurement provides more insights into the role of cl in electrooxidation fig 4 a reports the lsv scans of the ti4o7 anode in 100 mm na2so4 solution in the presence of varying cl 0 50 mm the anodic current decreased as the cl concentration increased while the on set potential appeared to shift slightly higher it suggests that cl occupied the reactive sites on the ti4o7 anode surface thus suppressing the oxidation of water mostafa et al 2018 and that cl oxidation due to det on the ti4o7 anode may occur if possible at a higher anodic potential and to a lower extent than water oxidation reduced oxidation of water means reduced generation of ho ads which would reduce pfos degradation in agreement with the data in fig 3 on the other hand cl is known to react with ho rapidly with the bimolecular rate constant as high as 4 3 109 m 1s 1 r2 since both cl and ho ads were present on the anode surface a fraction of ho ads may be consumed by cl which further decreased the concentration of ho ads on the anode surface and thus inhibited the degradation of pfos it should be noted that the reaction between ho ads and cl generates cloh r2 which transforms to cl r3 cl can react immediately with cl yielding cl2 or couple to each other to form free chlorine cl2 hocl r4 r5 and r6 r2 ho cl clho k 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 r3 clho h cl h 2 o k 2 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 r4 cl cl cl 2 k 6 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 r5 cl cl cl 2 k 8 8 10 7 m 1 s 1 r6 cl 2 h 2 o cl hocl h k 15 m 1 s 1 the formation of free chlorine was verified by dpd method fig 5 shows that the concentration of free chlorine in the electrooxidation system with ti4o7 anode increased continuously and reached 26 01 μm in 6 h chlorine radical species crs are less reactive than ho ads thus allowing for its accumulation to relatively high concentrations this may largely compensate the loss of ho ads and account for the recovered pfos degradation rate in the presence of high concentration of cl fig 3 this also explains the results displayed in fig 2 that pfos degradation rate increased despite the decrease of anodic potential as the cl concentration increased 3 3 effects of cl on pfos degradation on bdd anode the experiment on electrooxidation of pfos with bdd anode in na2so4 solution indicated that the presence of cl facilitated pfos degradation which differs from that on ti4o7 anode as shown in fig 3 l pfos degradation accelerated significantly when cl was included the k sa was 4 19 10 5 m s 1 in the absence of cl and increased to 1 04 10 4 m s 1 in the presence of 10 mm cl with cl concentration further increased such facilitation mitigated when cl was 50 mm the k sa decreased to 3 53 10 5 m s 1 different from the ti4o7 anode the presence of cl changed the anodic potential slightly reducing from 3 5 0 1 v to 3 3 v 0 1 vs she at the constant current density of 10 ma cm 2 fig s9 the decrease of anodic potential may reduce pfos removal but the rate of pfos removal increased after cl was spiked unlike ti4o7 electrode lsv profiles indicated the oxidation of cl via det on bdd a cl oxidation response is evident in fig 4b which increased with the increase of cl concentration inset 1 in fig 4b indicative of a strong cl det on the bdd anode via r7 a linear relationship between the peak currents and cl concentrations was evident inset 2 in fig 4b this differs from ti4o7 electrode but is in accordance with the findings of previous studies on bdd barazesh et al 2016 jung et al 2010 it suggests that cl is preferentially oxidized than water on the bdd direct oxidation of cl on bdd electrode generated cl which also participated in pfos degradation and therefore resulted in higher pfos degradation rate as cl concentration increased however excessive cl may compete with water oxidation and inhibit the generation of ho thus reducing pfos degradation rate in the presence of higher cl concentration such as 50 mm the preferential oxidation of cl would also led to faster generation of free chlorine on bdd than on ti4o7 r8 as the data in fig 5 indicate more free chlorine was generated on bdd than ti4o7 during the first 3 h of electrolysis the concentration increased to a temporal maximum of 8 37 μm at 2 0 h and then decreased as the reaction proceeded which suggests its further oxidation on the bdd anode r9 donaghue and chaplin 2013 r7 s c l k s c l a d s e r8 cl ho h ocl r9 ocl e ho h clo 2 e ho h clo 3 e ho h clo 4 molecular simulation based on density functional theory dft was performed using vasp to specifically probe the interactions of cl atom and oh moieties on ti4o7 110 and bdd 001 thus providing insights into the formation of cl and ho radicals on these anodes the final relaxed bdd 001 and ti4o7 110 surfaces upon the adsorption of cl atom and oh moieties are respectively displayed in figs s11 12 two adsorption locations were considered on the bdd 001 surface whereas one location was addressed on the ti4o7 110 surface table 2 presents the computed adsorption energies of cl and oh adsorbates on ti4o7 110 and bdd 001 surfaces the value of the oh adsorbate on ti4o7 electrode is 5 13 ev considerably lower than those on bdd generally a lower adsorption energy means a higher tendency of desorption to form radicals thus the ho on ti4o7 electrode has a higher reactivity than those on bdd this contributes to the higher pfos removal rate on ti4o7 than on bdd since ho plays an important role on its degradation the data in table 2 also show that the adsorption energy of oh and cl adsorbates are close to each other on ti4o7 110 but on bdd 001 cl adsorbate show significantly lower adsorption energy 4 161 and 3 851 ev than oh adsorbate 7 891 and 8 801 ev this suggests that cl is more easily released than ho on bdd 001 the preferential release of cl on bdd 001 explains its oxidation as indicated by lsv fig 4b the desorbed cl could participate in pfos degradation fig 3 or couple to each other to form free chlorine fig 5 3 4 formation of clo3 and clo4 previous studies have shown that cl can be transformed to clo3 and clo4 in electrooxidation systems lin et al 2016 azizi et al 2011 fig 6 a shows the formation of clo3 and clo4 during degradation of pfos in the presence of 1 mm cl on ti4o7 and bdd anodes clo3 increased first and then decreased as the reaction proceeded while the concentration of clo4 increased continuously in both systems overall the transformation was more rapid on bdd anode as shown in fig 6a clo3 reached its temporal maximum of 427 8 μm in the first 0 5 h and then decreased on bdd anode clo4 concentration increased and reached approximately 1000 μm in 3 0 h formation of clo3 on ti4o7 electrode was slower and reached a temporary maximum of approximate 382 0 μm in 4 0 h and then decreased slowly the formation of clo4 also appeared to be more slowly on ti4o7 electrode taking 25 0 h to reach 950 0 μm previous studies have proposed that clo4 is formed via a multistep pathway r8 and r9 starting with the oxidation of cl to form cl on the anode donaghue and chaplin 2013 jung et al 2010 the lack of det for cl on the ti4o7 anode may have in part led to the slower formation of clo3 and clo4 leaving the formation of cl only via indirect routes r2 and r3 the continuous accumulation of free chlorine fig 5 also suggests it is less readily oxidized in the ti4o7 system via r9 than on the bdd anode the relative slower formation of chlorate and perchlorate on ti4o7 anode than on bdd anode provides the former an advantage in application for eo treatment of wastewater containing persistent organic pollutants like pfos offering more flexibility for identifying treatment conditions that led to contaminant degradation without significant formation of chlorinated byproducts the formation of clo3 and clo4 on ti4o7 anode can be well fitted by the sequential reaction model r10 and e4 assuming steady state attained r10 c l k 1 c l o 3 k 2 c l o 4 e4 c l o 3 k 1 c l 0 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t e k 2 t k 1 and k 2 represent the pseudo first order formation and transformation rate constants of clo3 respectively the values against anodic potential were shown in fig 6b the results showed that the formation rate of clo3 was apparently dependent on the anodic potential as seen in fig 6b k 1 increased from 0 12 to 0 16 h 1 with the anodic potential increasing from 3 1 to 3 9 v and then it increased to 1 05 h 1 as the anodic potential further increased to 4 1 v on ti4o7 anode the k 2 increased gradually to approximately 0 39 h 1 when the anodic potential reached 4 1 v the formation of clo3 is more sensitive to the change of anodic potential than its further transformation although higher anodic potential facilitated pfos degradation on ti4o7 electrode table s2 it also accelerated the formation of clo3 and clo4 in addition higher anodic potential leds to more energy consumption therefore it is of great importance to select a suitable anodic potential for pfos treatment in practical application 4 conclusions the results of this study indicate effective pfos degradation by electrooxidation on both bdd and magnéli phase ti4o7 anode likely via the combination of det and surface absorbed ho oxidation the presence of cl accelerated pfos degradation on bdd anode due to the direct oxidation of cl to generate cl which participated in pfos degradation in contrast the presence of cl inhibited the degradation of the pfos on ti4o7 anode because the oxidation of cl due to det on this electrode was not as effective while cl quenched ho on the electrode surface the presence of cl also led to the formation of free chlorine which further converted to clo3 and clo4 in both bdd and ti4o7 anode systems this transformation process appeared much faster on bdd than ti4o7 anode the slow rates of clo3 and clo4 formation on ti4o7 anode is an advantage for application of this type of anodes overall ti4o7 anode is superior to bdd for the treatment of pfos in environmental matrices containing cl declaration of competing interest a patent application is pending on methods and systems for electrochemical oxidation of polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl contaminants 62 377 120 with qh as one of the inventors acknowledgments this research was supported in part by u s department of defense serdp er 2717 and er 1320 lw and jl would like

18244,a modeling framework was developed to evaluate synergistic blending of the waste streams from seawater reverse osmosis ro desalination and wastewater treatment facilities that are co located or in close proximity four scenarios were considered two of which involved blending treated wastewater with the brine resulting from the seawater ro desalination process effectively diluting ro brine prior to discharge one of these scenarios considers the capture of salinity gradient energy the other two scenarios involved blending treated wastewater with the intake seawater to dilute the influent to the ro process one of these scenarios incorporates a low energy osmotic dilution process to provide high quality pre treatment for the wastewater the model framework evaluates required seawater and treated wastewater flowrates discharge flowrates and components boron removal and system energy requirements using data from an existing desalination facility in close proximity to a wastewater treatment facility results showed that the influent blending scenarios scenarios 3 and 4 had several advantages over the brine blending scenarios scenarios 1 and 2 including 1 reduced seawater intake and brine discharge flowrates 2 no need for second pass ro for boron control and 3 reduced energy consumption it should be noted that the framework was developed for use with co located seawater desalination and coastal wastewater reclamation facilities but could be extended for use with desalination and wastewater reclamation facilities in in land locations where disposal of ro concentrate

jones et al 2019 although ro is the most widely adopted commercial seawater desalination technology seawater ro swro has several drawbacks including that it produces a brine stream requires seawater intakes and has high energy requirements global brine production by swro in 2018 was approximately 44 million m3 day or 16 0 billion m3 year jones et al 2019 the discharge of ro brine into ocean environments can have ecosystem impacts because of its high density contaminants can be carried to the ocean floor where benthic organisms may be harmed because there is minimal wave propagation for

maliva 2018 subsurface intakes can be used to mitigate the effects of intake systems on aquatic communities henthome and boysen 2015 because subsurface intakes also provide some pre treatment their use in small systems may be beneficial however for large systems their installation significantly increases capital costs and construction time missimer et al 2013 additionally the ability to install subsurface intakes depends on the presence of proper geology and sediment characteristics such as sand and gravel with sufficiently high porosity and transmissivity missimer and maliva 2018 in addition to these concerns there are also concerns with the high energy requirement of swro although ro is the most energy efficient commercial seawater desalination technology it still requires a relatively high amount of energy to achieve the pressures necessary to overcome the osmotic pressure of seawater elimelech and phillip 2011 lin and elimelech 2015 energy recovery devices erds with

2014 du et al 2015 2016 sassi and mujtaba 2013 1 2 synergistic opportunities in coastal water system swro facilities may be co located with wastewater treatment facilities that also discharge a stream to the ocean currently the only synergistic use of these waste streams is to use the treated wastewater to dilute the swro brine stream prior to discharge fig 1 the 2019 amendment to california ocean plan california environmental protection agency 2019 defines this blending as the preferred technology with the goal being that the resulting blended solution is positively buoyant voutchkov 2011 in this way the supply of treated wastewater could define the amount of seawater that can be desalinated however discharge of treated wastewater to the ocean could be considered a waste of the water resource within this stream instead of using treated wastewater to dilute the ro brine a possible future scenario is to blend the treated wastewater after additional advanced treatment processes with the intake seawater by blending the treated wastewater with the intake seawater upstream of the ro process not only will the swro feed stream be diluted but the swro brine stream will also be more dilute this scenario represents a raw water augmentation approach to direct potable reuse of treated wastewater national water research institute 2018 and has been considered briefly in the literature e g cath et al 2005 hancock et al 2012 2013 linares et al 2016 shaffer et al 2012 the objective of the current study is to evaluate synergistic blending of the waste streams from swro and wastewater treatment facilities four scenarios two discharge blending and two influent blending were considered a modeling framework was developed to evaluate required seawater and treated wastewater flowrates discharge flowrates and components boron removal and system energy requirements the best blending scenarios that meet swro brine discharge requirements were determined 2 material and methods 2 1 system model framework all scenarios were modeled based on a medium size 1 14 104 m3 d 3 million gallons day mgd swro facility the charles e meyer desalination plant santa barbara ca and a 3 03 104 m3 d 8 mgd secondary wastewater treatment facility the el estero wastewater treatment plant santa barbara ca which are 0 2 km apart approximately half of the treated wastewater 1 63 104 m3 d is further treated with tertiary processes to provide non potable reuse water the other half of the treated wastewater 1 40 104 m3 d is used to dilute the brine from the swro facility the blended stream is discharged into a pipeline that extends 2 4 km into the ocean brine discharge regulations that exist around the world range from salinity increments above ambient e g 1 part per thousand ppt to absolute levels e g 40 g l jenkins et al 2012 these limits typically apply at the boundary of a mixing zone that has dimensions on the order of 50 300 m surrounding the discharge jenkins et al 2012 the 2019 amendment to california ocean plan california environmental protection agency 2019 states that discharges to the receiving water body shall not exceed a daily maximum of 2 ppt above the natural background salinity measured no further than 100 m horizontally from the discharge point accordingly the claude bud lewis carlsbad desalination facility in carlsbad ca and a new facility in late stage permitting in huntington beach ca have absolute limits of less than 40 ppt at a compliance point of 305 m 1000 ft from the discharge location california water resources control board 2012 in the current framework the limitation for discharge salinity was set at 40 g l 2 2 overview of scenarios this section provides an overview of the four scenarios considered fig 2 detailed discussion and depiction of the scenarios can be found in supplementary information figs s1 s4 the scenarios included a brine blending scenario blending treated wastewater with ro brine fig 2a a scenario with extraction of salinity gradient energy sge during brine blending fig 2b an influent blending scenario blending treated wastewater with seawater influent to ro fig 2c and a scenario with osmotic dilution as a treatment process during influent blending fig 2d in scenario 1 the baseline scenario treated wastewater is blended with swro brine prior to discharge fig 2a and detailed schematic in fig s1 the objective of this scenario is to use treated wastewater to dilute the ro brine stream to maintain a discharge salinity of 40 g l because the treated wastewater is used only for brine dilution prior to disposal and not for beneficial reuse purposes this scenario does not make full use of the value of the water resource embedded within the treated wastewater in scenario 2 fig 2b and detailed schematic in fig s2 the ro brine stream is used as a draw solution to extract high quality water from the treated wastewater under isobaric conditions the result is a diluted ro brine stream and a concentrated wastewater stream as well as the capture of sge achilli and childress 2010 han et al 2013 she et al 2012 straub et al 2014 achilli et al 2014a b in this study sge capture was modeled using pressure retarded osmosis in pressure retarded osmosis a semi permeable membrane separates the pressurized high salinity draw solution i e the ro brine from the low salinity feed solution i e the treated wastewater through osmosis water permeates from the feed solution to the draw solution against the pressure gradient diluting the ro brine achilli et al 2014a b prante et al 2014 a portion of the chemical potential between the draw solution and the low salinity feed solution is transformed into hydraulic pressure as water is transferred energy is recovered through depressurization plata and childress 2019 the concentrated wastewater stream can then be blended with the diluted ro brine stream that is discharged to the ocean or it can be sent back to the wastewater treatment facility in scenario 3 fig 2c and detailed schematic in fig s3 treated wastewater is blended with the intake seawater creating a diluted feed stream for the ro process this scenario is considered as direct potable reuse since treated wastewater is an influent to the ro process that ultimately produces water for a potable supply linares et al 2016 this scenario is expected to be advantageous over scenarios 1 and 2 because the volume of seawater influent required is reduced this reduction in seawater influent flowrate requirement has direct implications for reduced infrastructure requirements for seawater intake systems additionally the energy requirements for ro decrease as the salinity of the feed solution decreases however this scenario does require additional processes and monitoring to ensure that the water quality of the ro permeate meets potable reuse regulations national water research institute 2018 in scenario 4 fig 2d and detailed schematic in fig s4 the intake seawater is used as a draw solution to extract high quality water from the treated wastewater using osmotic dilution in osmotic dilution the driving force for transport across a forward osmosis membrane is the osmotic pressure difference between the treated wastewater and the seawater cath et al 2006 2010 as in scenario 3 the diluted seawater becomes the influent to the ro process and the concentrated wastewater stream can either be blended with the brine stream that exits the ro process or it can be sent back to the wastewater treatment facility although this process increases system capital and operating costs the additional treatment barrier that it provides may be necessary to achieve regulatory requirements for pathogen removal in addition the forward osmosis process provides a low energy high quality pre treatment process for the treated wastewater hancock et al 2011 morrow and childress 2019 shaffer et al 2012 zou et al 2016 cath and childress 2011 thus scenario 4 is expected to require fewer additional processes than scenario 3 to ensure that the water quality of the ro permeate meets direct potable reuse regulations 2 3 process models each process in the treatment train e g pre treatment reverse osmosis engineered osmosis and post treatment was modeled individually to determine flowrates and energy consumption 2 3 1 pre treatment in the four scenarios uf was used as pre treatment for swro and also as pre treatment for the treated wastewater prior to ro forward osmosis and pressure retarded osmosis the uf process was modeled using dow chemical company s dow wave design software version 1 64 dow chemical company 2019 similar to studies from the literature e g kahler et al 2015 nakatsuka et al 1996 qin et al 2004 a recovery of 90 was assumed for the uf process 100 of the feed water was converted to filtrate however 10 of the filtrate was used to backwash the uf membranes 2 3 2 reverse osmosis the ro process was modeled using both dow wave design software and power model energy recovery inc 2019 because all scenarios incorporated an ro pressure exchanger to reduce energy consumption a px q300 pressure exchanger energy recovery inc san leandro ca was selected because of its high efficiency in scenarios 1 and 2 there is no dilution of the ro influent with treated wastewater so the ro influent consists of 100 seawater in scenarios 3 and 4 when the ro influent is diluted with treated wastewater the ro influent consists of a blend of seawater and treated wastewater hereafter referred to as the sw ww influent ratio for example a 40 60 sw ww influent ratio represents a blend of 40 seawater and 60 treated wastewater as the ro influent the ro recovery rate was set at 50 when the sw ww influent ratio is 100 0 and the ro recovery rate was set at 80 when the sw ww influent ratio is 0 100 these are typical water recovery values for those systems altaee et al 2014 gilron 2014 linares et al 2013 for blended ro influent streams the ro recovery rate r r o is a weighted average between 50 and 80 and calculated according to 1 r ro sw r ro sw ww r ro ww where s w is percentage of seawater in the ro influent r r o s w is ro recovery rate when the ro influent is 100 seawater w w is percentage of treated wastewater in the ro influent and r r o w w is ro recovery rate when the ro influent is 100 treated wastewater based on the ro recovery rate the required ro influent flowrate f ro influent is 2 f ro influent f pw r ro where f p w is ro permeate flowrate f p w is held constant at 1 14 104 m3 d for all scenarios as the sw ww influent ratio decreases i e as the percentage of treated wastewater increases the ro recovery rate increases according to equation 1 and the ro influent flowrate requirement decreases according to equation 2 the ro influent flowrates of seawater and treated wastewater required to achieve the product flowrate of 1 14 104 m3 d are shown in fig 3 a sw ww influent ratio of 100 0 represents seawater desalination only no wastewater reclamation and a sw ww influent ratio of 0 100 represents wastewater reclamation only no seawater desalination 2 3 3 second pass ro for boron removal in the current framework the boron concentration limit is assumed to be 1 mg l second pass ro is deemed necessary when the boron concentration in the ro permeate exceeds this value dow wave design software was used to calculate the energy consumption of full second pass ro and then a linear relationship between energy consumption difference and influent boron concentration from du et al 2015 was used to estimate a value for only partial second pass ro 2 3 4 engineered osmosis forward osmosis and pressure retarded osmosis were modeled using engineered osmosis processes eop solver which is a module scale solver that considers key aspects of spiral wound membrane modules and directly estimates mass transfer and pressure losses in forward osmosis and pressure retarded osmosis in eop the forward osmosis process was operated at a recovery rate of 90 and the pressure retarded osmosis process was operated at a recovery rate of 95 similar recovery rates for forward osmosis and pressure retarded osmosis processes are found in the literature linares et al 2013 tan and ng 2010 2 3 5 post treatment advanced oxidation using uv light coupled with hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 is an industry standard post treatment process in potable reuse applications national water research institute 2018 yin et al 2018 uv h2o2 degrades neutral charged low molecular weight organics that pass through the ro membrane kimura et al 2003 mccurry et al 2017 a uv dose of at least 300 mj cm2 is necessary for 6 log removal of all known pathogens national water research institute 2018 and a uv dose of 900 mj cm2 is used to destroy disinfection by products such as n nitroso dimethylamine gerrity et al 2015 in the current study uv h2o2 was modeled as a post treatment process for the ro permeate in the influent blending scenarios scenarios 3 and 4 with the dose varying between 300 and 900 mj cm2 depending on the sw ww influent ratio 2 4 estimation of energy consumption for each scenario specific energy consumption sec and specific energy savings ses were calculated for the individual processes sec values for ro se c ro and uf se c uf were calculated using dow wave design software and sec values for forward osmosis se c fo were calculated using eop solver sec values for uv h2o2 se c uv aop were estimated based on the literature e g holloway et al 2016 tang et al 2018

u f f i l t r a t e f u f f i l t r a t e f p w where s e c u f f i l t r a t e is the energy consumption of the uf process per cubic meter of uf filtrate and f u f f i l t r a t e is uf filtrate flowrate 3 results and discussion 3 1 ro brine salinity the ro brine salinity for each sw ww influent ratio is shown in fig 4 ro brine salinity decreases as the sw ww influent ratio decreases because the salinity of the treated wastewater 0 6 g l is much less than that of seawater 35 g l the horizontal line in fig 4 indicates the limitation for discharge salinity 40 g l set in the current study it can be seen that to maintain a discharge salinity of 40 g l without discharge dilution the sw ww influent ratio must be 30 70 or less at sw ww influent ratios from 100 0 to 40 60 discharge dilution is necessary alongside influent dilution 3 2 treated wastewater flowrates in hybrid systems the data in fig 5 show treated wastewater flowrates required to meet the limitation for discharge salinity because there is no influent dilution in scenarios 1 and 2 these scenarios are represented only by the 100 0 sw ww influent ratio fig 5a in scenarios 1 and 2 to maintain a discharge salinity of 40 g l 8 19 103 m3 d of treated wastewater must be blended with the ro brine in scenario 3 fig 5b there is no data point for sw ww influent ratio 100 0 because the case of no influent dilution is already represented by scenario 1 as the sw ww influent ratio decreases the treated wastewater flowrate requirement increases at sw ww influent ratios greater than 40 60 some treated wastewater is used for influent dilution and some for discharge dilution for example when the sw ww influent ratio is 50 50 even when the seawater influent is diluted by 50 with treated wastewater the ro brine still requires dilution to achieve 40 g l or less according to equation 1 the ro recovery rate is 65 not 50 thus the ro brine salinity prior to effluent dilution is 50 g l not 40 g l fig 4 at influent ratios of 40 60 and less discharge dilution is no longer needed to maintain a discharge salinity of 40 g l this is important because when treated wastewater is used for influent dilution the value of the water resource is fully realized when treated wastewater is used for discharge dilution much of the value in the water resource is lost at sw ww influent ratios of 10 90 and less achieving the desired product water flowrate of 1 14 104 m3 d requires more treated wastewater than is available thus scenario 3 is not feasible at sw ww influent ratios less than or equal to 10 90 in scenario 4 fig 5c osmotic dilution is used to achieve influent dilution and pre treatment for the ro process there are no data points for sw ww influent ratios less than or equal to 30 70 because the seawater flowrates for these ratios are too low to extract wastewater through the forward osmosis process similar to scenario 3 fig 5b as the sw ww influent ratio decreases the treated wastewater flowrate requirement increases comparing the treated wastewater flowrate requirements for scenarios 3 and 4 for sw ww influent ratios from 90 10 to 60 40 the total treated wastewater flowrates for scenarios 3 and 4 are exactly the same even though the forward osmosis process has a recovery rate of 90 this is because all forward osmosis concentrate is used for discharge dilution at the sw ww influent ratio of 50 50 scenario 4 requires 5 more treated wastewater than scenario 3 because only a portion of the forward osmosis concentrate is needed for discharge dilution i e the forward osmosis concentrate flowrate exceeds the flowrate needed for discharge dilution at the sw ww influent ratio of 40 60 scenario 4 requires 10 more treated wastewater than scenario 3 because no treated wastewater is needed for discharge dilution if the goal is to operate a swro facility that meets a 40 g l limitation for discharge salinity and does not waste the water resource in the treated wastewater i e all treated wastewater is used for influent dilution then scenarios 3 and 4 would be operated at sw ww influent ratios of 40 60 and 50 50 at these blending ratios no discharge dilution is needed thus a sw ww influent ratio of 40 60 in scenario 3 and a sw ww influent ratio of 50 50 in scenario 4 were selected to represent scenarios 3 and 4 in later discussion 3 3 discharge flowrates in hybrid systems discharge flowrates are depicted in fig 6 the total discharge flowrates are similar in magnitude for each sw ww influent ratio regardless of scenario but the total discharge flowrates decrease substantially with decreasing sw ww influent ratio in scenarios 1 and 2 the combined flowrates of uf retentate treated wastewater and pressure retarded osmosis concentrate scenario 2 only are almost equal to the flowrate of ro brine in scenario 3 at sw ww influent ratios greater than 40 60 uf retentate alone is not enough to dilute the ro brine to 40 g l thus treated wastewater is also required at sw ww influent ratios less than or equal to 40 60 uf retentate alone is enough to dilute the ro brine in scenario 4 forward osmosis concentrate is also used for discharge dilution similar to scenario 3 at sw ww influent ratios less than or equal to 50 50 uf retentate and forward osmosis concentrate are enough to dilute the ro brine and no additional treated wastewater is required in scenarios 3 and 4 at lower sw ww influent ratios where discharge dilution is not necessary the less uf retentate and less forward osmosis concentrate the less wasted discharge thus at these conditions operation at higher uf and forward osmosis recovery rates would be preferred 3 4 boron concentration in ro permeate from fig s5 in supplementary information the concentration of boron in the ro permeate decreases from 1 32 to 0 24 mg l as sw ww influent ratio decreases from 100 0 to 0 100 at sw ww influent ratios greater than 60 40 because the boron concentration exceeds 1 0 mg l partial second pass ro was added to the model the resulting increase in energy consumption is discussed in the next section for sw ww influent ratios of 60 40 or less additional treatment is not required to reduce the boron concentration 3 5 specific energy consumption and specific energy savings in hybrid systems 3 5 1 specific energy consumption of ro the ro sec values for each sw ww influent ratio are shown in fig 7 for sw ww influent ratios greater than 60 40 when partial second pass ro pass 2 is required the ro sec increases by 34 specifically due to the second pass for influent ratios of 60 40 and less because second pass ro is not required to reduce the boron concentration there are no pass 2 energy requirements 3 5 2 energy consumption of pre treatment and post treatment uf is used for pre treating seawater in all scenarios and for pre treating treated wastewater in scenarios 3 and 4 the uf sec decreases as the sw ww influent ratio decreases from 100 0 to 0 100 fig s6 in supplementary information this decrease is not because the uf sec for pre treatment of seawater is higher than that of treated wastewater in fact they are assumed to be the same both are 0 07 kw h m3 instead total uf sec decreases because a higher ro recovery rate can be used when the seawater is diluted with treated wastewater fig 3 so the uf influent flowrate is reduced uv h2o2 is modeled as a post treatment process for the ro permeate in scenarios 3 and 4 the uv dose increases linearly from 300 to 900 mj cm2 with decreasing sw ww influent ratio table s1 in supplementary information in scenario 3 the uv sec increases from 0 04 to 0 13 kw h m3 pertaining to scenario 4 it has been demonstrated in previous studies that forward osmosis rejection is greater than 40 for tested organic compounds in bench scale experiments and greater than 60 for tested organic compounds in pilot scale experiments hancock et al 2011 based on this rejection of organic compounds by forward osmosis in this study is assumed to be 50 thus with the additional barrier provided by osmotic dilution in scenario 4 the uv dose is set to range from 300 to 450 mj cm2 only table s1 in supplementary information over this range the uv sec increases from 0 04 to 0 06 kw h m3 3 5 3 integration into system scale model net sec values calculated from equations 3 6 are shown in fig 8 in scenario 1 the baseline scenario the net sec is 3 5 kw h m3 this overall energy consumption is approximately two times the theoretical minimum energy of ro 1 8 kw h m3 elimelech and phillip 2011 due to the need for partial second pass ro uf and uv h2o2 processes in scenario 2 the net sec is 0 42 kw h m3 less than that in scenario 1 due to energy recovery by pressure retarded osmosis based on the available flowrates and concentrations of the ro brine and treated wastewater streams 0 60 kw h m3 of specific energy is theoretically available for the pressure retarded osmosis system to recover yip and elimelech 2012 the difference between the theoretical thermodynamic potential and the modeled result 30 or 0 18 kw h m3 is due to unutilized energy and friction losses o toole et al 2016 in scenario 3 as the sw ww influent ratio decreases from 90 10 to 0 100 the net sec decreases from 3 4 to 0 6 kw h m3 the sw ww influent ratio of 0 100 in scenario 3 represents the condition where the ro influent consists of 100 treated wastewater in this case the energy consumption is 0 6 kw h m3 which is lower than the energy consumption values for the blended ro influents however as can be seen in fig 5b the available treated wastewater flowrate is not sufficient to achieve the desired product water flowrates which would necessitate use of a blended influent in scenario 4 the net sec values are slightly less than those in scenario 3 due to the lower uv doses required in scenario 4 all in all decreasing the percentage of seawater has a much greater effect on decreasing net sec than the choice of scenario 3 5 4 composition of net sec the data in fig 9 show the sec percentages for each process in scenario 1 fig 9a the ro and uf contributions to net sec are 95 9 and 4 1 in scenario 2 the ro contribution decreases to 93 9 because the pressure retarded osmosis sub system reduces the overall sec by recovering sge from blending the ro brine with the treated wastewater in addition in scenario 2 the uf contribution to net sec increases to 6 1 because scenario 2 replaces the direct blending in scenario 1 with a pressure retarded osmosis process which requires uf as pre treatment in scenario 3 as the sw ww influent ratio decreases from 90 10 to 0 100 and the percentage of treated wastewater increases the ro contribution to net sec decreases and the contributions of uf and uv h2o2 increase in scenario 4 the uf contribution to net sec is slightly higher than scenario 3 because scenario 4 replaces the direct blending in scenario 3 with forward osmosis that is operated at 90 recovery thus compared to scenario 3 more treated wastewater needs to be pre treated by uf prior to the forward osmosis process in scenario 4 the contribution of uv h2o2 to net sec in scenario 4 is 29 lower than it is in scenario 3 on average because the additional barrier provided by osmotic dilution reduces the uv dose requirement also considering that the additional wastewater foulants in the ro influent are being rejected at higher pressure than are typically used in ro for wastewater reuse the high quality pre treatment offered by forward osmosis in scenario 4 may be valuable in addition forward osmosis only contributes negligibly less than 0 5 to the sec 3 5 5 specific energy comparison for select conditions of four scenarios energy consumptions in all scenarios are depicted in fig 10 sec values for all processes are shown above the x axis and ses values are shown below the x axis also shown for each scenario is the net sec the sum of sec values minus the sum of ses values as mentioned in section 3 2 for scenarios 3 and 4 40 60 and 50 50 are selected to compare with scenarios 1 and 2 because they represent conditions that meet the limitation for discharge salinity but do not waste the water resources in the treated wastewater i e all treated wastewater is used for influent dilution in scenarios 1 and 2 the ro sec is greater than in scenarios 3 and 4 because with no influent dilution the ro operates at higher pressure in first pass ro and also second pass ro is required for boron control in scenario 4 forward osmosis provides a highly selective pre treatment with only 11 increase in sec when compared to scenario 3 3 6 summary for select conditions of four scenarios the data in fig 11 shows the seawater intake flowrates treated wastewater flowrates discharge flowrates and secs for the selected sw ww influent ratio conditions it is important to note that the product water flowrate is constant across all scenarios compared to scenarios 1 and 2 without influent dilution seawater influent flowrates discharge flowrates and net secs in scenarios 3 and 4 are approximately 66 63 and 42 lower the reason is that when treated wastewater is used for influent dilution rather than discharge dilution a larger fraction of treated wastewater can be recovered as product water in addition the treated wastewater flowrates in scenarios 3 and 4 are 34 higher than that of scenarios 1 and 2 but not as much as double mainly because the reduced influent salinity of ro in scenarios 3 and 4 allows greater ro recovery in scenario 2 the pressure retarded osmosis subsystem reduces energy consumption without requiring additional treated wastewater 3 7 concerns for application of blending scenarios comparing the brine blending scenarios scenarios 1 and 2 with the influent blending scenarios scenarios 3 and 4 there will be increased likelihood of fouling and in particular biological fouling or biofouling on the ro membrane in scenarios 3 and 4 considering this scenario 4 may have a better lifecycle outlook as the forward osmosis process provides additional pretreatment to the treated wastewater by removing most of the dissolved and colloidal carbon species that are typically only marginally removed by a uf membrane fan et al 2008 morrow et al 2018 with regard to ro membrane and module selection for scenarios 3 and 4 although feed channel spacers are necessary to create turbulence and alleviate concentration polarization which can ultimately lead to increased salt passage through the membrane biofouling of the spacers may be problematic module feed spacers that minimize biofouling linares et al 2014 matin et al 2011 siddiqui et al 2017 and associated pressure drop in the feed channels siddiqui et al 2017 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 are desirable 4 conclusion and implication given the multiple benefits of the influent blending scenarios scenarios 3 and 4 including that 1 seawater intake and discharge requirements are reduced 2 second pass ro for boron control is no longer required 3 energy consumption is reduced 4 seawater and treated wastewater constituents in the brine to be disposed are diluted 5 land footprint is saved and 6 pumping volumes are saved the advantages of these scenarios are clear even though sge recovered in scenario 2 decreases the overall energy consumption the saving is not as significant as the ro energy savings that occur at lower seawater percentages in the influent blending scenarios scenarios 3 and 4 beyond the framework technical and societal challenges associated with direct potable reuse must be considered with consideration of developing regulatory requirements for potable reuse national water research institute 2018 california state water resources control board 2019 the benefits of osmotic dilution over other advanced processes must be considered if real time membrane failure detection is available for forward osmosis desormeaux 2017 the ability to achieve additional log removal value credits would provide significant value although the framework was developed for use with co located seawater desalination and coastal wastewater reclamation facilities its use can be extended to co located or close proximity desalination and wastewater reclamation facilities in in land locations at these facilities disposal of ro concentrate is an equally serious concern considering the large number of seawater and brackish water ro facilities that are in planning construction and operation in the us west and other arid regions of the world the developed framework could have a broad reach

18244,a modeling framework was developed to evaluate synergistic blending of the waste streams from seawater reverse osmosis ro desalination and wastewater treatment facilities that are co located or in close proximity four scenarios were considered two of which involved blending treated wastewater with the brine resulting from the seawater ro desalination process effectively diluting ro brine prior to discharge one of these scenarios considers the capture of salinity gradient energy the other two scenarios involved blending treated wastewater with the intake seawater to dilute the influent to the ro process one of these scenarios incorporates a low energy osmotic dilution process to provide high quality pre treatment for the wastewater the model framework evaluates required seawater and treated wastewater flowrates discharge flowrates and components boron removal and system energy requirements using data from an existing desalination facility in close proximity to a wastewater treatment facility results showed that the influent blending scenarios scenarios 3 and 4 had several advantages over the brine blending scenarios scenarios 1 and 2 including 1 reduced seawater intake and brine discharge flowrates 2 no need for second pass ro for boron control and 3 reduced energy consumption it should be noted that the framework was developed for use with co located seawater desalination and coastal wastewater reclamation facilities but could be extended for use with desalination and wastewater reclamation facilities in in land locations where disposal of ro concentrate is a serious concern graphical abstract image 1 keywords seawater desalination wastewater reclamation modeling framework energy requirements membrane processes reverse osmosis 1 introduction and background 1 1 seawater reverse osmosis desalination as of 2018 there were 5328 operational seawater desalination plants with a total global desalination capacity of approximately 58 million m3 day jones et al 2019 of the seawater desalination technologies reverse osmosis ro is the most dominant process amy et al 2017 greenlee et al 2009 producing 56 of the global seawater desalination product jones et al 2019 although ro is the most widely adopted commercial seawater desalination technology seawater ro swro has several drawbacks including that it produces a brine stream requires seawater intakes and has high energy requirements global brine production by swro in 2018 was approximately 44 million m3 day or 16 0 billion m3 year jones et al 2019 the discharge of ro brine into ocean environments can have ecosystem impacts because of its high density contaminants can be carried to the ocean floor where benthic organisms may be harmed because there is minimal wave propagation for mixing and dilution tularam and ilahee 2007 in some countries e g usa australia japan uae and oman dilution and or diffusers are required prior to during discharge of ro brine to the ocean jenkins et al 2012 to reduce and attenuate brine concentration rodman et al 2018 entrainment and impingement of marine organisms by seawater intake systems is also a major environmental concern missimer and maliva 2018 subsurface intakes can be used to mitigate the effects of intake systems on aquatic communities henthome and boysen 2015 because subsurface intakes also provide some pre treatment their use in small systems may be beneficial however for large systems their installation significantly increases capital costs and construction time missimer et al 2013 additionally the ability to install subsurface intakes depends on the presence of proper geology and sediment characteristics such as sand and gravel with sufficiently high porosity and transmissivity missimer and maliva 2018 in addition to these concerns there are also concerns with the high energy requirement of swro although ro is the most energy efficient commercial seawater desalination technology it still requires a relatively high amount of energy to achieve the pressures necessary to overcome the osmotic pressure of seawater elimelech and phillip 2011 lin and elimelech 2015 energy recovery devices erds with efficiencies greater than 95 are commonplace and reduce energy consumption by as much as 60 penate and garcia rodriguez 2011 with erds current state of the art swro facilities consume between 3 and 3 5 kw h m3 ng et al 2015 if second pass ro is required for boron removal energy consumption increases further typically boron concentrations in seawater are approximately 4 6 mg l park et al 2012 and swro only rejects approximately 83 92 shultz and freger 2018 us states such as california and florida and countries such as israel saudi arabia and japan have regulations or guidelines for maximum boron levels ranging from 0 4 to 1 mg l for example the california state notification level is 1 mg l thus second pass ro for all or part of first pass product water may be required alnouri and linke 2014 du et al 2015 2016 sassi and mujtaba 2013 1 2 synergistic opportunities in coastal water system swro facilities may be co located with wastewater treatment facilities that also discharge a stream to the ocean currently the only synergistic use of these waste streams is to use the treated wastewater to dilute the swro brine stream prior to discharge fig 1 the 2019 amendment to california ocean plan california environmental protection agency 2019 defines this blending as the preferred technology with the goal being that the resulting blended solution is positively buoyant voutchkov 2011 in this way the supply of treated wastewater could define the amount of seawater that can be desalinated however discharge of treated wastewater to the ocean could be considered a waste of the water resource within this stream instead of using treated wastewater to dilute the ro brine a possible future scenario is to blend the treated wastewater after additional advanced treatment processes with the intake seawater by blending the treated wastewater with the intake seawater upstream of the ro process not only will the swro feed stream be diluted but the swro brine stream will also be more dilute this scenario represents a raw water augmentation approach to direct potable reuse of treated wastewater national water research institute 2018 and has been considered briefly in the literature e g cath et al 2005 hancock et al 2012 2013 linares et al 2016 shaffer et al 2012 the objective of the current study is to evaluate synergistic blending of the waste streams from swro and wastewater treatment facilities four scenarios two discharge blending and two influent blending were considered a modeling framework was developed to evaluate required seawater and treated wastewater flowrates discharge flowrates and components boron removal and system energy requirements the best blending scenarios that meet swro brine discharge requirements were determined 2 material and methods 2 1 system model framework all scenarios were modeled based on a medium size 1 14 104 m3 d 3 million gallons day mgd swro facility the charles e meyer desalination plant santa barbara ca and a 3 03 104 m3 d 8 mgd secondary wastewater treatment facility the el estero wastewater treatment plant santa barbara ca which are 0 2 km apart approximately half of the treated wastewater 1 63 104 m3 d is further treated with tertiary processes to provide non potable reuse water the other half of the treated wastewater 1 40 104 m3 d is used to dilute the brine from the swro facility the blended stream is discharged into a pipeline that extends 2 4 km into the ocean brine discharge regulations that exist around the world range from salinity increments above ambient e g 1 part per thousand ppt to absolute levels e g 40 g l jenkins et al 2012 these limits typically apply at the boundary of a mixing zone that has dimensions on the order of 50 300 m surrounding the discharge jenkins et al 2012 the 2019 amendment to california ocean plan california environmental protection agency 2019 states that discharges to the receiving water body shall not exceed a daily maximum of 2 ppt above the natural background salinity measured no further than 100 m horizontally from the discharge point accordingly the claude bud lewis carlsbad desalination facility in carlsbad ca and a new facility in late stage permitting in huntington beach ca have absolute limits of less than 40 ppt at a compliance point of 305 m 1000 ft from the discharge location california water resources control board 2012 in the current framework the limitation for discharge salinity was set at 40 g l 2 2 overview of scenarios this section provides an overview of the four scenarios considered fig 2 detailed discussion and depiction of the scenarios can be found in supplementary information figs s1 s4 the scenarios included a brine blending scenario blending treated wastewater with ro brine fig 2a a scenario with extraction of salinity gradient energy sge during brine blending fig 2b an influent blending scenario blending treated wastewater with seawater influent to ro fig 2c and a scenario with osmotic dilution as a treatment process during influent blending fig 2d in scenario 1 the baseline scenario treated wastewater is blended with swro brine prior to discharge fig 2a and detailed schematic in fig s1 the objective of this scenario is to use treated wastewater to dilute the ro brine stream to maintain a discharge salinity of 40 g l because the treated wastewater is used only for brine dilution prior to disposal and not for beneficial reuse purposes this scenario does not make full use of the value of the water resource embedded within the treated wastewater in scenario 2 fig 2b and detailed schematic in fig s2 the ro brine stream is used as a draw solution to extract high quality water from the treated wastewater under isobaric conditions the result is a diluted ro brine stream and a concentrated wastewater stream as well as the capture of sge achilli and childress 2010 han et al 2013 she et al 2012 straub et al 2014 achilli et al 2014a b in this study sge capture was modeled using pressure retarded osmosis in pressure retarded osmosis a semi permeable membrane separates the pressurized high salinity draw solution i e the ro brine from the low salinity feed solution i e the treated wastewater through osmosis water permeates from the feed solution to the draw solution against the pressure gradient diluting the ro brine achilli et al 2014a b prante et al 2014 a portion of the chemical potential between the draw solution and the low salinity feed solution is transformed into hydraulic pressure as water is transferred energy is recovered through depressurization plata and childress 2019 the concentrated wastewater stream can then be blended with the diluted ro brine stream that is discharged to the ocean or it can be sent back to the wastewater treatment facility in scenario 3 fig 2c and detailed schematic in fig s3 treated wastewater is blended with the intake seawater creating a diluted feed stream for the ro process this scenario is considered as direct potable reuse since treated wastewater is an influent to the ro process that ultimately produces water for a potable supply linares et al 2016 this scenario is expected to be advantageous over scenarios 1 and 2 because the volume of seawater influent required is reduced this reduction in seawater influent flowrate requirement has direct implications for reduced infrastructure requirements for seawater intake systems additionally the energy requirements for ro decrease as the salinity of the feed solution decreases however this scenario does require additional processes and monitoring to ensure that the water quality of the ro permeate meets potable reuse regulations national water research institute 2018 in scenario 4 fig 2d and detailed schematic in fig s4 the intake seawater is used as a draw solution to extract high quality water from the treated wastewater using osmotic dilution in osmotic dilution the driving force for transport across a forward osmosis membrane is the osmotic pressure difference between the treated wastewater and the seawater cath et al 2006 2010 as in scenario 3 the diluted seawater becomes the influent to the ro process and the concentrated wastewater stream can either be blended with the brine stream that exits the ro process or it can be sent back to the wastewater treatment facility although this process increases system capital and operating costs the additional treatment barrier that it provides may be necessary to achieve regulatory requirements for pathogen removal in addition the forward osmosis process provides a low energy high quality pre treatment process for the treated wastewater hancock et al 2011 morrow and childress 2019 shaffer et al 2012 zou et al 2016 cath and childress 2011 thus scenario 4 is expected to require fewer additional processes than scenario 3 to ensure that the water quality of the ro permeate meets direct potable reuse regulations 2 3 process models each process in the treatment train e g pre treatment reverse osmosis engineered osmosis and post treatment was modeled individually to determine flowrates and energy consumption 2 3 1 pre treatment in the four scenarios uf was used as pre treatment for swro and also as pre treatment for the treated wastewater prior to ro forward osmosis and pressure retarded osmosis the uf process was modeled using dow chemical company s dow wave design software version 1 64 dow chemical company 2019 similar to studies from the literature e g kahler et al 2015 nakatsuka et al 1996 qin et al 2004 a recovery of 90 was assumed for the uf process 100 of the feed water was converted to filtrate however 10 of the filtrate was used to backwash the uf membranes 2 3 2 reverse osmosis the ro process was modeled using both dow wave design software and power model energy recovery inc 2019 because all scenarios incorporated an ro pressure exchanger to reduce energy consumption a px q300 pressure exchanger energy recovery inc san leandro ca was selected because of its high efficiency in scenarios 1 and 2 there is no dilution of the ro influent with treated wastewater so the ro influent consists of 100 seawater in scenarios 3 and 4 when the ro influent is diluted with treated wastewater the ro influent consists of a blend of seawater and treated wastewater hereafter referred to as the sw ww influent ratio for example a 40 60 sw ww influent ratio represents a blend of 40 seawater and 60 treated wastewater as the ro influent the ro recovery rate was set at 50 when the sw ww influent ratio is 100 0 and the ro recovery rate was set at 80 when the sw ww influent ratio is 0 100 these are typical water recovery values for those systems altaee et al 2014 gilron 2014 linares et al 2013 for blended ro influent streams the ro recovery rate r r o is a weighted average between 50 and 80 and calculated according to 1 r ro sw r ro sw ww r ro ww where s w is percentage of seawater in the ro influent r r o s w is ro recovery rate when the ro influent is 100 seawater w w is percentage of treated wastewater in the ro influent and r r o w w is ro recovery rate when the ro influent is 100 treated wastewater based on the ro recovery rate the required ro influent flowrate f ro influent is 2 f ro influent f pw r ro where f p w is ro permeate flowrate f p w is held constant at 1 14 104 m3 d for all scenarios as the sw ww influent ratio decreases i e as the percentage of treated wastewater increases the ro recovery rate increases according to equation 1 and the ro influent flowrate requirement decreases according to equation 2 the ro influent flowrates of seawater and treated wastewater required to achieve the product flowrate of 1 14 104 m3 d are shown in fig 3 a sw ww influent ratio of 100 0 represents seawater desalination only no wastewater reclamation and a sw ww influent ratio of 0 100 represents wastewater reclamation only no seawater desalination 2 3 3 second pass ro for boron removal in the current framework the boron concentration limit is assumed to be 1 mg l second pass ro is deemed necessary when the boron concentration in the ro permeate exceeds this value dow wave design software was used to calculate the energy consumption of full second pass ro and then a linear relationship between energy consumption difference and influent boron concentration from du et al 2015 was used to estimate a value for only partial second pass ro 2 3 4 engineered osmosis forward osmosis and pressure retarded osmosis were modeled using engineered osmosis processes eop solver which is a module scale solver that considers key aspects of spiral wound membrane modules and directly estimates mass transfer and pressure losses in forward osmosis and pressure retarded osmosis in eop the forward osmosis process was operated at a recovery rate of 90 and the pressure retarded osmosis process was operated at a recovery rate of 95 similar recovery rates for forward osmosis and pressure retarded osmosis processes are found in the literature linares et al 2013 tan and ng 2010 2 3 5 post treatment advanced oxidation using uv light coupled with hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 is an industry standard post treatment process in potable reuse applications national water research institute 2018 yin et al 2018 uv h2o2 degrades neutral charged low molecular weight organics that pass through the ro membrane kimura et al 2003 mccurry et al 2017 a uv dose of at least 300 mj cm2 is necessary for 6 log removal of all known pathogens national water research institute 2018 and a uv dose of 900 mj cm2 is used to destroy disinfection by products such as n nitroso dimethylamine gerrity et al 2015 in the current study uv h2o2 was modeled as a post treatment process for the ro permeate in the influent blending scenarios scenarios 3 and 4 with the dose varying between 300 and 900 mj cm2 depending on the sw ww influent ratio 2 4 estimation of energy consumption for each scenario specific energy consumption sec and specific energy savings ses were calculated for the individual processes sec values for ro se c ro and uf se c uf were calculated using dow wave design software and sec values for forward osmosis se c fo were calculated using eop solver sec values for uv h2o2 se c uv aop were estimated based on the literature e g holloway et al 2016 tang et al 2018 which shows that se c uv aop has a linear relationship with uv dose and ranges from 0 04 to 0 13 kw h m3 ses values were calculated for the px se s px by power model and for the pressure retarded

u f f i l t r a t e f u f f i l t r a t e f p w where s e c u f f i l t r a t e is the energy consumption of the uf process per cubic meter of uf filtrate and f u f f i l t r a t e is uf filtrate flowrate 3 results and discussion 3 1 ro brine salinity the ro brine salinity for each sw ww influent ratio is shown in fig 4 ro brine salinity decreases as the sw ww influent ratio decreases because the salinity of the treated wastewater 0 6 g l is much less than that of seawater 35 g l the horizontal line in fig 4 indicates the limitation for discharge salinity 40 g l set in the current study it can be seen that to maintain a discharge salinity of 40 g l without discharge dilution the sw ww influent ratio must be 30 70 or less at sw ww influent ratios from 100 0 to 40 60 discharge dilution is necessary alongside influent dilution 3 2 treated wastewater flowrates in hybrid systems the data in fig 5 show treated wastewater flowrates required to meet the limitation for discharge salinity because there is no influent dilution in scenarios 1 and 2 these scenarios are represented only by the 100 0 sw ww influent ratio fig 5a in scenarios 1 and 2 to maintain a discharge salinity of 40 g l 8 19 103 m3 d of treated wastewater must be blended with the ro brine in scenario 3 fig 5b there is no data point for sw ww influent ratio 100 0 because the case of no influent dilution is already represented by scenario 1 as the sw ww influent ratio decreases the treated wastewater flowrate requirement increases at sw ww influent ratios greater than 40 60 some treated wastewater is used for influent dilution and some for discharge dilution for example when the sw ww influent ratio is 50 50 even when the seawater influent is diluted by 50 with treated wastewater the ro brine still requires dilution to achieve 40 g l or less according to equation 1 the ro recovery rate is 65 not 50 thus the ro brine salinity prior to effluent dilution is 50 g l not 40 g l fig 4 at influent ratios of 40 60 and less discharge dilution is no longer needed to maintain a discharge salinity of 40 g l this is important because when treated wastewater is used for influent dilution the value of the water resource is fully realized when treated wastewater is used for discharge dilution much of the value in the water resource is lost at sw ww influent ratios of 10 90 and less achieving the desired product water flowrate of 1 14 104 m3 d requires more treated wastewater than is available thus scenario 3 is not feasible at sw ww influent ratios less than or equal to 10 90 in scenario 4 fig 5c osmotic dilution is used to achieve influent dilution and pre treatment for the ro process there are no data points for sw ww influent ratios less than or equal to 30 70 because the seawater flowrates for these ratios are too low to extract wastewater through the forward osmosis process similar to scenario 3 fig 5b as the sw ww influent ratio decreases the treated wastewater flowrate requirement increases comparing the treated wastewater flowrate requirements for scenarios 3 and 4 for sw ww influent ratios from 90 10 to 60 40 the total treated wastewater flowrates for scenarios 3 and 4 are exactly the same even though the forward osmosis process has a recovery rate of 90 this is because all forward osmosis concentrate is used for discharge dilution at the sw ww influent ratio of 50 50 scenario 4 requires 5 more treated wastewater than scenario 3 because only a portion of the forward osmosis concentrate is needed for discharge dilution i e the forward osmosis concentrate flowrate exceeds the flowrate needed for discharge dilution at the sw ww influent ratio of 40 60 scenario 4 requires 10 more treated wastewater than scenario 3 because no treated wastewater is needed for discharge dilution if the goal is to operate a swro facility that meets a 40 g l limitation for discharge salinity and does not waste the water resource in the treated wastewater i e all treated wastewater is used for influent dilution then scenarios 3 and 4 would be operated at sw ww influent ratios of 40 60 and 50 50 at these blending ratios no discharge dilution is needed thus a sw ww influent ratio of 40 60 in scenario 3 and a sw ww influent ratio of 50 50 in scenario 4 were selected to represent scenarios 3 and 4 in later discussion 3 3 discharge flowrates in hybrid systems discharge flowrates are depicted in fig 6 the total discharge flowrates are similar in magnitude for each sw ww influent ratio regardless of scenario but the total discharge flowrates decrease substantially with decreasing sw ww influent ratio in scenarios 1 and 2 the combined flowrates of uf retentate treated wastewater and pressure retarded osmosis concentrate scenario 2 only are almost equal to the flowrate of ro brine in scenario 3 at sw ww influent ratios greater than 40 60 uf retentate alone is not enough to dilute the ro brine to 40 g l thus treated wastewater is also required at sw ww influent ratios less than or equal to 40 60 uf retentate alone is enough to dilute the ro brine in scenario 4 forward osmosis concentrate is also used for discharge dilution similar to scenario 3 at sw ww influent ratios less than or equal to 50 50 uf retentate and forward osmosis concentrate are enough to dilute the ro brine and no additional treated wastewater is required in scenarios 3 and 4 at lower sw ww influent ratios where discharge dilution is not necessary the less uf retentate and less forward osmosis concentrate the less wasted discharge thus at these conditions operation at higher uf and forward osmosis recovery rates would be preferred 3 4 boron concentration in ro permeate from fig s5 in supplementary information the concentration of boron in the ro permeate decreases from 1 32 to 0 24 mg l as sw ww influent ratio decreases from 100 0 to 0 100 at sw ww influent ratios greater than 60 40 because the boron concentration exceeds 1 0 mg l partial second pass ro was added to the model the resulting increase in energy consumption is discussed in the next section for sw ww influent ratios of 60 40 or less additional treatment is not required to reduce the boron concentration 3 5 specific energy consumption and specific energy savings in hybrid systems 3 5 1 specific energy consumption of ro the ro sec values for each sw ww influent ratio are shown in fig 7 for sw ww influent ratios greater than 60 40 when partial second pass ro pass 2 is required the ro sec increases by 34 specifically due to the second pass for influent ratios of 60 40 and less because second pass ro is not required to reduce the boron concentration there are no pass 2 energy requirements 3 5 2 energy consumption of pre treatment and post treatment uf is used for pre treating seawater in all scenarios and for pre treating treated wastewater in scenarios 3 and 4 the uf sec decreases as the sw ww influent ratio decreases from 100 0 to 0 100 fig s6 in supplementary information this decrease is not because the uf sec for pre treatment of seawater is higher than that of treated wastewater in fact they are assumed to be the same both are 0 07 kw h m3 instead total uf sec decreases because a higher ro recovery rate can be used when the seawater is diluted with treated wastewater fig 3 so the uf influent flowrate is reduced uv h2o2 is modeled as a post treatment process for the ro permeate in scenarios 3 and 4 the uv dose increases linearly from 300 to 900 mj cm2 with decreasing sw ww influent ratio table s1 in supplementary information in scenario 3 the uv sec increases from 0 04 to 0 13 kw h m3 pertaining to scenario 4 it has been demonstrated in previous studies that forward osmosis rejection is greater than 40 for tested organic compounds in bench scale experiments and greater than 60 for tested organic compounds in pilot scale experiments hancock et al 2011 based on this rejection of organic compounds by forward osmosis in this study is assumed to be 50 thus with the additional barrier provided by osmotic dilution in scenario 4 the uv dose is set to range from 300 to 450 mj cm2 only table s1 in supplementary information over this range the uv sec increases from 0 04 to 0 06 kw h m3 3 5 3 integration into system scale model net sec values calculated from equations 3 6 are shown in fig 8 in scenario 1 the baseline scenario the net sec is 3 5 kw h m3 this overall energy consumption is approximately two times the theoretical minimum energy of ro 1 8 kw h m3 elimelech and phillip 2011 due to the need for partial second pass ro uf and uv h2o2 processes in scenario 2 the net sec is 0 42 kw h m3 less than that in scenario 1 due to energy recovery by pressure retarded osmosis based on the available flowrates and concentrations of the ro brine and treated wastewater streams 0 60 kw h m3 of specific energy is theoretically available for the pressure retarded osmosis system to recover yip and elimelech 2012 the difference between the theoretical thermodynamic potential and the modeled result 30 or 0 18 kw h m3 is due to unutilized energy and friction losses o toole et al 2016 in scenario 3 as the sw ww influent ratio decreases from 90 10 to 0 100 the net sec decreases from 3 4 to 0 6 kw h m3 the sw ww influent ratio of 0 100 in scenario 3 represents the condition where the ro influent consists of 100 treated wastewater in this case the energy consumption is 0 6 kw h m3 which is lower than the energy consumption values for the blended ro influents however as can be seen in fig 5b the available treated wastewater flowrate is not sufficient to achieve the desired product water flowrates which would necessitate use of a blended influent in scenario 4 the net sec values are slightly less than those in scenario 3 due to the lower uv doses required in scenario 4 all in all decreasing the percentage of seawater has a much greater effect on decreasing net sec than the choice of scenario 3 5 4 composition of net sec the data in fig 9 show the sec percentages for each process in scenario 1 fig 9a the ro and uf contributions to net sec are 95 9 and 4 1 in scenario 2 the ro contribution decreases to 93 9 because the pressure retarded osmosis sub system reduces the overall sec by recovering sge from blending the ro brine with the treated wastewater in addition in scenario 2 the uf contribution to net sec increases to 6 1 because scenario 2 replaces the direct blending in scenario 1 with a pressure retarded osmosis process which requires uf as pre treatment in scenario 3 as the sw ww influent ratio decreases from 90 10 to 0 100 and the percentage of treated wastewater increases the ro contribution to net sec decreases and the contributions of uf and uv h2o2 increase in scenario 4 the uf contribution to net sec is slightly higher than scenario 3 because scenario 4 replaces the direct blending in scenario 3 with forward osmosis that is operated at 90 recovery thus compared to scenario 3 more treated wastewater needs to be pre treated by uf prior to the forward osmosis process in scenario 4 the contribution of uv h2o2 to net sec in scenario 4 is 29 lower than it is in scenario 3 on average because the additional barrier provided by osmotic dilution reduces the uv dose requirement also considering that the additional wastewater foulants in the ro influent are being rejected at higher pressure than are typically used in ro for wastewater reuse the high quality pre treatment offered by forward osmosis in scenario 4 may be valuable in addition forward osmosis only contributes negligibly less than 0 5 to the sec 3 5 5 specific energy comparison for select conditions of four scenarios energy consumptions in all scenarios are depicted in fig 10 sec values for all processes are shown above the x axis and ses values are shown below the x axis also shown for each scenario is the net sec the sum of sec values minus the sum of ses values as mentioned in section 3 2 for scenarios 3 and 4 40 60 and 50 50 are selected to compare with scenarios 1 and 2 because they represent conditions that meet the limitation for discharge salinity but do not waste the water resources in the treated wastewater i e all treated wastewater is used for influent dilution in scenarios 1 and 2 the ro sec is greater than in scenarios 3 and 4 because with no influent dilution the ro operates at higher pressure in first pass ro and also second pass ro is required for boron control in scenario 4 forward osmosis provides a highly selective pre treatment with only 11 increase in sec when compared to scenario 3 3 6 summary for select conditions of four scenarios the data in fig 11 shows the seawater intake flowrates treated wastewater flowrates discharge flowrates and secs for the selected sw ww influent ratio conditions it is important to note that the product water flowrate is constant across all scenarios compared to scenarios 1 and 2 without influent dilution seawater influent flowrates discharge flowrates and net secs in scenarios 3 and 4 are approximately 66 63 and 42 lower the reason is that when treated wastewater is used for influent dilution rather than discharge dilution a larger fraction of treated wastewater can be recovered as product water in addition the treated wastewater flowrates in scenarios 3 and 4 are 34 higher than that of scenarios 1 and 2 but not as much as double mainly because the reduced influent salinity of ro in scenarios 3 and 4 allows greater ro recovery in scenario 2 the pressure retarded osmosis subsystem reduces energy consumption without requiring additional treated wastewater 3 7 concerns for application of blending scenarios comparing the brine blending scenarios scenarios 1 and 2 with the influent blending scenarios scenarios 3 and 4 there will be increased likelihood of fouling and in particular biological fouling or biofouling on the ro membrane in scenarios 3 and 4 considering this scenario 4 may have a better lifecycle outlook as the forward osmosis process provides additional pretreatment to the treated wastewater by removing most of the dissolved and colloidal carbon species that are typically only marginally removed by a uf membrane fan et al 2008 morrow et al 2018 with regard to ro membrane and module selection for scenarios 3 and 4 although feed channel spacers are necessary to create turbulence and alleviate concentration polarization which can ultimately lead to increased salt passage through the membrane biofouling of the spacers may be problematic module feed spacers that minimize biofouling linares et al 2014 matin et al 2011 siddiqui et al 2017 and associated pressure drop in the feed channels siddiqui et al 2017 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 are desirable 4 conclusion and implication given the multiple benefits of the influent blending scenarios scenarios 3 and 4 including that 1 seawater intake and discharge requirements are reduced 2 second pass ro for boron control is no longer required 3 energy consumption is reduced 4 seawater and treated wastewater constituents in the brine to be disposed are diluted 5 land footprint is saved and 6 pumping volumes are saved the advantages of these scenarios are clear even though sge recovered in scenario 2 decreases the overall energy consumption the saving is not as significant as the ro energy savings that occur at lower seawater percentages in the influent blending scenarios scenarios 3 and 4 beyond the framework technical and societal challenges associated with direct potable reuse must be considered with consideration of developing regulatory requirements for potable reuse national water research institute 2018 california state water resources control board 2019 the benefits of osmotic dilution over other advanced processes must be considered if real time membrane failure detection is available for forward osmosis desormeaux 2017 the ability to achieve additional log removal value credits would provide significant value although the framework was developed for use with co located seawater desalination and coastal wastewater reclamation facilities its use can be extended to co located or close proximity desalination and wastewater reclamation facilities in in land locations at these facilities disposal of ro concentrate is an equally serious concern considering the large number of seawater and brackish water ro facilities that are in planning construction and operation in the us west and other arid regions of the world the developed framework could have a broad reach
