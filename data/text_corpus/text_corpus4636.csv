23180,the fatigue life of steel catenary risers is significantly influenced by cyclic riser seabed water interaction in the touchdown zone in this study the penetration and extraction of a shallow embedded riser section subjected to cyclic vertical loading are simulated using a computational fluid dynamics approach with ansys cfx an empirical strength degradation model is proposed for soil softening due to undrained remoulding and clay water interaction in the highly sheared interface termed shear wetting the combined effects of strain rate and softening on the mobilized shear strength of deepwater offshore clay are implemented in cfx a sufficiently large number of loading cycles is simulated using this computationally efficient numerical technique to achieve a stable response a significantly large reduction of vertical resistance of a shallowly embedded riser section due to cyclic loading as observed in physical model tests is obtained using the proposed strength degradation model with shear wetting which cannot be explained simply by undrained remoulding keywords steel catenary riser finite volume method soft clay cyclic loading strength degradation suction 1 introduction steel catenary risers scrs long flexible pipes of typically 150 600 mm diameter are widely used in deepwater to transport hydrocarbons from seabed well systems to floating platforms or surface vessels environmental loading such as surface waves or currents causes cyclic motion of the riser one of the key concerns in the design is the fatigue response of risers near the touchdown point tdp the point where the riser first touches the seabed the fatigue response is significantly influenced by riser seabed water interaction in the touchdown zone tdz the zone where cyclic riser soil interaction exists in the current industry practice the fatigue performance is mainly evaluated modelling the seabed as a linear nonlinear spring or rigid surface large scale field and laboratory tests e g bridge et al 2003 hodder and byrne 2010 wang et al 2014 and reduced scale centrifuge tests e g hu 2010 elliott et al 2013a b 2014 were conducted to understand the response of a riser under cyclic loading still this complex behaviour is not well understood environmental loading could cause six degrees of motion however the vertical motion of the riser is the most critical because the penetration near the tdp could increase the curvature and bending moment clukey et al 2005 moreover suction under the riser during uplift also increases fatigue damage clukey et al 2007 ting et al 2010 therefore the focus of the present study is to investigate the response of an scr subjected to cyclic vertical motion only although it is understood that the response might be influenced by the motions in the other directions in several ways such as altering trench shape size and water flow mechanisms a riser separates from the seabed near the tdp when lifted upward during cyclic motion the degree of separation is high during storm events because of the large amplitude vertical motion further away from the tdp in the buried zone the amplitude of motion reduces and therefore the maximum vertical displacement may not be sufficient to cause separation of the riser from the seabed compared to their large amplitude motion during storm events risers generally experience much more frequent day to day small to medium amplitude cyclic motions over a long period which governs the fatigue design bridge 2005 clukey et al 2005 2007 model tests have been conducted to understand riser seabed water interaction under cyclic loading in these tests the invert of a model pipe section of diameter d is first penetrated into the seabed to the desired depth w in and then cyclic vertical displacements of amplitude a are applied tests were conducted under the submerged condition in order to investigate the effects of water on vertical resistance the depth of embedment w represents the vertical distance between the invert of the pipe and mudline fig 1 for brevity the symbols w ˆ w d w ˆ in w in d and a ˆ a d are used in the following sections in most of the tests cyclic loading started from a shallow initial embedment w ˆ in 1 2 bridge 2005 clukey et al 2005 aubeny et al 2008 langford and aubeny 2008a b langford and meyer 2010 however some researchers conducted tests for larger w ˆ in clukey et al 2008b hu et al 2010 yuan et al 2016 when the pipe is not fully covered by soil during cyclic loading the available free water could interact with seabed sediment at the interface between water and clay the following were the key observations in the experimental programs when free water was available the resistance decreased rapidly with the number of cycles when the pipe t bar broke away from the seabed in large amplitude cyclic motions hodder et al 2008 2009 langford and meyer 2010 yuan et al 2016 a large number of small or medium amplitude cyclic motions reduced the vertical resistance significantly even in the tests without pipe t bar breakaway clukey et al 2005 2008b ganesan and bolton 2013 soil and free water mixing near the interface exacerbate the strength degradation process the degradation of vertical resistance in free water cases is much higher than that resulting from undrained remoulding in t bar tests when the cyclic motion is applied under a fully embedded condition recognizing the complex nature of riser seabed water interaction mathematical models in the form of a p y curve where p is the vertical resistance per unit length of riser and y is the vertical displacement have been proposed for practical engineering purposes bridge et al 2004 aubeny and biscontin 2009 randolph and quiggin 2009 a number of empirical model parameters are required in these models and the authors proposed the ranges for these parameters based on two dimensional model test results dunlap et al 1990 bridge 2005 aubeny et al 2008 the degradation of shear strength due to cyclic loading is not considered in these models these models have also been used to investigate the fatigue response of risers e g shiri and randolph 2010 ting et al 2010 li and low 2011 nakhaee and zhang 2010 incorporated the degradation of resistance due to plastic deformation during cyclic loading in the p y curve however they neglected the effects of water entrainment possible erosion and reconsolidation of softened sediment as reported from physical experiments hodder et al 2013 sahdi et al 2017 aubeny et al 2015 proposed a revised p y curve where the effects of amplitude and number of loading cycles have been incorporated using a set of empirical equations numerical modelling could provide further insights into the mechanisms and can explain some of these experimental observations finite element fe simulation of cyclic penetration and extraction processes in a fully embedded deep condition is available in the literature zhou and randolph 2009 similarly fe modelling of penetration of a shallowly embedded pipeline has been presented by a number of researchers wang et al 2010 chatterjee et al 2012 dutta et al 2014 however numerical modelling of extraction behaviour at shallow depths is very limited clukey et al 2008a demonstrated some advantages of eulerian simulations for modelling riser seabed water interaction in the presence of free water they suggested that soil and free water mixing might be incorporated in the strength degradation model although it was not considered in that study moreover simulations have been performed only for one loading cycle instead of simulating a sufficiently large number of cycles using a finite element limit analysis program martin and white 2012 calculated the lower and upper bound limit loads of wished in place pipes for rough smooth and fully bonded unbonded cases the soil has been modelled as rigid plastic material without softening again cyclic loading was not simulated in that study the authors of the present study used the eulerian solution technique in ansys cfx to model penetration of a pipe into a soft clay seabed hawlader et al 2015a they also implemented a simplified strength degradation model as a function of distance from the riser in cfx and simulated only one loading cycle hawlader et al 2015b comparing with previous model tests and fe results it was shown that cfx can simulate both penetration and extraction processes in summary when subjected to cyclic loading the response of shallowly embedded scr is very different from the response of a fully embedded t bar the numerical modelling of scr subjected to cyclic displacements near the seabed where free water could play a major role is not available in the present study numerical simulations in a eulerian framework are performed using ansys cfx software which can accommodate both geotechnical and hydrodynamic aspects of the problem a soil strength degradation model is proposed and implemented in cfx to simulate the reduction of soil resistance under cyclic loading for a range of model parameters and loading conditions using this computationally efficient technique simulations are continued over a sufficiently large number of cycles 2 problem statement a section of pipe located at a distance y w above the seabed is displaced downward to w w in and then a sinusoidal cyclic displacement of amplitude a is applied maintaining an average velocity v 0 during penetration and extraction fig 1 the depth of a soil element from the mudline is z 3 cfd model development the general purpose ansys cfx 14 0 software is used for numerical modelling ansys cfx 2012 the computational fluid dynamics cfd approach has been used in the past not only for modelling fluid but also for the problems involved in soft seabed sediments including debris flows glide blocks and out runner blocks modelling de blasio et al 2004a b 2005 gauer et al 2005 2006 harbitz et al 2003 zakeri 2009 zakeri et al 2009 zakeri and hawlader 2013 the basic principle of cfd modelling the similarity and differences between solid mechanics which is the basis of fe formulations and the advantages of cfd over fe methods to simulate riser seabed water interaction have been discussed in hawlader et al 2015a b fig 2 shows the cfx model used in the present study as cfx allows only three dimensional modelling the analysis is performed only for one element of 10 mm thickness in the out of plane direction a riser section of d 350 mm and l 10 mm is placed in water above the seabed at y w 1 0d the soil and water domains are discretized into a three dimensional mesh previous fe analyses and model tests for shallow embedded conditions show that the soil elements more than 1 5d from the pipe surface do not experience significant deformation during vertical displacement dutta et al 2014 a subdomain of 1 5d thickness the shaded zone in fig 2 is created where mesh deformation is not allowed and therefore the size and shape of the mesh in the subdomain do not change with loading however mesh distortion is allowed outside the subdomain soil and water modelled as eulerian materials can flow through the mesh both inside and outside the subdomain and also through the outer boundary of the subdomain numerical issues related to mesh distortion are avoided using the subdomain further details are available in hawlader et al 2015 a b all the boundaries are placed at a sufficiently large distance from the riser in order to avoid boundary effects the bottom and all the vertical boundaries are defined as impermeable surfaces a no slip boundary condition is applied to the bottom which represents zero velocity of soil elements next to this boundary a free slip boundary condition is applied to the right vertical face a symmetry plane boundary condition is applied to the other three vertical faces which implies that the flow of eulerian materials soil water on one side of the plane is a mirror image of the flow on the opposite side the unspecified mesh motion option in cfx is used for the vertical walls this setting allows the mesh node on these faces to move in the vertical direction preserving the quality of mesh during the displacement of the riser the top of the water is defined as an opening to allow water to flow in and out of the domain compared with typical fe modelling the preceding boundary conditions represent rollers in the vertical faces and hinges at the bottom the mudline is defined by the volume fraction tool in cfx the volume fraction of water is 1 0 and clay is 0 above the mudline whereas it is the reverse in the elements below the mudline the riser is modelled as an impermeable wall with no slip boundary condition following the concept of the finite thickness interface element supachawarote et al 2004 jostad and andresen 2004 the shear strength of a thin zone of soil of 10 mm thickness around the riser is modelled as ατy where α 0 and α 1 represent the conditions similar to smooth and rough interfaces respectively and τy is the mobilized shear strength as discussed below 4 shear strength of seabed sediment the undrained shear strength s u can be used to model soil behaviour if water entrainment does not occur however as the behaviour is not undrained when water entrainment occurs the symbol τy is used for mobilized shear strength fig 3 shows the shear strength degradation curve that is used in the present study where the first segment ab represents the undrained remoulding of clay experimental evidence shows that s u increases with shear strain rate γ and decreases with accumulated plastic shear strain ξ based on the work of einav and randolph 2005 the following empirical equation is used for the segment ab in fig 3 1 τ y f 1 f 2 s u 0 where f 1 and f 2 represent the strain rate and strain softening effects respectively s u0 is the value of s u at the reference shear strain rate γ ref and prior to any softening in this study f 1 and f 2 are defined as einav and randolph 2005 2 f 1 1 μ log max γ γ ref γ ref 3 f 2 1 s t 1 1 s t e 3 ξ ξ 95 where μ is the rate of change of shear strength per log cycle of γ remoulded sensitivity s t s up s ur in which s up and s ur are the peak and remoulded values of s u respectively for a given γ and ξ95 is the value of ξ at which s u is reduced by 95 of s up s ur equation 3 successfully simulates the degradation of soil resistance during cyclic vertical movement of cylindrical objects if cycling occurs in fully embedded conditions such as in t bar tests zhou and randolph 2009 however if the cycling occurs near the seabed the reduction of vertical resistance is significantly higher than that in a fully embedded condition clukey et al 2005 hodder et al 2008 langford and meyer 2010 for example hodder et al 2008 showed the reduction of vertical resistance by a factor of 7 5 when cyclic loading was applied at w in 0 5d whereas the full flow penetrometer sensitivity was only 2 4 re penetration of the riser which was separated from the seabed during unloading through the water filled trench and water entrainment during cyclic loading caused enhanced soil softening some experimental investigations show that small amplitude cyclic motion could also cause a significant reduction of vertical resistance which is again due to the complex interaction between free water and clay and cannot be explained simply using undrained remoulding clukey et al 2005 however the number of cycles required for a given degree of enhanced softening is higher in small amplitude motions than in large amplitude cyclic loadings where the riser has broken away from the seabed the experimental results clearly show additional strength reduction in the presence of free water however the modelling of free water effects on shear strength degradation is very difficult a number of factors might be involved in this process including water entrainment soil water mixing near the interface increase in pore water pressure and moisture content high plastic shear strain accumulation microchannel formation and erosion of disturbed soil clukey et al 2008a noted that the free water effect might be encompassed in an empirical shear strength degradation function although they did not propose any model or explicitly consider it in numerical modelling note that challenges in soil water interface modelling have been encountered not only for this problem but also in other fields such as riverbed erosion and possible hydroplaning in a submarine debris flow conducting a series of laboratory tests for a wide range of initial water content w across the soil fluid transition phase boukpeti et al 2012 proposed an empirical model for shear strength as a power function of w they also showed that the modelling of shear resistance in a soil mechanics framework better represents the behaviour of this material than fluid mechanics models for the range of water content they considered following the water entrainment concept of de blasio and his co workers for modelling runout of submarine landslides the strength degradation process is divided into two components de blasio et al 2005 elverhøi et al 2005 the first component is due to bond breakage fabric change and particle alignment which result from plastic shear strain accumulation strain softening this type of undrained remoulding occurs without a significant change in moisture content e g cyclic t bar tests in a fully embedded condition the second component of shear strength degradation occurs due to water entrainment in the highly sheared zone near the soil water interface where free water is available this process has been termed shear wetting de blasio 2005 elverhøi et al 2005 for risers the effects of water entrainment were examined using centrifuge modelling both the rate and magnitude soil softening increased significantly when the cyclic displacements were applied to a riser section or penetrometer near the seabed as compared to softening due to cyclic loading at a fully embedded condition where only undrained remoulding occurred without free water entrainment hodder et al 2008 westgate et al 2013 yuan et al 2016 although it is difficult to quantify accurately de blasio 2005 proposed an empirical model for shear strength degradation due to shear wetting as a function of shear strain based on some simplifying assumptions kobayashi et al 2015 made an attempt to incorporate water entrainment effects in a modified cam clay based model the solid line abcd in fig 3 shows the shear strength degradation model used in the present study the line abe represents undrained strain softening eq 1 for a given strain rate in order to incorporate shear wetting effects τy is linearly decreased from τy s u95 to τy τy ld at a large total accumulated shear strain ξld and then maintained constant lines bc cd as shown later large plastic shear strains accumulate mainly near the riser and clay water interface where shear wetting is also possible therefore the shear wetting effect segment bcd is primarily applicable to the highly sheared zones near the clay water interface in summary the mobilized shear resistance is calculated as 4 τ y f 1 1 s t 1 1 s t e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u 0 if ξ ξ 95 f 1 s u 95 s u 95 τ y ld ξ ξ 95 ξ ld ξ 95 if ξ 95 ξ ξ ld f 1 τ y ld if ξ ξ ld note that de blasio 2005 also used an exponential degradation function similar to eq 3 however the strain softening and shear wetting effects have been combined by defining sensitivity as s up s u ld in the present study these effects are modelled separately i e undrained remoulding at ξ ξ95 and shear wetting at ξ ξ95 because the mechanisms of strength degradation are different as discussed it also has the following advantages the soil elements far from free water having 0 ξ ξ95 will experience only undrained remoulding effects if de blasio s 2005 type of model is used these elements will have also some effect of shear wetting because the strength degradation curve has been defined by τy ld which is not realistic for riser cyclic motion as free water is not available note that water entrainment could also reduce ξ95 therefore to capture enhanced soil softening a reduced value of ξ95 has been used to improve the performance of a model for dynamic embedment of pipe near the seabed cheuk and white 2011 the geometry and soil parameters used in the base case analysis are shown in table 1 a uniform τy s u0 of 2 25 kpa is used although it is understood that s u0 might increase with depth in many cases a typical range of s t is 2 5 for offshore sediments kvalstad et al 2001 ranges of ξ95 10 50 and μ 0 05 0 2 have been used in the past for successful modelling of undrained remoulding and strain rate effects respectively randolph 2004 einav and randolph 2005 it is difficult to estimate ξld form the results of physical experiments such as penetrometer cycling because the effects of water entrainment on overall vertical resistance cannot be separated easily in the present study ξld 15 35 and τy ld 0 1 kpa are used further studies are required for a better quantification of these parameters 5 numerical implementation both clay and water are modelled as homogeneous multiphase eulerian materials where the shear behaviour is defined using the dynamic viscosity for water a constant value of dynamic viscosity μdw is used table 1 clay is modelled as a visco plastic non newtonian fluid defining its dynamic viscosity μds as τy γ using the cfx expression language a declarative language in cfx for enhanced simulation the displacement of the riser material properties and desired output variables are defined the cfx does not have any direct option to define shear strength degradation as shown in fig 3 the additional variable option in cfx is used to calculate the accumulated shear strain as required in eq 3 in each time increment γ is called which represents the second invariant of the deviatoric strain rate tensor a scalar quantity multiplying γ by time increment δt the shear strain increment δξ is calculated summing up δξ over the period of analysis the accumulated strain ξ is calculated the authors have developed a special technique in cfx to calculate ξ using the value of γ and ξ the mobilized shear strength is calculated for each element which is then used to update μds 6 results of base case analysis 6 1 penetration and uplift resistance fig 4 a shows the variation of normalized resistance n f s un d e l with normalized depth w ˆ w d e for the base case the undrained shear strength used for normalization s un is 2 3 s u 0 see hawlader et al 2015a b for further discussion as finite thickness interface elements and a no slip riser soil interface condition are used the failure occurs in the soil instead of at the riser soil interface therefore following the concept of gui and bolton 1998 and assuming that the failure occurs at a distance of half of the element thickness from the outer surface of the riser the value of effective diameter d e is calculated as 360 mm 350 mm 2 10 2 mm for 10 mm thick elements just outside the riser fig 4 a shows that both the penetration and uplift resistance decrease with the number of cycles n although the reduction of n per cycle reduces with an increase in n note that if the extraction is continued instead of re penetration at w ˆ 0 25 the uplift resistance will decrease and the riser pipe will be separated from the seabed leaving a trench in some cases as observed in model tests bridge 2005 and simulated by the authors in hawlader et al 2015b the simulation shown in fig 4 a takes only 2 5 h with a 3 4 ghz intel core i7 processor and 12 gb ram to compare large deformation fe analysis is performed using abaqus cel only for penetration from the seabed to w ˆ 0 5 see dutta et al 2014 for further details the present cfx analysis is more than six times faster than abaqus cel analysis the use of a subdomain of fine mesh that moves without any deformation during cyclic motion together with different solution techniques in cfd make cfx simulation computationally very efficient a similar analysis is performed without shear wetting i e strength degradation is modelled by the line abe instead of abcd in fig 3 fig 4 b shows that both penetration and uplift resistance decrease with n however after 6 8 cycles the resistance decreases slowly with cyclic loading as compared to the shear wetting case a comparison of fig 4 a b shows that penetration and uplift resistances are the same in both figures for the first few loading cycles because the initial part of the strength degradation curve segment ab in fig 3 is the same in both simulations however when ξ ξ95 the strength degradation is more in the former case fig 4 a with shear wetting see the vertical distance between lines be and bcd in fig 3 therefore the degradation of resistance continues over a large number of cycles in fig 4 a and provides low resistance as compared to fig 4 b for a better comparison the normalized resistance presented in fig 4 a b is plotted against n in fig 5 following randolph et al 2007 the values of n at the halfway point of riser travel during cyclic loading i e at w 0 375d e in fig 4 are obtained solid circle and triangle in fig 4 the obtained penetration and uplift resistance at a given cycle n i are then normalized by the penetration resistance at w 0 375d e during initial penetration point a in fig 4 which is denoted as n 0 25 assuming that 25 of the average total strain that accumulates in the first cycle is developed at this stage zhou and randolph 2009 and therefore it is considered as n 0 25 similarly n 0 75 at w 0 375d e during the first uplift point c in fig 4 the degradation of resistance with cyclic loading is then examined by defining the ratio of normalized resistances as r n n i n 0 25 the ratio of extraction to penetration resistance for the first cycle n 0 75 n 0 25 is 0 82 and therefore uplift curves in fig 6 start from r n 0 82 this ratio depends on several factors such as soil properties and loading conditions as presented in the parametric study physical model test results also show a wide variation of this ratio bridge et al 2005 hodder et al 2009 the degradation of vertical resistance is related to soil sensitivity s t however the sensitivity of soil s t is not equal to 1 r n even at later cycles for example fig 6 shows that for the no shear wetting case 1 r n at n 30 is 2 64 for penetration which is smaller than s t 4 the following are the main reasons for this difference i considerable softening occurs prior to mobilization of n 0 25 that is used to define r n for the no shear wetting case in fig 6 n 0 25 is 86 of that in a simulation using a rate dependent eq 2 non softening f 2 1 soil model with the other parameters the same as in table 1 ii strain rate effects on shear strength increase the vertical resistance the simulation for the no shear wetting case in fig 6 is continued to 65 cycles and it is found that at n 65 the soil in the failure mechanism is in an almost fully remoulded state f 2 1 s t however because of strain rate effects f 1 1 the mobilized shear strength is greater than the remoulded shear strength iii self weight effects buoyancy influence the uplift resistance simulations with an ideal soil model rate independent and non softening for γ 5 kn m3 base case and γ 0 weightless show that n 0 25 for the former case is 4 higher than that of the latter case a similar trend i e s t 1 r n has been reported for full flow cycling yafrate et al 2009 zhou and randolph 2009 based on large deformation finite element simulations for n 6 zhou and randolph 2009 identified three potential reasons for s t 1 r n i softening prior to mobilization of n 0 25 ii pipe soil interface resistance which they defined as s u0 s t and iii the extent of flow mechanisms outside the fully remoulded zone these aspects are discussed further in later sections 6 2 plastic shear strain fig 7 shows the accumulated plastic shear strain during the 5th 10th 15th and 20th cycles just before the end of penetration to w ˆ 0 5 the figures in the left column fig 7 a d show the results for the no shear wetting case while the right column fig 7 e h is for the shear wetting case at the 5th cycles ξ and instantaneous soil velocity vectors are very similar for both cases fig 7 a e the coloured zone in fig 7 represents the area where enhanced softening occurs when shear wetting is considered ξ 10 i e ξ ξ95 comparison between strains in fig 7 a e shows that shear wetting occurs only in a small zone near the pipe fig 7 e therefore the penetration or extraction resistances in n 5 are almost the same for both cases fig 6 at n 10 the zone of large ξ is slightly smaller in fig 7 f than that in fig 7 b at these strains a considerable strength reduction occurs due to shear wetting and therefore gives low resistance as compared to the no shear wetting case fig 5 with an increase in n high shear strains mainly localise near the riser in the shear wetting case which reduces the strength significantly in that zone therefore in this case soil elements mainly displace through this narrow zone as shown by the instantaneous velocity vectors fig 7 g h however for the no shear wetting case soil elements displace over a large area fig 7 c d as the shear strength decreases significantly when shear wetting is considered this weak soil can displace easily during re penetration and therefore a higher berm near the riser can be formed as shown in fig 7 g h however the berm shape is different when shear wetting is not considered the highly softened soil around the riser might be eroded by the flow of this weak soil along the length of the riser during cyclic motion and by the current when it reaches the seabed these factors together with lateral movement could enhance the shear wetting process and trench formation as observed in the field bridge 2005 the effects of these factors need to be studied further 6 3 suction under riser during uplift the total pressure on a soil element has two components i the ambient water pressure u 0 which is considered as a reference pressure ii the pressure p that comes from the difference between the density of soil and water and loading during the vertical movement of the pipe in the numerical simulation p is calculated in each time increment when p is less than zero the total pressure is less than the initial ambient water pressure which represents the suction fig 8 shows the suction ve value of p 0 under the riser during the 5th 10th 15th and 20th cycles just before re penetration at w ˆ 0 25 the contour intervals of suction are shown in logarithmic scale for clarity note that although cycle numbers are the same as before because of additional upward displacement of 0 25d ξ at this stage is higher than the values shown in fig 7 but the pattern of ξ is very similar to fig 7 and therefore it is not shown again instead the development of suction is examined which is also an important parameter for design comparison of figures in the left and right columns of fig 8 shows that suction reduces with the number of cycles when shear wetting is considered the suction pulls the soil elements down toward the invert of the riser the extent of zone and magnitude of suction reduce with n in the shear wetting case because of the shear strength reduction with n however the reduction is not significant when shear wetting is not considered and therefore a very small change in uplift resistance is calculated after n 5 fig 6 langford and meyer 2010 conducted model tests using a 174 mm diameter riser section cycled in highly plastic west african clay where the pore pressure was measured at the invert of the riser their test configuration was different from the present study s u0 5 7 kpa and cycled between w ˆ 0 and w ˆ 0 5 however a negative pore pressure of 10 kpa at the first cycle and its gradual reduction with the number of cycles were found this trend is similar to the simulated suction presented in fig 8 e 8 h one important observation is that when shear wetting is considered a trough above the clay water interface is formed in the highly softened soil fig 8 f h the size of the trough increases with n during extraction water gushes toward the trough as shown by instantaneous velocity vectors of water above the clay water interface the bottom of the trough e g point b in fig 8 h progresses deeper than the highest point of the clay sticks to the pipe surface point a note that based on experimental observation clukey et al 2008a suggested that during uplift clay might adhere to the riser while failure might occur through the soil the present simulation with shear wetting can explain that process when shear wetting is not considered this type of trough does not form fig 8 d 7 parametric study a parametric study is performed for the shear wetting case varying only one parameter while the other parameters are the same as in the base case table 1 7 1 effect of μ the value of μ could vary between 0 05 and 0 2 einav and randolph 2005 lehane et al 2009 fig 9 shows a very small difference between r n n curves with μ 0 05 0 2 for both penetration and extraction resistance note however that n i and n 0 25 increase with μ although their ratio r n is almost the same for all 4 values of μ for example n 0 25 is 6 4 and 7 9 for μ 0 11 and μ 0 2 respectively in summary μ has a negligible effect on r n and therefore r n is a better parameter to describe cyclic degradation vertical resistance than n i 7 2 effect of st the remoulded sensitivity of offshore clays typically varies between 2 and 5 kvalstad et al 2001 andersen and jostad 2004 randolph 2004 as shown in fig 3 with an increase in s t the point b shifts downward meaning that the shear strength degrades quickly with ξ at the early stage as a result both penetration and extraction resistances decrease quickly for a high s t as shown in fig 10 however r n is almost the same for all three values of s t at a large n during this stage significantly high strains generate around the riser fig 7 and therefore the shear strength degrades to τy ld which is the same for all three cases 7 3 effect of ξ95 fig 11 shows that r n decreases quickly with a decrease in ξ95 because the lower the value of ξ95 the faster the degradation of strength fig 3 similar to fig 10 r n is almost the same at large n because the shear strength degrades to τy ld at this stage near the riser 7 4 effect of ξld while s t and ξ95 primarily affect the shape of the initial part of the strength degradation curve ξ ξ95 ξld mainly influences the latter part at large values of ξ fig 3 fig 12 shows that ξld does not have a significant influence on r n up to 4 cycles however with an increase in n the zone of large plastic shear strains ξ95 ξ ξld around the riser increases where the strength degrades quickly for a small value of ξld therefore at a given n 4 r n is smaller for smaller values of ξld again r n will be almost the same for all three values of ξld if the analysis is continued for a large number of cycles because the shear strength in the failure mechanism will degrade to τy ld 7 5 effect of initial embedment win depending upon the location of riser section with respect to tdp installation and loading conditions a section of riser might have different initial depths of embedment and experience cyclic loading of different amplitudes fig 13 shows that r n decreases quickly with n for shallow initial penetration depths this trend is similar to the first episode of 20 cycles of hodder et al 2009 where they showed that the slope of the load displacement curve stiffness decreases rapidly for a shallow initial embedment at a large n the uplift resistance is almost the same for this range of w in because the localized shear strength of highly softened clay at high ξ mainly governs the extraction behaviour however for penetration r n in the later cycles increases with an increase in w in because unlike extraction the penetration behaviour is also influenced by the less softened clay outside the highly softened zone and this influence increases for deeper conditions this has been verified by examining clay velocity vectors at these stages 7 6 effect of cyclic amplitude a experimental evidence shows that small to large amplitude riser motion could cause significant degradation of vertical resistance clukey et al 2008b hodder et al 2009 langford and meyer 2010 fig 14 shows the variation of r n with n for two amplitudes a 0 1d e 0 25d e for w ˆ in 0 5 because of higher displacement of the riser in each cycle r n decreases quickly with n for a 0 25d e and becomes almost constant after n 25 the reduction of r n with n is slow for the smaller amplitude motion of a 0 1d e and the reduction continues right up to 60 cycles a similar trend of decreasing resistance for small amplitude motions has been reported from physical model tests clukey et al 2005 very large amplitude motions near the tdp are expected during storm events although this does not occur frequently moreover the effect of water flow in the trench along the riser is more significant near the tdp this has not been simulated in the present study 7 7 effect of riser soil interface behaviour in previous sections α 0 5 is used to define the interface elements shear strength the effects of α are examined in this section by conducting simulations with two limiting values of α 1 0 for rough and 0 01 for smooth and these simulations are continued for a large number of cycles n 65 fig 15 shows the variation of r n which is calculated using n 0 25 for the corresponding interface condition the values of n 0 25 for rough and smooth conditions are 6 32 and 5 69 respectively as shown α does not have a significant influence on the reduction of r n with the number of cycles the extent of soil failure mechanism is presented in fig 16 using instantaneous velocity vectors and strain rates for three different cycles drawing two lines in these figures the level of soil softening in the failure mechanism is divided into three zones undrained remoulding shear wetting and large strain shear resistance i e segments ab bc and cd in fig 3 for both interface conditions the zone of failure mechanism contracts during early cycles and then expands in later cycles for the rough condition the lateral extent near the seabed from the centre of the riser is 1 5d at n 10 which is reduced to 1 0d at n 26 and finally increased to 1 35d at n 65 fig 16 a c during early cycles the shear strength of soil elements near the riser is reduced because of strain softening which causes the soil to displace through this softened zone and therefore the extent of the failure mechanism is reduced however when a sufficient thickness of soil near the riser is softened to τy ld the higher strain rate near the riser gives a higher mobilized shear resistance which causes gradual expansion of the failure mechanism during later cycles a similar trend is found for the smooth condition fig 16 d f although the extent of the failure mechanism is different however it does not have a significant influence on the reduction of r n for rough and smooth cases as shown in fig 15 as discussed the vertical resistance has two components i soil resistance that acts opposite to the direction of movement of the riser and ii buoyancy acting upward a number of factors e g the shape of the berm soil resistance and depth of embedment influence the buoyancy force merifield et al 2009 in the present study as the berm size and shape and soil resistance change the contribution of buoyancy to the vertical resistance varies with cyclic loading and also in the penetration and extraction phases moreover even though the soil underneath the riser moves upward during extraction the entire failure mechanism is not a true example of a reverse penetration mechanism at the same depth compare figs 7 and 8 in fact a segment of the riser s surface separates from the soil during extraction fig 8 because of these two factors i e buoyancy contribution and soil failure mechanism r n is smaller in extraction than in penetration moreover the consideration of strain rate increases the vertical resistance therefore 1 r n may not approach sup τy ld even after a very large number of cycle 8 conclusions numerical modelling of the penetration and extraction behaviour of a section of riser subjected to cyclic vertical motion at shallow depths is presented in this study in order to capture the role of free water in the trench and suction under the riser during extraction the numerical simulation is performed using a computational fluid dynamics approach with ansys cfx software a strain rate and strain softening dependent model for shear strength of clay is used in addition to undrained remoulding the potential effect of water entrainment in the highly sheared zone is incorporated in the shear strength degradation model using the concept of shear wetting the present cfx model can simulate the flow large deformation of clay and water around the riser together with the formation of trench and berm during cyclic loading the following conclusions are drawn from this study a the decrease in vertical resistance primarily occurs during 10 25 cycles of loading and thereafter it occurs slowly the shear wetting increases the magnitude and rate of reduction of vertical resistance as compared to that for undrained remoulding only without shear wetting the additional reduction of vertical resistance in the shear wetting cases supports experimental observation and cannot be explained with undrained remoulding only b when shear wetting is considered the extent of the soil failure mechanism around the riser reduces in early cycles because of a reduction of the shear strength of the soil that flows through this narrow zone the failure mechanism then expands with continued cyclic loading the process of contraction and expansion of the failure mechanism is influenced by riser soil interface resistance the enhanced soil softening also causes the reduction of suction under the riser during extraction c the rate of reduction of the normalized resistance ratio r n with the number of cycles decreases with an increase in initial depth of embedment and increases with cyclic loading amplitude d the normalized resistance ratio is almost independent of strain rate although the resistance itself increases with strain rate the rate of reduction of the normalized resistance ratio with the number of cycles increases with the model parameters that accelerate the soil strength degradation process such as high sensitivity low ξ95 and low ξld finally although the inclusion of an empirical shear wetting model could better explain the reduction of resistance as observed in physical experiments which cannot be explained using the remoulded sensitivity only the complex process of water entrainment and its effects on shear resistance need to be studied further moreover the effects of a number of factors such as combined vertical lateral cyclic motion as examined through centrifuge modelling yuan et al 2016 erosion of highly softened sediment and its reconsolidation should be investigated acknowledgements the work presented in this

23180,the fatigue life of steel catenary risers is significantly influenced by cyclic riser seabed water interaction in the touchdown zone in this study the penetration and extraction of a shallow embedded riser section subjected to cyclic vertical loading are simulated using a computational fluid dynamics approach with ansys cfx an empirical strength degradation model is proposed for soil softening due to undrained remoulding and clay water interaction in the highly sheared interface termed shear wetting the combined effects of strain rate and softening on the mobilized shear strength of deepwater offshore clay are implemented in cfx a sufficiently large number of loading cycles is simulated using this computationally efficient numerical technique to achieve a stable response a significantly large reduction of vertical resistance of a shallowly embedded riser section due to cyclic loading as observed in physical model tests is obtained using the proposed strength degradation model with shear wetting which cannot be explained simply by undrained remoulding keywords steel catenary riser finite volume method soft clay cyclic loading strength degradation suction 1 introduction steel catenary risers scrs long flexible pipes of typically 150 600 mm diameter are widely used in deepwater to transport hydrocarbons from seabed well systems to floating platforms or surface vessels environmental loading such as surface waves or currents causes cyclic motion of the riser one of the key concerns in the design is the fatigue response of risers near the touchdown point tdp the point where the riser first touches the seabed the fatigue response is significantly influenced by riser seabed water interaction in the touchdown zone tdz the zone where cyclic riser soil interaction exists in the current industry practice the fatigue performance is mainly evaluated modelling the seabed as a linear nonlinear spring or rigid surface large scale field and laboratory tests e g bridge et al 2003 hodder and byrne 2010 wang et al 2014 and reduced scale centrifuge tests e g hu 2010 elliott et al 2013a b 2014 were conducted to understand the response of a riser under cyclic loading still this complex behaviour is not well understood environmental loading could cause six degrees of motion however the vertical motion of the riser is the most critical because the penetration near the tdp could increase the curvature and bending moment clukey et al 2005 moreover suction under the riser during uplift also increases fatigue damage clukey et al 2007 ting et al 2010 therefore the focus of the present study is to investigate the response of an scr subjected to cyclic vertical motion only although it is understood that the response might be influenced by the motions in the other directions in several ways such as altering trench shape size and water flow mechanisms a riser separates from the seabed near the tdp when lifted upward during cyclic motion the degree of separation is high during storm events because of the large amplitude vertical motion further away from the tdp in the buried zone the amplitude of motion reduces and therefore the maximum vertical displacement may not be sufficient to cause separation of the riser from the seabed compared to their large amplitude motion during storm events risers generally experience much more frequent day to day small to medium amplitude cyclic motions over a long period which governs the fatigue design bridge 2005 clukey et al 2005 2007 model tests have been conducted to understand riser seabed water interaction under cyclic loading in these tests the invert of a model pipe section of diameter d is first penetrated into the seabed to the desired depth w in and then cyclic vertical displacements of amplitude a are applied tests were conducted under the submerged condition in order to investigate the effects of water on vertical resistance the depth of embedment w represents the vertical distance between the invert of the pipe and mudline fig 1 for brevity the symbols w ˆ w d w ˆ in w in d and a ˆ a d are used in the following sections in most of the tests cyclic loading started from a shallow initial embedment w ˆ in 1 2 bridge 2005 clukey et al 2005 aubeny et al 2008 langford and aubeny 2008a b langford and meyer 2010 however some researchers conducted tests for larger w ˆ in clukey et al 2008b hu et al 2010 yuan et al 2016 when the pipe is not fully covered by soil during cyclic loading the available free water could interact with seabed sediment at the interface between water and clay the following were the key observations in the experimental programs when free water was available the resistance decreased rapidly with the number of cycles when the pipe t bar broke away from the seabed in large amplitude cyclic motions hodder et al 2008 2009 langford and meyer 2010 yuan et al 2016 a large number of small or medium amplitude cyclic motions reduced the vertical resistance significantly even in the tests without pipe t bar breakaway clukey et al 2005 2008b ganesan and bolton 2013 soil and free water mixing near the interface exacerbate the strength degradation process the degradation of vertical resistance in free water cases is much higher than that resulting from undrained remoulding in t bar tests when the cyclic motion is applied under a fully embedded condition recognizing the complex nature of riser seabed water interaction mathematical models in the form of a p y curve where p is the vertical resistance per unit length of riser and y is the vertical displacement have been proposed for practical engineering purposes bridge et al 2004 aubeny and biscontin 2009 randolph and quiggin 2009 a number of empirical model parameters are required in these models and the authors proposed the ranges for these parameters based on two dimensional model test results dunlap et al 1990 bridge 2005 aubeny et al 2008 the degradation of shear strength due to cyclic loading is not considered in these models these models have also been used to investigate the fatigue response of risers e g shiri and randolph 2010 ting et al 2010 li and low 2011 nakhaee and zhang 2010 incorporated the degradation of resistance due to plastic deformation during cyclic loading in the p y curve however they neglected the effects of water entrainment possible erosion and reconsolidation of softened sediment as reported from physical experiments hodder et al 2013 sahdi et al 2017 aubeny et al 2015 proposed a revised p y curve where the effects of amplitude and number of loading cycles have been incorporated using a set of empirical equations numerical modelling could provide further insights into the mechanisms and can explain some of these experimental observations finite element fe simulation of cyclic penetration and extraction processes in a fully embedded deep condition is available in the literature zhou and randolph 2009 similarly fe modelling of penetration of a shallowly embedded pipeline has been presented by a number of researchers wang et al 2010 chatterjee et al 2012 dutta et al 2014 however numerical modelling of extraction behaviour at shallow depths is very limited clukey et al 2008a demonstrated some advantages of eulerian simulations for modelling riser seabed water interaction in the presence of free water they suggested that soil and free water mixing might be incorporated in the strength degradation model although it was not considered in that study moreover simulations have been performed only for one loading cycle instead of simulating a sufficiently large number of cycles using a finite element limit analysis program martin and white 2012 calculated the lower and upper bound limit loads of wished in place pipes for rough smooth and fully bonded unbonded cases the soil has been modelled as rigid plastic material without softening again cyclic loading was not simulated in that study the authors of the present study used the eulerian solution technique in ansys cfx to model penetration of a pipe into a soft clay seabed hawlader et al 2015a they also implemented a simplified strength degradation model as a function of distance from the riser in cfx and simulated only one loading cycle hawlader et al 2015b comparing with previous model tests and fe results it was shown that cfx can simulate both penetration and extraction processes in summary when subjected to cyclic loading the response of shallowly embedded scr is very different from the response of a fully embedded t bar the numerical modelling of scr subjected to cyclic displacements near the seabed where free water could play a major role is not available in the present study numerical simulations in a eulerian framework are performed using ansys cfx software which can accommodate both geotechnical and hydrodynamic aspects of the problem a soil strength degradation model is proposed and implemented in cfx to simulate the reduction of soil resistance under cyclic loading for a range of model parameters and loading conditions using this computationally efficient technique simulations are continued over a sufficiently large number of cycles 2 problem statement a section of pipe located at a distance y w above the seabed is displaced downward to w w in and then a sinusoidal cyclic displacement of amplitude a is applied maintaining an average velocity v 0 during penetration and extraction fig 1 the depth of a soil element from the mudline is z 3 cfd model development the general purpose ansys cfx 14 0 software is used for numerical modelling ansys cfx 2012 the computational fluid dynamics cfd approach has been used in the past not only for modelling fluid but also for the problems involved in soft seabed sediments including debris flows glide blocks and out runner blocks modelling de blasio et al 2004a b 2005 gauer et al 2005 2006 harbitz et al 2003 zakeri 2009 zakeri et al 2009 zakeri and hawlader 2013 the basic principle of cfd modelling the similarity and differences between solid mechanics which is the basis of fe formulations and the advantages of cfd over fe methods to simulate riser seabed water interaction have been discussed in hawlader et al 2015a b fig 2 shows the cfx model used in the present study as cfx allows only three dimensional modelling the analysis is performed only for one element of 10 mm thickness in the out of plane direction a riser section of d 350 mm and l 10 mm is placed in water above the seabed at y w 1 0d the soil and water domains are discretized into a three dimensional mesh previous fe analyses and model tests for shallow embedded conditions show that the soil elements more than 1 5d from the pipe surface do not experience significant deformation during vertical displacement dutta et al 2014 a subdomain of 1 5d thickness the shaded zone in fig 2 is created where mesh deformation is not allowed and therefore the size and shape of the mesh in the subdomain do not change with loading however mesh distortion is allowed outside the subdomain soil and water modelled as eulerian materials can flow through the mesh both inside and outside the subdomain and also through the outer boundary of the subdomain numerical issues related to mesh distortion are avoided using the subdomain further details are available in hawlader et al 2015 a b all the boundaries are placed at a sufficiently large distance from the riser in order to avoid boundary effects the bottom and all the vertical boundaries are defined as impermeable surfaces a no slip boundary condition is applied to the bottom which represents zero velocity of soil elements next to this boundary a free slip boundary condition is applied to the right vertical face a symmetry plane boundary condition is applied to the other three vertical faces which implies that the flow of eulerian materials soil water on one side of the plane is a mirror image of the flow on the opposite side the unspecified mesh motion option in cfx is used for the vertical walls this setting allows the mesh node on these faces to move in the vertical direction preserving the quality of mesh during the displacement of the riser the top of the water is defined as an opening to allow water to flow in and out of the domain compared with typical fe modelling the preceding boundary conditions represent rollers in the vertical faces and hinges at the bottom the mudline is defined by the volume fraction tool in cfx the volume fraction of water is 1 0 and clay is 0 above the mudline whereas it is the reverse in the elements below the mudline the riser is modelled as an impermeable wall with no slip boundary condition following the concept of the finite thickness interface element supachawarote et al 2004 jostad and andresen 2004 the shear strength of a thin zone of soil of 10 mm thickness around the riser is modelled as ατy where α 0 and α 1 represent the conditions similar to smooth and rough interfaces respectively and τy is the mobilized shear strength as discussed below 4 shear strength of seabed sediment the undrained shear strength s u can be used to model soil behaviour if water entrainment does not occur however as the behaviour is not undrained when water entrainment occurs the symbol τy is used for mobilized shear strength fig 3 shows the shear strength degradation curve that is used in the present study where the first segment ab represents the undrained remoulding of clay experimental evidence shows that s u increases with shear strain rate γ and decreases with accumulated plastic shear strain ξ based on the work of einav and randolph 2005 the following empirical equation is used for the segment ab in fig 3 1 τ y f 1 f 2 s u 0 where f 1 and f 2 represent the strain rate and strain softening effects respectively s u0 is the value of s u at the reference shear strain rate γ ref and prior to any softening in this study f 1 and f 2 are defined as einav and randolph 2005 2 f 1 1 μ log max γ γ ref γ ref 3 f 2 1 s t 1 1 s t e 3 ξ ξ 95 where μ is the rate of change of shear strength per log cycle of γ remoulded sensitivity s t s up s ur in which s up and s ur are the peak and remoulded values of s u respectively for a given γ and ξ95 is the value of ξ at which s u is reduced by 95 of s up s ur equation 3 successfully simulates the degradation of soil resistance during cyclic vertical movement of cylindrical objects if cycling occurs in fully embedded conditions such as in t bar tests zhou and randolph 2009 however if the cycling occurs near the seabed the reduction of vertical resistance is significantly higher than that in a fully embedded condition clukey et al 2005 hodder et al 2008 langford and meyer 2010 for example hodder et al 2008 showed the reduction of vertical resistance by a factor of 7 5 when cyclic loading was applied at w in 0 5d whereas the full flow penetrometer sensitivity was only 2 4 re penetration of the riser which was separated from the seabed during unloading through the water filled trench and water entrainment during cyclic loading caused enhanced soil softening some experimental investigations show that small amplitude cyclic motion could also cause a significant reduction of vertical resistance which is again due to the complex interaction between free water and clay and cannot be explained simply using undrained remoulding clukey et al 2005 however the number of cycles required for a given degree of enhanced softening is higher in small amplitude motions than in large amplitude cyclic loadings where the riser has broken away from the seabed the experimental results clearly show additional strength reduction in the presence of free water however the modelling of free water effects on shear strength degradation is very difficult a number of factors might be involved in this process including water entrainment soil water mixing near the interface increase in pore water pressure and moisture content high plastic shear strain accumulation microchannel formation and erosion of disturbed soil clukey et al 2008a noted that the free water effect might be encompassed in an empirical shear strength degradation function although they did not propose any model or explicitly consider it in numerical modelling note that challenges in soil water interface modelling have been encountered not only for this problem but also in other fields such as riverbed erosion and possible hydroplaning in a submarine debris flow conducting a series of laboratory tests for a wide range of initial water content w across the soil fluid transition phase boukpeti et al 2012 proposed an empirical model for shear strength as a power function of w they also showed that the modelling of shear resistance in a soil mechanics framework better represents the behaviour of this material than fluid mechanics models for the range of water content they considered following the water entrainment concept of de blasio and his co workers for modelling runout of submarine landslides the strength degradation process is divided into two components de blasio et al 2005 elverhøi et al 2005 the first component is due to bond breakage fabric change and particle alignment which result from plastic shear strain accumulation strain softening this type of undrained remoulding occurs without a significant change in moisture content e g cyclic t bar tests in a fully embedded condition the second component of shear strength degradation occurs due to water entrainment in the highly sheared zone near the soil water interface where free water is available this process has been termed shear wetting de blasio 2005 elverhøi et al 2005 for risers the effects of water entrainment were examined using centrifuge modelling both the rate and magnitude soil softening increased significantly when the cyclic displacements were applied to a riser section or penetrometer near the seabed as compared to softening due to cyclic loading at a fully embedded condition where only undrained remoulding occurred without free water entrainment hodder et al 2008 westgate et al 2013 yuan et al 2016 although it is difficult to quantify accurately de blasio 2005 proposed an empirical model for shear strength degradation due to shear wetting as a function of shear strain based on some simplifying assumptions kobayashi et al 2015 made an attempt to incorporate water entrainment effects in a modified cam clay based model the solid line abcd in fig 3 shows the shear strength degradation model used in the present study the line abe represents undrained strain softening eq 1 for a given strain rate in order to incorporate shear wetting effects τy is linearly decreased from τy s u95 to τy τy ld at a large total accumulated shear strain ξld and then maintained constant lines bc cd as shown later large plastic shear strains accumulate mainly near the riser and clay water interface where shear wetting is also possible therefore the shear wetting effect segment bcd is primarily applicable to the highly sheared zones near the clay water interface in summary the mobilized shear resistance is calculated as 4 τ y f 1 1 s t 1 1 s t e 3 ξ ξ 95 s u 0 if ξ ξ 95 f 1 s u 95 s u 95 τ y ld ξ ξ 95 ξ ld ξ 95 if ξ 95 ξ ξ ld f 1 τ y ld if ξ ξ ld note that de blasio 2005 also used an exponential degradation function similar to eq 3 however the strain softening and shear wetting effects have been combined by defining sensitivity as s up s u ld in the present study these effects are modelled separately i e undrained remoulding at ξ ξ95 and shear wetting at ξ ξ95 because the mechanisms of strength degradation are different as discussed it also has the following advantages the soil elements far from free water having 0 ξ ξ95 will experience only undrained remoulding effects if de blasio s 2005 type of model is used these elements will have also some effect of shear wetting because the strength degradation curve has been defined by τy ld which is not realistic for riser cyclic motion as free water is not available note that water entrainment could also reduce ξ95 therefore to capture enhanced soil softening a reduced value of ξ95 has been used to improve the performance of a model for dynamic embedment of pipe near the seabed cheuk and white 2011 the geometry and soil parameters used in the base case analysis are shown in table 1 a uniform τy s u0 of 2 25 kpa is used although it is understood that s u0 might increase with depth in many cases a typical range of s t is 2 5 for offshore sediments kvalstad et al 2001 ranges of ξ95 10 50 and μ 0 05 0 2 have been used in the past for successful modelling of undrained remoulding and strain rate effects respectively randolph 2004 einav and randolph 2005 it is difficult to estimate ξld form the results of physical experiments such as penetrometer cycling because the effects of water entrainment on overall vertical resistance cannot be separated easily in the present study ξld 15 35 and τy ld 0 1 kpa are used further studies are required for a better quantification of these parameters 5 numerical implementation both clay and water are modelled as homogeneous multiphase eulerian materials where the shear behaviour is defined using the dynamic viscosity for water a constant value of dynamic viscosity μdw is used table 1 clay is modelled as a visco plastic non newtonian fluid defining its dynamic viscosity μds as τy γ using the cfx expression language a declarative language in cfx for enhanced simulation the displacement of the riser material properties and desired output variables are defined the cfx does not have any direct option to define shear strength degradation as shown in fig 3 the additional variable option in cfx is used to calculate the accumulated shear strain as required in eq 3 in each time increment γ is called which represents the second invariant of the deviatoric strain rate tensor a scalar quantity multiplying γ by time increment δt the shear strain increment δξ is calculated summing up δξ over the period of analysis the accumulated strain ξ is calculated the authors have developed a special technique in cfx to calculate ξ using the value of γ and ξ the mobilized shear strength is calculated for each element which is then used to update μds 6 results of base case analysis 6 1 penetration and uplift resistance fig 4 a shows the variation of normalized resistance n f s un d e l with normalized depth w ˆ w d e for the base case the undrained shear strength used for normalization s un is 2 3 s u 0 see hawlader et al 2015a b for further discussion as finite thickness interface elements and a no slip riser soil interface condition are used the failure occurs in the soil instead of at the riser soil interface therefore following the concept of gui and bolton 1998 and assuming that the failure occurs at a distance of half of the element thickness from the outer surface of the riser the value of effective diameter d e is calculated as 360 mm 350 mm 2 10 2 mm for 10 mm thick elements just outside the riser fig 4 a shows that both the penetration and uplift resistance decrease with the number of cycles n although the reduction of n per cycle reduces with an increase in n note that if the extraction is continued instead of re penetration at w ˆ 0 25 the uplift resistance will decrease and the riser pipe will be separated from the seabed leaving a trench in some cases as observed in model tests bridge 2005 and simulated by the authors in hawlader et al 2015b the simulation shown in fig 4 a takes only 2 5 h with a 3 4 ghz intel core i7 processor and 12 gb ram to compare large deformation fe analysis is performed using abaqus cel only for penetration from the seabed to w ˆ 0 5 see dutta et al 2014 for further details the present cfx analysis is more than six times faster than abaqus cel analysis the use of a subdomain of fine mesh that moves without any deformation during cyclic motion together with different solution techniques in cfd make cfx simulation computationally very efficient a similar analysis is performed without shear wetting i e strength degradation is modelled by the line abe instead of abcd in fig 3 fig 4 b shows that both penetration and uplift resistance decrease with n however after 6 8 cycles the resistance decreases slowly with cyclic loading as compared to the shear wetting case a comparison of fig 4 a b shows that penetration and uplift resistances are the same in both figures for the first few loading cycles because the initial part of the strength degradation curve segment ab in fig 3 is the same in both simulations however when ξ ξ95 the strength degradation is more in the former case fig 4 a with shear wetting see the vertical distance between lines be and bcd in fig 3 therefore the degradation of resistance continues over a large number of cycles in fig 4 a and provides low resistance as compared to fig 4 b for a better comparison the normalized resistance presented in fig 4 a b is plotted against n in fig 5 following randolph et al 2007 the values of n at the halfway point of riser travel during cyclic loading i e at w 0 375d e in fig 4 are obtained solid circle and triangle in fig 4 the obtained penetration and uplift resistance at a given cycle n i are then normalized by the penetration resistance at w 0 375d e during initial penetration point a in fig 4 which is denoted as n 0 25 assuming that 25 of the average total strain that accumulates in the first cycle is developed at this stage zhou and randolph 2009 and therefore it is considered as n 0 25 similarly n 0 75 at w 0 375d e during the first uplift point c in fig 4 the degradation of resistance with cyclic loading is then examined by defining the ratio of normalized resistances as r n n i n 0 25 the ratio of extraction to penetration resistance for the first cycle n 0 75 n 0 25 is 0 82 and therefore uplift curves in fig 6 start from r n 0 82 this ratio depends on several factors such as soil properties and loading conditions as presented in the parametric study physical model test results also show a wide variation of this ratio bridge et al 2005 hodder et al 2009 the degradation of vertical resistance is related to soil sensitivity s t however the sensitivity of soil s t is not equal to 1 r n even at later cycles for example fig 6 shows that for the no shear wetting case 1 r n at n 30 is 2 64 for penetration which is smaller than s t 4 the following are the main reasons for this difference i considerable softening occurs prior to mobilization of n 0 25 that is used to define r n for the no shear wetting case in fig 6 n 0 25 is 86 of that in a simulation using a rate dependent eq 2 non softening f 2 1 soil model with the other parameters the same as in table 1 ii strain rate effects on shear strength increase the vertical resistance the simulation for the no shear wetting case in fig 6 is continued to 65 cycles and it is found that at n 65 the soil in the failure mechanism is in an almost fully remoulded state f 2 1 s t however because of strain rate effects f 1 1 the mobilized shear strength is greater than the remoulded shear strength iii self weight effects buoyancy influence the uplift resistance simulations with an ideal soil model rate independent and non softening for γ 5 kn m3 base case and γ 0 weightless show that n 0 25 for the former case is 4 higher than that of the latter case a similar trend i e s t 1 r n has been reported for full flow cycling yafrate et al 2009 zhou and randolph 2009 based on large deformation finite element simulations for n 6 zhou and randolph 2009 identified three potential reasons for s t 1 r n i softening prior to mobilization of n 0 25 ii pipe soil interface resistance which they defined as s u0 s t and iii the extent of flow mechanisms outside the fully remoulded zone these aspects are discussed further in later sections 6 2 plastic shear strain fig 7 shows the accumulated plastic shear strain during the 5th 10th 15th and 20th cycles just before the end of penetration to w ˆ 0 5 the figures in the left column fig 7 a d show the results for the no shear wetting case while the right column fig 7 e h is for the shear wetting case at the 5th cycles ξ and instantaneous soil velocity vectors are very similar for both cases fig 7 a e the coloured zone in fig 7 represents the area where enhanced softening occurs when shear wetting is considered ξ 10 i e ξ ξ95 comparison between strains in fig 7 a e shows that shear wetting occurs only in a small zone near the pipe fig 7 e therefore the penetration or extraction resistances in n 5 are almost the same for both cases fig 6 at n 10 the zone of large ξ is slightly smaller in fig 7 f than that in fig 7 b at these strains a considerable strength reduction occurs due to shear wetting and therefore gives low resistance as compared to the no shear wetting case fig 5 with an increase in n high shear strains mainly localise near the riser in the shear wetting case which reduces the strength significantly in that zone therefore in this case soil elements mainly displace through this narrow zone as shown by the instantaneous velocity vectors fig 7 g h however for the no shear wetting case soil elements displace over a large area fig 7 c d as the shear strength decreases significantly when shear wetting is considered this weak soil can displace easily during re penetration and therefore a higher berm near the riser can be formed as shown in fig 7 g h however the berm shape is different when shear wetting is not considered the highly softened soil around the riser might be eroded by the flow of this weak soil along the length of the riser during cyclic motion and by the current when it reaches the seabed these factors together with lateral movement could enhance the shear wetting process and trench formation as observed in the field bridge 2005 the effects of these factors need to be studied further 6 3 suction under riser during uplift the total pressure on a soil element has two components i the ambient water pressure u 0 which is considered as a reference pressure ii the pressure p that comes from the difference between the density of soil and water and loading during the vertical movement of the pipe in the numerical simulation p is calculated in each time increment when p is less than zero the total pressure is less than the initial ambient water pressure which represents the suction fig 8 shows the suction ve value of p 0 under the riser during the 5th 10th 15th and 20th cycles just before re penetration at w ˆ 0 25 the contour intervals of suction are shown in logarithmic scale for clarity note that although cycle numbers are the same as before because of additional upward displacement of 0 25d ξ at this stage is higher than the values shown in fig 7 but the pattern of ξ is very similar to fig 7 and therefore it is not shown again instead the development of suction is examined which is also an important parameter for design comparison of figures in the left and right columns of fig 8 shows that suction reduces with the number of cycles when shear wetting is considered the suction pulls the soil elements down toward the invert of the riser the extent of zone and magnitude of suction reduce with n in the shear wetting case because of the shear strength reduction with n however the reduction is not significant when shear wetting is not considered and therefore a very small change in uplift resistance is calculated after n 5 fig 6 langford and meyer 2010 conducted model tests using a 174 mm diameter riser section cycled in highly plastic west african clay where the pore pressure was measured at the invert of the riser their test configuration was different from the present study s u0 5 7 kpa and cycled between w ˆ 0 and w ˆ 0 5 however a negative pore pressure of 10 kpa at the first cycle and its gradual reduction with the number of cycles were found this trend is similar to the simulated suction presented in fig 8 e 8 h one important observation is that when shear wetting is considered a trough above the clay water interface is formed in the highly softened soil fig 8 f h the size of the trough increases with n during extraction water gushes toward the trough as shown by instantaneous velocity vectors of water above the clay water interface the bottom of the trough e g point b in fig 8 h progresses deeper than the highest point of the clay sticks to the pipe surface point a note that based on experimental observation clukey et al 2008a suggested that during uplift clay might adhere to the riser while failure might occur through the soil the present simulation with shear wetting can explain that process when shear wetting is not considered this type of trough does not form fig 8 d 7 parametric study a parametric study is performed for the shear wetting case varying only one parameter while the other parameters are the same as in the base case table 1 7 1 effect of μ the value of μ could vary between 0 05 and 0 2 einav and randolph 2005 lehane et al 2009 fig 9 shows a very small difference between r n n curves with μ 0 05 0 2 for both penetration and extraction resistance note however that n i and n 0 25 increase with μ although their ratio r n is almost the same for all 4 values of μ for example n 0 25 is 6 4 and 7 9 for μ 0 11 and μ 0 2 respectively in summary μ has a negligible effect on r n and therefore r n is a better parameter to describe cyclic degradation vertical resistance than n i 7 2 effect of st the remoulded sensitivity of offshore clays typically varies between 2 and 5 kvalstad et al 2001 andersen and jostad 2004 randolph 2004 as shown in fig 3 with an increase in s t the point b shifts downward meaning that the shear strength degrades quickly with ξ at the early stage as a result both penetration and extraction resistances decrease quickly for a high s t as shown in fig 10 however r n is almost the same for all three values of s t at a large n during this stage significantly high strains generate around the riser fig 7 and therefore the shear strength degrades to τy ld which is the same for all three cases 7 3 effect of ξ95 fig 11 shows that r n decreases quickly with a decrease in ξ95 because the lower the value of ξ95 the faster the degradation of strength fig 3 similar to fig 10 r n is almost the same at large n because the shear strength degrades to τy ld at this stage near the riser 7 4 effect of ξld while s t and ξ95 primarily affect the shape of the initial part of the strength degradation curve ξ ξ95 ξld mainly influences the latter part at large values of ξ fig 3 fig 12 shows that ξld does not have a significant influence on r n up to 4 cycles however with an increase in n the zone of large plastic shear strains ξ95 ξ ξld around the riser increases where the strength degrades quickly for a small value of ξld therefore at a given n 4 r n is smaller for smaller values of ξld again r n will be almost the same for all three values of ξld if the analysis is continued for a large number of cycles because the shear strength in the failure mechanism will degrade to τy ld 7 5 effect of initial embedment win depending upon the location of riser section with respect to tdp installation and loading conditions a section of riser might have different initial depths of embedment and experience cyclic loading of different amplitudes fig 13 shows that r n decreases quickly with n for shallow initial penetration depths this trend is similar to the first episode of 20 cycles of hodder et al 2009 where they showed that the slope of the load displacement curve stiffness decreases rapidly for a shallow initial embedment at a large n the uplift resistance is almost the same for this range of w in because the localized shear strength of highly softened clay at high ξ mainly governs the extraction behaviour however for penetration r n in the later cycles increases with an increase in w in because unlike extraction the penetration behaviour is also influenced by the less softened clay outside the highly softened zone and this influence increases for deeper conditions this has been verified by examining clay velocity vectors at these stages 7 6 effect of cyclic amplitude a experimental evidence shows that small to large amplitude riser motion could cause significant degradation of vertical resistance clukey et al 2008b hodder et al 2009 langford and meyer 2010 fig 14 shows the variation of r n with n for two amplitudes a 0 1d e 0 25d e for w ˆ in 0 5 because of higher displacement of the riser in each cycle r n decreases quickly with n for a 0 25d e and becomes almost constant after n 25 the reduction of r n with n is slow for the smaller amplitude motion of a 0 1d e and the reduction continues right up to 60 cycles a similar trend of decreasing resistance for small amplitude motions has been reported from physical model tests clukey et al 2005 very large amplitude motions near the tdp are expected during storm events although this does not occur frequently moreover the effect of water flow in the trench along the riser is more significant near the tdp this has not been simulated in the present study 7 7 effect of riser soil interface behaviour in previous sections α 0 5 is used to define the interface elements shear strength the effects of α are examined in this section by conducting simulations with two limiting values of α 1 0 for rough and 0 01 for smooth and these simulations are continued for a large number of cycles n 65 fig 15 shows the variation of r n which is calculated using n 0 25 for the corresponding interface condition the values of n 0 25 for rough and smooth conditions are 6 32 and 5 69 respectively as shown α does not have a significant influence on the reduction of r n with the number of cycles the extent of soil failure mechanism is presented in fig 16 using instantaneous velocity vectors and strain rates for three different cycles drawing two lines in these figures the level of soil softening in the failure mechanism is divided into three zones undrained remoulding shear wetting and large strain shear resistance i e segments ab bc and cd in fig 3 for both interface conditions the zone of failure mechanism contracts during early cycles and then expands in later cycles for the rough condition the lateral extent near the seabed from the centre of the riser is 1 5d at n 10 which is reduced to 1 0d at n 26 and finally increased to 1 35d at n 65 fig 16 a c during early cycles the shear strength of soil elements near the riser is reduced because of strain softening which causes the soil to displace through this softened zone and therefore the extent of the failure mechanism is reduced however when a sufficient thickness of soil near the riser is softened to τy ld the higher strain rate near the riser gives a higher mobilized shear resistance which causes gradual expansion of the failure mechanism during later cycles a similar trend is found for the smooth condition fig 16 d f although the extent of the failure mechanism is different however it does not have a significant influence on the reduction of r n for rough and smooth cases as shown in fig 15 as discussed the vertical resistance has two components i soil resistance that acts opposite to the direction of movement of the riser and ii buoyancy acting upward a number of factors e g the shape of the berm soil resistance and depth of embedment influence the buoyancy force merifield et al 2009 in the present study as the berm size and shape and soil resistance change the contribution of buoyancy to the vertical resistance varies with cyclic loading and also in the penetration and extraction phases moreover even though the soil underneath the riser moves upward during extraction the entire failure mechanism is not a true example of a reverse penetration mechanism at the same depth compare figs 7 and 8 in fact a segment of the riser s surface separates from the soil during extraction fig 8 because of these two factors i e buoyancy contribution and soil failure mechanism r n is smaller in extraction than in penetration moreover the consideration of strain rate increases the vertical resistance therefore 1 r n may not approach sup τy ld even after a very large number of cycle 8 conclusions numerical modelling of the penetration and extraction behaviour of a section of riser subjected to cyclic vertical motion at shallow depths is presented in this study in order to capture the role of free water in the trench and suction under the riser during extraction the numerical simulation is performed using a computational fluid dynamics approach with ansys cfx software a strain rate and strain softening dependent model for shear strength of clay is used in addition to undrained remoulding the potential effect of water entrainment in the highly sheared zone is incorporated in the shear strength degradation model using the concept of shear wetting the present cfx model can simulate the flow large deformation of clay and water around the riser together with the formation of trench and berm during cyclic loading the following conclusions are drawn from this study a the decrease in vertical resistance primarily occurs during 10 25 cycles of loading and thereafter it occurs slowly the shear wetting increases the magnitude and rate of reduction of vertical resistance as compared to that for undrained remoulding only without shear wetting the additional reduction of vertical resistance in the shear wetting cases supports experimental observation and cannot be explained with undrained remoulding only b when shear wetting is considered the extent of the soil failure mechanism around the riser reduces in early cycles because of a reduction of the shear strength of the soil that flows through this narrow zone the failure mechanism then expands with continued cyclic loading the process of contraction and expansion of the failure mechanism is influenced by riser soil interface resistance the enhanced soil softening also causes the reduction of suction under the riser during extraction c the rate of reduction of the normalized resistance ratio r n with the number of cycles decreases with an increase in initial depth of embedment and increases with cyclic loading amplitude d the normalized resistance ratio is almost independent of strain rate although the resistance itself increases with strain rate the rate of reduction of the normalized resistance ratio with the number of cycles increases with the model parameters that accelerate the soil strength degradation process such as high sensitivity low ξ95 and low ξld finally although the inclusion of an empirical shear wetting model could better explain the reduction of resistance as observed in physical experiments which cannot be explained using the remoulded sensitivity only the complex process of water entrainment and its effects on shear resistance need to be studied further moreover the effects of a number of factors such as combined vertical lateral cyclic motion as examined through centrifuge modelling yuan et al 2016 erosion of highly softened sediment and its reconsolidation should be investigated acknowledgements the work presented in this

23181,numerical simulations of a rigid stationary bluff body were performed using three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd and validated against published data bluff body cross sections such as the circle semi circle straight edged triangle concave edged triangle and convex edged triangle were modelled at a reynolds number of 10 000 in ansys fluent v17 1 the streamwise and transverse wake energy components were investigated using fourier analysis to analyse the spatial and temporal concentration of bluff bodies the simulation results of the circular cylinder are compared against known experimental values and there was good agreement for the flow characteristics the time averaged energy in the wake for all the shapes does not present significant augmentation in the wake except for a 60 increase in the streamwise kinetic energy near the surface of the cylinder due to a jetting effect spatial concentration maxima for the temporal fluctuations in kinetic energy components u and v occur between a streamwise distance of 1 x d 3 and a transverse distance of 0 y d 1 and occur mostly at the shedding frequency since wiv is vibration that is enhanced by fluctuations in the wake a cross section which increases temporal energy can lead to more energy captured by such a system changing the cross section of the cylinder changes the distribution of the wake energy where the convex

population increased energy consumption and desire for improved quality of life bilgen et al 2008 future energy needs and its sources are a popular topic among environmentalists governments and scientists around the world a large proportion of energy is produced via combustion of non renewable fossil fuels which are dwindling due to their limited quantities kaltschmitt et al 2007 the desire to transition to more sustainable energy and low carbon intensity are major drivers of new environmental policies and technology development renewable energy sources are expected to play a key role in this transition however it is predicted that by the year 2035 global energy demand will increase by 53 over the level in 2008 while renewable energy sources are predicted to increase to only 16 over the same period useia 2011 hence there is an interest in exploring other avenues to find viable clean and abundant energy sources besides wind solar geothermal and hydro electric based on hydrostatic head pressure energy sources hydrokinetic energy based on the kinetic energy in flows and waves is a widely untapped resource of renewable energy energy convertors for hydrokinetic energy can be classified by the nature of the utilized space in which they operate hydrokinetic energy convertors include point absorbers such as surface buoys johnson and pride 2010 line absorbers such as the pelamis attenuator lagoun et al 2010 horizontal surface patch absorbers such as oscillating water columns heath 2012 vertical surface absorbers such as turbines and open propellers batten et al 2006 and three dimensional space absorbers such as devices which operate using vortex induced vibrations viv for example the vortex induced vibration for aquatic clean energy vivace converter bernitsas et al 2009 turbines which are the most popular hydrokinetic energy convertor operate at efficiencies of about 20 55 hansen 2015 vries 1983 and usually need high start up flow speeds khan et al 2009 flow energy can be split up in to spatial and temporal energy the definition arises from the steady component and the unsteady fluctuating component in the flow the steady component is defined as the mean component of the flow which gives a steady value over time whereas the unsteady component arises from fluctuations in the flow hence spatial flow energy concentrators would perform better in situations with steady flow conditions i e upstream of turbines whilst temporal flow concentrators are needed for devices which operate utilising the temporal flow energy spatial flow energy concentrators such as diffusers have been analysed ever since the betz limit was established for turbines and other vertical surface absorbers dick 1984 in theory diffusers can result in a combined system efficiency of 89 hansen et al 2000 jamieson 2008 however in practice duct augmented turbines have not been able to reach such a high power coefficient khan et al 2009 diffusers fall under the class of spatial energy concentrators where energy is augmented at specific locations in the flow field there are many different types of diffusers and each has their own merits and limitations gaden and bibeau 2006 ohya et al 2001 ponta and dutt 2000 ponta and jacovkis 2008 setoguchi et al 2004 in addition to spatial concentration temporal concentration can further increase power densities that can be obtained from a hydrokinetic energy convertor system a combination of spatial and time dependant energy concentration i e temporal concentration can be achieved using bluff bodies as shown in previous studies assi 2009 bernitsas et al 2008 derakhshandeh et al 2014 the concentration is time specific due to the characteristic von karman vortex street that forms in the wakes of bluff bodies circular cylinders have received the most attention amongst bluff bodies in a cross flow there are numerous review papers on the vibration response of single circular cylinders and the factors that affect it due to early research being focused on mitigating the phenomenon to reduce failure in engineered structures king 1977 sarpkaya 1979 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 the current state of art has shifted focus to harness the vibrations in bluff bodies exposed to cross flow to produce useful clean and renewable energy bernitsas et al 2008 derakhshandeh et al 2014 2015a 2016 hansen et al 2000 in viv energy harnessing systems it has been identified that tandem bodies result in higher power efficiencies when compared to the single bluff body case because they can generate a larger temporal component a stationary upstream bluff body in a flow produces a vortex street and hence the downstream body operates in a wake containing spatially and temporally concentrated hydrokinetic energy transverse vibration amplitudes of cylinders undergoing viv are about 3 times greater than the streamwise amplitudes and hence been of more interest for energy generating potential bernitsas et al 2008 hobbs and hu 2012 wang and ko 2010 there exist two different classes of devices which utilise viv for energy generation and this is based on the energy output of the device many small scale devices using a combination of viv and piezoelectric transduction have been investigated to provide power for wireless sensing devices although these devices can vary in configuration most of them use a circular or triangular cross section bluff body to produce vortices which impinge on to a beam containing piezoelectric materials these devices usually provide power in the order of milli watts and have very low efficiencies hobbs and hu 2012 wang and ko 2010 weinstein et al 2012 larger scale devices which operate using viv are aimed at providing useful energy to the grid from low speed currents in oceans and rivers a prototype known as the vortex induced vibration aquatic clean energy vivace generator was developed by bernitsas et al 2008 who pioneered the energy harnessing potential of viv and have continued to research the field bernitsas et al 2009 bernitsas and raghavan 2004 bernitsas et al 2008 chang et al 2011 lee and bernitsas 2011 the theoretical efficiency of power conversion for viv of a single cylinder unit was calculated to be 37 at a reynolds number of 100 000 however the maximum power obtained via experiments conducted on a single cylinder system was 22 this sparked more interest in the field to improve the energy harnessing efficiency from viv very recent experimental work by ding et al 2016 demonstrated that higher efficiencies η 37 can be obtained at lower reynolds numbers re 60 000 using passive turbulence control by attaching roughness strips to the cylinder most research on viv for energy has been performed on circular cylinders due to the abundant research available on the flow features of a circular cylinder braza et al 1986 cantwell and coles 1983 ong and wallace 1996 williamson 1996 derakhshandeh et al 2014 have shown the feasibility of vortex and wake induced vibrations viv and wiv respectively to harness hydrokinetic energy a transverse spacing of 0 y d 1 and streamwise spacing of 3 x d 4 between tandem staggered cylinders provided maximum energy harnessing efficiency η 48 4 for a cylinder with diameter equal to d at a reynolds number of 65 000 derakhshandeh et al 2014 the power generating potential of viv has been confirmed by these studies and further work in particular on the flow field in between the cylinders is required to identify an efficient and realisable system other bluff bodies have also been tested for the purpose of flow induced motion fim although the vibration responses of single bluff bodies such as square cylinders amandolèse and hémon 2010 barrero gil and fernandez arroyo 2013 nemes et al 2012 triangular prisms alonso and meseguer 2006 alonso et al 2005 and a comparison between various bodies ding et al 2015 have been studied in extant literature analysis of the energy concentration in their wake has not been investigated additionally these investigations analysed the vibration responses of the bodies but there has been no mention of the energy in the wake produced by bodies of different cross sections past studies have established that a bluff body placed with proper spacing in front of a vibrating bluff body enhances the viv response of the downstream body derakhshandeh et al 2016 the spacing has been varied to find the optimum spacing that results in high power efficiency for the system for various shapes and sizes of cylinders the attributing cause to the response is due to impedance matching which occurs when the velocity of the vibrating body and the forces acting on it are in phase however extant literature has not yet identified the contribution of the frequency and magnitude of the velocity components that attribute to a higher energy harnessing potential it is clear from previous studies that the concentration in the wake of a bluff body is not only spatial in nature but has a temporal attribute as well due to the unsteady components which occur at different frequencies and velocities there exists a gap in the understanding of the contribution of the different wake velocity components to the energy in the wake and how these components result in the temporal and spatial concentration of the upstream energy in the flow understanding the factors which contribute to the observed responses can lead to knowledge on how these components can be manipulated to result in a high efficiency system based on the above this work aims to start this investigation by developing a validated computational fluid dynamics cfd and fourier analysis on the wake of different bluff bodies to characterise the spatial and temporal variation of the streamwise and transverse velocity components u and v respectively although there are many different bluff bodies the circular cylinder was considered in this paper as a starting point of investigation since there are numerous experimental data available for the validation of the circular cross section following the circular cylinder several other cross sections such as the semi circular cylinder and equilateral triangles with curved sides were analysed the proceeding section details the methodology utilized in this paper which is followed by the results and their discussion and finally the main findings are summarised in the conclusion 2 method transient velocity data in the wake of the cylinder are needed to analyse the contribution of the streamwise and crosswise components to gather these data three dimensional 3d cfd simulations were performed using ansys fluent v 17 1 a 3d model was simulated in order to resolve the turbulent spectrum using the sas model rather than compute the isotropic turbulence that is characteristic of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models even though the cfd model was performed in 3d only the velocities in the transverse and streamwise directions were collected and used for analysis as the primary focus was on the distribution of the transverse fluctuations which contribute to the transverse vibrations that are desired in wiv systems a validated cfd model was deemed appropriate for the purpose of this research due to the existence of experimental data available at high reynolds numbers for circular cylinders a circular cylinder was used as the bluff body since it is the most investigated bluff body for viv and serves as a good starting point for the wake analysis a reynolds number of 10 000 was used since it is still in the transition in the shear layer regime zdravkovich 1997 as well as being high enough to cover real world applications existing experimental and computational work were available to validate the cfd model a detailed account of the methods and validation used for the circular cylinder case are presented in this section 2 1 grid definition the mesh for the flow domain was created using the ansys meshing software and the resulting mesh is shown in fig 1 the first layer height of 0 0017d was chosen to maintain a non dimensional wall distance y plus of 1 near the cylinder wall region sensitivity of the mesh size was also tested by using three different sizes for each type of mesh the details of the different meshes used are given in table 1 and grid 2 proved to be sufficient for this analysis 2 2 numerical method and mathematical modelling the 3d form of the incompressible navier stokes equations was solved using a finite volume scheme with second order spatial and temporal discretization the pressure based solver was used and solved with double precision the domain used for this study is presented in fig 1 the rectangular fluid domain extends 25d downstream of the cylinder and 5d on either side where the diameter d of the cylinder is 30 mm the cylinder is placed 5d from the velocity inlet and has a span wise depth of 3d which is similar to that used in other published cfd work cao and xiang 2001 derakhshandeh et al 2014 wei et al 1995 the large boundary distances were chosen to negate blockage effects and to prevent reversed flow from the pressure outlet the transverse boundary spacing results in a blockage ratio of about 4 which can be considered negligible as shown in previous studies derakhshandeh et al 2014 wanderley et al 2008 the top and bottom boundaries and the span wise boundaries were defined as free slip walls to negate blockage effects and to prevent boundary layers developing on these surfaces a no slip wall condition was applied to the cylinder wall and the mesh was concentrated around the cylinder to accurately resolve the boundary layer the streamwise x transverse y and spanwise z distances are measured from the centre of the cylinder the navier stokes equations for the conservation of mass equation 2 1 and momentum equation 2 2 for three dimensional viscous incompressible flow with constant density are solved in the cfd model and are as follows 2 1 u i x i 0 2 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ϑ 2 u i x j 2 u i u j x j where x represents the directionu is the mean velocity component in x y and z directions u is the fluctuating component of the velocity ρ is the density of the fluid p denotes the pressure the term u i u j presents the reynolds stress component which is defined in terms of a turbulent viscosity ϑ t as 2 3 u i u j x j ϑ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 k δ i j where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and δ i j is the kronecker delta function the scale adaptive simulation sas model which is a form of scale resolving simulations srs was used to model the turbulence in the cfd simulation the sas model is an improved form of the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans formulation and differs from classic urans models in its ability to resolve the turbulence spectrum the urans models such as sst are only able to model large scale unsteadiness whereas the sas model can resolve spectral content in the detached regions turbulence length scale in the sas model is resolved by considering the definition of von karman length scale sas overcomes the deficiency of other urans models in resolving the turbulence length scale by considering the definition of von karman length scale this assists in more accurately to capturing the vortex structure in the wake of the structure the von karman length scale is given by 2 4 l v k k u y 2 u y 2 the sas model uses the von karman length scale to adapt its behaviour to srs according to the stability parameters of the flow egorov et al 2010 and provides a balance between the contributions of the simulated and resolved parts of the turbulence stresses hence the model can effectively and automatically switch from the large eddy simulation les mode to the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans mode menter and egorov 2010 further derivation and information on this model can be found in menter and egorov 2010 and in ansys help version 17 1 0 compared to reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models such as the k ω shear stress transport sst model sas is able to capture vortical structures effectively as shown by previous studies derakhshandeh et al 2014 2016 identical initial and boundary conditions were used for all the cases a time step size of 0 5 ms was needed to satisfy the courant friedrichs lewy condition cfl 1 which is essential for convergence of the cfd simulation however the simulations for test cases 2 and 3 were run at both 0 1 m s and 1 m s and there was no difference observed in the results for the drag coefficient lift coefficient and strouhal number hence a time step of 1 m s was chosen for the rest of the simulations the chosen time step was also sufficient to resolve the time scales in the fluid flow as there are approximately 416 time steps per vortex shedding cycle shedding frequency 2 2 hz a streamwise velocity of 0 335 m s was defined at the inlet boundary and the outlet had a gauge pressure of 0 pa this inlet velocity resulted in a reynolds number of 10 000 computed using properties of water at 25 c density ρ 997 1 and dynamic viscosity μ 0 001003 results showed that the shear layers first form on either side of the cylinder and start to interact to produce the vortex street as the simulation time progresses hence the solution needs to be allowed to establish in order for the vortex street to fully develop and regular vortex shedding is observed the model was initialised with a steady state solution in order to reduce the time for established flow the cfd model was deemed to be established when steady state sinusoidal behaviour is observed for the lift and drag coefficients of the cylinder which occurred within 10 s of flow time from the start of the simulation a convergence criterion of 10 5 was used for all the residuals and this resulted in a maximum of 12 iterations for each time step 2 3 post processing methods transient velocity data were gathered in the cylinder wake along the spanwise centre 1 5d away from the symmetry walls of the domain during the simulation the wake velocity data were time averaged to analyse the mean components and decomposed using fast fourier transforms fft to identify the contribution of the fluctuating velocity components u and v utilising this information the kinetic energy due to these components was computed velocity data from 10 000 time steps were used as the input for the fft analysis of the wake the fft analysis was used to identify the dominant frequencies of the fluctuating components as well as the magnitude at which they appear in the wake the pwelch function in matlab was used to perform a welch s power spectrum estimate of the fluctuating streamwise and transverse velocity components the transient velocity data were de trended and the dc mean was removed from the signal the data were then normalised using the freestream velocity 0 335 m s a flat top window was used with 50 overlap to get the magnitude of the power at different frequencies in the power spectrum the fft used 10000 points to have sufficient resolution for the frequencies considered whilst still managing to capture the peak from the power spectrum the output from the velocity power spectrum has units of m2 s2 and hence represents the normalised energy contained in the fluctuating component at the frequency of interest the energy obtained from the spectrum was a ratio compared to the available free stream energy since the input to the welch power spectrum was the velocity data normalised by the free stream velocity these data were used to analyse the temporal and spatial distribution of the wake augmented energy which can then be correlated to identify optimum locations for known wake energy extractors wees this was accomplished by identifying the shedding frequency and its harmonics occurring in the wake and then finding the magnitude of energy contribution from the power spectrum 2 4 validation of the cfd model the cfd model was validated using experimental data from previous publications to demonstrate the accuracy of the model the pressure coefficient on the surface of the cylinder was compared to the experimental data at similar reynolds numbers dong et al 2006 the equation used to calculate the pressure coefficient is given below with a description of

the pressure coefficient distribution obtained from the cfd simulation showed a similar trend to experimental values and had a minimum around 70 which agrees well with extant literature dong et al 2006 norberg 1992 the independence of the solution from the grid was analysed by testing the three different mesh configurations the mesh sizes were varied and integral parameters such as the mean drag coefficient c d the back pressure c pb root mean square r m s lift coefficient c l and strouhal number s t were monitored in the current work and are presented in table 2 along with values from experiments based on these results grid 2 and 3 had a difference of less than 5 for the parameters considered and hence case 2 was used for this paper and the drag and lift coefficients are plotted in fig 3 further validation of the model was done by comparing the mean streamwise velocity at the centreline to data published by norberg 1998 the comparison is displayed in fig 4 and a reasonable agreement less than 10 difference was observed 3 results this section contains the post processed results of the unsteady wake velocity data which were exported from the cfd simulation considering the two dimensional wake behind a circular cylinder the wake has streamwise and transverse linear velocity components in addition to a rotational component due to the vorticity the velocity field can be split up in to the mean u and v and fluctuating u and v components of the transverse and streamwise velocity thus the energy in the wake arises from the mean and fluctuating parts of the streamwise and transverse components due to the temporal nature of the vortex street the instantaneous energy density will also fluctuate with time this is the concept of temporal energy concentration and is observed when the time dependant data are analysed in this section the frequencies at which the fluctuating components occur are presented as multiples of the shedding frequency since the dominant frequencies observed were all harmonics of the shedding frequency all the energy magnitudes inferred to in this paper are normalised using the available freestream energy in the flow upstream of the cylinder and hence are an indication of the ratio of energy concentration by the cylinder the definition of the energy terms derived for the temporal wake analysis is given in equations 3a and 3f the primary shedding frequency was identified for each shape and the corresponding magnitude for that frequency was taken from the power spectrum since most of the temporal energy is found at the vortex shedding frequency the temporal investigation only includes the normalised energy found at the primary shedding frequency for each bluff body contour maps of the resulting magnitudes at their respective locations were used to observe the trends in temporal wake energy mean normalised streamwise energy 3a e u u 2 u 0 2 mean normalised transverse energy 3b e v v 2 u 0 2 mean normalised

spatial energy distribution in the wake the time averaged values of the streamwise transverse and spanwise velocities were used to plot the non dimensional mean energy due to each of these components u v w as depicted in figs 5 7 respectively the energy is normalised using the energy available in the flow upstream of the cylinder as the flow approaches the cylinder there is a reduction in the u energy followed by an increase near the surface of the cylinder the wake has a lower energy than the freestream as the flow is recovers to the freestream condition the highest value for the mean streamwise energy is close to the surface of the cylinder and is attributed to flow accelerating up around the cylinder due to the blockage to the flow caused by the cylinder the aft part of the cylinder has the minimum point for energy from u due to the low velocity region caused by the recirculating flow the mean transverse energy v is much lower in general when compared to the mean streamwise energy u which was to be expected the normalised energy due to v plotted in fig 6 shows a single peak of energy at about one diameter downstream of the cylinder due to the interaction between the shear layers from the top and bottom surfaces of the cylinder which is where the large scale vortices are formed the time averaged energy of the transverse component does not display a significant augmentation effect in the wake because the time dependency of the energy peaks is not taken in to effect and hence the fluctuations cancel each other out the streamwise component on the other hand has almost double the energy compared to the upstream flow near the surface of the cylinder this is due to the high velocity shear layer which forms around the surface of the cylinder the time averaged spanwise energy component has a very low magnitude and is almost 104 times less than the other time averaged energy components fig 7 hence e w is not very useful for harvesting energy from wiv 3 2 fluctuating temporal energy distribution in the cylinder wake fourier analyses were performed on the transient velocity data field in matlab to identify the frequency of the fluctuations and the magnitude at which the unsteady components appear in the wake of the cylinder fourier analysis was performed on the normalised velocity data and the harmonic frequencies that appear in the wake were identified a power spectrum of the data utilising a flat top window was used to extract the magnitude of energy due to u and v at the harmonic frequencies the frequencies at which maxima appeared on the fft plots were all harmonics of the primary shedding frequency of the cylinder this section only contains contours of the fluctuating components at the shedding frequency fs and not the other frequencies as the magnitude of the normalised energy at the other frequencies was at least an order of magnitude less than the primary shedding frequency fig 8 displays the fft plots for u and v at different x d and y d locations in the wake of the circular cylinder and highlights the difference in magnitude the frequencies were normalised using the shedding frequency to display the magnitudes at consecutive harmonics of the vortex shedding frequency figs 9 11 depict the contour maps of the normalised streamwise transverse and spanwise energy fluctuations at the shedding frequency as shown in fig 11 the energy contained in w is negligible 103 times lower in magnitude when compared to the other fluctuating velocity components u and v the spanwise velocity component has negligible energy content compared to the other components and hence will not be investigated further in this study to further prove the 2 dimensionality of the energy content in the wake of the cylinder in this study 2d cfd simulations were performed using the surface mesh from the 3d analysis the energy contour maps of the 2d and 3d simulation for e u e v e u fs and e v fs are presented side by side in fig 12 where the maximum energy zones are similar in magnitude and location between the 2d and 3d simulations analysis of energy in the harmonic frequencies showed that the zones containing the maximum energy due to u and v alternate between y d 0 and 0 5 between the different harmonic frequencies however at any given frequency the maxima for the streamwise and transverse fluctuations never occur in the same location the location of the maximum transverse energy fluctuation is between 1 x d 2 whilst the maximum streamwise fluctuation is located between 0 x d 2 for all the harmonic frequencies another interesting observation was that there is a higher maximum magnitude of the fluctuating transverse energy at the third harmonic 6hz compared to the second harmonic 4hz this correlates to the secondary peak that is usually seen at the third harmonic of the shedding frequency for a cylinder undergoing viv at high reynolds numbers branković and bearman 2006 and odd harmonics are common in harmonic distortions arising from non linear processes 3 3 variation of the energy components at different transverse locations variation of the normalised fluctuating energy components with the streamwise distance from the cylinder at a given transverse location y d 0 0 5 or 1 is displayed in fig 13 these results were used to compare the magnitudes of the fluctuating energy components in relation to the mean components only y d 0 0 5 and 1 are included to exhibit the observed trends since at greater transverse distances from the cylinder only small magnitudes for the u component were observed near x d 0 5 and all the other components exhibited no significant augmentation at all y d locations the highest energy component is due to the u velocity this is due to the streamwise direction of the flow the u energy does not recover to unity by the end of the domain in the plots presented since these y d locations are still within the wake of the cylinder and hence experience the effects of reduced velocity flow energy from fluctuating components occurring at higher harmonics of the shedding frequency is not included to maintain clarity as they are of negligible magnitude the normalised energy due to u and u at the shedding frequency show maxima at x d 1 and y d 0 5 this is due to the shear layers that are moving towards the centreline of the cylinder the energy due to v at the primary shedding frequency also exhibits a peak at x d 1 due to the propagation of eddies formed in the shear layer the normalised energy magnitude due to v at the primary harmonic exhibited a lower magnitude at y d 0 5 compared to the y d 0 location due to the rapid dissipation of vorticity when the shear layers interact with each other when y d 0 and 0 5 the mean streamwise energy goes to zero at x d 0 since the cylinder is blocking the flow at these locations at y d 1 there is a maximum of 1 58 fig 13 c for the u energy as this is the region where the flow accelerates around the cylinder although not included in these plots the fluctuating components exhibit small peaks at the second and third harmonics but these peaks are still very low in magnitude and not suitable for energy capture 3 4 energy that can be captured by an energy extractor over one cycle of vortex shedding the betz limit was developed for turbines and rotors in a flow the betz limit also has been applied to shrouded turbines since the concentration by diffusers is internal however the betz limit is not applicable to the cylinder case as no area could be defined to calculate the limit due to the external concentration of the flow the maximum energy that can be captured as a ratio of the upstream energy can be derived if a wake energy extractor wee can move transversely at a fixed streamwise distance to examine the limit of energy extraction it was assumed that a wee can move to the zones of maximum energy at a specific streamwise distance from the cylinder and can absorb all the energy available at that region hence this analysis was pointwise and not spatially averaged as in the preceding section streamwise distances in increments of 0 5d from 0 to 4d from the cylinder were chosen as this range encompassed all the maximum energy points discovered in the previous section it was also assumed that no energy is wasted in the movement these assumptions were necessary to examine the order of magnitude of the energy limit for the external flow concentration by a cylinder the lift data from the cfd simulation were used to identify the vortex shedding cycles in the data gathered once the start and end of a cycle were known the data were split to have 8 frames of analysis for a single cycle the time dependant streamwise and transverse energies were investigated for every 1 8th of a single cycle as a ratio compared to the available freestream energy utilising the maximum streamwise and transverse energy available at each stage of the cycle the maximum energy extractable by a wee was calculated for each streamwise distance from the cylinder the results for the maximum energy extractable are depicted in fig 14 where a contour of the average normalised energy is used as the background for the line plots which show the trend for the streamwise and transverse energy components the maximum obtainable pointwise energy density was at x d 0 from to the streamwise energy this occurred due to the jet that formed on the surface of the cylinder and was almost three times the magnitude of the available upstream flow energy the maximum obtainable transverse energy occurred at x d 1 and had a magnitude of about 1 25 times the oncoming energy if a wee was able to capture both the transverse and the streamwise energies a combined maximum of 3 25 times the free stream energy is available at x d 1 the transverse energy ratio is comparatively lower than the streamwise component due to the streamwise propagation of the flow from the inlet beyond x d 3 the magnitudes of transverse and streamwise energy reduced at a lower rate compared to the near wake as the turbulence dissipated in the far wake 3 5 effect of bluff body cross section the circular cylinder has been extensively reviewed and many experiments exist on viv of the cylinder there has not been any systematic study to investigate the performance of other bluff body cross sections with similar length characteristics operating under the same flow conditions particularly there has been no focus given to the wake characteristics and the differences in downstream flow conditions from the standard circular cylinder configuration varying the bluff body cross section will change the amount of energy in the streamwise and transverse components by investigating these differences it is possible to identify a cross section that will concentrate most of the energy in a carrier that is ideal for energy harnessing e g transverse fluctuations a number of selected cross sections were investigated to identify the differences in wake energy carriers for different bluff bodies and realise a cross section that resulted in increasing the energy concentrated in transverse fluctuations the shapes chosen were a semi circular cylinder an equilateral triangle and a midway shape between the semicircle and the triangle a triangle with convex sides as shown in fig 15 the semi circular cylinder was chosen to investigate the effect of halving the cross section of the circular cylinder such that there is a flat aft edge which would lead to a larger back pressure and hence a larger pressure difference between the fore and aft faces of the cylinder the equilateral triangle was chosen due to its widespread use in piezoelectric systems as the upstream energy concentrator the transition from the semi circular cylinder to the equilateral cylinder resulted in the triangle with convex edged sides and a flat aft face the shapes were simulated such that the aft part of the cylinders was the flat end and hence was downstream of the body and all the cylinders had a characteristic diameter of 30 mm and a length of 90 mm the 3d cfd models for the different cross sections used the same mesh configuration turbulence model and method of analysis as that of the circular cylinder the differences in energy magnitude of the different velocity components were investigated and particular attention was on whether an increase in the transverse fluctuations could be observed as the cfd techniques used were identical to the circular cylinder it is expected that the numerical data are valid for analysis the results of the variation of the components are given in the proceeding subsections results were analysed at increments of 0 1d in the transverse direction and the results for y d 0 0 5 and 1 are presented here and a detailed comparison is given in section 4 3 5 1 semi circular cylinder the magnitudes of the energy components for the semi circular cylinder are plotted in fig 16 the shedding frequency was almost equal to the shedding frequency observed in the full cylinder case since the separation point was approximately the same for both the cases the maximum normalised magnitude of the transverse fluctuations at the shedding frequency was 0 92 and occurs at y d 0 and x d 1 other harmonics have very low energy magnitudes for both the transverse and streamwise energy fluctuations 3 5 2 straight edged equilateral triangle results of the normalised energy magnitudes for the different energy components in the wake of an equilateral triangle are displayed in fig 17 apart from the energy concentration of the mean streamwise component there is no significant concentration of energy observed in the wake by the other velocity components the mean streamwise energy component was similar to the circular cylinder 3 5 3 equilateral triangle with convex sides the magnitudes of the energy components for the equilateral triangle with convex sides are plotted in fig 18 the shedding frequency was higher 2 8 hz than that observed in the circular and semi circular cylinder cases the maximum for the mean streamwise energy is also higher in this case the maximum normalised magnitude of streamwise energy fluctuations at the shedding frequency was around 0 2 and occurred at y d 0 5 and x d 1 the transverse fluctuations of energy at the shedding frequency occur at a higher magnitude than the circular cylinder but occur at the same location of about y d 0 and x d 1 1 5 at transverse distances higher than 0 5d the only significant component observed is the mean streamwise component 4 discussion the results demonstrate the temporal and spatial concentration of energy in a flow using different bluff bodies for the circular cylinder the temporal energy concentration due to the fluctuating components is lower in magnitude compared to the concentration observed in the mean streamwise component the mean streamwise energy component exhibits a large magnitude due to the accelerating shear layer near the surface of the cylinder but this concentrated energy cannot be captured as it is too close to the cylinder s surface and occurs only over a small region it is known that a circular cylinder can be used to convert the mean streamwise energy in to the transverse fluctuations which in turn can contribute to transverse vibrations in a downstream body tuning a system to either the mean or unsteady component will affect the response observed and hence the efficiency of the system there is a possibility of designing smarter wake energy extractors wees which are able to operate at high energy extraction efficiencies by utilising the information known about the locations of maximum magnitude of the components utilising the results gathered about the circular cylinder wake a suitable wee would have to be placed between 1 x d 3 and 0 y d 1 to harness the maxima of the temporal energy u and v and near the boundary of the cylinder to capture the maximum mean streamwise energy due to the jetting effect however if a wee is placed too close to the first body the flow is blocked and hence regions further downstream which have high energy densities are best for energy capturing the energy due to the v component is not very useful as it is lower in magnitude compared to the others fig 9 the oscillating transverse component of the energy in the wake is significant compared to the other temporal fluctuations the unsteady components u and v are maximum near the wake of the cylinder since eddies are produced in the boundary layer of the cylinder and start to dissipate when they form in to the vortex clouds the third harmonic of the transverse velocity oscillations also seem to be a significant contributor to the temporal concentration of energy and corresponds to the secondary peak found in the power spectral density of the oscillation amplitude reported by branković and bearman 2006 an effective wee needs to be able to capture both the mean streamwise energy as well as the transverse fluctuations to maximise the energy extraction efficiency the total temporally averaged energy in the wake of the cylinder would be lower than the energy in a comparable upstream area this is due to energy losses in the flow due to friction and the effects of viscosity however peaks of augmented energy which occur during a vortex shedding cycle and exceed upstream energy densities could be captured to result in a large amount of energy being harnessed energy analysis of the wake showed that if a wee were able to capture the maximum energy regions in a vortex shedding cycle a maximum of 3 25 times the available upstream energy can be harnessed at a streamwise distance of x 1d a wee working further downstream beyond x 3d will be able to harness approximately 1 8 times the available upstream energy these results indicate that there is significant external concentration of energy in the wake due to the cylinder compared to the augmentation factor of about 1 6 for diffusers cylinders can be used to spatially and temporally concentrate energy to achieve higher ratios assuming a wee that is capable of actively harnessing the high energy density regions a significant portion of the augmented energy can be captured and converted to useful energy however this limit was calculated assuming the wee can move to the high energy density regions without losing any energy and is non impacting on the flow field the efficiency of power conversion from the available energy to useful energy also has not been considered a complete system configuration will need to be realised to obtain the actual efficiencies and to investigate whether augmenting and harvesting temporally concentrated energy will achieve a higher efficiency compared to the betz limit it is possible to identify the characteristic diameter of a second cylinder and the operating region where it will be able to harness a maximum amount of energy the vortex shedding of the second cylinder needs to be known to achieve the maximum efficiency from the system configuration when considering bluff bodies a second body that is much smaller in size compared to the first body would benefit in being able to capture the augmented energy a smaller second body has a smaller effect on the flow structure from the upstream body and can capture higher magnitudes of the fluctuating components as demonstrated by the planar averaging results presented in section 3 4 the positions of maximum efficiency found in previous studies with a tandem circular cylinder derakhshandeh et al 2014 and aerofoil derakhshandeh et al 2016 do not match up with the results seen in this study as that position would also depend on the wake of the downstream body and the phase difference between the forces on the body due to its own vortex shedding as well the fluctuations in velocity caused by the upstream body the maximum regions for the spatial and temporal concentration cannot be captured by wee due to the flow field differing significantly when a second body is placed downstream if the streamwise gap is smaller than 1 5d the flow does not separate between the bodies and hence there is no vortex shedding in the gap for rigid bluff bodies igarashi 1981 both bodies behave as one and the shear layer connects the bodies this may be a reason for the smaller gaps not being the place of high power efficiency as reported by others derakhshandeh et al 2014 2015a 2016 the effect of different bluff body cross sections was also briefly investigated in this paper for comparison the results of energy concentration by the different bluff bodies including the circular cylinder are shown in figs 19 22 the mean streamwise component shown in fig 19 exhibits a similar trend along all bluff bodies which has been discussed in the preceding section there is similarity in the recovery of the mean streamwise component for all shapes and at y d 1 5 all the bluff bodies have approximately the same magnitude along x and have a normalised magnitude slightly higher than 1 the mean transverse component some augmentation of energy for both the convex edged and straight edged triangle since the flow gets diverted up by the leading edges as expected the straight triangle has a higher magnitude 0 24 than that of the convex edge 0 14 fig 20 shows this trend and the maximum mean transverse component occurs for the straight edged triangular cylinder at y d 0 5 and x d 0 the fluctuating streamwise component is not a significant carrier of the wake energy downstream from the bluff bodies however the near wake x d 0 2 y d 0 5 of bluff bodies such as the semicircular and convex triangle bodies have at least a quarter of the upstream available energy as shown in fig 21 the minimal energy trend observed in the fluctuating streamwise component maybe due to the high energy mean streamwise component which dissipates the fluctuations the fluctuating transverse component has very small magnitudes of energy at transverse distances greater than y d 1 at y d 0 and x d 0 5 the semi circle and convex triangle have magnitudes greater than 1 5 which is much greater than the other bluff bodies fig 22 the semi circle and convex triangle also have larger magnitudes of normalised energy compared to the other bodies at y d 0 5 hence the semi circle and the convex triangle are bluff bodies which are most suited to obtain a wake with more transverse fluctuations 5 conclusions three dimensional cfd simulation of a rigid stationary cylinder was performed to identify the variation of the streamwise and transverse velocity components in the wake spatial and temporal velocity concentration of the flow caused by the cylinder was investigated using fourier analysis of the wake velocity data the fluctuating components of the streamwise and transverse energy components u and v were separated from the mean components u and v there was significant spatial energy concentration due to the mean streamwise velocity component which occurred near the top and bottom surfaces of the circular cylinder due to the blockage by the cylinder the mean transverse component does not display any significant augmentation of energy in the wake the temporal components of velocity contribute to the temporal concentration of energy at different harmonics of the vortex shedding frequency most of the temporal concentration occurs at the shedding frequency due to the large scale von karman vortices shed from the body and the maxima occur at 1 x d 3 and 0 y d 1 the maximum amount of energy that could be captured by an ideal wee assuming that the wee could capture high energy density regions in a single cycle of vortex shedding was also computed a maximum of 3 25 times the available upstream energy can be harnessed at a streamwise distance of x 1d if both the temporally and spatially concentrated energy is harnessed considering an ideal case where the wee can move between high energy density locations at different time steps of the vortex shedding cycle a high amount of energy can be captured by a device most of the augmentation from the different energy components occurred in the very near wake of the cylinder a suitable wee which operates using the temporal concentration will operate in the very near wake of the cylinder without changing the flow structure however extant literature suggests a critical spacing of at least 1 5d carmo et al 2008 igarashi 1984 zdravkovich 1997 between in line separated circular cylinders of equal diameter for the vortices to form in the gap between the cylinders current viv systems seem to be utilising a combination of the temporal and spatial concentration where the location of maximum efficiency is when the contribution from the unsteady components is in phase to the contribution from the steady components the effect of varying the cross section of the cylinder was investigated using shapes such as the semi circle straight edged triangle concave edged triangle and convex edged triangle the spatial concentration of the bodies varied very little from that of the circular cylinder however there was a significant increase in the temporal concentration of wake energy by the convex edged triangle and the semi circular cylinder hence these bodies would be ideal for use as primary bodies in wiv systems where they can provide a large amount of energy in the form of transverse fluctuations in the wake the influence of the second body significantly changes the flow field and hence future work should investigate the spatial and temporal analysis of tandem bodies to identify how the flow field is different however this paper has identified the concept of spatial and temporal concentration in the wake of cylinder and the methods which can be used to analyse the flow field and identify crucial factors that can be used to improve the design of viv energy harnessing systems 
23181,numerical simulations of a rigid stationary bluff body were performed using three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd and validated against published data bluff body cross sections such as the circle semi circle straight edged triangle concave edged triangle and convex edged triangle were modelled at a reynolds number of 10 000 in ansys fluent v17 1 the streamwise and transverse wake energy components were investigated using fourier analysis to analyse the spatial and temporal concentration of bluff bodies the simulation results of the circular cylinder are compared against known experimental values and there was good agreement for the flow characteristics the time averaged energy in the wake for all the shapes does not present significant augmentation in the wake except for a 60 increase in the streamwise kinetic energy near the surface of the cylinder due to a jetting effect spatial concentration maxima for the temporal fluctuations in kinetic energy components u and v occur between a streamwise distance of 1 x d 3 and a transverse distance of 0 y d 1 and occur mostly at the shedding frequency since wiv is vibration that is enhanced by fluctuations in the wake a cross section which increases temporal energy can lead to more energy captured by such a system changing the cross section of the cylinder changes the distribution of the wake energy where the convex

population increased energy consumption and desire for improved quality of life bilgen et al 2008 future energy needs and its sources are a popular topic among environmentalists governments and scientists around the world a large proportion of energy is produced via combustion of non renewable fossil fuels which are dwindling due to their limited quantities kaltschmitt et al 2007 the desire to transition to more sustainable energy and low carbon intensity are major drivers of new environmental policies and technology development renewable energy sources are expected to play a key role in this transition however it is predicted that by the year 2035 global energy demand will increase by 53 over the level in 2008 while renewable energy sources are predicted to increase to only 16 over the same period useia 2011 hence there is an interest in exploring other avenues to find viable clean and abundant energy sources besides wind solar geothermal and hydro electric based on hydrostatic head pressure energy sources hydrokinetic energy based on the kinetic energy in flows and waves is a widely untapped resource of renewable energy energy convertors for hydrokinetic energy can be classified by the nature of the utilized space in which they operate hydrokinetic energy convertors include point absorbers such as surface buoys johnson and pride 2010 line absorbers such as the pelamis attenuator lagoun et al 2010 horizontal surface patch absorbers such as oscillating water columns heath 2012 vertical surface absorbers such as turbines and open propellers batten et al 2006 and three dimensional space absorbers such as devices which operate using vortex induced vibrations viv for example the vortex induced vibration for aquatic clean energy vivace converter bernitsas et al 2009 turbines which are the most popular hydrokinetic energy convertor operate at efficiencies of about 20 55 hansen 2015 vries 1983 and usually need high start up flow speeds khan et al 2009 flow energy can be split up in to spatial and temporal energy the definition arises from the steady component and the unsteady fluctuating component in the flow the steady component is defined as the mean component of the flow which gives a steady value over time whereas the unsteady component arises from fluctuations in the flow hence spatial flow energy concentrators would perform better in situations with steady flow conditions i e upstream of turbines whilst temporal flow concentrators are needed for devices which operate utilising the temporal flow energy spatial flow energy concentrators such as diffusers have been analysed ever since the betz limit was established for turbines and other vertical surface absorbers dick 1984 in theory diffusers can result in a combined system efficiency of 89 hansen et al 2000 jamieson 2008 however in practice duct augmented turbines have not been able to reach such a high power coefficient khan et al 2009 diffusers fall under the class of spatial energy concentrators where energy is augmented at specific locations in the flow field there are many different types of diffusers and each has their own merits and limitations gaden and bibeau 2006 ohya et al 2001 ponta and dutt 2000 ponta and jacovkis 2008 setoguchi et al 2004 in addition to spatial concentration temporal concentration can further increase power densities that can be obtained from a hydrokinetic energy convertor system a combination of spatial and time dependant energy concentration i e temporal concentration can be achieved using bluff bodies as shown in previous studies assi 2009 bernitsas et al 2008 derakhshandeh et al 2014 the concentration is time specific due to the characteristic von karman vortex street that forms in the wakes of bluff bodies circular cylinders have received the most attention amongst bluff bodies in a cross flow there are numerous review papers on the vibration response of single circular cylinders and the factors that affect it due to early research being focused on mitigating the phenomenon to reduce failure in engineered structures king 1977 sarpkaya 1979 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 the current state of art has shifted focus to harness the vibrations in bluff bodies exposed to cross flow to produce useful clean and renewable energy bernitsas et al 2008 derakhshandeh et al 2014 2015a 2016 hansen et al 2000 in viv energy harnessing systems it has been identified that tandem bodies result in higher power efficiencies when compared to the single bluff body case because they can generate a larger temporal component a stationary upstream bluff body in a flow produces a vortex street and hence the downstream body operates in a wake containing spatially and temporally concentrated hydrokinetic energy transverse vibration amplitudes of cylinders undergoing viv are about 3 times greater than the streamwise amplitudes and hence been of more interest for energy generating potential bernitsas et al 2008 hobbs and hu 2012 wang and ko 2010 there exist two different classes of devices which utilise viv for energy generation and this is based on the energy output of the device many small scale devices using a combination of viv and piezoelectric transduction have been investigated to provide power for wireless sensing devices although these devices can vary in configuration most of them use a circular or triangular cross section bluff body to produce vortices which impinge on to a beam containing piezoelectric materials these devices usually provide power in the order of milli watts and have very low efficiencies hobbs and hu 2012 wang and ko 2010 weinstein et al 2012 larger scale devices which operate using viv are aimed at providing useful energy to the grid from low speed currents in oceans and rivers a prototype known as the vortex induced vibration aquatic clean energy vivace generator was developed by bernitsas et al 2008 who pioneered the energy harnessing potential of viv and have continued to research the field bernitsas et al 2009 bernitsas and raghavan 2004 bernitsas et al 2008 chang et al 2011 lee and bernitsas 2011 the theoretical efficiency of power conversion for viv of a single cylinder unit was calculated to be 37 at a reynolds number of 100 000 however the maximum power obtained via experiments conducted on a single cylinder system was 22 this sparked more interest in the field to improve the energy harnessing efficiency from viv very recent experimental work by ding et al 2016 demonstrated that higher efficiencies η 37 can be obtained at lower reynolds numbers re 60 000 using passive turbulence control by attaching roughness strips to the cylinder most research on viv for energy has been performed on circular cylinders due to the abundant research available on the flow features of a circular cylinder braza et al 1986 cantwell and coles 1983 ong and wallace 1996 williamson 1996 derakhshandeh et al 2014 have shown the feasibility of vortex and wake induced vibrations viv and wiv respectively to harness hydrokinetic energy a transverse spacing of 0 y d 1 and streamwise spacing of 3 x d 4 between tandem staggered cylinders provided maximum energy harnessing efficiency η 48 4 for a cylinder with diameter equal to d at a reynolds number of 65 000 derakhshandeh et al 2014 the power generating potential of viv has been confirmed by these studies and further work in particular on the flow field in between the cylinders is required to identify an efficient and realisable system other bluff bodies have also been tested for the purpose of flow induced motion fim although the vibration responses of single bluff bodies such as square cylinders amandolèse and hémon 2010 barrero gil and fernandez arroyo 2013 nemes et al 2012 triangular prisms alonso and meseguer 2006 alonso et al 2005 and a comparison between various bodies ding et al 2015 have been studied in extant literature analysis of the energy concentration in their wake has not been investigated additionally these investigations analysed the vibration responses of the bodies but there has been no mention of the energy in the wake produced by bodies of different cross sections past studies have established that a bluff body placed with proper spacing in front of a vibrating bluff body enhances the viv response of the downstream body derakhshandeh et al 2016 the spacing has been varied to find the optimum spacing that results in high power efficiency for the system for various shapes and sizes of cylinders the attributing cause to the response is due to impedance matching which occurs when the velocity of the vibrating body and the forces acting on it are in phase however extant literature has not yet identified the contribution of the frequency and magnitude of the velocity components that attribute to a higher energy harnessing potential it is clear from previous studies that the concentration in the wake of a bluff body is not only spatial in nature but has a temporal attribute as well due to the unsteady components which occur at different frequencies and velocities there exists a gap in the understanding of the contribution of the different wake velocity components to the energy in the wake and how these components result in the temporal and spatial concentration of the upstream energy in the flow understanding the factors which contribute to the observed responses can lead to knowledge on how these components can be manipulated to result in a high efficiency system based on the above this work aims to start this investigation by developing a validated computational fluid dynamics cfd and fourier analysis on the wake of different bluff bodies to characterise the spatial and temporal variation of the streamwise and transverse velocity components u and v respectively although there are many different bluff bodies the circular cylinder was considered in this paper as a starting point of investigation since there are numerous experimental data available for the validation of the circular cross section following the circular cylinder several other cross sections such as the semi circular cylinder and equilateral triangles with curved sides were analysed the proceeding section details the methodology utilized in this paper which is followed by the results and their discussion and finally the main findings are summarised in the conclusion 2 method transient velocity data in the wake of the cylinder are needed to analyse the contribution of the streamwise and crosswise components to gather these data three dimensional 3d cfd simulations were performed using ansys fluent v 17 1 a 3d model was simulated in order to resolve the turbulent spectrum using the sas model rather than compute the isotropic turbulence that is characteristic of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models even though the cfd model was performed in 3d only the velocities in the transverse and streamwise directions were collected and used for analysis as the primary focus was on the distribution of the transverse fluctuations which contribute to the transverse vibrations that are desired in wiv systems a validated cfd model was deemed appropriate for the purpose of this research due to the existence of experimental data available at high reynolds numbers for circular cylinders a circular cylinder was used as the bluff body since it is the most investigated bluff body for viv and serves as a good starting point for the wake analysis a reynolds number of 10 000 was used since it is still in the transition in the shear layer regime zdravkovich 1997 as well as being high enough to cover real world applications existing experimental and computational work were available to validate the cfd model a detailed account of the methods and validation used for the circular cylinder case are presented in this section 2 1 grid definition the mesh for the flow domain was created using the ansys meshing software and the resulting mesh is shown in fig 1 the first layer height of 0 0017d was chosen to maintain a non dimensional wall distance y plus of 1 near the cylinder wall region sensitivity of the mesh size was also tested by using three different sizes for each type of mesh the details of the different meshes used are given in table 1 and grid 2 proved to be sufficient for this analysis 2 2 numerical method and mathematical modelling the 3d form of the incompressible navier stokes equations was solved using a finite volume scheme with second order spatial and temporal discretization the pressure based solver was used and solved with double precision the domain used for this study is presented in fig 1 the rectangular fluid domain extends 25d downstream of the cylinder and 5d on either side where the diameter d of the cylinder is 30 mm the cylinder is placed 5d from the velocity inlet and has a span wise depth of 3d which is similar to that used in other published cfd work cao and xiang 2001 derakhshandeh et al 2014 wei et al 1995 the large boundary distances were chosen to negate blockage effects and to prevent reversed flow from the pressure outlet the transverse boundary spacing results in a blockage ratio of about 4 which can be considered negligible as shown in previous studies derakhshandeh et al 2014 wanderley et al 2008 the top and bottom boundaries and the span wise boundaries were defined as free slip walls to negate blockage effects and to prevent boundary layers developing on these surfaces a no slip wall condition was applied to the cylinder wall and the mesh was concentrated around the cylinder to accurately resolve the boundary layer the streamwise x transverse y and spanwise z distances are measured from the centre of the cylinder the navier stokes equations for the conservation of mass equation 2 1 and momentum equation 2 2 for three dimensional viscous incompressible flow with constant density are solved in the cfd model and are as follows 2 1 u i x i 0 2 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ϑ 2 u i x j 2 u i u j x j where x represents the directionu is the mean velocity component in x y and z directions u is the fluctuating component of the velocity ρ is the density of the fluid p denotes the pressure the term u i u j presents the reynolds stress component which is defined in terms of a turbulent viscosity ϑ t as 2 3 u i u j x j ϑ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 k δ i j where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and δ i j is the kronecker delta function the scale adaptive simulation sas model which is a form of scale resolving simulations srs was used to model the turbulence in the cfd simulation the sas model is an improved form of the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans formulation and differs from classic urans models in its ability to resolve the turbulence spectrum the urans models such as sst are only able to model large scale unsteadiness whereas the sas model can resolve spectral content in the detached regions turbulence length scale in the sas model is resolved by considering the definition of von karman length scale sas overcomes the deficiency of other urans models in resolving the turbulence length scale by considering the definition of von karman length scale this assists in more accurately to capturing the vortex structure in the wake of the structure the von karman length scale is given by 2 4 l v k k u y 2 u y 2 the sas model uses the von karman length scale to adapt its behaviour to srs according to the stability parameters of the flow egorov et al 2010 and provides a balance between the contributions of the simulated and resolved parts of the turbulence stresses hence the model can effectively and automatically switch from the large eddy simulation les mode to the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans mode menter and egorov 2010 further derivation and information on this model can be found in menter and egorov 2010 and in ansys help version 17 1 0 compared to reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models such as the k ω shear stress transport sst model sas is able to capture vortical structures effectively as shown by previous studies derakhshandeh et al 2014 2016 identical initial and boundary conditions were used for all the cases a time step size of 0 5 ms was needed to satisfy the courant friedrichs lewy condition cfl 1 which is essential for convergence of the cfd simulation however the simulations for test cases 2 and 3 were run at both 0 1 m s and 1 m s and there was no difference observed in the results for the drag coefficient lift coefficient and strouhal number hence a time step of 1 m s was chosen for the rest of the simulations the chosen time step was also sufficient to resolve the time scales in the fluid flow as there are approximately 416 time steps per vortex shedding cycle shedding frequency 2 2 hz a streamwise velocity of 0 335 m s was defined at the inlet boundary and the outlet had a gauge pressure of 0 pa this inlet velocity resulted in a reynolds number of 10 000 computed using properties of water at 25 c density ρ 997 1 and dynamic viscosity μ 0 001003 results showed that the shear layers first form on either side of the cylinder and start to interact to produce the vortex street as the simulation time progresses hence the solution needs to be allowed to establish in order for the vortex street to fully develop and regular vortex shedding is observed the model was initialised with a steady state solution in order to reduce the time for established flow the cfd model was deemed to be established when steady state sinusoidal behaviour is observed for the lift and drag coefficients of the cylinder which occurred within 10 s of flow time from the start of the simulation a convergence criterion of 10 5 was used for all the residuals and this resulted in a maximum of 12 iterations for each time step 2 3 post processing methods transient velocity data were gathered in the cylinder wake along the spanwise centre 1 5d away from the symmetry walls of the domain during the simulation the wake velocity data were time averaged to analyse the mean components and decomposed using fast fourier transforms fft to identify the contribution of the fluctuating velocity components u and v utilising this information the kinetic energy due to these components was computed velocity data from 10 000 time steps were used as the input for the fft analysis of the wake the fft analysis was used to identify the dominant frequencies of the fluctuating components as well as the magnitude at which they appear in the wake the pwelch function in matlab was used to perform a welch s power spectrum estimate of the fluctuating streamwise and transverse velocity components the transient velocity data were de trended and the dc mean was removed from the signal the data were then normalised using the freestream velocity 0 335 m s a flat top window was used with 50 overlap to get the magnitude of the power at different frequencies in the power spectrum the fft used 10000 points to have sufficient resolution for the frequencies considered whilst still managing to capture the peak from the power spectrum the output from the velocity power spectrum has units of m2 s2 and hence represents the normalised energy contained in the fluctuating component at the frequency of interest the energy obtained from the spectrum was a ratio compared to the available free stream energy since the input to the welch power spectrum was the velocity data normalised by the free stream velocity these data were used to analyse the temporal and spatial distribution of the wake augmented energy which can then be correlated to identify optimum locations for known wake energy extractors wees this was accomplished by identifying the shedding frequency and its harmonics occurring in the wake and then finding the magnitude of energy contribution from the power spectrum 2 4 validation of the cfd model the cfd model was validated using experimental data from previous publications to demonstrate the accuracy of the model the pressure coefficient on the surface of the cylinder was compared to the experimental data at similar reynolds numbers dong et al 2006 the equation used to calculate the pressure coefficient is given below with a description of the variables used c p p p 0 1 2 ρ 0 u 0 2 p static pressure at the location where the pressure coefficient is being evaluated p 0 static pressure in the freestream free from any disturbance ρ 0 density of water in the freestream 998 2 kg m3 at 20 c u 0 velocity of fluid in the freestream the time averaged pressure coefficient around the top half of the cylinder surface is plotted in fig 2 the pressure coefficient distribution obtained from the cfd simulation showed a similar trend to experimental values and had a minimum around 70 which agrees well with extant literature dong et al 2006 norberg 1992 the independence of the solution from the grid was analysed by testing the three different mesh configurations the mesh sizes were varied and integral parameters such as the mean drag coefficient c d the back pressure c pb root mean square r m s lift coefficient c l and strouhal number s t were monitored in the current work and are presented in table 2 along with values from experiments based on these results grid 2 and 3 had a difference of less than 5 for the parameters considered and hence case 2 was used for this paper and the drag and lift coefficients are plotted in fig 3 further validation of the model was done by comparing the mean streamwise velocity at the centreline to data published by norberg 1998 the comparison is displayed in fig 4 and a reasonable agreement less than 10 difference was observed 3 results this section contains the post processed results of the unsteady wake velocity data which were exported from the cfd simulation considering the two dimensional wake behind a circular cylinder the wake has streamwise and transverse linear velocity components in addition to a rotational component due to the vorticity the velocity field can be split up in to the mean u and v and fluctuating u and v components of the transverse and streamwise velocity thus the energy in the wake arises from the mean and fluctuating parts of the streamwise and transverse components due to the temporal nature of the vortex street the instantaneous energy density will also fluctuate with time this is the concept of temporal energy concentration and is observed when the time dependant data are analysed in this section the frequencies at which the fluctuating components occur are presented as multiples of the shedding frequency since the dominant frequencies observed were all harmonics of the shedding frequency all the energy magnitudes inferred to in this paper are normalised using the available freestream energy in the flow upstream of the cylinder and hence are an indication of the ratio of energy concentration by the cylinder the definition of the energy terms derived for the temporal wake analysis is given in equations 3a and 3f the primary shedding frequency was identified for each shape and the corresponding magnitude for that frequency was taken from the power spectrum since most of the temporal energy is found at the vortex shedding frequency the temporal investigation only includes the normalised energy found at the primary shedding frequency for each bluff body contour maps of the resulting magnitudes at their respective locations were used to observe the trends in temporal wake energy mean normalised streamwise energy 3a e u u 2 u 0 2 mean normalised transverse energy 3b e v v 2 u 0 2 mean normalised

w m a g p s power spectrum magnitude obtained for the spanwise velocity at the primary shedding frequency u 0 freestream velocity and the overbar indicates the mean of the variable 3 1 time averaged spatial energy distribution in the wake the time averaged values of the streamwise transverse and spanwise velocities were used to plot the non dimensional mean energy due to each of these components u v w as depicted in figs 5 7 respectively the energy is normalised using the energy available in the flow upstream of the cylinder as the flow approaches the cylinder there is a reduction in the u energy followed by an increase near the surface of the cylinder the wake has a lower energy than the freestream as the flow is recovers to the freestream condition the highest value for the mean streamwise energy is close to the surface of the cylinder and is attributed to flow accelerating up around the cylinder due to the blockage to the flow caused by the cylinder the aft part of the cylinder has the minimum point for energy from u due to the low velocity region caused by the recirculating flow the mean transverse energy v is much lower in general when compared to the mean streamwise energy u which was to be expected the normalised energy due to v plotted in fig 6 shows a single peak of energy at about one diameter downstream of the cylinder due to the interaction between the shear layers from the top and bottom surfaces of the cylinder which is where the large scale vortices are formed the time averaged energy of the transverse component does not display a significant augmentation effect in the wake because the time dependency of the energy peaks is not taken in to effect and hence the fluctuations cancel each other out the streamwise component on the other hand has almost double the energy compared to the upstream flow near the surface of the cylinder this is due to the high velocity shear layer which forms around the surface of the cylinder the time averaged spanwise energy component has a very low magnitude and is almost 104 times less than the other time averaged energy components fig 7 hence e w is not very useful for harvesting energy from wiv 3 2 fluctuating temporal energy distribution in the cylinder wake fourier analyses were performed on the transient velocity data field in matlab to identify the frequency of the fluctuations and the magnitude at which the unsteady components appear in the wake of the cylinder fourier analysis was performed on the normalised velocity data and the harmonic frequencies that appear in the wake were identified a power spectrum of the data utilising a flat top window was used to extract the magnitude of energy due to u and v at the harmonic frequencies the frequencies at which maxima appeared on the fft plots were all harmonics of the primary shedding frequency of the cylinder this section only contains contours of the fluctuating components at the shedding frequency fs and not the other frequencies as the magnitude of the normalised energy at the other frequencies was at least an order of magnitude less than the primary shedding frequency fig 8 displays the fft plots for u and v at different x d and y d locations in the wake of the circular cylinder and highlights the difference in magnitude the frequencies were normalised using the shedding frequency to display the magnitudes at consecutive harmonics of the vortex shedding frequency figs 9 11 depict the contour maps of the normalised streamwise transverse and spanwise energy fluctuations at the shedding frequency as shown in fig 11 the energy contained in w is negligible 103 times lower in magnitude when compared to the other fluctuating velocity components u and v the spanwise velocity component has negligible energy content compared to the other components and hence will not be investigated further in this study to further prove the 2 dimensionality of the energy content in the wake of the cylinder in this study 2d cfd simulations were performed using the surface mesh from the 3d analysis the energy contour maps of the 2d and 3d simulation for e u e v e u fs and e v fs are presented side by side in fig 12 where the maximum energy zones are similar in magnitude and location between the 2d and 3d simulations analysis of energy in the harmonic frequencies showed that the zones containing the maximum energy due to u and v alternate between y d 0 and 0 5 between the different harmonic frequencies however at any given frequency the maxima for the streamwise and transverse fluctuations never occur in the same location the location of the maximum transverse energy fluctuation is between 1 x d 2 whilst the maximum streamwise fluctuation is located between 0 x d 2 for all the harmonic frequencies another interesting observation was that there is a higher maximum magnitude of the fluctuating transverse energy at the third harmonic 6hz compared to the second harmonic 4hz this correlates to the secondary peak that is usually seen at the third harmonic of the shedding frequency for a cylinder undergoing viv at high reynolds numbers branković and bearman 2006 and odd harmonics are common in harmonic distortions arising from non linear processes 3 3 variation of the energy components at different transverse locations variation of the normalised fluctuating energy components with the streamwise distance from the cylinder at a given transverse location y d 0 0 5 or 1 is displayed in fig 13 these results were used to compare the magnitudes of the fluctuating energy components in relation to the mean components only y d 0 0 5 and 1 are included to exhibit the observed trends since at greater transverse distances from the cylinder only small magnitudes for the u component were observed near x d 0 5 and all the other components exhibited no significant augmentation at all y d locations the highest energy component is due to the u velocity this is due to the streamwise direction of the flow the u energy does not recover to unity by the end of the domain in the plots presented since these y d locations are still within the wake of the cylinder and hence experience the effects of reduced velocity flow energy from fluctuating components occurring at higher harmonics of the shedding frequency is not included to maintain clarity as they are of negligible magnitude the normalised energy due to u and u at the shedding frequency show maxima at x d 1 and y d 0 5 this is due to the shear layers that are moving towards the centreline of the cylinder the energy due to v at the primary shedding frequency also exhibits a peak at x d 1 due to the propagation of eddies formed in the shear layer the normalised energy magnitude due to v at the primary harmonic exhibited a lower magnitude at y d 0 5 compared to the y d 0 location due to the rapid dissipation of vorticity when the shear layers interact with each other when y d 0 and 0 5 the mean streamwise energy goes to zero at x d 0 since the cylinder is blocking the flow at these locations at y d 1 there is a maximum of 1 58 fig 13 c for the u energy as this is the region where the flow accelerates around the cylinder although not included in these plots the fluctuating components exhibit small peaks at the second and third harmonics but these peaks are still very low in magnitude and not suitable for energy capture 3 4 energy that can be captured by an energy extractor over one cycle of vortex shedding the betz limit was developed for turbines and rotors in a flow the betz limit also has been applied to shrouded turbines since the concentration by diffusers is internal however the betz limit is not applicable to the cylinder case as no area could be defined to calculate the limit due to the external concentration of the flow the maximum energy that can be captured as a ratio of the upstream energy can be derived if a wake energy extractor wee can move transversely at a fixed streamwise distance to examine the limit of energy extraction it was assumed that a wee can move to the zones of maximum energy at a specific streamwise distance from the cylinder and can absorb all the energy available at that region hence this analysis was pointwise and not spatially averaged as in the preceding section streamwise distances in increments of 0 5d from 0 to 4d from the cylinder were chosen as this range encompassed all the maximum energy points discovered in the previous section it was also assumed that no energy is wasted in the movement these assumptions were necessary to examine the order of magnitude of the energy limit for the external flow concentration by a cylinder the lift data from the cfd simulation were used to identify the vortex shedding cycles in the data gathered once the start and end of a cycle were known the data were split to have 8 frames of analysis for a single cycle the time dependant streamwise and transverse energies were investigated for every 1 8th of a single cycle as a ratio compared to the available freestream energy utilising the maximum streamwise and transverse energy available at each stage of the cycle the maximum energy extractable by a wee was calculated for each streamwise distance from the cylinder the results for the maximum energy extractable are depicted in fig 14 where a contour of the average normalised energy is used as the background for the line plots which show the trend for the streamwise and transverse energy components the maximum obtainable pointwise energy density was at x d 0 from to the streamwise energy this occurred due to the jet that formed on the surface of the cylinder and was almost three times the magnitude of the available upstream flow energy the maximum obtainable transverse energy occurred at x d 1 and had a magnitude of about 1 25 times the oncoming energy if a wee was able to capture both the transverse and the streamwise energies a combined maximum of 3 25 times the free stream energy is available at x d 1 the transverse energy ratio is comparatively lower than the streamwise component due to the streamwise propagation of the flow from the inlet beyond x d 3 the magnitudes of transverse and streamwise energy reduced at a lower rate compared to the near wake as the turbulence dissipated in the far wake 3 5 effect of bluff body cross section the circular cylinder has been extensively reviewed and many experiments exist on viv of the cylinder there has not been any systematic study to investigate the performance of other bluff body cross sections with similar length characteristics operating under the same flow conditions particularly there has been no focus given to the wake characteristics and the differences in downstream flow conditions from the standard circular cylinder configuration varying the bluff body cross section will change the amount of energy in the streamwise and transverse components by investigating these differences it is possible to identify a cross section that will concentrate most of the energy in a carrier that is ideal for energy harnessing e g transverse fluctuations a number of selected cross sections were investigated to identify the differences in wake energy carriers for different bluff bodies and realise a cross section that resulted in increasing the energy concentrated in transverse fluctuations the shapes chosen were a semi circular cylinder an equilateral triangle and a midway shape between the semicircle and the triangle a triangle with convex sides as shown in fig 15 the semi circular cylinder was chosen to investigate the effect of halving the cross section of the circular cylinder such that there is a flat aft edge which would lead to a larger back pressure and hence a larger pressure difference between the fore and aft faces of the cylinder the equilateral triangle was chosen due to its widespread use in piezoelectric systems as the upstream energy concentrator the transition from the semi circular cylinder to the equilateral cylinder resulted in the triangle with convex edged sides and a flat aft face the shapes were simulated such that the aft part of the cylinders was the flat end and hence was downstream of the body and all the cylinders had a characteristic diameter of 30 mm and a length of 90 mm the 3d cfd models for the different cross sections used the same mesh configuration turbulence model and method of analysis as that of the circular cylinder the differences in energy magnitude of the different velocity components were investigated and particular attention was on whether an increase in the transverse fluctuations could be observed as the cfd techniques used were identical to the circular cylinder it is expected that the numerical data are valid for analysis the results of the variation of the components are given in the proceeding subsections results were analysed at increments of 0 1d in the transverse direction and the results for y d 0 0 5 and 1 are presented here and a detailed comparison is given in section 4 3 5 1 semi circular cylinder the magnitudes of the energy components for the semi circular cylinder are plotted in fig 16 the shedding frequency was almost equal to the shedding frequency observed in the full cylinder case since the separation point was approximately the same for both the cases the maximum normalised magnitude of the transverse fluctuations at the shedding frequency was 0 92 and occurs at y d 0 and x d 1 other harmonics have very low energy magnitudes for both the transverse and streamwise energy fluctuations 3 5 2 straight edged equilateral triangle results of the normalised energy magnitudes for the different energy components in the wake of an equilateral triangle are displayed in fig 17 apart from the energy concentration of the mean streamwise component there is no significant concentration of energy observed in the wake by the other velocity components the mean streamwise energy component was similar to the circular cylinder 3 5 3 equilateral triangle with convex sides the magnitudes of the energy components for the equilateral triangle with convex sides are plotted in fig 18 the shedding frequency was higher 2 8 hz than that observed in the circular and semi circular cylinder cases the maximum for the mean streamwise energy is also higher in this case the maximum normalised magnitude of streamwise energy fluctuations at the shedding frequency was around 0 2 and occurred at y d 0 5 and x d 1 the transverse fluctuations of energy at the shedding frequency occur at a higher magnitude than the circular cylinder but occur at the same location of about y d 0 and x d 1 1 5 at transverse distances higher than 0 5d the only significant component observed is the mean streamwise component 4 discussion the results demonstrate the temporal and spatial concentration of energy in a flow using different bluff bodies for the circular cylinder the temporal energy concentration due to the fluctuating components is lower in magnitude compared to the concentration observed in the mean streamwise component the mean streamwise energy component exhibits a large magnitude due to the accelerating shear layer near the surface of the cylinder but this concentrated energy cannot be captured as it is too close to the cylinder s surface and occurs only over a small region it is known that a circular cylinder can be used to convert the mean streamwise energy in to the transverse fluctuations which in turn can contribute to transverse vibrations in a downstream body tuning a system to either the mean or unsteady component will affect the response observed and hence the efficiency of the system there is a possibility of designing smarter wake energy extractors wees which are able to operate at high energy extraction efficiencies by utilising the information known about the locations of maximum magnitude of the components utilising the results gathered about the circular cylinder wake a suitable wee would have to be placed between 1 x d 3 and 0 y d 1 to harness the maxima of the temporal energy u and v and near the boundary of the cylinder to capture the maximum mean streamwise energy due to the jetting effect however if a wee is placed too close to the first body the flow is blocked and hence regions further downstream which have high energy densities are best for energy capturing the energy due to the v component is not very useful as it is lower in magnitude compared to the others fig 9 the oscillating transverse component of the energy in the wake is significant compared to the other temporal fluctuations the unsteady components u and v are maximum near the wake of the cylinder since eddies are produced in the boundary layer of the cylinder and start to dissipate when they form in to the vortex clouds the third harmonic of the transverse velocity oscillations also seem to be a significant contributor to the temporal concentration of energy and corresponds to the secondary peak found in the power spectral density of the oscillation amplitude reported by branković and bearman 2006 an effective wee needs to be able to capture both the mean streamwise energy as well as the transverse fluctuations to maximise the energy extraction efficiency the total temporally averaged energy in the wake of the cylinder would be lower than the energy in a comparable upstream area this is due to energy losses in the flow due to friction and the effects of viscosity however peaks of augmented energy which occur during a vortex shedding cycle and exceed upstream energy densities could be captured to result in a large amount of energy being harnessed energy analysis of the wake showed that if a wee were able to capture the maximum energy regions in a vortex shedding cycle a maximum of 3 25 times the available upstream energy can be harnessed at a streamwise distance of x 1d a wee working further downstream beyond x 3d will be able to harness approximately 1 8 times the available upstream energy these results indicate that there is significant external concentration of energy in the wake due to the cylinder compared to the augmentation factor of about 1 6 for diffusers cylinders can be used to spatially and temporally concentrate energy to achieve higher ratios assuming a wee that is capable of actively harnessing the high energy density regions a significant portion of the augmented energy can be captured and converted to useful energy however this limit was calculated assuming the wee can move to the high energy density regions without losing any energy and is non impacting on the flow field the efficiency of power conversion from the available energy to useful energy also has not been considered a complete system configuration will need to be realised to obtain the actual efficiencies and to investigate whether augmenting and harvesting temporally concentrated energy will achieve a higher efficiency compared to the betz limit it is possible to identify the characteristic diameter of a second cylinder and the operating region where it will be able to harness a maximum amount of energy the vortex shedding of the second cylinder needs to be known to achieve the maximum efficiency from the system configuration when considering bluff bodies a second body that is much smaller in size compared to the first body would benefit in being able to capture the augmented energy a smaller second body has a smaller effect on the flow structure from the upstream body and can capture higher magnitudes of the fluctuating components as demonstrated by the planar averaging results presented in section 3 4 the positions of maximum efficiency found in previous studies with a tandem circular cylinder derakhshandeh et al 2014 and aerofoil derakhshandeh et al 2016 do not match up with the results seen in this study as that position would also depend on the wake of the downstream body and the phase difference between the forces on the body due to its own vortex shedding as well the fluctuations in velocity caused by the upstream body the maximum regions for the spatial and temporal concentration cannot be captured by wee due to the flow field differing significantly when a second body is placed downstream if the streamwise gap is smaller than 1 5d the flow does not separate between the bodies and hence there is no vortex shedding in the gap for rigid bluff bodies igarashi 1981 both bodies behave as one and the shear layer connects the bodies this may be a reason for the smaller gaps not being the place of high power efficiency as reported by others derakhshandeh et al 2014 2015a 2016 the effect of different bluff body cross sections was also briefly investigated in this paper for comparison the results of energy concentration by the different bluff bodies including the circular cylinder are shown in figs 19 22 the mean streamwise component shown in fig 19 exhibits a similar trend along all bluff bodies which has been discussed in the preceding section there is similarity in the recovery of the mean streamwise component for all shapes and at y d 1 5 all the bluff bodies have approximately the same magnitude along x and have a normalised magnitude slightly higher than 1 the mean transverse component some augmentation of energy for both the convex edged and straight edged triangle since the flow gets diverted up by the leading edges as expected the straight triangle has a higher magnitude 0 24 than that of the convex edge 0 14 fig 20 shows this trend and the maximum mean transverse component occurs for the straight edged triangular cylinder at y d 0 5 and x d 0 the fluctuating streamwise component is not a significant carrier of the wake energy downstream from the bluff bodies however the near wake x d 0 2 y d 0 5 of bluff bodies such as the semicircular and convex triangle bodies have at least a quarter of the upstream available energy as shown in fig 21 the minimal energy trend observed in the fluctuating streamwise component maybe due to the high energy mean streamwise component which dissipates the fluctuations the fluctuating transverse component has very small magnitudes of energy at transverse distances greater than y d 1 at y d 0 and x d 0 5 the semi circle and convex triangle have magnitudes greater than 1 5 which is much greater than the other bluff bodies fig 22 the semi circle and convex triangle also have larger magnitudes of normalised energy compared to the other bodies at y d 0 5 hence the semi circle and the convex triangle are bluff bodies which are most suited to obtain a wake with more transverse fluctuations 5 conclusions three dimensional cfd simulation of a rigid stationary cylinder was performed to identify the variation of the streamwise and transverse velocity components in the wake spatial and temporal velocity concentration of the flow caused by the cylinder was investigated using fourier analysis of the wake velocity data the fluctuating components of the streamwise and transverse energy components u and v were separated from the mean components u and v there was significant spatial energy concentration due to the mean streamwise velocity component which occurred near the top and bottom surfaces of the circular cylinder due to the blockage by the cylinder the mean transverse component does not display any significant augmentation of energy in the wake the temporal components of velocity contribute to the temporal concentration of energy at different harmonics of the vortex shedding frequency most of the temporal concentration occurs at the shedding frequency due to the large scale von karman vortices shed from the body and the maxima occur at 1 x d 3 and 0 y d 1 the maximum amount of energy that could be captured by an ideal wee assuming that the wee could capture high energy density regions in a single cycle of vortex shedding was also computed a maximum of 3 25 times the available upstream energy can be harnessed at a streamwise distance of x 1d if both the temporally and spatially concentrated energy is harnessed considering an ideal case where the wee can move between high energy density locations at different time steps of the vortex shedding cycle a high amount of energy can be captured by a device most of the augmentation from the different energy components occurred in the very near wake of the cylinder a suitable wee which operates using the temporal concentration will operate in the very near wake of the cylinder without changing the flow structure however extant literature suggests a critical spacing of at least 1 5d carmo et al 2008 igarashi 1984 zdravkovich 1997 between in line separated circular cylinders of equal diameter for the vortices to form in the gap between the cylinders current viv systems seem to be utilising a combination of the temporal and spatial concentration where the location of maximum efficiency is when the contribution from the unsteady components is in phase to the contribution from the steady components the effect of varying the cross section of the cylinder was investigated using shapes such as the semi circle straight edged triangle concave edged triangle and convex edged triangle the spatial concentration of the bodies varied very little from that of the circular cylinder however there was a significant increase in the temporal concentration of wake energy by the convex edged triangle and the semi circular cylinder hence these bodies would be ideal for use as primary bodies in wiv systems where they can provide a large amount of energy in the form of transverse fluctuations in the wake the influence of the second body significantly changes the flow field and hence future work should investigate the spatial and temporal analysis of tandem bodies to identify how the flow field is different however this paper has identified the concept of spatial and temporal concentration in the wake of cylinder and the methods which can be used to analyse the flow field and identify crucial factors that can be used to improve the design of viv energy harnessing systems 
23182,motivated by the design of a protective anti shark cable net enclosure located in heavy surf on la réunion france this paper presents a modeling technique for underwater cable structures subject to breaking wave action such modeling capability is not offered in leading commercial software forces on underwater cable structures are frequently modeled using the well established morison equation these forces are functions of the fluid velocity and acceleration which are normally calculated using an appropriate wave theory such an approach works well in many applications but it does not permit the modeling the effects of breaking waves however considering the absence of wave impact loads on submerged structures the morison equation is still valid provided that a suitable hydrodynamic time history is available in the presented work the morison equation is coupled with a high resolution breaking wave simulation obtained by solving the full air water navier stokes equations creating a time domain analysis approach suitable for studying underwater cable structures subject to breaking waves the hydrodynamic model is validated using the software package proteusds and the presented model is used to characterize the mechanical response of a moored cable net this research is of relevance to the analysis and design of submerged cable structures keywords cable structures breaking waves morison equation numerical modeling time domain analysis 1 introduction recently installed cable net shark barriers in strong surf la réunion france have suffered from persistent damage and high maintenance costs 1 2 1 http reunion orange fr actu reunion la degradation du filet anti requins de boucan canot en images html 2 https vimeo com 258646602 the barriers consist of cable or rope netting anchored to the sea floor and tensioned by buoys seeking to improve the barrier s design has exposed a gap of knowledge in modeling and designing such structures although the modeling of submerged cable nets has been extensively studied in the context of fishing and aquaculture applications e g cui et al 2014 huang et al 2006 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 moe et al 2010 xu et al 2013 yao et al 2016 these existing models do not account for the impact of breaking waves as such nets are not typically subjected to breaking wave action this paper presents a novel approach to incorporate breaking wave action into a hydrodynamic time domain analysis model for the analysis of underwater cable structures generally the modeling of underwater cable structures subject to hydrodynamic loads but not wave break loads is a well studied problem the morison equation 1950 first developed to describe wave forces on slender piles is typically used for this purpose see 2 1 commercial software such as orcaflex 3 3 https www orcina com softwareproducts orcaflex and proteusds 4 4 https dsa ltd ca proteusds overview can model a wide variety of moored structures subject to the effects of wind and non breaking waves such software generates sea states using wave functions from which the necessary velocity and acceleration data are calculated and applied to the morison equation however such a modeling approach cannot handle breaking waves when a wave breaks a strong turbulent flow is generated and the fluid velocities and accelerations no longer vary in time with the wave period no analytical theories provide a useful description of fluid motions in such cases e g drazen et al 2008 perlin et al 2013 rapp and melville 1990 however if the cable structure remains submerged then there are no impact forces imparted and the morison equation remains valid allowing the possibility of using numerical simulations to describe the fluid motion instead of analytical theories using such a numerical approach this paper describes a time domain analysis model suitable for underwater cable structures subject to breaking wave action with the proper adjustments to the wave simulation this approach can be easily implemented to model moored cable structures in a wide variety of environments the paper is structured as follows following this introduction the requisite background knowledge on lumped mass cable modeling and recent contributions to the area are presented and the numerical methods used to simulate breaking waves and obtain the post breaking velocity field are described in 2 in 3 the structural model the wave simulation and their coupling are presented the structural model is validated with the commercial software proteusds using three simple benchmarks that ensure the proper functionality of the model and the hydrodynamic forcing function finally sample results are presented in 4 for a section of an underwater cable net under a breaking wave the paper concludes with a summary of the presented approach in 5 in this work vectors and matrices are denoted by lowercase and uppercase bolded italics respectively while scalar quantities are denoted by plain italics 2 background given the centrality of fluid mechanics to the design of any underwater structure this section begins with a brief review of the physical phenomena relevant to moored cable structures namely the forces described by the morison equation as well as a description of the numerical breaking wave simulation numerical modeling techniques suitable for characterizing the behavior of underwater cable structures are also reviewed 2 1 hydrodynamic forces on cables throughout the literature cable elements are commonly regarded as cylinders to simplify the computation of hydrodynamic forces a complete treatment of flow around cylinders is offered by sumer and fredsøe 2006 when a structure like a cable net is composed of slender elements whose diameters are much smaller than the wavelengths of the waves affecting them scattering and diffraction effects can be ignored a special theory has been developed for this situation originally proposed by morison et al 1950 for the case of fixed vertical piles and later generalized to include moving cylindrical bodies a complete treatment of flow around cylindrical bodies is offered by sumer and fredsøe 2006 to summarize the morison equation eq 2 1 expresses the hydrodynamic wave force f e x t on a unit length of a cylinder as the sum of three terms drag force hydrodynamic mass force and the froude krylov force 2 1 f e x t 1 2 ρ f d c d v x v x d r a g f d ρ f c m a v x h y d r o d y n a m i c m a s s ρ f a v f r o u d e k r y l o v f f k ρ f is the mass density of fluid d is the diameter of the cylinder a is the cross sectional area of the cylinder v is the fluid velocity calculated using a suitable wave theory or from a numerical simulation and x is the element position c d and c m are semi empirical drag and hydrodynamic mass coefficients the drag force is encountered in many engineering applications and cylinder drag is a well studied problem the other two terms in eq 2 1 also merit a brief explanation the hydrodynamic mass force describes the inertial effect due to the distortion of the fluid flow by the presence of the body in general the force f required to sustain the acceleration of a body with mass m through a stationary fluid is proportional to the body acceleration x and can be written as 2 2 f m m x here m ρ f c m a is the hydrodynamic mass also referred to as added mass of the unit cylinder which is the mass of the fluid in the immediate vicinity of the body that is accelerated along with the body due to pressure effects the hydrodynamic mass force is the additional force needed to accelerate this mass and can be obtained by integrating the pressure gradient that develops around the body as it accelerates for the case of the cylinder the added mass for flow perpendicular to the body is equal to ρ f a which gives rise to an added mass coefficient c m 1 as shown in sumer and fredsøe 2006 it is common to neglect the hydrodynamic mass force in the case of tangential flow around cylinders c m 0 the froude krylov force is the surface integral of pressure generated by accelerating flow in far field a control volume of water having a mass m and undergoing acceleration v must experience a force m v if this control volume is replaced with another body then that body must experience the same force m v to summarize the hydrodynamic mass force arises from near field effects and depends on the relative acceleration of the body while the froude krylov force depends only on the acceleration of the fluid in far field the drag force the hydrodynamic mass force and the froude krylov force represent the external loadings that are accounted for in the presented modeling approach see 3 for submerged moored cables subject to breaking wave action 2 2 modeling of moored cable net structures the moored cable nets that motivate the present work consist of cables and buoys in this paper however only the cable elements are treated in detail while the buoyant force from the buoys is considered as an additional external forcing on the system both the finite element fem e g huang 1994 ran et al 1999 williams and trivailo 2007 and the finite difference fdm e g ablow and schechter 1983 mehrabi and tabatabai 1998 milinazzo et al 1987 methods have been used in the dynamic modeling and simulation of cable systems the established fem approach uses a consistent mass matrix as in wang et al 1998 however by far the most widely used model is the lumped mass lm cable model which instead features a diagonal mass matrix m providing computational advantages in situations involving m 1 due to its ubiquity the lm model is well described e g buckham 2003 buckham and nicoll 2015 masciola et al 2014 to summarize the lm method a cable is discretized into n segments and their masses are concentrated at n 1 nodes the nodes are assumed to be connected by viscoelastic springs or in more complex formulations such as buckham s 2003 bending and torsional springs as well after discretization the entire cable is located in a chosen inertial frame while cable segments are described individually with local element frames unlike traditional stiffer civil engineering structures on land hydrodynamic loads on compliant cable structures vary not only with time but also with the structure s changing configuration and orientation for example the drag force and the hydrodynamic mass effect are each functions of anisotropic empirical and geometric coefficients which may differ for each degree of freedom in the model for cylindrical cable elements these coefficients are defined with respect to an element s normal and tangential directions for optimal computational efficiency the treatment of such loads necessitates the construction of an appropriate local element frame the most common approach uses euler angles and the frenet serret frame while an alternative has been proposed recently by zhu and yoo 2017 which accounts for not only geometry but also environmental loading in this approach an orthonormal reference frame for element e fig 1 is constructed using the element s normalized tangent vector z e defined using the element orientation vector l and length l and the average relative nodal velocity vector v r defined in eq 3 8 2 3 z e l l l l x e z e v r z e v r y e z e x e such a reference frame presents several advantages over the frenet serret frame approach as 1 most singularities associated with the traditional frame are avoided 2 the calculation of hydrodynamic forces is greatly simplified since tangential drag along with axial extension and damping is expressed with respect to the tangent vector z e and normal drag is expressed purely in terms of the binormal vector y e and 3 drag components on straight taut cables can be correctly modeled however this element frame experiences singularities in situations of either zero relative velocities or when the tangent and relative velocity vectors are collinear since non zero relative velocities can be assumed for modeling purposes the first singularity can be avoided by placing a small lower bound on the magnitude of the relative velocity such an approach is valid as it produces continuous displacements the second singularity requires ignoring the normal drag and added mass effects this element frame is adopted in the modeling approach presented in 3 2 3 wave breaking phenomenon deep water breaking waves impact ocean atmosphere interactions from local to climatic scales and play a significant role in interactions with marine structures and ships this has motivated numerous studies to elucidate the dynamics of breaking waves and characterize the post breaking turbulent flow when a wave breaks the water surface experiences strong changes at a front of the wave a jet may form and hit back at the water surface or the surface may roll over both processes entrain air eject spray and generate a complex turbulent flow beneath the surface wave breaking is therefore a transition from a laminar to a turbulent flow and solid structures in water will be affected by the post breaking flow laboratory experiments combined with numerical studies and theoretical scaling arguments have led to significant progress in the understanding of deep water breaking waves e g deike et al 2017 2016 2015 drazen et al 2008 perlin et al 2013 rapp and melville 1990 and have shown the importance of the wave slope s 2 4 s h k where h is the wave amplitude and k the wave number as the main parameter to describe the intensity of the post breaking flow the vertical velocity of the falling jet is given by a ballistic velocity g h which sets the level of vorticity and turbulence generated by the breaking event e g deike et al 2015 drazen et al 2008 pizzo et al 2016 2 4 modeling of breaking waves modeling the full two fluid air water flow associated with breaking waves remains a numerical challenge since it involves a two phase turbulent flow over a wide range of scales different approaches exist for modeling breaking waves in deep and shallow water reynolds averaged navier stokes rans are lower cost solutions for large scale flows but are unable to properly capture unsteady turbulent flows as discussed in derakhti et al 2016 large eddy simulations have this ability but rely on subgrid scale closures where strong assumptions are needed e g derakhti and kirby 2014 lubin and glockner 2015 in contrast direct numerical simulation dns is an appealing tool since no simplifications are needed however dns is computationally more expensive recently the open source solver gerris developed by popinet 2009 was used to perform dns of the two phase navier stokes equations solving for breaking waves in deep water in two and three dimensions at high reynolds number with results in very good agreement with laboratory experiments performed in large scale facility e g deike et al 2017 2016 2015 pizzo et al 2016 in this work a two dimensional breaking wave is considered for simplicity assuming no transverse component in the flow which was shown to reproduce many features of the post breaking flow e g deike et al 2016 2015 pizzo et al 2016 three dimensional simulations would be necessary for investigation of three dimensional vertical structures which are out of the scope of this study in this paper the two dimensional two phase air water navier stokes equations are solved using the solver gerris see 3 3 1 to simulate breaking waves and the results i e the velocity and acceleration fields are then considered as input for the forcing function on the cable structure within the two dimensional constraint all of the physical phenomena taking place at the interface are captured without resorting to any simplification of the model the simulation is similar to the one presented by deike et al 2015 and pizzo et al 2016 with a wave slope h k 0 5 corresponding to a strong plunging breaker 2 5 time integration cable structures are normally discretized per the finite element or the finite difference approach both of which result in the following discrete equation of motion in time t 2 5 m u t f i n t u t u t f e x t u t here m is the mass matrix f i n t u t u t is the internal force vector describing the damping and elastic forces and f e x t is the load vector nodal displacements velocities and accelerations are denoted by u t x t x i n i t i a l u t and u t respectively inertial forces due to the hydrodynamic mass can be dealt with either by 1 treating the effect as an external forcing as described in the morison equation eq 2 1 and adding the appropriate terms to f e x t u t or 2 by adding the hydrodynamic mass to the mass matrix m giving rise to a total mass matrix m t o t a l 2 6 m t o t a l u t f i n t u t u t f e x t u t a time domain analysis of the structure entails solving the equation of motion eq 2 5 in general this is a well studied problem and numerous techniques have been developed for this purpose the reader is referred to the state of the art reviews by modak and sotelino 2002 2000 and subbaraj and dokainish 1989a 1989b on this matter while efficient algorithms have been developed for flexible structures like cable nets e g cash and karp 1990 chung and hulbert 1993 the numerical modeling work presented in 3 uses an explicit central difference time integration scheme for simplicity 3 description of the numerical model to the best of the authors knowledge two commercial software packages have the capability to model submarine cable structures proteusds and orcaflex while both software packages can generate a wide variety of wave and current conditions using various wave theories neither is capable of modeling breaking waves to model the effect of breaking waves on moored cable systems a novel approach is proposed in this paper a propriety time domain analysis approach was developed in matlab 2016 using the central difference time integration method in this approach the morison equation eq 2 1 is coupled with a high resolution breaking wave simulation this coupling constitutes an original contribution to the research area as suggested by wienke and oumeraci 2005 this approach assumes the morison equation is still valid under breaking wave conditions if the net remains in the water and does not experience impact loads this section is dedicated to presenting the numerical model in detail with a focus on the cable dynamics and the hydrodynamic input data the breaking wave simulation the cable model considers the following phenomena self weight buoyancy internal tension linear internal damping and the hydrodynamic loads as given by the morison equation and makes use of the local element frame described by zhu and yoo 2017 the model uses linear elastic lumped mass cable elements as well as special point mass elements to model buoys three translational degrees of freedom are adopted for the nodes bending torsion or cable contact effects are not considered 3 1 cable model equations at every time step fig 2 cable dynamics internal forces external loads and hydrodynamic masses are calculated for every element in its local frame fig 1 and then transformed back into the inertial frame using the 6 1 geometric operators c x e c y e c z e and the 3 3 transformation matrix a e eq 3 3 the geometric operators are constructed from the local frame basis unit vectors the geometric operators necessarily take on the form in eq 3 1 when applied to internal forces such as tension and damping and the form in eq 3 2 when applied to external loads as given by the morison equation 3 1 1 tension cable element tension p e is modeled using an element s cross sectional area a elastic modulus e current length l and reference length l r which is calculated from initial model geometry unless explicitly specified as an input variable for cables a value of l l r indicates the element is slack the cable element tension is given by 3 4 p e c z e a e l r l l r 3 1 2 damping damping is modeled using a constant material damping coefficient c c for damping to occur the element cannot be slack the damping force d e is assumed to be linear with the net tangential component of the nodal velocities 3 5 d e c z e c c u 2 u 1 z e 3 1 3 drag due to the use of the local element frame developed by zhu and yoo 2017 the hydrodynamic drag force appears only in the local y e and z e directions fig 1 the two drag force components acting on an element e can be written as 3 6 f d y e 1 2 c n ρ f d l v r x e z e v r 3 7 f d z e 1 2 π c t ρ f d l v r z e v r where d is the diameter ρ f is the mass density of the fluid c n and c t are the normal and tangential drag coefficients respectively and v r is the average relative nodal velocity of an element 3 8 v r v 2 u 2 v 1 u 1 2 as explained in 2 u n denotes the velocity of node n and v n denotes the fluid velocity at the location of node n the total drag force is transformed to the reference frame and assumed to be divided evenly between the two element nodes therefore the contribution of f d e at each node is 1 2 c y f d y e c z f d z e 3 1 4 froude krylov force as discussed in 2 1 the froude krylov force is the integral of pressure in the incident wave undisturbed by the presence of the body over the surface of the element since the froude krylov force depends only on the acceleration of the fluid in far field the froude krylov force for a cable element is given directly in the reference frame as 3 9 f f k e ρ f a l v where v is the average fluid acceleration at nodes 1 and 2 of an element 3 10 v v 2 v 1 2 3 1 5 hydrodynamic mass in the model presented in this paper the hydrodynamic mass added mass of an element m is considered as an extra inertial effect as shown in eq 2 2 and eq 2 6 as discussed in 2 1 the added mass coefficient c a for a cylinder is equal to 1 so the element added mass is equal to the mass of the displaced fluid 3 11 m c a a l ignoring the hydrodynamic mass in the element s tangential direction yields the hydrodynamic mass matrix m e in the local frame 3 12 m e m 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 this quantity is divided evenly between element nodes transformed to the reference frame and vectorized before being added to the total mass vector m t o t a l 3 13 m t o t a l m 1 2 a e m e a e t 1 1 1 t 3 1 6 buoyancy the numerical model has to consider the buoyancy of the submerged structure namely that of the cables elements and the buoys the buoyancy of a cable element is assumed to be constant and equal to ρ f v g where v is the volume is of the element and g is the acceleration due to gravity unlike cable elements the buoyant force on a buoy varies significantly as its submerged volume changes since the desired function of the model is to characterize the motion and forces in the cable elements a straightforward 3 degrees of freedom spherical buoy model is adopted in this paper for simplicity it is assumed that the submerged volume is a function of the depth and position of the buoy node ignoring the effects of free surface inclination in the numerical model buoys are created by designating cable nodes as point mass elements which then receive additional attributes of radius and mass buoy elements are assumed to be connected to cable elements at the buoy bottom the net buoy force is modeled as the sum of the buoy weight and the time varying buoyant force associated with current submerged volume v s for a spherical buoy with radius r b u o y v s is the volume of a spherical cap with wetted height h w 3 14 v s π 3 h w 2 3 r b u o y h w 0 v s v b u o y 0 h w 2 r b u o y 3 2 cable model benchmarking the time domain numerical model was benchmarked using the commercial software package proteusds considering simple hydrodynamic loadings the three example benchmarks shown in fig 3 all involve a 4 5 m long cable composed of nine 0 5 m long cable segments with diameter d 0 014 m stiffness factor of 1e5 n normal drag coefficient c n 1 5 tangential drag coefficient c t 0 05 added mass coefficient c a 1 0 and linear damping coefficient c c 1800 n m s the three benchmark cases in fig 3 are a general dynamics pendulum in air no drag weighted with a 100 kg point mass b drag cable pinned at both ends subject to a constant 2 m s current c drag and hydrodynamic mass pendulum in still water weighted with a 100 kg point mass in all three cases the benchmark tests indicate the reliability of the matlab model since the results tension vs time were in good agreement with proteusds figs 4 6 nevertheless due to different initialization procedures between the two time integration schemes some minor deviations should be expected between the solutions such deviations can be attributed to phase shifts and differences in numerical damping therefore to compare the numerical results the difference in the tension time history between the two models was normalized with respect to the maximum tension obtained figs 4d 5b and 6b with expected peak deviations occurring around moments of near zero tension fig 4c the difference between the constant time step of the matlab model and the variable time step in proteusds given by the mixed order runge kutta algorithm is also visible fig 4b 3 3 wave breaking model to characterize the mechanical behavior of a cable structure using the model described in the preceding sections relevant hydrodynamic time series input data describing the breaking wave action must be provided as mentioned in 1 commercial software generates this data using wave theories however these theories do not cover breaking waves thus motivating the coupling of the numerical breaking wave model described in 2 4 with the morison equation described in 2 1 in this work a two dimensional velocity field of the post breaking flow is considered as described above the velocity field is obtained using simulations similar to the one presented in deike et al 2015 and pizzo et al 2016 the intensity of the flow velocity and vorticity field turbulent dissipation rate depends on the wave slope s h k numerical results are normalized by the wavelength λ 2 π k for length scales and the wave period t for the time the wave period and wave number being linked by the dispersion relation for gravity waves in deep water ω 2 π t g k t a n h k h assuming geometric similarity of the breaking process for large wavelengths no surface tension effects the post breaking velocity fields can then be scaled to replicate any specific incoming wave since the wavelength sets the horizontal length scale and the wave slope sets the vertical one this assumption is supported by work on the dissipation and post breaking flow associated with breaking waves e g deike et al 2017 2016 2015 drazen et al 2008 drazen and melville 2009 pizzo et al 2016 the resulting velocity field of the post breaking flow is numerically differentiated to obtain the acceleration field the velocity acceleration and depth time histories are stored as interpolant objects for use during the cable dynamics time integration this coupling of the morison based hydrodynamic model with the breaking wave simulation permits the mechanical behavior of the underwater cable structures to be studied under breaking wave conditions 3 3 1 gerris flow solver this section describes the numerical methods used to generate breaking waves for this study the open source gerris is based on a quad octree adaptive spatial discretization multilevel poisson solver the full navier stokes equations in a two phase flow are solved in 2d including surface tension the interface between the high density liquid water and the low density gas air is reconstructed by a volume of fluid vof method the multifluid interface is traced by a function c x t defined as the volume fraction of a given fluid in each cell of the computational mesh the density and viscosity can thus be written as ρ c c ρ w 1 c ρ a μ c c μ w 1 c μ a with ρ w ρ a and μ w μ a the density and viscosity of the two fluids water and air respectively a detailed description of the numerical methods can be found in popinet 2009 this solver has been used recently by deike et al 2017 2016 2015 to study complex phenomena involving multiphase flow including breaking waves the incompressible variable density navier stokes equations with surface tension can be written as 3 15 v ρ t v v v p 2 μ d γ κ δ s n t ρ ρ v 0 v 0 with v u v w the fluid velocity ρ ρ x t the fluid density μ μ x t the dynamic viscosity and d the deformation tensor defined as d i j i u j j u i 2 the dirac delta δ s expresses the fact that the surface tension term is concentrated on the interface where γ is the surface tension coefficient κ and n the curvature and normal to the interface in gerris the interface between volumes of water tracer t 1 and air tracer t 0 is reconstructed by a discrete geometric vof method in the geometric volume of fluid formulation the volume fraction field is the exact integral of the volume fraction in each discretization element it is not smeared or diffused i e the volume fraction is one or zero in cells which do not contain an interface and between zero and one in cells which contain an interface the interface can then be reconstructed unambiguously in each cell with second order accuracy using piecewise linear elements 3 3 2 present configuration nonlinear stokes waves of wavelength λ are used as initial conditions to study wave breaking in order to simulate the laboratory experiments the waves must be able to propagate freely after breaking without interfering with the turbulent flow created during the breaking event thus a 2d rectangular numerical domain is considered with dimension l 8 λ in the horizontal propagation direction and l λ in the vertical direction see fig 7 the mean water level is set at η 0 so that the water depth is d λ 2 boundary conditions are periodic in x but the main wave never reaches the end of the numerical domain for times necessary to resolve the properties under investigation the top and bottom walls are free slip at z d λ 2 the total simulation time corresponds to 8 t where t 2 π ω 0 is the wave period and ω 0 the linear angular frequency of the input wave form a solution based on third order stokes wave for the interface η x t and the velocity potential φ x z t in the water are used as initial conditions at the left of the numerical domain for x λ 2 3 λ 2 and in the rest of the domain the interface and the velocity are set to 0 by applying a smooth windowing a strong plunging breaking wave with an initial wave slope h k 0 5 is considered the physical properties of the two phases are those of air and water and these manifest themselves through the density and viscosity ratios the bond number is defined as b o δ ρ g γ k 2 with δ ρ the density difference between the two fluids g the acceleration due to gravity and γ is the surface tension so that b o gives the ratio between gravity and surface tension forces the reynolds number in the water is r e c λ ν where c g k is the linear gravity wave phase speed and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the water which is set to r e 40000 this choice is related to spatial resolution constraints but should not affect the results regarding the wave dissipation since the reynolds number is sufficiently high enough to capture the phenomena in question as shown in deike et al 2016 2015 to obtain plunging breakers at high initial wave slope and to correctly resolve surface tension effects the bond number is chosen as b o 200 the wave breaking process obtained in the these simulations has been described in previous work by deike et al 2015 and pizzo et al 2016 and is very similar to laboratory observation e g drazen et al 2008 rapp and melville 1990 the wave starts propagating and becomes steeper due to non linear effects the interface becomes vertical and a jet forms at the crest then under gravity the jet impacts the surface and entrains air creating vortical motion in the water and a turbulent patch the vertical motion of the falling jet is well described by a ballistic trajectory with a velocity g h at impact liquid droplets and gas bubbles are formed when the overturning wave hits the liquid plunging breakers generate significant air entrainment when the jet reconnects to the liquid surface 4 case study the modeling framework is demonstrated with a square 5 5 m square net featuring an orthogonal mesh composed of ten 0 5 m cells in each direction fig 8 the model discretization coincides with the net knots resulting in 220 cable elements connected at 121 nodes the bottom of the net is positioned 5 m below mean water level and the bottom knots are pinned preventing translation but allowing rotation see fig 9 eleven spherical buoys with radius 0 15 m and mass 5 kg support the net from the top row nodes the material properties are identical to the ones used in the model validation 3 2 as discussed in 3 the fluid dynamics of the breaking wave are solved before starting the cable dynamics simulation a strong plunging breaker 2 2 is considered with t 5 s λ 39 m and h 3 1 m although the motivation for this paper stems from a net in shallow water here bathymetry is not considered and deep water waves are used for simplicity the corresponding velocity and acceleration fields as well as the free surface are precomputed using gerris 3 3 since the simulated fluid domain in this case is much larger than the size of the net at this scale the domain length is 8λ 312 26 m the gerris output can be cropped to the vicinity of the net to capture interesting effects on the cables the cable net is positioned so that the wave passes directly over it as it breaks next the cable dynamics are calculated to limit transient effects associated with initial conditions the static equilibrium problem at time t 0 s is solved first in other words only the effects of buoyancy are considered following this initialization the time integration was performed for a simulated time of 12 s fig 11 capturing two wave periods in their entirety the choice of model discretization and simulation time were based on the computational costs associated with the non optimized implementation of the numerical model however discretization is suitable for demonstrating the functionality of the modeling approach while the initialization procedure ensures a longer simulation time is not necessary for decaying transient effects apart from nodal displacements the simulation yields the time history of cable tensions for the cable net considered the mechanical response is dominated by the vertical cables due to the buoy forces while the horizontal cables fig 13 remain mostly slack indicated by thin dashed lines in fig 10 5 5 slack cables can pose numerical difficulties due to the sensitivity of the time integration algorithm so it is possible that spikes in the tensile response of the unrestrained horizontal cables are due to numerical rather than physical phenomena indeed when the vertical cables are loaded the horizontal cable tensions are smooth and well behaved fig 13 these effects can be mitigated by an appropriate choice of time step the middle vertical cable is examined more closely fig 12 whose elements are indicated in fig 8 the mechanical response to the two passing waves is clearly visible as a wave approaches and the free surface rises the entire cable is loaded suddenly with the bottom vertical element v116 seeing the highest tension due to the buoy and the cumulative buoyancy of the cable however the tension in the lower part of the cable quickly decreases while the top portion of the cable v215 experiences a more constant load for the duration of the wave period this behavior is typical for all the vertical cables as can be seen in fig 11 and can be attributed to the effects of drag forces acting along curved cables while many factors can contribute to and accelerate the degradation of moored cable structures the continuous wave loading suggests that effects of fatigue should be considered while the magnitude of the calculated forces may appear small the forces obviously increase for larger cables and buoys they can be significant when considering the fatigue phenomenon since even small loads can lead to material failure given a sufficiently high number of load cycles therefore the tensile load history of the cable net is an important factor to consider especially since it completely unloaded and reloaded every wave period while an in depth discussion of the fatigue of mooring lines is outside the scope of this discussion the method presented here makes it possible to supply a chosen fatigue model with potentially more accurate load estimates when dealing with breaking waves 5 conclusions future work motivated by the unique design problem of a protective anti shark cable net barrier this paper presented a novel approach to modeling underwater cable structures subject to breaking wave action to the best of the authors knowledge no previous literature exists on this specific subject the model presented in this paper is able to describe the complex states cable structures experience under breaking wave action the well known morison equation was coupled with a breaking wave simulation to produce a time domain analysis model suitable for conditions that cannot be modeled with leading commercial software the hydrodynamic model showed good agreement with the software package proteusds though it has not been validated empirically the analysis method was demonstrated using a simple cable net example but in the future will be applied to more complex underwater cable structures in demanding conditions the work presented in this paper offers multiple avenues for further development firstly more complex physical phenomena could be included in the cable dynamics model including the effects of cable flexural stiffness full buoy hydrodynamics here only buoyancy was considered and more sophisticated boundary conditions regarding the fluid dynamics desired bathymetry can be easily incorporated finally to handle finer discretization and or larger models with reasonable computational times the numerical implementation itself could benefit from optimization regarding the cable net shark barrier that motivated this study the effects of horizontal cable tension on the net s mechanical response should be studied thoroughly in the example considered in 4 the horizontal cables were unrestrained and thus remained mostly slack however the shark barrier probably develops high tensile forces in its horizontal elements since it is not only restrained at the ends anchored at the beach but also long enough 500 m to experience significant drag forces and added mass effects developing the appropriate boundary conditions to capture these conditions short of modeling the entire barrier will be the subject of a future work funding this research did not receive any specific grant from

23182,motivated by the design of a protective anti shark cable net enclosure located in heavy surf on la réunion france this paper presents a modeling technique for underwater cable structures subject to breaking wave action such modeling capability is not offered in leading commercial software forces on underwater cable structures are frequently modeled using the well established morison equation these forces are functions of the fluid velocity and acceleration which are normally calculated using an appropriate wave theory such an approach works well in many applications but it does not permit the modeling the effects of breaking waves however considering the absence of wave impact loads on submerged structures the morison equation is still valid provided that a suitable hydrodynamic time history is available in the presented work the morison equation is coupled with a high resolution breaking wave simulation obtained by solving the full air water navier stokes equations creating a time domain analysis approach suitable for studying underwater cable structures subject to breaking waves the hydrodynamic model is validated using the software package proteusds and the presented model is used to characterize the mechanical response of a moored cable net this research is of relevance to the analysis and design of submerged cable structures keywords cable structures breaking

netting anchored to the sea floor and tensioned by buoys seeking to improve the barrier s design has exposed a gap of knowledge in modeling and designing such structures although the modeling of submerged cable nets has been extensively studied in the context of fishing and aquaculture applications e g cui et al 2014 huang et al 2006 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 moe et al 2010 xu et al 2013 yao et al 2016 these existing models do not account for the impact of breaking waves as such nets are not typically subjected to breaking wave action this paper presents a novel approach to incorporate breaking wave action into a hydrodynamic time domain analysis model for the analysis of underwater cable structures generally the modeling of underwater cable structures subject to hydrodynamic loads but not wave break loads is a well studied problem the morison equation 1950 first developed to describe wave forces on slender piles is typically used for this purpose see 2 1 commercial software such as orcaflex 3 3 https www orcina com softwareproducts orcaflex and proteusds 4 4 https dsa ltd ca proteusds overview can model a wide variety of moored structures subject to the effects of wind and non breaking waves such software generates sea states using wave functions from which the necessary velocity and acceleration data are calculated and applied to the morison equation however such a modeling approach cannot handle breaking waves when a wave breaks a strong turbulent flow is generated and the fluid velocities and accelerations no longer vary in time with the wave period no analytical theories provide a useful description of fluid motions in such cases e g drazen et al 2008 perlin et al 2013 rapp and melville 1990 however if the cable structure remains submerged then there are no impact forces imparted and the morison equation remains valid allowing the possibility of using numerical simulations to describe the fluid motion instead of analytical theories using such a numerical approach this paper describes a time domain analysis model suitable for underwater cable structures subject to breaking wave action with the proper adjustments to the wave simulation this approach can be easily implemented to model moored cable structures in a wide variety of environments the paper is structured as follows following this introduction the requisite background knowledge on lumped mass cable modeling and recent contributions to the area are presented and the numerical methods used to simulate breaking waves and obtain the post breaking velocity field are described in 2 in 3 the structural model the wave simulation and their coupling are presented the structural model is validated with the commercial software proteusds using three simple benchmarks that ensure the proper functionality of the model and the hydrodynamic forcing function finally sample results are presented in 4 for a section of an underwater cable net under a breaking wave the paper concludes with a summary of the presented approach in 5 in this work vectors and matrices are denoted by lowercase and uppercase bolded italics respectively while scalar quantities are denoted by plain italics 2 background given the centrality of fluid mechanics to the design of any underwater structure this section begins with a brief review of the physical phenomena relevant to moored cable structures namely the forces described by the morison equation as well as a description of the numerical breaking wave simulation numerical modeling techniques suitable for characterizing the behavior of underwater cable structures are also reviewed 2 1 hydrodynamic forces on cables throughout the literature cable elements are commonly regarded as cylinders to simplify the computation of hydrodynamic forces a complete treatment of flow around cylinders is offered by sumer and fredsøe 2006 when a structure like a cable net is composed of slender elements whose diameters are much smaller than the wavelengths of the waves affecting them scattering and diffraction effects can be ignored a special theory has been developed for this situation originally proposed by morison et al 1950 for the case of fixed vertical piles and later generalized to include moving cylindrical bodies a complete treatment of flow around cylindrical bodies is offered by sumer and fredsøe 2006 to summarize the morison equation eq 2 1 expresses the hydrodynamic wave force f e x t on a unit length of a cylinder as the sum of three terms drag force hydrodynamic mass force and the froude krylov force 2 1 f e x t 1 2 ρ f d c d v x v x d r a g f d ρ f c m a v x h y d r o d y n a m i c m a s s ρ f a v f r o u d e k r y l o v f f k ρ f is the mass density of fluid d is the diameter of the cylinder a is the cross sectional area of the cylinder v is the fluid velocity calculated using a suitable wave theory or from a numerical simulation and x is the element position c d and c m are semi empirical drag and hydrodynamic mass coefficients the drag force is encountered in many engineering applications and cylinder drag is a well studied problem the other two terms in eq 2 1 also merit a brief explanation the hydrodynamic mass force describes the inertial effect due to the distortion of the fluid flow by the presence of the body in general the force f required to sustain the acceleration of a body with mass m through a stationary fluid is proportional to the body acceleration x and can be written as 2 2 f m m x here m ρ f c m a is the hydrodynamic mass also referred to as added mass of the unit cylinder which is the mass of the fluid in the immediate vicinity of the body that is accelerated along with the body due to pressure effects the hydrodynamic mass force is the additional force needed to accelerate this mass and can be obtained by integrating the pressure gradient that develops around the body as it accelerates for the case of the cylinder the added mass for flow perpendicular to the body is equal to ρ f a which gives rise to an added mass coefficient c m 1 as shown in sumer and fredsøe 2006 it is common to neglect the hydrodynamic mass force in the case of tangential flow around cylinders c m 0 the froude krylov force is the surface integral of pressure generated by accelerating flow in far field a control volume of water having a mass m and undergoing acceleration v must experience a force m v if this control volume is replaced with another body then that body must experience the same force m v to summarize the hydrodynamic mass force arises from near field effects and depends on the relative acceleration of the body while the froude krylov force depends only on the acceleration of the fluid in far field the drag force the hydrodynamic mass force and the froude krylov force represent the external loadings that are accounted for in the presented modeling approach see 3 for submerged moored cables subject to breaking wave action 2 2 modeling of moored cable net structures the moored cable nets that motivate the present work consist of cables and buoys in this paper however only the cable elements are treated in detail while the buoyant force from the buoys is considered as an additional external forcing on the system both the finite element fem e g huang 1994 ran et al 1999 williams and trivailo 2007 and the finite difference fdm e g ablow and schechter 1983 mehrabi and tabatabai 1998 milinazzo et al 1987 methods have been used in the dynamic modeling and simulation of cable systems the established fem approach uses a consistent mass matrix as in wang et al 1998 however by far the most widely used model is the lumped mass lm cable model which instead features a diagonal mass matrix m providing computational advantages in situations involving m 1 due to its ubiquity the lm model is well described e g buckham 2003 buckham and nicoll 2015 masciola et al 2014 to summarize the lm method a cable is discretized into n segments and their masses are concentrated at n 1 nodes the nodes are assumed to be connected by viscoelastic springs or in more complex formulations such as buckham s 2003 bending and torsional springs as well after discretization the entire cable is located in a chosen inertial frame while cable segments are described individually with local element frames unlike traditional stiffer civil engineering structures on land hydrodynamic loads on compliant cable structures vary not only with time but also with the structure s changing configuration and orientation for example the drag force and the hydrodynamic mass effect are each functions of anisotropic empirical and geometric coefficients which may differ for each degree of freedom in the model for cylindrical cable elements these coefficients are defined with respect to an element s normal and tangential directions for optimal computational efficiency the treatment of such loads necessitates the construction of an appropriate local element frame the most common approach uses euler angles and the frenet serret frame while an alternative has been proposed recently by zhu and yoo 2017 which accounts for not only geometry but also environmental loading in this approach an orthonormal reference frame for element e fig 1 is constructed using the element s normalized tangent vector z e defined using the element orientation vector l and length l and the average relative nodal velocity vector v r defined in eq 3 8 2 3 z e l l l l x e z e v r z e v r y e z e x e such a reference frame presents several advantages over the frenet serret frame approach as 1 most singularities associated with the traditional frame are avoided 2 the calculation of hydrodynamic forces is greatly simplified since tangential drag along with axial extension and damping is expressed with respect to the tangent vector z e and normal drag is expressed purely in terms of the binormal vector y e and 3 drag components on straight taut cables can be correctly modeled however this element frame experiences singularities in situations of either zero relative velocities or when the tangent and relative velocity vectors are collinear since non zero relative velocities can be assumed for modeling purposes the first singularity can be avoided by placing a small lower bound on the magnitude of the relative velocity such an approach is valid as it produces continuous displacements the second singularity requires ignoring the normal drag and added mass effects this element frame is adopted in the modeling approach presented in 3 2 3 wave breaking phenomenon deep water breaking waves impact ocean atmosphere interactions from local to climatic scales and play a significant role in interactions with marine structures and ships this has motivated numerous studies to elucidate the dynamics of breaking waves and characterize the post breaking turbulent flow when a wave breaks the water surface experiences strong changes at a front of the wave a jet may form and hit back at the water surface or the surface may roll over both processes entrain air eject spray and generate a complex turbulent flow beneath the surface wave breaking is therefore a transition from a laminar to a turbulent flow and solid structures in water will be affected by the post breaking flow laboratory experiments combined with numerical studies and theoretical scaling arguments have led to significant progress in the understanding of deep water breaking waves e g deike et al 2017 2016 2015 drazen et al 2008 perlin et al 2013 rapp and melville 1990 and have shown the importance of the wave slope s 2 4 s h k where h is the wave amplitude and k the wave number as the main parameter to describe the intensity of the post breaking flow the vertical velocity of the falling jet is given by a ballistic velocity g h which sets the level of vorticity and turbulence generated by the breaking event e g deike et al 2015 drazen et al 2008 pizzo et al 2016 2 4 modeling of breaking waves modeling the full two fluid air water flow associated with breaking waves remains a numerical challenge since it involves a two phase turbulent flow over a wide range of scales different approaches exist for modeling breaking waves in deep and shallow water reynolds averaged navier stokes rans are lower cost solutions for large scale flows but are unable to properly capture unsteady turbulent flows as discussed in derakhti et al 2016 large eddy simulations have this ability but rely on subgrid scale closures where strong assumptions are needed e g derakhti and kirby 2014 lubin and glockner 2015 in contrast direct numerical simulation dns is an appealing tool since no simplifications are needed however dns is computationally more expensive recently the open source solver gerris developed by popinet 2009 was used to perform dns of the two phase navier stokes equations solving for breaking waves in deep water in two and three dimensions at high reynolds number with results in very good agreement with laboratory experiments performed in large scale facility e g deike et al 2017 2016 2015 pizzo et al 2016 in this work a two dimensional breaking wave is considered for simplicity assuming no transverse component in the flow which was shown to reproduce many features of the post breaking flow e g deike et al 2016 2015 pizzo et al 2016 three dimensional simulations would be necessary for investigation of three dimensional vertical structures which are out of the scope of this study in this paper the two dimensional two phase air water navier stokes equations are solved using the solver gerris see 3 3 1 to simulate breaking waves and the results i e the velocity and acceleration fields are then considered as input for the forcing function on the cable structure within the two dimensional constraint all of the physical phenomena taking place at the interface are captured without resorting to any simplification of the model the simulation is similar to the one presented by deike et al 2015 and pizzo et al 2016 with a wave slope h k 0 5 corresponding to a strong plunging breaker 2 5 time integration cable structures are normally discretized per the finite element or the finite difference approach both of which result in the following discrete equation of motion in time t 2 5 m u t f i n t u t u t f e x t u t here m is the mass matrix f i n t u t u t is the internal force vector describing the damping and elastic forces and f e x t is the load vector nodal displacements velocities and accelerations are denoted by u t x t x i n i t i a l u t and u t respectively inertial forces due to the hydrodynamic mass can be dealt with either by 1 treating the effect as an external forcing as described in the morison equation eq 2 1 and adding the appropriate terms to f e x t u t or 2 by adding the hydrodynamic mass to the mass matrix m giving rise to a total mass matrix m t o t a l 2 6 m t o t a l u t f i n t u t u t f e x t u t a time domain analysis of the structure entails solving the equation of motion eq 2 5 in general this is a well studied problem and numerous techniques have been developed for this purpose the reader is referred to the state of the art reviews by modak and sotelino 2002 2000 and subbaraj and dokainish 1989a 1989b on this matter while efficient algorithms have been developed for flexible structures like cable nets e g cash and karp 1990 chung and hulbert 1993 the numerical modeling work presented in 3 uses an explicit central difference time integration scheme for simplicity 3 description of the numerical model to the best of the authors knowledge two commercial software packages have the capability to model submarine cable structures proteusds and orcaflex while both software packages can generate a wide variety of wave and current conditions using various wave theories neither is capable of modeling breaking waves to model the effect of breaking waves on moored cable systems a novel approach is proposed in this paper a propriety time domain analysis approach was developed in matlab 2016 using the central difference time integration method in this approach the morison equation eq 2 1 is coupled with a high resolution breaking wave simulation this coupling constitutes an original contribution to the research area as suggested by wienke and oumeraci 2005 this approach assumes the morison equation is still valid under breaking wave conditions if the net remains in the water and does not experience impact loads this section is dedicated to presenting the numerical model in detail with a focus on the cable dynamics and the hydrodynamic input data the breaking wave simulation the cable model considers the following phenomena self weight buoyancy internal tension linear internal damping and the hydrodynamic loads as given by the morison equation and makes use of the local element frame described by zhu and yoo 2017 the model uses linear elastic lumped mass cable elements as well as special point mass elements to model buoys three translational degrees of freedom are adopted for the nodes bending torsion or cable contact effects are not considered 3 1 cable model equations at every time step fig 2 cable dynamics internal forces external loads and hydrodynamic masses are calculated for every element in its local frame fig 1 and then transformed back into the inertial frame using the 6 1 geometric operators c x e c y e c z e and the 3 3 transformation matrix a e eq 3 3 the geometric operators are constructed from the local frame basis unit vectors the geometric operators necessarily take on the form in eq 3 1 when applied to internal forces such as tension and damping and the form in eq 3 2 when applied to external loads as given by the morison equation 3 1 1 tension cable element tension p e is modeled using an element s cross sectional area a elastic modulus e current length l and reference length l r which is calculated from initial model geometry unless explicitly specified as an input variable for cables a value of l l r indicates the element is slack the cable element tension is given by 3 4 p e c z e a e l r l l r 3 1 2 damping damping is modeled using a constant material damping coefficient c c for damping to occur the element cannot be slack the damping force d e is assumed to be linear with the net tangential component of the nodal velocities 3 5 d e c z e c c u 2 u 1 z e 3 1 3 drag due to the use of the local element frame developed by zhu and yoo 2017 the hydrodynamic drag force appears only in the local y e and z e directions fig 1 the two drag force components acting on an element e can be written as 3 6 f d y e 1 2 c n ρ f d l v r x e z e v r 3 7 f d z e 1 2 π c t ρ f d l v r z e v r where d is the diameter ρ f is the mass density of the fluid c n and c t are the normal and tangential drag coefficients respectively and v r is the average relative nodal velocity of an element 3 8 v r v 2 u 2 v 1 u 1 2 as explained in 2 u n denotes the velocity of node n and v n denotes the fluid velocity at the location of node n the total drag force is transformed to the reference frame and assumed to be divided evenly between the two element nodes therefore the contribution of f d e at each node is 1 2 c y f d y e c z f d z e 3 1 4 froude krylov force as discussed in 2 1 the froude krylov force is the integral of pressure in the incident wave undisturbed by the presence of the body over the surface of the element since the froude krylov force depends only on the acceleration of the fluid in far field the froude krylov force for a cable element is given directly in the reference frame as 3 9 f f k e ρ f a l v where v is the average fluid acceleration at nodes 1 and 2 of an element 3 10 v v 2 v 1 2 3 1 5 hydrodynamic mass in the model presented in this paper the hydrodynamic mass added mass of an element m is considered as an extra inertial effect as shown in eq 2 2 and eq 2 6 as discussed in 2 1 the added mass coefficient c a for a cylinder is equal to 1 so the element added mass is equal to the mass of the displaced fluid 3 11 m c a a l ignoring the hydrodynamic mass in the element s tangential direction yields the hydrodynamic mass matrix m e in the local frame 3 12 m e m 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 this quantity is divided evenly between element nodes transformed to the reference frame and vectorized before being added to the total mass vector m t o t a l 3 13 m t o t a l m 1 2 a e m e a e t 1 1 1 t 3 1 6 buoyancy the numerical model has to consider the buoyancy of the submerged structure namely that of the cables elements and the buoys the buoyancy of a cable element is assumed to be constant and equal to ρ f v g where v is the volume is of the element and g is the acceleration due to gravity unlike cable elements the buoyant force on a buoy varies significantly as its submerged volume changes since the desired function of the model is to characterize the motion and forces in the cable elements a straightforward 3 degrees of freedom spherical buoy model is adopted in this paper for simplicity it is assumed that the submerged volume is a function of the depth and position of the buoy node ignoring the effects of free surface inclination in the numerical model buoys are created by designating cable nodes as point mass elements which then receive additional attributes of radius and mass buoy elements are assumed to be connected to cable elements at the buoy bottom the net buoy force is modeled as the sum of the buoy weight and the time varying buoyant force associated with current submerged volume v s for a spherical buoy with radius r b u o y v s is the volume of a spherical cap with wetted height h w 3 14 v s π 3 h w 2 3 r b u o y h w 0 v s v b u o y 0 h w 2 r b u o y 3 2 cable model benchmarking the time domain numerical model was benchmarked using the commercial software package proteusds considering simple hydrodynamic loadings the three example benchmarks shown in fig 3 all involve a 4 5 m long cable composed of nine 0 5 m long cable segments with diameter d 0 014 m stiffness factor of 1e5 n normal drag coefficient c n 1 5 tangential drag coefficient c t 0 05 added mass coefficient c a 1 0 and linear damping coefficient c c 1800 n m s the three benchmark cases in fig 3 are a general dynamics pendulum in air no drag weighted with a 100 kg point mass b drag cable pinned at both ends subject to a constant 2 m s current c drag and hydrodynamic mass pendulum in still water weighted with a 100 kg point mass in all three cases the benchmark tests indicate the reliability of the matlab model since the results tension vs time were in good agreement with proteusds figs 4 6 nevertheless due to different initialization procedures between the two time integration schemes some minor deviations should be expected between the solutions such deviations can be attributed to phase shifts and differences in numerical damping therefore to compare the numerical results the difference in the tension time history between the two models was normalized with respect to the maximum tension obtained figs 4d 5b and 6b with expected peak deviations occurring around moments of near zero tension fig 4c the difference between the constant time step of the matlab model and the variable time step in proteusds given by the mixed order runge kutta algorithm is also visible fig 4b 3 3 wave breaking model to characterize the mechanical behavior of a cable structure using the model described in the preceding sections relevant hydrodynamic time series input data describing the breaking wave action must be provided as mentioned in 1 commercial software generates this data using wave theories however these theories do not cover breaking waves thus motivating the coupling of the numerical breaking wave model described in 2 4 with the morison equation described in 2 1 in this work a two dimensional velocity field of the post breaking flow is considered as described above the velocity field is obtained using simulations similar to the one presented in deike et al 2015 and pizzo et al 2016 the intensity of the flow velocity and vorticity field turbulent dissipation rate depends on the wave slope s h k numerical results are normalized by the wavelength λ 2 π k for length scales and the wave period t for the time the wave period and wave number being linked by the dispersion relation for gravity waves in deep water ω 2 π t g k t a n h k h assuming geometric similarity of the breaking process for large wavelengths no surface tension effects the post breaking velocity fields can then be scaled to replicate any specific incoming wave since the wavelength sets the horizontal length scale and the wave slope sets the vertical one this assumption is supported by work on the dissipation and post breaking flow associated with breaking waves e g deike et al 2017 2016 2015 drazen et al 2008 drazen and melville 2009 pizzo et al 2016 the resulting velocity field of the post breaking flow is numerically differentiated to obtain the acceleration field the velocity acceleration and depth time histories are stored as interpolant objects for use during the cable dynamics time integration this coupling of the morison based hydrodynamic model with the breaking wave simulation permits the mechanical behavior of the underwater cable structures to be studied under breaking wave conditions 3 3 1 gerris flow solver this section describes the numerical methods used to generate breaking waves for this study the open source gerris is based on a quad octree adaptive spatial discretization multilevel poisson solver the full navier stokes equations in a two phase flow are solved in 2d including surface tension the interface between the high density liquid water and the low density gas air is reconstructed by a volume of fluid vof method the multifluid interface is traced by a function c x t defined as the volume fraction of a given fluid in each cell of the computational mesh the density and viscosity can thus be written as ρ c c ρ w 1 c ρ a μ c c μ w 1 c μ a with ρ w ρ a and μ w μ a the density and viscosity of the two fluids water and air respectively a detailed description of the numerical methods can be found in popinet 2009 this solver has been used recently by deike et al 2017 2016 2015 to study complex phenomena involving multiphase flow including breaking waves the incompressible variable density navier stokes equations with surface tension can be written as 3 15 v ρ t v v v p 2 μ d γ κ δ s n t ρ ρ v 0 v 0 with v u v w the fluid velocity ρ ρ x t the fluid density μ μ x t the dynamic viscosity and d the deformation tensor defined as d i j i u j j u i 2 the dirac delta δ s expresses the fact that the surface tension term is concentrated on the interface where γ is the surface tension coefficient κ and n the curvature and normal to the interface in gerris the interface between volumes of water tracer t 1 and air tracer t 0 is reconstructed by a discrete geometric vof method in the geometric volume of fluid formulation the volume fraction field is the exact integral of the volume fraction in each discretization element it is not smeared or diffused i e the volume fraction is one or zero in cells which do not contain an interface and between zero and one in cells which contain an interface the interface can then be reconstructed unambiguously in each cell with second order accuracy using piecewise linear elements 3 3 2 present configuration nonlinear stokes waves of wavelength λ are used as initial conditions to study wave breaking in order to simulate the laboratory experiments the waves must be able to propagate freely after breaking without interfering with the turbulent flow created during the breaking event thus a 2d rectangular numerical domain is considered with dimension l 8 λ in the horizontal propagation direction and l λ in the vertical direction see fig 7 the mean water level is set at η 0 so that the water depth is d λ 2 boundary conditions are periodic in x but the main wave never reaches the end of the numerical domain for times necessary to resolve the properties under investigation the top and bottom walls are free slip at z d λ 2 the total simulation time corresponds to 8 t where t 2 π ω 0 is the wave period and ω 0 the linear angular frequency of the input wave form a solution based on third order stokes wave for the interface η x t and the velocity potential φ x z t in the water are used as initial conditions at the left of the numerical domain for x λ 2 3 λ 2 and in the rest of the domain the interface and the velocity are set to 0 by applying a smooth windowing a strong plunging breaking wave with an initial wave slope h k 0 5 is considered the physical properties of the two phases are those of air and water and these manifest themselves through the density and viscosity ratios the bond number is defined as b o δ ρ g γ k 2 with δ ρ the density difference between the two fluids g the acceleration due to gravity and γ is the surface tension so that b o gives the ratio between gravity and surface tension forces the reynolds number in the water is r e c λ ν where c g k is the linear gravity wave phase speed and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the water which is set to r e 40000 this choice is related to spatial resolution constraints but should not affect the results regarding the wave dissipation since the reynolds number is sufficiently high enough to capture the phenomena in question as shown in deike et al 2016 2015 to obtain plunging breakers at high initial wave slope and to correctly resolve surface tension effects the bond number is chosen as b o 200 the wave breaking process obtained in the these simulations has been described in previous work by deike et al 2015 and pizzo et al 2016 and is very similar to laboratory observation e g drazen et al 2008 rapp and melville 1990 the wave starts propagating and becomes steeper due to non linear effects the interface becomes vertical and a jet forms at the crest then under gravity the jet impacts the surface and entrains air creating vortical motion in the water and a turbulent patch the vertical motion of the falling jet is well described by a ballistic trajectory with a velocity g h at impact liquid droplets and gas bubbles are formed when the overturning wave hits the liquid plunging breakers generate significant air entrainment when the jet reconnects to the liquid surface 4 case study the modeling framework is demonstrated with a square 5 5 m square net featuring an orthogonal mesh composed of ten 0 5 m cells in each direction fig 8 the model discretization coincides with the net knots resulting in 220 cable elements connected at 121 nodes the bottom of the net is positioned 5 m below mean water level and the bottom knots are pinned preventing translation but allowing rotation see fig 9 eleven spherical buoys with radius 0 15 m and mass 5 kg support the net from the top row nodes the material properties are identical to the ones used in the model validation 3 2 as discussed in 3 the fluid dynamics of the breaking wave are solved before starting the cable dynamics simulation a strong plunging breaker 2 2 is considered with t 5 s λ 39 m and h 3 1 m although the motivation for this paper stems from a net in shallow water here bathymetry is not considered and deep water waves are used for simplicity the corresponding velocity and acceleration fields as well as the free surface are precomputed using gerris 3 3 since the simulated fluid domain in this case is much larger than the size of the net at this scale the domain length is 8λ 312 26 m the gerris output can be cropped to the vicinity of the net to capture interesting effects on the cables the cable net is positioned so that the wave passes directly over it as it breaks next the cable dynamics are calculated to limit transient effects associated with initial conditions the static equilibrium problem at time t 0 s is solved first in other words only the effects of buoyancy are considered following this initialization the time integration was performed for a simulated time of 12 s fig 11 capturing two wave periods in their entirety the choice of model discretization and simulation time were based on the computational costs associated with the non optimized implementation of the numerical model however discretization is suitable for demonstrating the functionality of the modeling approach while the initialization procedure ensures a longer simulation time is not necessary for decaying transient effects apart from nodal displacements the simulation yields the time history of cable tensions for the cable net considered the mechanical response is dominated by the vertical cables due to the buoy forces while the horizontal cables fig 13 remain mostly slack indicated by thin dashed lines in fig 10 5 5 slack cables can pose numerical difficulties due to the sensitivity of the time integration algorithm so it is possible that spikes in the tensile response of the unrestrained horizontal cables are due to numerical rather than physical phenomena indeed when the vertical cables are loaded the horizontal cable tensions are smooth and well behaved fig 13 these effects can be mitigated by an appropriate choice of time step the middle vertical cable is examined more closely fig 12 whose elements are indicated in fig 8 the mechanical response to the two passing waves is clearly visible as a wave approaches and the free surface rises the entire cable is loaded suddenly with the bottom vertical element v116 seeing the highest tension due to the buoy and the cumulative buoyancy of the cable however the tension in the lower part of the cable quickly decreases while the top portion of the cable v215 experiences a more constant load for the duration of the wave period this behavior is typical for all the vertical cables as can be seen in fig 11 and can be attributed to the effects of drag forces acting along curved cables while many factors can contribute to and accelerate the degradation of moored cable structures the continuous wave loading suggests that effects of fatigue should be considered while the magnitude of the calculated forces may appear small the forces obviously increase for larger cables and buoys they can be significant when considering the fatigue phenomenon since even small loads can lead to material failure given a sufficiently high number of load cycles therefore the tensile load history of the cable net is an important factor to consider especially since it completely unloaded and reloaded every wave period while an in depth discussion of the fatigue of mooring lines is outside the scope of this discussion the method presented here makes it possible to supply a chosen fatigue model with potentially more accurate load estimates when dealing with breaking waves 5 conclusions future work motivated by the unique design problem of a protective anti shark cable net barrier this paper presented a novel approach to modeling underwater cable structures subject to breaking wave action to the best of the authors knowledge no previous literature exists on this specific subject the model presented in this paper is able to describe the complex states cable structures experience under breaking wave action the well known morison equation was coupled with a breaking wave simulation to produce a time domain analysis model suitable for conditions that cannot be modeled with leading commercial software the hydrodynamic model showed good agreement with the software package proteusds though it has not been validated empirically the analysis method was demonstrated using a simple cable net example but in the future will be applied to more complex underwater cable structures in demanding conditions the work presented in this paper offers multiple avenues for further development firstly more complex physical phenomena could be included in the cable dynamics model including the effects of cable flexural stiffness full buoy hydrodynamics here only buoyancy was considered and more sophisticated boundary conditions regarding the fluid dynamics desired bathymetry can be easily incorporated finally to handle finer discretization and or larger models with reasonable computational times the numerical implementation itself could benefit from optimization regarding the cable net shark barrier that motivated this study the effects of horizontal cable tension on the net s mechanical response should be studied thoroughly in the example considered in 4 the horizontal cables were unrestrained and thus remained mostly slack however the shark barrier probably develops high tensile forces in its horizontal elements since it is not only restrained at the ends anchored at the beach but also long enough 500 m to experience significant drag forces and added mass effects developing the appropriate boundary conditions to capture these conditions short of modeling the entire barrier will be the subject of a future work funding this research did not receive any specific grant from

23183,the reduction of roll and pitch motions is important to improve the safety and operability of a ship a pitch roll stabilization prs control approach for a ship with two pairs of active fins is proposed in this approach the key part is the onboard forecasting of the ship s hydrodynamic forces according to the proposed approach a prs controller was developed by integrating a short term predictor a force estimator and a fin angle allocator the prs controller outputs the optimal attack angles for the active fins by inputting the collected ship s motion time series first the short term predictor serves to predict the future motions of the ship second the predicted ship motions are used in the force estimator to estimate the external hydrodynamic forces finally the predicted hydrodynamic forces regarded as the expected stabilizing forces are further employed to evaluate the optimal effective attack angles for the fins actuator the active fins are actuated based on the specified optimal effective attack angles to evaluate the performance of the proposed prs control approach numerical simulations and experimental tests under various sea states were investigated both the numerical and experimental results suggest that the proposed control approach provided a satisfactory reduction of the pitch and roll motions simultaneously keywords pitch roll stabilization control active fins onboard hydrodynamic prediction numerical simulation experimental test 1 introduction ships experience large pitch and roll motions when sailing in severe sea states these motions lead to negative effects for maritime operations or traveling by ships in terms of safety and efficiency the vertical accelerations caused by the pitch and roll motions make a sensory conflict that leads to seasickness the seasickness greatly affects the comfort of the passengers and decreases the crew s ability to work in addition large roll motions may result in cargo damage and even cause the ship to capsize moreover pitch motions resonating with the waves produce a dangerous condition for a parametric roll motion which leads to the ship s loss of stability therefore research on the reduction of the roll and pitch has been extensively conducted over the past several decades anti rolling is the first choice for improving the sea keeping performance of a ship many passive and active controlled devices have been designed to reduce the roll motion the bilge keel was the first effort in anti rolling william froude 1865 later water tanks were studied for the roll control frahm 1911 active methods have been attempted to further improve the roll control efficiency schlick 1904 invented a roll control device using the gyroscopic effects of large rotating wheels the active gyrostabilizer system was also used in the ride control of marine vehicles townsend et al 2007 moving weights provide another feasible anti rolling method treakle et al 2000 in addition active and passive fins have been widely investigated where the active fins have demonstrated satisfactory performance in anti rolling as seen in perez and blanke 2012 in addition to roll control anti pitching is the second choice to improve the safety and operability of a ship comparatively anti pitching is still not as efficient for the practical purposes of anti rolling because the pitch moment is much larger than the roll moment early works on pitch reduction started from passive methods however the latter research studies indicate the superior performance of active methods over passive methods in anti pitching fixed fins stabilizers were the most widely used passive methods to reduce pitch motion and both bow and stern fins have been explored to prevent pitch motion experimental results abkowitz 1959 pournaras 1956 have consistently shown that considerable reductions in pitch and slamming were obtained however bow fixed fins lead to severe vibrations and speed loss the deficiency was confirmed by the sea trials results wallace 1955 ochi 1962 the bow fixed fins induced vibrations that could be alleviated by moving the fin aft of station 3 however the control efficiency would be greatly reduced ochi 1962 stefun 1962 found that tip fences and deep submergence are helpful in reducing vibrations a fixed strut mounted hydrofoil below the bow of a yacht was also investigated avis 1991 where the pitch and added wave resistance were found to be reduced by up to 20 however the total resistance was approximately 25 higher under certain encounter frequencies studies have shown that passive methods were effective in pitch control however they increase the ship s resistance and cause vibrations active methods such as a rudder or active fins have been shown to be another possible solution for pitch control anti pitching using a pi rudder was studied by kaplan 1981 the pitch and bow accelerations were reduced by 30 and 50 respectively however the controller design was more complex as pitch periods have a wider range kaplan and clark 1984 canted rudders produce both horizontal and vertical lift in which the horizontal lift is used to control the steering while the vertical lift controls the pitch kaplan and clark 1984 investigated canted rudders mathematically by using the warfare vessel uss oliver hazard perry ffg 7 the pitch was reduced 30 when the ffg 7 was operating at sea state 6 at 20 knots active fins provide another relatively efficient way for anti pitching pitch reductions through active fins actuated by various controller schemes such as the proportional integral derivative pid wu et al 1999 neural network and fuzzy logic liut 1999 liut et al 2001 were studied for practical purposes the joint pitch roll stabilization is the most expected method for improving the safety comfort and operability of ships however studies on joint pitch roll control have rarely been reported kim and kim 2011 studied ship pitch roll control by using two pairs of stabilizing fins controllers that were designed based on the pid and linear quadratic gaussian lqg algorithms were compared numerical simulations of anti pitching anti rolling and pitch roll control on a cruise ship were carried out considerable reduction of the roll motion was obtained by using the pid or lqg algorithms the roll and pitch motions were stabilized simultaneously by using two pairs of fins actuated by an lqg controller kim and kim 2014 analyzed passenger comfort quantitatively based on the motion sickness dose value msdv index the roll pitch stabilization using two pairs of active fins has been applied to improve passenger comfort among various stabilizers active fins function as the most effective stabilizer when the forward speed is higher than 10 15 knots perez 2005 large parts of modern ships are equipped with active fins for ship motion control the efficiency of a ship s motions controlled by active fins mainly depends on the controller design wu et al 1999 employed a pid controller for pitch reduction and verified the controller by experiments controllers using a variable structure yang and jiang 2004 and a linear quadratic regulator lee et al 2011 have been employed for anti rolling to overcome the nonlinearity in controlling active fins nonlinear approaches were used in designing the controllers liut 1999 liut et al 2001 developed controllers based on neural networks and fuzzy logic methods further a model predictive controller was also applied to prevent the nonlinear effects of fins perez 2005 perez and goodwin 2008 in recent years advanced methods have been proposed for the active fin controller design fang et al 2010 developed a self tuning neural network pid controller for an anti rolling fins stabilizer the simulation results indicate that the proposed controller is suitable for controlling the gains acquisition however the controller can increase the resistance and heading error kaplan and clark 1984 designed a lyapunov s direct method based on a controller for anti rolling and reducing the erosion of safe basins for ships this controller successfully reduced the erosion percentage of safe basins and the roll amplitudes for low ship speeds however the roll amplitudes exceeded a certain value a genetic algorithm based on a pid controller for a fin stabilizer has been studied for roll reduction liut et al 2001 the uncertain fin roll dynamic was stabilized by using a sliding mode controller moradi and malekizade 2013 hinostroza et al 2015 developed a robust fin controller based on an l2 gain design to reduce the roll motion of surface ships liut et al 2001 designed a sliding mode controller for both steering and roll reduction however compared with the research on anti rolling and anti pitching the research on pitch roll control has rarely been reported an adaptive estimation of the hydrodynamic forces for a pitch roll stabilization prs controller design has not been clearly solved in the present research a predictive approach was developed to reduce the pitch roll motions the predictive control approach estimates the hydrodynamic forces online based on the real time predicted ship motions whereas an adaptive ar model autoregressive model is employed to forecast the ship s motions in real time a prs controller is designed to actuate two pairs of active fins numerical and experimental investigations were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and to analyze the control efficiency of the proposed method this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the mathematical model of a ship s dynamics section 3 presents the details of the controller design section 4 provides the experimental methodology section 5 discusses both the numerical and experimental results and section 6 presents the study s conclusions 2 mathematical model of ship dynamics this section describes a mathematical model for ship roll pitch heave dynamics fig 1 illustrates the heave roll pitch motions and coordinate systems for dynamic modeling the ship motions of pitch heave and roll are represented as η 5 η 3 and η 4 respectively the inertial coordinate system o x 0 y 0 z 0 fixed on the calm water surface is used to model the wave ship hydrodynamics are described using the body fixed coordinate system g xyz this system originates at the ship s center of gravity and moves with the ship the horizontal body coordinate system o x 0 y 0 z 0 is employed to describe the hydrodynamic boundary value problem it is fixed on the calm water surface however it translates with the ship along the forward direction 2 1 3 dof ship motions dynamic model this subsection presents the formulations for a three degrees of freedom dof ship dynamic model for practical purpose potential theories are mostly used in ship hydrodynamic modeling in the ship motion control problem eqs 1 3 formulate the roll heave and pitch motions in the time domain by using the impulsive response function

difference operators the indices jk suggest the contribution of an oscillatory motion in the j th mode on the hydrodynamic coefficients in k th direction the 3rd 4th and 5th modes motions represent heave roll and pitch respectively μ jk denotes the infinite frequency added mass coefficients b jk represents the radiated damping coefficients and c jk and k jk t are the restoring hydrodynamic factor and time dependent memory functions respectively hydrodynamic coefficients in the ship dynamic mathematical model can be obtained by solving the boundary value problems for details regarding the hydrodynamic forces calculation and ship motions simulation in the 2d method refer to fonseca and guedes stefun 1962 in our present work the numerical simulations of the ship motions were realized through a 2 5d approach ma et al 2005 for practical purposes the roll heave and pitch equations were solved in the time domain by continuously implementing the 4th order runge kutta schemes 2 2 hydrodynamic modeling for active fins this section describes the dynamic model for the active fin stabilizer the stabilizer consists of two pairs of hydrofoils the hydrofoils were mounted on rotatable stocks at the turn of the bilge the hydrofoils produce hydrodynamic lifts when there is an angle between the flow and the fins the incoming flow results from the advancing speed of the ship the stabilizing moments for pitch and roll motions controls are contributed by the generated lifts assuming that the ship advances in the x axis direction with a forward speed u then the incoming flow speed v and the effective attack angle α t can be formulated as 4 v v x v y u u w t η 3 t y f i η 4 t x f i η 5 t v w t and 5 α t i α f i η 5 δ α i in which the components of the effective attack angle α t are illustrated in fig 2 in equation 5 α f i is the operational angle of the i th active fin the horizontal and vertical components of the fluid particle are represented as u w t and v w t respectively and δ α derives from the ship s velocity and the flow velocity it is expressed as 6 δ α i arctan η 3 t y f i η 4 t x f i η 5 t v w t u u w t where x f i y f i z f i indicate the x y and z components of the i th actuating arm respectively the actuating arm is defined as the distance between the quarter point of the i th fin and the gravity center of the ship the parameters η 3 η 4 η 5 are the induced velocities with respect to the heave roll and pitch motions respectively stabilizer fins usually operate in unsteady conditions for practical purposes however the unsteady effects are neglected altogether in most cases for the control system design steady hydrodynamic characteristics of the fins can be performed in the controller design for ship reduction perez 2005 a quasi steady approach with an input constraint on the attack angle is adopted in the present control method detailed descriptions about the constrained method are provided in subsection 3 3 the lift force l f i and the drag d f i of each active fin are formulated as 7 l f i 1 2 ρ v 2 s c l α t α t i i 1 4 8 d f i 1 2 ρ v 2 s c d α t α t i i 1 4 where ρ represents the water density s denotes the fin s projected area and c l α t and c d α t are derivatives of the lift coefficient c l and the drag coefficient c d to the effective attack angle α t i consequently the induced moments for roll and pitch reduction produced by two pairs of active fins are calculated by 9 f 4 f i 1 4 y f i l f i cos δ α d f i sin δ α 10 f 5 f i 1 4 x f i l f i cos δ α d f i sin δ α where f f 4 and f f 5 are the roll and pitch stabilization moments respectively and x f i and y f i represent the x and y components of the i th actuating arm the actuating arm is defined as the distance between the quarter point of the i th fin and the ship s gravity center 3 pitch roll stabilization controller design in this section a pitch roll stabilization prs controller is designed on the basis of the proposed method the active fins stabilizer produces hydrodynamic lift when there is an attack angle between the incoming flow and the hydrofoil the prs control using two pairs of active fins is illustrated in fig 3 two pairs of stabilizing hydrofoils were installed on both the fore and aft parts of the ship to produce the stabilizing moments for the pitch and roll motion simultaneously the active fins were actuated as follows for both the fore pair or aft pair of fins the attack angles of the port side and the starboard side fins have the same sign but different magnitudes in addition the fore pair of fins and the aft pair of fins were actuated in the opposite directions consequently the pitch stabilizing moment is generated by the fore pair and the aft pair of fins as shown in fig 3 the stabilizing moment for anti rolling is obtained from the resultant of the generated lifts by the port side and the starboard side fins as shown in fig 3 fig 4 illustrates the pitch roll stabilization prs controller design and its implementation procedure the ship motions are the outputs of the ship s dynamic system these motions result from the wave excitation f wave t and stabilizing force f fin stab the ship dynamic system shown in the flow chart can be either a numerical or physical ship environment system in our study both a numerical simulation and experimental testing were investigated for the numerical simulation the ship motions were generated by using a weakly nonlinear 2 5d method duan et al 2016 in the ship model testing the ship motions were obtained via sensors as shown in fig 4 the ship motions η ˆ t combined with their velocities η ˆ t and accelerations η ˆ t are the inputs to the prs controller the output of the prs controller is the attack angle vector α t k when implementing the prs controller first the short term predictors were constructed based on the collected ship motion data the predictors provided the predictions of the heave roll and pitch motions and the k step predicted results were designated η ˆ t k η ˆ t k and η ˆ t k respectively subsequently the incoming heave force f ˆ 3 t k roll moment f ˆ 4 t k and pitch moment f ˆ 5 t k were calculated by the hydrodynamic force estimator finally the attack angle allocator calculated the expected attack angles α t k and commanded the actuators to modify the attack angles of the hydrofoils as suggested above three parts are involved in the controller design the prs controller was developed by integrating a short term predictor a force estimator and a fin angle allocator the essential part of the prs controller is forecasting the roll and pitch moments based on the predicted motions the details regarding the short term predictor force estimator and fin angle allocator are provided in section 3 1 3 1 short term predictor the short term prediction of the ship motions in real time is valuable for compensation control wu et al 1999 the present prs controller design applies a short term predictor for the heave roll and pitch motions the predictor was developed based on the ar model the predictor has been widely used in ship motions predictions for its relatively simple model identification adaptation and convenience in real time implementation in the prs controller the ar model was constructed by using the collected ship motion this model considers that hidden relations exist among the variables of time series the present variable is able to be represented by the previous variable in time for a given ship motion time series η t t 1 n the ar model is expressed as 11 η t φ η t t 1 ε t t p 1 n in which 12 φ φ 1 φ 2 φ p η t 1 t η t 1 η t 2 η t p where p and φ are model order and parameter vector respectively and ε t t p 1 n is a zero mean white noise sequence the identification of the ar model in eq 11 involves the determinations of order p and model parameter vector φ the determination of the model parameters vector φ is called parameter estimation in the present work the levinson durbin l d algorithm was adopted for the parameter s estimation because the l d algorithm shows a comparatively high adaptive nature and high computational efficiency duan et al 2015a first the system when p 1 is solved then it is easy to solve a p 1 coefficients sized problem according to the levinson durbin recursion the p coefficients sized problem for the recursive algorithm has already previously been solved the details of the levinson durbin algorithm were presented by duan et al 2015b similarly the determination of the model order p is called order selection in past decades various criteria have been proposed to determine the order for the ar model among these methods the aikaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic are still the most popular approaches for practical applications however as the model order determined by the aic principle fails to converge to the true order avis 1991 the bic criterion is preferred in the order selection the bic value of the general ar p model is defined as 13 b i c p lg σ ˆ a 2 p 1 lg n n where σ 2 is the covariance the model order that leads to the minimum bic value is chosen as the optimal order when the model order p and parameters vector φ are worked out based on the given ship motions time series η t t 1 n a k step ahead short term predictor based on the ar model in eq 11 can be developed as 14 η ˆ n k φ η t n k 1 and 15 η t n k 1 η n k 1 η n k 2 η n k p k 1 η ˆ n k 1 η ˆ n 1 η n η n p k 1 k p η ˆ n k 1 η ˆ n k 2 η ˆ n k p k p where η ˆ n k is the k step prediction result 3 2 hydrodynamic forces estimator a real time estimation of the ship hydrodynamic forces is the essential part for the prs controller design the heave force roll moment and pitch moment are calculated by the hydrodynamic force estimator which was developed by applying the dynamic equilibrium between the external forces and ship motions the coordinate systems as shown in fig 1 are used to describe the relations between the ship motions and hydrodynamic forces according to eqs 1 3 the hydrodynamic forces estimator is formulated as 16 f ˆ 3 t 1 m μ 33 η ˆ 3 t 1 b 33 η ˆ 3 t 1 c 33 η ˆ 3 t 1 0 t 1 k 33 t τ η ˆ 3 t 1 d τ μ 35 η ˆ 5 t 1 b 35 η ˆ 5 t 1 c 35 η ˆ 5 t 1 0 t 1 k 35 t τ η ˆ 5 t 1 d τ c 33 h η ˆ 3 t 1 c 35 h η ˆ 3 t 1 17 f ˆ 4 t 1 i x x μ 44 η ˆ 4 t 1 b 44 η ˆ 4 t 1 c 44 η ˆ 4 t 1 0 t 1 k 44 t τ η ˆ 4 t 1 d τ c 44 h η ˆ 4 t 1 b 441 η ˆ 4 t 1 b 443 η ˆ 4 3 t 1 18 f ˆ 5 t 1 i y y μ 55 η 5 t 1 b 55 η ˆ 5 t 1 c 55 η ˆ 5 0 t 1 k 55 t τ η ˆ 5 t 1 d τ 5 μ 53 η ˆ 3 t 1 b 53 η ˆ 3 t 1 c 53 η 3 t 1 0 t 1 k 53 t τ η ˆ 3 t 1 d τ c 55 h η ˆ 5 t 1 c 53 h η ˆ 5 t 1 where t indicates the present step while t 1 is the incoming step and f ˆ 3 t 1 f ˆ 4 t 1 and f ˆ 5 t 1 are the predicted heave force roll and pitch moments respectively resulting from the external wave excitations the moments of inertia for the roll and pitch motion are represented by i xx and i yy respectively and c j k h are the statistic restoring coefficients represented as follows c 33 h ρ g a w p c 44 h ρ g z b z g ρ g w p y 2 d x d y c 35 h c 53 h ρ g w p x d x d y c 55 h ρ g z b z g ρ g w p x 2 d x d y in which ρ is the water density and g is the gravity acceleration for a ship the z components of the bouncy center and gravity center are designated z b and z g the ship s displacement and water plan are represented by a wp and x and y are the longitudinal and lateral positions of the discrete units on the integration routine of a ship s water plan with the above relations the external hydrodynamic forces can be evaluated with the measured ship motions in real time 3 3 attack angle allocator the attack angle allocator provides the outputs of the prs controller it decides the optimal attack angles for actuating the active fins the output attack angles are calculated by applying the hydrodynamic forces forecasts to eqs 9 and 10 the predicted wave excited roll moment f ˆ 4 and pitch moment f ˆ 5 are regarded as the required roll and pitch stabilization moments therefore the expected attack angles α t i i 1 4 can be evaluated by solving equation system 19 19 f ˆ 4 f 4 f α t i 0 f ˆ 5 f 5 f α t i 0 to avoid dynamic stall caused by the unsteady effects a constrained condition needs to be satisfied in addition to equation system 19 dynamic stall leads to loss of control action perez and goodwin 2008 when the effective attack angle is less than the steady flow stall angle however experimental results gaillarde 2002 reveal that the dynamic behavior of the foil can be predicted by its static characteristic the steady characteristics describe the behavior of the fin accurately in a quasi steady motion of the fins therefore the fins allocator design can be performed using the steady hydrodynamic characteristic of the fins perez 2005 a constraint on the effective angle of attack could prevent the development of dynamic stalling conditions perez 2005 the effective attack angle should be less than the stall angle perez and goodwin 2008 consequently the effective attack angles in equation system 19 are required to be constrained by 20 α t i α s t a l l where α s t a l l is stall angle in the real time implementation of allocating the fins angles the initial effective attack angles α t i are obtained by solving equation system 19 the calculated attack angles are further constrained by eq 20 to obtain the optimal attack angle α t e i specifically if the instantaneous effective attack angles α t i are larger than stall angle α s t a l l then α s t a l l will be designated the expected attack angle 4 experimental methodology in the current research ship model experiments of pitch roll control in various sea conditions were explored this section provides the details about the ship model and experimental setup 4 1 towing tank the experimental tests were carried out in the towing tank with a length of 110 m and a cross section of 7 m 3 5 m as seen in fig 5 one side of the tank is a wave maker and the other side is the wave absorbed beach the wave maker can produce regular waves with a maximum wave height of 0 4 m and the wave period varies from 0 4 s to 4 s the wave tank also makes irregular waves according to various wave spectrums the maximum significant wave height is 0 32 m the ship model is accurately towed by an electrically driven carriage with a maximum speed of 6 5 m s the force and motion measurement instruments were installed on the carriage to measure the ship model s resistance and motions 4 2 prototype for towing tank tests pitch roll stabilization control on a 50 th scale warship model with dimensions of 3 2 m l pp 0 4 m b 0 14 m d was investigated in our work as seen in fig 6 the prototype for the pitch roll control experiment consists of a ship model and its stabilization system the main features of the ship model are summarized in table 1 the pitch roll stabilization system consists of two pairs of active fins four actuators the ship motion measurement instruments and a microcontroller the naca0015 airfoil is chosen as the section type of the lifting surface the size of the active fins is related to the water plane of a ship kim and kim 2014 the span and chord of each fin model are both 0 067 m the active fins are located in the fore and aft parts of a ship the specific installations of the active fins are shown in fig 7 both an external and internal installation diagram are exhibited locations of the fin were selected in consideration of the interaction of the two pairs of active fins the relative longitude position of each pair of fins affects the pitch reduction rather than the roll reduction the longitude interval of fins should be taken into account for improving the pitch stabilization when the interval to chord ratio is 20 times more than the aspect ratio the influence between the fins was small enough to be neglected zelik and alexander 2012 in addition to take the interaction of stabilizing fins into account mechanical limitations for installation are also considered hence the interval between the fore and aft fins is set as 1 6 m a quasi steady flow approximation was adopted in calculating the lift forces the active fins dynamic model is provided in subsection 2 2 mechanical limitations such as the maximum rotation angle were required in the active fins controller design the effective attack angles for the active fins need to be constrained by the stall angle perez 2005 in the present pitch roll control investigation the stall angle α s t a l l was assumed to be 20 according to the characteristics of the hydrofoils gim and lee 2013 4 3 controller implementation when implementing the prs controller the ship motions are sensed via the angular and acceleration sensors and fed back to the control system next the control system commands the actuators to modify the attack angles of the active fins the heave motion was measured using a heaving acceleration sensor meanwhile the roll and pitch motions were sensed by an integrated pitching and rolling angular sensor the performance parameters of the measurement range resolution and sizes of the sensors are presented in table 2 the control system is the key part of the pitch roll experiment a control program for the active fins control system was developed on the platform of the microcontroller atmega2560 using the c language the principal performance parameters of the actuators and microcontroller are provided in table 3 the control process of the active fins are summarized as follows a transferring the voltage signals output by the angular sensor and acceleration sensor into digital signals using an analog to digital converter ads1115 b receiving the ship motion digital signals from the ads1115 converter c estimating the ship motions using the short term predictor calculating the hydrodynamic force acting on the ship model and allocating the attack angles based on the attack angle allocator d converting the attack angles into the pulse width modulation pwm wave and sending the pwm wave to the actuators e deriving the fins to the expected positions according to the pwm wave 4 4 forced roll system for generating ship motions in oblique waves conventionally pitch heave and roll motions in oblique waves model testing are usually realized by the combination of longitudinal and lateral motions this approach is effective for low speed sea keeping experiments the effective sampling time duration in each test is limited by the lateral dimension of the tank for the ship model experiment with the high forward speed however the effective sampling time length is too short to satisfy the ship motions control system for example as shown in fig 8 the maximum sample time length is only 19 4 s when the forward speed is 1 75 m s and the incident wave angle is 135 in which the width b of the towing tank is 30 m the effective width b e is assumed to be 80 of the width b due to the sidewall reflection effects and mechanical restrictions the time cost for the ship model acceleration and deceleration and sample accumulation for the ar model identification should be eliminated to obtain the effective samples length it takes approximately 5 s to speed up and slow down the ship model when the acceleration is 0 5 m s2 meanwhile 10 20 s are required to collect ship motions for constructing the predictive model in the stabilization controller in this case a total time cost of 15 25 s needs to be excluded in the maximum sample time length of 19 4 s this result indicates the difficulty of obtaining sufficient and effective data for the pitch roll reduction experiment therefore an active forced roll system is designed for the ship motions model testing in oblique wave conditions the restriction of the width on the effective sampling time length is overcome hence the ship pitch roll motions control experiment is able to be conducted in a longer yet narrower towing tank fig 9 presents the design and installation of the active forced roll system the working principles of the active forced roll system is shown in fig 10 its basic idea is to produce the roll motions by moving the designed loads on the apparatus specifically we can get the roll moment time series f 4 t under each testing condition through numerical simulation subsequently the roll moment time series f 4 t is transferred into the displacement time series x t of the designed loads by using eq 21 next the x t is taken as the inputs of the control panel to drive the motor finally the loads move in the expected trajectories to produce the roll motions the pitch and roll motions in oblique waves are then realized by using the active forced roll system in heading waves as follows 21 x t f 4 t g where the f 4 t is the roll moment time series and g and x t represent the gravity and displacement time series of the design loads to validate the feasibility of the proposed active forced roll system the experimental and numerical ship responses were compared figs 11 and 12 provide comparisons of the measured and simulated ship responses where the forward speeds are 24 and 32 knots respectively as suggested in figs 11 and 12 the measured ship responses by using the proposed active forced roll system agrees well with the numerical results however the difference between the measured and simulated results is increased as the wavelength grows this is because the nonlinearity due to the ship motions is positive to the wavelength however the numerical results are obtained by using the weakly nonlinear method consequently the difference between the experimental and numerical results in the long wave e g λ l pp 1 0 is obvious however the generally good agreement demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed apparatus in the oblique wave model testing 5 results and discussion both the numerical simulations and experiments on the pitch roll control using the proposed method were carried out in this study to evaluate the performance of the prs controller the results were analyzed by i a time series comparison of the controlled and uncontrolled roll and pitch motions ii comparing the controlled and uncontrolled ship motions spectrums and iii a statistics analysis of the root mean square rms and reduction efficiency ratio er the rms indicates the ensemble characteristic of a stochastic time series for a given time series x i i 1 n it is defined as 22 r m s 1 n i 1 n x i μ 2 where μ is the mean value of x i and n represents the number of the time series with the definition of rms the reduction efficiency ratio er is formulated into 23 e r r m s 0 r m s r m s 0 100 where rms 0 and rms are the root mean squares of the uncontrolled and controlled ship motion time series respectively 5 1 numerical results to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed prs control approach theoretically the numerical simulations in regular and irregular waves were explored the numerical ship environment was developed based on weakly nonlinear 2 5d method which was described in detail by duan et al 2016 details of the regular and irregular sea conditions are provided in tables 4 and 5 in regular wave conditions the ratios of wave length to ship length are 1 0 1 25 1 5 1 75 and 2 0 the regular wave heights were assumed to be 30 mm for irregular waves condition the range of sea states 4 6 were considered the waves in various sea states were simulated on the basis of the ittc wave spectrum the ittc spectrum is expressed as eq 24 the magnitudes of the significant wave height h 1 3 and peak period t 0 for each sea state are provided in table 5 the wave spectrum was divided into 100 frequency components upon implementation in the numerical simulation ship model forward speed u and the incident wave angle were assumed to be 2 33 m s and 135 for the full scale ship the corresponding forward speed is 32 knots 24 s ζ ω a ω 5 exp b ω 4 where 25 a 173 h 1 3 2 t 1 3 4 b 691 t 1 3 4 in which s ζ ω represents the spectrum density function ω is the circular frequency t0 and h1 3 are peak period and significant wave height respectively 5 1 1 regular waves fig 13 presents the time historical results of numerical simulations in the regular wave where the wavelength is equal to the ship length plots 13 a and 13 b present the comparison between the controlled and uncontrolled roll and pitch time series the attack angles time series for stabilizers are also shown in fig 13 c table 6 summarizes the reduction ratios of pitch and roll motions under various wavelength regular wave conditions the numerical results demonstrate that the proposed control approach performs satisfactorily in the pitch roll stabilization as shown in fig 13 note that the pitch and roll motions were considerably reduced instantaneously both the angular and accelerations amplitudes of the pitch and roll motions decreased obviously by applying the developed prs controller the time series comparison provided a direct demonstration for the feasibility of the prs control method the effectiveness of the proposed method was further confirmed by the summarization of the reduction ratios in table 6 considerable reduction ratios in the pitch and roll motions were obtained under various wave length conditions the amplitudes of the pitch and roll motions as shown in fig 13 were reduced by more than 44 and 48 respectively as shown in table 6 the maximal reduction ratios with respects to pitch and roll angular were approximately 44 and 53 in addition no added vibrations will be induced by using the proposed prs controller to operate the active fins the output attack angles by the prs controller as shown in fig 13 c are relatively smooth the periodical flat tops and bottoms of the attack angles time series suggest that the fins had reached the preset stall angle the reduction ratio comparison between roll and pitch motions suggests that anti rolling performs better than anti pitching as shown in table 6 the reduction ratios of the roll motion are greater than 48 while those of the pitch motion are less than 44 the results show that the pitch moment is much larger than the roll moment therefore the pitch control requires a larger stabilizer or allocation of a larger valid attack angle 5 1 2 irregular waves to evaluate the performance of the proposed prs control approach under irregular waves numerical simulations in sea state 4 6 were carried out the typical results consisting of time series and spectrum power density in sea state 5 are plotted in figs 14 and 15 fig 14 shows the time series comparisons of the controlled and uncontrolled pitch and roll motions the shifts between the controlled and uncontrolled motions resulted from the statistic phases in the numerical simulations the results in fig 14 show that the pitch and roll motion were largely reduced simultaneously by applying the proposed controller the time series comparisons demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed controller in reducing the pitch roll motion under an irregular wave s condition this feasibility is further confirmed by the spectrum power density comparisons shown in fig 15 the performance of the control approach can be directly found through spectrum analysis considerable reductions in the peak values and total areas of the spectrum were obtained and provide obvious evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed controller additionally the corresponding time history of the attack angles for the pitch roll control at sea state 5 is provided in fig 16 the attack angles vary smoothly with time which indicates that no additional vibrations will be produced when operating the fins by using the proposed controller the time series comparison and spectrum provide direct and qualitative methods to evaluate the performance of the proposed predictive control approach in addition table 7 summarizes the statistics of the pitch roll reduction efficiency to offer a further quantitative analysis on the proposed controller as table 7 suggests the active fins controlled by the proposed method show a dramatic reduction efficiency for sea states 4 5 the lowest reduction efficiencies for pitch and roll motions are more than 30 and 65 respectively furthermore as the results in figs 14 and 15 and table 7 suggest the present roll reduction is far more effective than the pitch reduction especially in rough sea conditions taking the results of sea state 6 as an example the efficiency for the roll reduction is more than 65 approximately 35 higher than pitch control this is because the pitch moment is far larger than the roll moment due to the limitation of the control cost the stabilization performance becomes poor as the sea condition turns severe pitch and roll motions become larger under severe conditions hence more control cost is required to stabilize the motions effectively the stabilization performance in rough seas can be improved by increasing the speed or fitting a larger capacity actuator 5 2 experimental results the preliminary analysis on the performance of the proposed prs control approach was conducted based on theoretical results further experimental investigations were also carried out in the towing tank the effectiveness of the proposed pitch roll control method was analyzed by comparing the uncontrolled and controlled ship motions at various experimental testing conditions in the present study both regular and irregular waves conditions are considered the details of the regular waves towing test conditions are provided in tables 8 and 9 in the regular wave conditions the ratios of the wave length to ship length are 1 0 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 and the wave heights are assumed to be 30 mm the range of sea states 4 through 6 is taken into account for the irregular wave condition where the ittc wave spectrums are employed the magnitudes of the significant wave height designated h 1 3 and peak period represented by t 0 for each sea state are provided in table 9 the forward speeds v of the ship model are assumed to be 1 75 m s and 2 33 m s corresponding to 24 and 32 knots respectively for the full scale ship 5 2 1 results in regular waves fig 17 exhibits the controlled and uncontrolled pitch and roll motions in regular waves where the ratio of wave length to ship length equals to 1 0 as the controlled pitch and roll motions are not sinusoidal the root mean square rms values of ship motions are used to evaluate reduction performance quantitatively figs 19 and 20 show the rms of pitch and roll motions under various regular wave conditions magnitudes of the rms and reduction efficiency are summarized in table 8 note that from the experimental results shown in fig 17 that the pitch and roll motions were reduced simultaneously an obvious descending on the crest to trough values of pitch and roll motions were obtained these results show the feasibility of using the proposed controller in pitch roll stabilization figs 18 and 19 confirmed the above observations note that the rms values of the ship motions decrease by applying the present predictive control approach moreover the results shown in table 10 provide evidence for a general demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed pitch roll control approach in regular wave conditions when the experimental forward speed was 32 knots the maximal reduction ratios of roll and pitch motions were 42 94 and 43 90 respectively the relationships between the reduction ratio and the testing conditions can also be found in fig 18 the roll rms and its decrease show a positive relationship to the incident wave length however the rms and reduction of the pitch motion increases when λ l pp is less than 1 1 and decreases when λ l pp exceeds 1 1 such tendencies originate from the ship s dynamic behavior under various incident wave conditions as shown in fig 18 when the incident wave parameter λ l pp is less than 2 1 the roll rms increases as λ l pp become larger nevertheless the roll moment is comparatively small the active fin stabilizers can produce a sufficient stabilizing moment for the roll reduction consequently the reduction ratio of the roll motion is positive to λ l pp as well as plotted in fig 20 a the pitch reduction shows a consistent tendency to the roll reduction when λ l pp is less than the resonant magnitude because the pitch moment is relatively small however the pitch moment becomes far larger than the roll moment when λ l pp is more than the resonant magnitude hence the rms reduction and its ratio are negative to the wave length 5 2 2 results in irregular waves the pitch roll control experimental results are analyzed using the time series comparison spectrum and statistical analysis the testing conditions for the pitch roll stabilization experiment are summarized in table 11 where sea states 4 6 and the forward speeds of both 24 and 32 knots were taken into consideration the model scale is 50 typically the results at sea state 5 and the 24 knots forward speed is exhibited for direct and qualitative analysis in which the time history and spectrum of the controlled and uncontrolled ship motions are compared fig 21 exhibits the measured pitch and roll time history and the corresponding spectrum power density are shown in figure 22 in addition the statistical results of spectrum and time history are summarized in tables 11 and 12 as suggested in fig 21 the pitch and roll motions are effectively controlled by applying the proposed control method a considerable reduction of the peak values and average can be clearly noticed despite the shifts in the time history comparisons these shifts are derived from the stochastic behavior of the experimental tests the controlled and uncontrolled experimental tests are independent stochastic events however the time history comparison can only provide local results as the time window is limited therefore the spectrum results are used for an overall assessment of the proposed method we note the proposed method performs satisfactorily for the spectrum power density in fig 22 where the peaks and the total areas of the spectrum were considerably reduced in addition as plotted in fig 22 the frequencies of the spectrum crests turn smaller by applying the present control method a decrease of the spectrum crest indicates the amplitude reduction of the ship motions meanwhile the reduction on the spectrum crest frequency suggests the period of the ship motion increases in other words the pitch and roll motions are slowed down due to the proposed controller to validate the above observation more generally the magnitudes and frequencies of the spectrum crests under various testing conditions are summarized in table 11 as presented in table 11 the results in various testing conditions keep a high consistency in which the spectrum peak magnitudes and frequencies of the controlled motions are obviously lower essentially the active fins increase the ship s damping force therefore the ship motions were slowed and their periods became longer the effectiveness of the present pitch roll control approach was qualitatively demonstrated through a time series comparison and spectrum analysis to realize a quantitative assessment on the proposed method table 12 summarizes the reduction ratios in various conditions the reduction ratio is formulated in eq 18 table 12 suggests that the pitch and roll motions were apparently controlled a considerable reduction efficiency was obtained for example the reduction ratios with respect to the pitch and roll motions are 45 and 30 at sea state 5 with a 24 knot forward speed the speed of the ship model shows positive effects on the reduction ratios as presented in table 12 the reduction ratios corresponding to 32 knots are comparatively higher taking the results of sea state 6 as an example the control efficiency for the pitch is more than 40 at 32 knots approximately 10 higher than the result at 24 knots table 12 also confirms that the present roll reduction is more effective than the pitch reduction this tendency has been discussed by using the numerical results in table 7 in general the experimental reduction ratios of the roll control are 5 15 higher in the typical testing condition of sea state 5 and 24 knots the pitch control efficiency is 15 lower than the roll control the above tendency originates from the difference between the pitch and roll dynamic behavior where the roll moment is far smaller than the pitch moment compared to the numerical simulation the experimental results show a lower control efficiency as shown in tables 7 and 12 for instance the experimental efficiencies of pitch control are approximately 15 lower than the numerical results at sea state 5 and 24 knots the difference between the numerical and experimental control efficiencies are mainly derived from the following three aspects first system errors are inevitable in physical experiments due to such factors as actuating mechanisms and controller implementation however numerical simulations neglect these system errors second numerical simulations calculate the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces by integrating the pressure on the exact instantaneous wetted hull surface in physical experiments however these forces were approximately estimated by integrating the pressure on the design wetted hull surface because the exact instantaneous wetted surface was unknown and was difficult to be measured in real time finally the coupling effect between the roll and pitch motion also results in discrepancies between the numerical and experimental reduction efficiencies roll and pitch motions were regarded separately in the present study however the coupling effect between roll and pitch do exist during the physical experiment any coupling effect between roll and pitch may play an important role in the magnitude of total motion of the ship this in turn may affect the input to the controller system nevertheless the experimental results strongly demonstrate the feasibility and the capability of the proposed pitch roll control approach the reduction efficiency can be further improved by optimizing the actuator and controller implementation for practical applications 6 conclusions reducing the ship s roll and pitch motions simultaneously is critical for improving the operability of a ship the adaptive pitch roll stabilization control remains difficult to realize there are several works on joint pitch roll control investigations especially for experimental research in the present work a pitch roll stabilization prs control approach was proposed based on the onboard hydrodynamic prediction the real time estimation of the hydrodynamic force based on the ship s motion short term prediction is the essential part of the present approach two pairs of active fins were used as stabilizers a prs controller was developed based upon the proposed control method in which a short term predictor a force estimator and a fin angle allocator were integrated for the prs controller the collected ship motion s time series are the inputs while the attack angles are the outputs during the implementation of the prs controller first the short term predictor forecasts the ship s future motions next the force estimator evaluates the external hydrodynamic forces by applying the dynamic equilibrium between the predicted ship motions and hydrodynamic forces finally the fins actuator calculates the optimal effective attack angles based on the predicted hydrodynamic forces the numerical simulations and experimental tests under various sea states were investigated to evaluate the performance of the proposed prs control approach numerical and experimental results under regular and irregular wave conditions were discussed these results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in pitch roll stabilization for the typical testing conditions of sea state 5 and 32 knots the theoretical results indicate that the pitch and roll motions can be reduced by up to 56 and 75 respectively the experimental results on the other hand suggest that the reduction ratio with respect to the pitch and roll motions are approximately 40 comparatively the experimental reduction efficiency is obviously lower than the numerical results this trend stems from the system error hydrodynamic estimation deficiency and coupling effect between the roll and the pitch the details about the system error and hydrodynamic estimation deficiency are discussed in subsection 5 5 2 however the experiment results provide strong evidence for the effectiveness and the capability of the proposed approach in practical applications pitch roll control efficiency can be further improved through optimizations on the actuator and controller implementation since the total capacity of the actuators is limited the balance between anti rolling and anti pitching need to be regulated appropriately depending on specific practical requirements and speed reduction due to the ocean waves at high sea states needs to be taken into account free run model testing can be further carried out to explored how speed reduction affects the control performance besides the proposed is not suitable for pitch roll reduction at zero speed as no lift will be produced by the active fins at zero speed limited by real time implementation of active pitch roll control the ship hydrodynamics were evaluated by using a linear method in the present work further research is warranted to develop nonlinear methods for

23183,the reduction of roll and pitch motions is important to improve the safety and operability of a ship a pitch roll stabilization prs control approach for a ship with two pairs of active fins is proposed in this approach the key part is the onboard forecasting of the ship s hydrodynamic forces according to the proposed approach a prs controller was developed by integrating a short term predictor a force estimator and a fin angle allocator the prs controller outputs the optimal attack angles for the active fins by inputting the collected ship s motion time series first the short term predictor serves to predict the future motions of the ship second the predicted ship motions are used in the force estimator to estimate the external hydrodynamic forces finally the predicted hydrodynamic forces regarded as the expected stabilizing forces are further employed to evaluate the optimal effective attack angles for the fins actuator the active fins are actuated based on the specified optimal effective attack angles to evaluate the performance of the proposed prs control approach numerical simulations and experimental tests under various sea states were investigated both the numerical and experimental results suggest that the proposed control approach provided a satisfactory reduction of the pitch and roll motions simultaneously keywords pitch roll stabilization control active fins onboard hydrodynamic prediction numerical simulation experimental test 1 introduction ships experience large pitch and roll motions when sailing in severe sea states these motions lead to negative effects for maritime operations or traveling by ships in terms of safety and efficiency the vertical accelerations caused by the pitch and roll motions make a sensory conflict that leads to seasickness the seasickness greatly affects the comfort of the passengers and decreases the crew s ability to work in addition large roll motions may result in cargo damage and even cause the ship to capsize moreover pitch motions resonating with the waves produce a dangerous condition for a parametric roll motion which leads to the ship s loss of stability therefore research on the reduction of the roll and pitch has been extensively conducted over the past several decades anti rolling is the first choice for improving the sea keeping performance of a ship many passive and active controlled devices have been designed to reduce the roll motion the bilge keel was the first effort in anti rolling william froude 1865 later water tanks were studied for the roll control frahm 1911 active methods have been attempted to further improve the roll control efficiency schlick 1904 invented a roll control device using the gyroscopic effects of large rotating wheels the active gyrostabilizer system was also used in the ride control of marine vehicles townsend et al 2007 moving weights provide another feasible anti rolling method treakle et al 2000 in addition active and passive fins have been widely investigated where the active fins have demonstrated satisfactory performance in anti rolling as seen in perez and blanke 2012 in addition to roll control anti pitching is the second choice to improve the safety and operability of a ship comparatively anti pitching is still not as efficient for the practical purposes of anti rolling because the pitch moment is much larger than the roll moment early works on pitch reduction started from passive methods however the latter research studies indicate the superior performance of active methods over passive methods in anti pitching fixed fins stabilizers were the most widely used passive methods to reduce pitch motion and both bow and stern fins have been explored to prevent pitch motion experimental results abkowitz 1959 pournaras 1956 have consistently shown that considerable reductions in pitch and slamming were obtained however bow fixed fins lead to severe vibrations and speed loss the deficiency was confirmed by the sea trials results wallace 1955 ochi 1962 the bow fixed fins induced vibrations that could be alleviated by moving the fin aft of station 3 however the control efficiency would be greatly reduced ochi 1962 stefun 1962 found that tip fences and deep submergence are helpful in reducing vibrations a fixed strut mounted hydrofoil below the bow of a yacht was also investigated avis 1991 where the pitch and added wave resistance were found to be reduced by up to 20 however the total resistance was approximately 25 higher under certain encounter frequencies studies have shown that passive methods were effective in pitch control however they increase the ship s resistance and cause vibrations active methods such as a rudder or active fins have been shown to be another possible solution for pitch control anti pitching using a pi rudder was studied by kaplan 1981 the pitch and bow accelerations were reduced by 30 and 50 respectively however the controller design was more complex as pitch periods have a wider range kaplan and clark 1984 canted rudders produce both horizontal and vertical lift in which the horizontal lift is used to control the steering while the vertical lift controls the pitch kaplan and clark 1984 investigated canted rudders mathematically by using the warfare vessel uss oliver hazard perry ffg 7 the pitch was reduced 30 when the ffg 7 was operating at sea state 6 at 20 knots active fins provide another relatively efficient way for anti pitching pitch reductions through active fins actuated by various controller schemes such as the proportional integral derivative pid wu et al 1999 neural network and fuzzy logic liut 1999 liut et al 2001 were studied for practical purposes the joint pitch roll stabilization is the most expected method for improving the safety comfort and operability of ships however studies on joint pitch roll control have rarely been reported kim and kim 2011 studied ship pitch roll control by using two pairs of stabilizing fins controllers that were designed based on the pid and linear quadratic gaussian lqg algorithms were compared numerical simulations of anti pitching anti rolling and pitch roll control on a cruise ship were carried out considerable reduction of the roll motion was obtained by using the pid or lqg algorithms the roll and pitch motions were stabilized simultaneously by using two pairs of fins actuated by an lqg controller kim and kim 2014 analyzed passenger comfort quantitatively based on the motion sickness dose value msdv index the roll pitch stabilization using two pairs of active fins has been applied to improve passenger comfort among various stabilizers active fins function as the most effective stabilizer when the forward speed is higher than 10 15 knots perez 2005 large parts of modern ships are equipped with active fins for ship motion control the efficiency of a ship s motions controlled by active fins mainly depends on the controller design wu et al 1999 employed a pid controller for pitch reduction and verified the controller by experiments controllers using a variable structure yang and jiang 2004 and a linear quadratic regulator lee et al 2011 have been employed for anti rolling to overcome the nonlinearity in controlling active fins nonlinear approaches were used in designing the controllers liut 1999 liut et al 2001 developed controllers based on neural networks and fuzzy logic methods further a model predictive controller was also applied to prevent the nonlinear effects of fins perez 2005 perez and goodwin 2008 in recent years advanced methods have been proposed for the active fin controller design fang et al 2010 developed a self tuning neural network pid controller for an anti rolling fins stabilizer the simulation results indicate that the proposed controller is suitable for controlling the gains acquisition however the controller can increase the resistance and heading error kaplan and clark 1984 designed a lyapunov s direct method based on a controller for anti rolling and reducing the erosion of safe basins for ships this controller successfully reduced the erosion percentage of safe basins and the roll amplitudes for low ship speeds however the roll amplitudes exceeded a certain value a genetic algorithm based on a pid controller for a fin stabilizer has been studied for roll reduction liut et al 2001 the uncertain fin roll dynamic was stabilized by using a sliding mode controller moradi and malekizade 2013 hinostroza et al 2015 developed a robust fin controller based on an l2 gain design to reduce the roll motion of surface ships liut et al 2001 designed a sliding mode controller for both steering and roll reduction however compared with the research on anti rolling and anti pitching the research on pitch roll control has rarely been reported an adaptive estimation of the hydrodynamic forces for a pitch roll stabilization prs controller design has not been clearly solved in the present research a predictive approach was developed to reduce the pitch roll motions the predictive control approach estimates the hydrodynamic forces online based on the real time predicted ship motions whereas an adaptive ar model autoregressive model is employed to forecast the ship s motions in real time a prs controller is designed to actuate two pairs of active fins numerical and experimental investigations were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and to analyze the control efficiency of the proposed method this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the mathematical model of a ship s dynamics section 3 presents the details of the controller design section 4 provides the experimental methodology section 5 discusses both the numerical and experimental results and section 6 presents the study s conclusions 2 mathematical model of ship dynamics this section describes a mathematical model for ship roll pitch heave dynamics fig 1 illustrates the heave roll pitch motions and coordinate systems for dynamic modeling the ship motions of pitch heave and roll are represented as η 5 η 3 and η 4 respectively the inertial coordinate system o x 0 y 0 z 0 fixed on the calm water surface is used to model the wave ship hydrodynamics are described using the body fixed coordinate system g xyz this system originates at the ship s center of gravity and moves with the ship the horizontal body coordinate system o x 0 y 0 z 0 is employed to describe the hydrodynamic boundary value problem it is fixed on the calm water surface however it translates with the ship along the forward direction 2 1 3 dof ship motions dynamic model this subsection presents the formulations for a three degrees of freedom dof ship dynamic model for practical purpose potential theories are mostly used in ship hydrodynamic modeling in the ship motion control problem eqs 1 3 formulate the roll heave and pitch motions in the time domain by using the impulsive response function

difference operators the indices jk suggest the contribution of an oscillatory motion in the j th mode on the hydrodynamic coefficients in k th direction the 3rd 4th and 5th modes motions represent heave roll and pitch respectively μ jk denotes the infinite frequency added mass coefficients b jk represents the radiated damping coefficients and c jk and k jk t are the restoring hydrodynamic factor and time dependent memory functions respectively hydrodynamic coefficients in the ship dynamic mathematical model can be obtained by solving the boundary value problems for details regarding the hydrodynamic forces calculation and ship motions simulation in the 2d method refer to fonseca and guedes stefun 1962 in our present work the numerical simulations of the ship motions were realized through a 2 5d approach ma et al 2005 for practical purposes the roll heave and pitch equations were solved in the time domain by continuously implementing the 4th order runge kutta schemes 2 2 hydrodynamic modeling for active fins this section describes the dynamic model for the active fin stabilizer the stabilizer consists of two pairs of hydrofoils the hydrofoils were mounted on rotatable stocks at the turn of the bilge the hydrofoils produce hydrodynamic lifts when there is an angle between the flow and the fins the incoming flow results from the advancing speed of the ship the stabilizing moments for pitch and roll motions controls are contributed by the generated lifts assuming that the ship advances in the x axis direction with a forward speed u then the incoming flow speed v and the effective attack angle α t can be formulated as 4 v v x v y u u w t η 3 t y f i η 4 t x f i η 5 t v w t and 5 α t i α f i η 5 δ α i in which the components of the effective attack angle α t are illustrated in fig 2 in equation 5 α f i is the operational angle of the i th active fin the horizontal and vertical components of the fluid particle are represented as u w t and v w t respectively and δ α derives from the ship s velocity and the flow velocity it is expressed as 6 δ α i arctan η 3 t y f i η 4 t x f i η 5 t v w t u u w t where x f i y f i z f i indicate the x y and z components of the i th actuating arm respectively the actuating arm is defined as the distance between the quarter point of the i th fin and the gravity center of the ship the parameters η 3 η 4 η 5 are the induced velocities with respect to the heave roll and pitch motions respectively stabilizer fins usually operate in unsteady conditions for practical purposes however the unsteady effects are neglected altogether in most cases for the control system design steady hydrodynamic characteristics of the fins can be performed in the controller design for ship reduction perez 2005 a quasi steady approach with an input constraint on the attack angle is adopted in the present control method detailed descriptions about the constrained method are provided in subsection 3 3 the lift force l f i and the drag d f i of each active fin are formulated as 7 l f i 1 2 ρ v 2 s c l α t α t i i 1 4 8 d f i 1 2 ρ v 2 s c d α t α t i i 1 4 where ρ represents the water density s denotes the fin s projected area and c l α t and c d α t are derivatives of the lift coefficient c l and the drag coefficient c d to the effective attack angle α t i consequently the induced moments for roll and pitch reduction produced by two pairs of active fins are calculated by 9 f 4 f i 1 4 y f i l f i cos δ α d f i sin δ α 10 f 5 f i 1 4 x f i l f i cos δ α d f i sin δ α where f f 4 and f f 5 are the roll and pitch stabilization moments respectively and x f i and y f i represent the x and y components of the i th actuating arm the actuating arm is defined as the distance between the quarter point of the i th fin and the ship s gravity center 3 pitch roll stabilization controller design in this section a pitch roll stabilization prs controller is designed on the basis of the proposed method the active fins stabilizer produces hydrodynamic lift when there is an attack angle between the incoming flow and the hydrofoil the prs control using two pairs of active fins is illustrated in fig 3 two pairs of stabilizing hydrofoils were installed on both the fore and aft parts of the ship to produce the stabilizing moments for the pitch and roll motion simultaneously the active fins were actuated as follows for both the fore pair or aft pair of fins the attack angles of the port side and the starboard side fins have the same sign but different magnitudes in addition the fore pair of fins and the aft pair of fins were actuated in the opposite directions consequently the pitch stabilizing moment is generated by the fore pair and the aft pair of fins as shown in fig 3 the stabilizing moment for anti rolling is obtained from the resultant of the generated lifts by the port side and the starboard side fins as shown in fig 3 fig 4 illustrates the pitch roll stabilization prs controller design and its implementation procedure the ship motions are the outputs of the ship s dynamic system these motions result from the wave excitation f wave t and stabilizing force f fin stab the ship dynamic system shown in the flow chart can be either a numerical or physical ship environment system in our study both a numerical simulation and experimental testing were investigated for the numerical simulation the ship motions were generated by using a weakly nonlinear 2 5d method duan et al 2016 in the ship model testing the ship motions were obtained via sensors as shown in fig 4 the ship motions η ˆ t combined with their velocities η ˆ t and accelerations η ˆ t are the inputs to the prs controller the output of the prs controller is the attack angle vector α t k when implementing the prs controller first the short term predictors were constructed based on the collected ship motion data the predictors provided the predictions of the heave roll and pitch motions and the k step predicted results were designated η ˆ t k η ˆ t k and η ˆ t k respectively subsequently the incoming heave force f ˆ 3 t k roll moment f ˆ 4 t k and pitch moment f ˆ 5 t k were calculated by the hydrodynamic force estimator finally the attack angle allocator calculated the expected attack angles α t k and commanded the actuators to modify the attack angles of the hydrofoils as suggested above three parts are involved in the controller design the prs controller was developed by integrating a short term predictor a force estimator and a fin angle allocator the essential part of the prs controller is forecasting the roll and pitch moments based on the predicted motions the details regarding the short term predictor force estimator and fin angle allocator are provided in section 3 1 3 1 short term predictor the short term prediction of the ship motions in real time is valuable for compensation control wu et al 1999 the present prs controller design applies a short term predictor for the heave roll and pitch motions the predictor was developed based on the ar model the predictor has been widely used in ship motions predictions for its relatively simple model identification adaptation and convenience in real time implementation in the prs controller the ar model was constructed by using the collected ship motion this model considers that hidden relations exist among the variables of time series the present variable is able to be represented by the previous variable in time for a given ship motion time series η t t 1 n the ar model is expressed as 11 η t φ η t t 1 ε t t p 1 n in which 12 φ φ 1 φ 2 φ p η t 1 t η t 1 η t 2 η t p where p and φ are model order and parameter vector respectively and ε t t p 1 n is a zero mean white noise sequence the identification of the ar model in eq 11 involves the determinations of order p and model parameter vector φ the determination of the model parameters vector φ is called parameter estimation in the present work the levinson durbin l d algorithm was adopted for the parameter s estimation because the l d algorithm shows a comparatively high adaptive nature and high computational efficiency duan et al 2015a first the system when p 1 is solved then it is easy to solve a p 1 coefficients sized problem according to the levinson durbin recursion the p coefficients sized problem for the recursive algorithm has already previously been solved the details of the levinson durbin algorithm were presented by duan et al 2015b similarly the determination of the model order p is called order selection in past decades various criteria have been proposed to determine the order for the ar model among these methods the aikaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic are still the most popular approaches for practical applications however as the model order determined by the aic principle fails to converge to the true order avis 1991 the bic criterion is preferred in the order selection the bic value of the general ar p model is defined as 13 b i c p lg σ ˆ a 2 p 1 lg n n where σ 2 is the covariance the model order that leads to the minimum bic value is chosen as the optimal order when the model order p and parameters vector φ are worked out based on the given ship motions time series η t t 1 n a k step ahead short term predictor based on the ar model in eq 11 can be developed as 14 η ˆ n k φ η t n k 1 and 15 η t n k 1 η n k 1 η n k 2 η n k p k 1 η ˆ n k 1 η ˆ n 1 η n η n p k 1 k p η ˆ n k 1 η ˆ n k 2 η ˆ n k p k p where η ˆ n k is the k step prediction result 3 2 hydrodynamic forces estimator a real time estimation of the ship hydrodynamic forces is the essential part for the prs controller design the heave force roll moment and pitch moment are calculated by the hydrodynamic force estimator which was developed by applying the dynamic equilibrium between the external forces and ship motions the coordinate systems as shown in fig 1 are used to describe the relations between the ship motions and hydrodynamic forces according to eqs 1 3 the hydrodynamic forces estimator is formulated as 16 f ˆ 3 t 1 m μ 33 η ˆ 3 t 1 b 33 η ˆ 3 t 1 c 33 η ˆ 3 t 1 0 t 1 k 33 t τ η ˆ 3 t 1 d τ μ 35 η ˆ 5 t 1 b 35 η ˆ 5 t 1 c 35 η ˆ 5 t 1 0 t 1 k 35 t τ η ˆ 5 t 1 d τ c 33 h η ˆ 3 t 1 c 35 h η ˆ 3 t 1 17 f ˆ 4 t 1 i x x μ 44 η ˆ 4 t 1 b 44 η ˆ 4 t 1 c 44 η ˆ 4 t 1 0 t 1

3 t 1 0 t 1 k 53 t τ η ˆ 3 t 1 d τ c 55 h η ˆ 5 t 1 c 53 h η ˆ 5 t 1 where t indicates the present step while t 1 is the incoming step and f ˆ 3 t 1 f ˆ 4 t 1 and f ˆ 5 t 1 are the predicted heave force roll and pitch moments respectively resulting from the external wave excitations the moments of inertia for the roll and pitch motion are represented by i xx and i yy respectively and c j k h are the statistic restoring coefficients represented as follows c 33 h ρ g a w p c 44 h ρ g z b z g ρ g w p y 2 d x d y c 35 h c 53 h ρ g w p x d x d y c 55 h ρ g z b z g ρ g w p x 2 d x d y in which ρ is the water density and g is the gravity acceleration for a ship the z components of the bouncy center and gravity center are designated z b and z g the ship s displacement and water plan are represented by a wp and x and y are the longitudinal and lateral positions of the discrete units on the integration routine of a ship s water plan with the above relations the external hydrodynamic forces can be evaluated with the measured ship motions in real time 3 3 attack angle allocator the attack angle allocator provides the outputs of the prs controller it decides the optimal attack angles for actuating the active fins the output attack angles are calculated by applying the hydrodynamic forces forecasts to eqs 9 and 10 the predicted wave excited roll moment f ˆ 4 and pitch moment f ˆ 5 are regarded as the required roll and pitch stabilization moments therefore the expected attack angles α t i i 1 4 can be evaluated by solving equation system 19 19 f ˆ 4 f 4 f α t i 0 f ˆ 5 f 5 f α t i 0 to avoid dynamic stall caused by the unsteady effects a constrained condition needs to be satisfied in addition to equation system 19 dynamic stall leads to loss of control action perez and goodwin 2008 when the effective attack angle is less than the steady flow stall angle however experimental results gaillarde 2002 reveal that the dynamic behavior of the foil can be predicted by its static characteristic the steady characteristics describe the behavior of the fin accurately in a quasi steady motion of the fins therefore the fins allocator design can be performed using the steady hydrodynamic characteristic of the fins perez 2005 a constraint on the effective angle of attack could prevent the development of dynamic stalling conditions perez 2005 the effective attack angle should be less than the stall angle perez and goodwin 2008 consequently the effective attack angles in equation system 19 are required to be constrained by 20 α t i α s t a l l where α s t a l l is stall angle in the real time implementation of allocating the fins angles the initial effective attack angles α t i are obtained by solving equation system 19 the calculated attack angles are further constrained by eq 20 to obtain the optimal attack angle α t e i specifically if the instantaneous effective attack angles α t i are larger than stall angle α s t a l l then α s t a l l will be designated the expected attack angle 4 experimental methodology in the current research ship model experiments of pitch roll control in various sea conditions were explored this section provides the details about the ship model and experimental setup 4 1 towing tank the experimental tests were carried out in the towing tank with a length of 110 m and a cross section of 7 m 3 5 m as seen in fig 5 one side of the tank is a wave maker and the other side is the wave absorbed beach the wave maker can produce regular waves with a maximum wave height of 0 4 m and the wave period varies from 0 4 s to 4 s the wave tank also makes irregular waves according to various wave spectrums the maximum significant wave height is 0 32 m the ship model is accurately towed by an electrically driven carriage with a maximum speed of 6 5 m s the force and motion measurement instruments were installed on the carriage to measure the ship model s resistance and motions 4 2 prototype for towing tank tests pitch roll stabilization control on a 50 th scale warship model with dimensions of 3 2 m l pp 0 4 m b 0 14 m d was investigated in our work as seen in fig 6 the prototype for the pitch roll control experiment consists of a ship model and its stabilization system the main features of the ship model are summarized in table 1 the pitch roll stabilization system consists of two pairs of active fins four actuators the ship motion measurement instruments and a microcontroller the naca0015 airfoil is chosen as the section type of the lifting surface the size of the active fins is related to the water plane of a ship kim and kim 2014 the span and chord of each fin model are both 0 067 m the active fins are located in the fore and aft parts of a ship the specific installations of the active fins are shown in fig 7 both an external and internal installation diagram are exhibited locations of the fin were selected in consideration of the interaction of the two pairs of active fins the relative longitude position of each pair of fins affects the pitch reduction rather than the roll reduction the longitude interval of fins should be taken into account for improving the pitch stabilization when the interval to chord ratio is 20 times more than the aspect ratio the influence between the fins was small enough to be neglected zelik and alexander 2012 in addition to take the interaction of stabilizing fins into account mechanical limitations for installation are also considered hence the interval between the fore and aft fins is set as 1 6 m a quasi steady flow approximation was adopted in calculating the lift forces the active fins dynamic model is provided in subsection 2 2 mechanical limitations such as the maximum rotation angle were required in the active fins controller design the effective attack angles for the active fins need to be constrained by the stall angle perez 2005 in the present pitch roll control investigation the stall angle α s t a l l was assumed to be 20 according to the characteristics of the hydrofoils gim and lee 2013 4 3 controller implementation when implementing the prs controller the ship motions are sensed via the angular and acceleration sensors and fed back to the control system next the control system commands the actuators to modify the attack angles of the active fins the heave motion was measured using a heaving acceleration sensor meanwhile the roll and pitch motions were sensed by an integrated pitching and rolling angular sensor the performance parameters of the measurement range resolution and sizes of the sensors are presented in table 2 the control system is the key part of the pitch roll experiment a control program for the active fins control system was developed on the platform of the microcontroller atmega2560 using the c language the principal performance parameters of the actuators and microcontroller are provided in table 3 the control process of the active fins are summarized as follows a transferring the voltage signals output by the angular sensor and acceleration sensor into digital signals using an analog to digital converter ads1115 b receiving the ship motion digital signals from the ads1115 converter c estimating the ship motions using the short term predictor calculating the hydrodynamic force acting on the ship model and allocating the attack angles based on the attack angle allocator d converting the attack angles into the pulse width modulation pwm wave and sending the pwm wave to the actuators e deriving the fins to the expected positions according to the pwm wave 4 4 forced roll system for generating ship motions in oblique waves conventionally pitch heave and roll motions in oblique waves model testing are usually realized by the combination of longitudinal and lateral motions this approach is effective for low speed sea keeping experiments the effective sampling time duration in each test is limited by the lateral dimension of the tank for the ship model experiment with the high forward speed however the effective sampling time length is too short to satisfy the ship motions control system for example as shown in fig 8 the maximum sample time length is only 19 4 s when the forward speed is 1 75 m s and the incident wave angle is 135 in which the width b of the towing tank is 30 m the effective width b e is assumed to be 80 of the width b due to the sidewall reflection effects and mechanical restrictions the time cost for the ship model acceleration and deceleration and sample accumulation for the ar model identification should be eliminated to obtain the effective samples length it takes approximately 5 s to speed up and slow down the ship model when the acceleration is 0 5 m s2 meanwhile 10 20 s are required to collect ship motions for constructing the predictive model in the stabilization controller in this case a total time cost of 15 25 s needs to be excluded in the maximum sample time length of 19 4 s this result indicates the difficulty of obtaining sufficient and effective data for the pitch roll reduction experiment therefore an active forced roll system is designed for the ship motions model testing in oblique wave conditions the restriction of the width on the effective sampling time length is overcome hence the ship pitch roll motions control experiment is able to be conducted in a longer yet narrower towing tank fig 9 presents the design and installation of the active forced roll system the working principles of the active forced roll system is shown in fig 10 its basic idea is to produce the roll motions by moving the designed loads on the apparatus specifically we can get the roll moment time series f 4 t under each testing condition through numerical simulation subsequently the roll moment time series f 4 t is transferred into the displacement time series x t of the designed loads by using eq 21 next the x t is taken as the inputs of the control panel to drive the motor finally the loads move in the expected trajectories to produce the roll motions the pitch and roll motions in oblique waves are then realized by using the active forced roll system in heading waves as follows 21 x t f 4 t g where the f 4 t is the roll moment time series and g and x t represent the gravity and displacement time series of the design loads to validate the feasibility of the proposed active forced roll system the experimental and numerical ship responses were compared figs 11 and 12 provide comparisons of the measured and simulated ship responses where the forward speeds are 24 and 32 knots respectively as suggested in figs 11 and 12 the measured ship responses by using the proposed active forced roll system agrees well with the numerical results however the difference between the measured and simulated results is increased as the wavelength grows this is because the nonlinearity due to the ship motions is positive to the wavelength however the numerical results are obtained by using the weakly nonlinear method consequently the difference between the experimental and numerical results in the long wave e g λ l pp 1 0 is obvious however the generally good agreement demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed apparatus in the oblique wave model testing 5 results and discussion both the numerical simulations and experiments on the pitch roll control using the proposed method were carried out in this study to evaluate the performance of the prs controller the results were analyzed by i a time series comparison of the controlled and uncontrolled roll and pitch motions ii comparing the controlled and uncontrolled ship motions spectrums and iii a statistics analysis of the root mean square rms and reduction efficiency ratio er the rms indicates the ensemble characteristic of a stochastic time series for a given time series x i i 1 n it is defined as 22 r m s 1 n i 1 n x i μ 2 where μ is the mean value of x i and n represents the number of the time series with the definition of rms the reduction efficiency ratio er is formulated into 23 e r r m s 0 r m s r m s 0 100 where rms 0 and rms are the root mean squares of the uncontrolled and controlled ship motion time series respectively 5 1 numerical results to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed prs control approach theoretically the numerical simulations in regular and irregular waves were explored the numerical ship environment was developed based on weakly nonlinear 2 5d method which was described in detail by duan et al 2016 details of the regular and irregular sea conditions are provided in tables 4 and 5 in regular wave conditions the ratios of wave length to ship length are 1 0 1 25 1 5 1 75 and 2 0 the regular wave heights were assumed to be 30 mm for irregular waves condition the range of sea states 4 6 were considered the waves in various sea states were simulated on the basis of the ittc wave spectrum the ittc spectrum is expressed as eq 24 the magnitudes of the significant wave height h 1 3 and peak period t 0 for each sea state are provided in table 5 the wave spectrum was divided into 100 frequency components upon implementation in the numerical simulation ship model forward speed u and the incident wave angle were assumed to be 2 33 m s and 135 for the full scale ship the corresponding forward speed is 32 knots 24 s ζ ω a ω 5 exp b ω 4 where 25 a 173 h 1 3 2 t 1 3 4 b 691 t 1 3 4 in which s ζ ω represents the spectrum density function ω is the circular frequency t0 and h1 3 are peak period and significant wave height respectively 5 1 1 regular waves fig 13 presents the time historical results of numerical simulations in the regular wave where the wavelength is equal to the ship length plots 13 a and 13 b present the comparison between the controlled and uncontrolled roll and pitch time series the attack angles time series for stabilizers are also shown in fig 13 c table 6 summarizes the reduction ratios of pitch and roll motions under various wavelength regular wave conditions the numerical results demonstrate that the proposed control approach performs satisfactorily in the pitch roll stabilization as shown in fig 13 note that the pitch and roll motions were considerably reduced instantaneously both the angular and accelerations amplitudes of the pitch and roll motions decreased obviously by applying the developed prs controller the time series comparison provided a direct demonstration for the feasibility of the prs control method the effectiveness of the proposed method was further confirmed by the summarization of the reduction ratios in table 6 considerable reduction ratios in the pitch and roll motions were obtained under various wave length conditions the amplitudes of the pitch and roll motions as shown in fig 13 were reduced by more than 44 and 48 respectively as shown in table 6 the maximal reduction ratios with respects to pitch and roll angular were approximately 44 and 53 in addition no added vibrations will be induced by using the proposed prs controller to operate the active fins the output attack angles by the prs controller as shown in fig 13 c are relatively smooth the periodical flat tops and bottoms of the attack angles time series suggest that the fins had reached the preset stall angle the reduction ratio comparison between roll and pitch motions suggests that anti rolling performs better than anti pitching as shown in table 6 the reduction ratios of the roll motion are greater than 48 while those of the pitch motion are less than 44 the results show that the pitch moment is much larger than the roll moment therefore the pitch control requires a larger stabilizer or allocation of a larger valid attack angle 5 1 2 irregular waves to evaluate the performance of the proposed prs control approach under irregular waves numerical simulations in sea state 4 6 were carried out the typical results consisting of time series and spectrum power density in sea state 5 are plotted in figs 14 and 15 fig 14 shows the time series comparisons of the controlled and uncontrolled pitch and roll motions the shifts between the controlled and uncontrolled motions resulted from the statistic phases in the numerical simulations the results in fig 14 show that the pitch and roll motion were largely reduced simultaneously by applying the proposed controller the time series comparisons demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed controller in reducing the pitch roll motion under an irregular wave s condition this feasibility is further confirmed by the spectrum power density comparisons shown in fig 15 the performance of the control approach can be directly found through spectrum analysis considerable reductions in the peak values and total areas of the spectrum were obtained and provide obvious evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed controller additionally the corresponding time history of the attack angles for the pitch roll control at sea state 5 is provided in fig 16 the attack angles vary smoothly with time which indicates that no additional vibrations will be produced when operating the fins by using the proposed controller the time series comparison and spectrum provide direct and qualitative methods to evaluate the performance of the proposed predictive control approach in addition table 7 summarizes the statistics of the pitch roll reduction efficiency to offer a further quantitative analysis on the proposed controller as table 7 suggests the active fins controlled by the proposed method show a dramatic reduction efficiency for sea states 4 5 the lowest reduction efficiencies for pitch and roll motions are more than 30 and 65 respectively furthermore as the results in figs 14 and 15 and table 7 suggest the present roll reduction is far more effective than the pitch reduction especially in rough sea conditions taking the results of sea state 6 as an example the efficiency for the roll reduction is more than 65 approximately 35 higher than pitch control this is because the pitch moment is far larger than the roll moment due to the limitation of the control cost the stabilization performance becomes poor as the sea condition turns severe pitch and roll motions become larger under severe conditions hence more control cost is required to stabilize the motions effectively the stabilization performance in rough seas can be improved by increasing the speed or fitting a larger capacity actuator 5 2 experimental results the preliminary analysis on the performance of the proposed prs control approach was conducted based on theoretical results further experimental investigations were also carried out in the towing tank the effectiveness of the proposed pitch roll control method was analyzed by comparing the uncontrolled and controlled ship motions at various experimental testing conditions in the present study both regular and irregular waves conditions are considered the details of the regular waves towing test conditions are provided in tables 8 and 9 in the regular wave conditions the ratios of the wave length to ship length are 1 0 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 and the wave heights are assumed to be 30 mm the range of sea states 4 through 6 is taken into account for the irregular wave condition where the ittc wave spectrums are employed the magnitudes of the significant wave height designated h 1 3 and peak period represented by t 0 for each sea state are provided in table 9 the forward speeds v of the ship model are assumed to be 1 75 m s and 2 33 m s corresponding to 24 and 32 knots respectively for the full scale ship 5 2 1 results in regular waves fig 17 exhibits the controlled and uncontrolled pitch and roll motions in regular waves where the ratio of wave length to ship length equals to 1 0 as the controlled pitch and roll motions are not sinusoidal the root mean square rms values of ship motions are used to evaluate reduction performance quantitatively figs 19 and 20 show the rms of pitch and roll motions under various regular wave conditions magnitudes of the rms and reduction efficiency are summarized in table 8 note that from the experimental results shown in fig 17 that the pitch and roll motions were reduced simultaneously an obvious descending on the crest to trough values of pitch and roll motions were obtained these results show the feasibility of using the proposed controller in pitch roll stabilization figs 18 and 19 confirmed the above observations note that the rms values of the ship motions decrease by applying the present predictive control approach moreover the results shown in table 10 provide evidence for a general demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed pitch roll control approach in regular wave conditions when the experimental forward speed was 32 knots the maximal reduction ratios of roll and pitch motions were 42 94 and 43 90 respectively the relationships between the reduction ratio and the testing conditions can also be found in fig 18 the roll rms and its decrease show a positive relationship to the incident wave length however the rms and reduction of the pitch motion increases when λ l pp is less than 1 1 and decreases when λ l pp exceeds 1 1 such tendencies originate from the ship s dynamic behavior under various incident wave conditions as shown in fig 18 when the incident wave parameter λ l pp is less than 2 1 the roll rms increases as λ l pp become larger nevertheless the roll moment is comparatively small the active fin stabilizers can produce a sufficient stabilizing moment for the roll reduction consequently the reduction ratio of the roll motion is positive to λ l pp as well as plotted in fig 20 a the pitch reduction shows a consistent tendency to the roll reduction when λ l pp is less than the resonant magnitude because the pitch moment is relatively small however the pitch moment becomes far larger than the roll moment when λ l pp is more than the resonant magnitude hence the rms reduction and its ratio are negative to the wave length 5 2 2 results in irregular waves the pitch roll control experimental results are analyzed using the time series comparison spectrum and statistical analysis the testing conditions for the pitch roll stabilization experiment are summarized in table 11 where sea states 4 6 and the forward speeds of both 24 and 32 knots were taken into consideration the model scale is 50 typically the results at sea state 5 and the 24 knots forward speed is exhibited for direct and qualitative analysis in which the time history and spectrum of the controlled and uncontrolled ship motions are compared fig 21 exhibits the measured pitch and roll time history and the corresponding spectrum power density are shown in figure 22 in addition the statistical results of spectrum and time history are summarized in tables 11 and 12 as suggested in fig 21 the pitch and roll motions are effectively controlled by applying the proposed control method a considerable reduction of the peak values and average can be clearly noticed despite the shifts in the time history comparisons these shifts are derived from the stochastic behavior of the experimental tests the controlled and uncontrolled experimental tests are independent stochastic events however the time history comparison can only provide local results as the time window is limited therefore the spectrum results are used for an overall assessment of the proposed method we note the proposed method performs satisfactorily for the spectrum power density in fig 22 where the peaks and the total areas of the spectrum were considerably reduced in addition as plotted in fig 22 the frequencies of the spectrum crests turn smaller by applying the present control method a decrease of the spectrum crest indicates the amplitude reduction of the ship motions meanwhile the reduction on the spectrum crest frequency suggests the period of the ship motion increases in other words the pitch and roll motions are slowed down due to the proposed controller to validate the above observation more generally the magnitudes and frequencies of the spectrum crests under various testing conditions are summarized in table 11 as presented in table 11 the results in various testing conditions keep a high consistency in which the spectrum peak magnitudes and frequencies of the controlled motions are obviously lower essentially the active fins increase the ship s damping force therefore the ship motions were slowed and their periods became longer the effectiveness of the present pitch roll control approach was qualitatively demonstrated through a time series comparison and spectrum analysis to realize a quantitative assessment on the proposed method table 12 summarizes the reduction ratios in various conditions the reduction ratio is formulated in eq 18 table 12 suggests that the pitch and roll motions were apparently controlled a considerable reduction efficiency was obtained for example the reduction ratios with respect to the pitch and roll motions are 45 and 30 at sea state 5 with a 24 knot forward speed the speed of the ship model shows positive effects on the reduction ratios as presented in table 12 the reduction ratios corresponding to 32 knots are comparatively higher taking the results of sea state 6 as an example the control efficiency for the pitch is more than 40 at 32 knots approximately 10 higher than the result at 24 knots table 12 also confirms that the present roll reduction is more effective than the pitch reduction this tendency has been discussed by using the numerical results in table 7 in general the experimental reduction ratios of the roll control are 5 15 higher in the typical testing condition of sea state 5 and 24 knots the pitch control efficiency is 15 lower than the roll control the above tendency originates from the difference between the pitch and roll dynamic behavior where the roll moment is far smaller than the pitch moment compared to the numerical simulation the experimental results show a lower control efficiency as shown in tables 7 and 12 for instance the experimental efficiencies of pitch control are approximately 15 lower than the numerical results at sea state 5 and 24 knots the difference between the numerical and experimental control efficiencies are mainly derived from the following three aspects first system errors are inevitable in physical experiments due to such factors as actuating mechanisms and controller implementation however numerical simulations neglect these system errors second numerical simulations calculate the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces by integrating the pressure on the exact instantaneous wetted hull surface in physical experiments however these forces were approximately estimated by integrating the pressure on the design wetted hull surface because the exact instantaneous wetted surface was unknown and was difficult to be measured in real time finally the coupling effect between the roll and pitch motion also results in discrepancies between the numerical and experimental reduction efficiencies roll and pitch motions were regarded separately in the present study however the coupling effect between roll and pitch do exist during the physical experiment any coupling effect between roll and pitch may play an important role in the magnitude of total motion of the ship this in turn may affect the input to the controller system nevertheless the experimental results strongly demonstrate the feasibility and the capability of the proposed pitch roll control approach the reduction efficiency can be further improved by optimizing the actuator and controller implementation for practical applications 6 conclusions reducing the ship s roll and pitch motions simultaneously is critical for improving the operability of a ship the adaptive pitch roll stabilization control remains difficult to realize there are several works on joint pitch roll control investigations especially for experimental research in the present work a pitch roll stabilization prs control approach was proposed based on the onboard hydrodynamic prediction the real time estimation of the hydrodynamic force based on the ship s motion short term prediction is the essential part of the present approach two pairs of active fins were used as stabilizers a prs controller was developed based upon the proposed control method in which a short term predictor a force estimator and a fin angle allocator were integrated for the prs controller the collected ship motion s time series are the inputs while the attack angles are the outputs during the implementation of the prs controller first the short term predictor forecasts the ship s future motions next the force estimator evaluates the external hydrodynamic forces by applying the dynamic equilibrium between the predicted ship motions and hydrodynamic forces finally the fins actuator calculates the optimal effective attack angles based on the predicted hydrodynamic forces the numerical simulations and experimental tests under various sea states were investigated to evaluate the performance of the proposed prs control approach numerical and experimental results under regular and irregular wave conditions were discussed these results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in pitch roll stabilization for the typical testing conditions of sea state 5 and 32 knots the theoretical results indicate that the pitch and roll motions can be reduced by up to 56 and 75 respectively the experimental results on the other hand suggest that the reduction ratio with respect to the pitch and roll motions are approximately 40 comparatively the experimental reduction efficiency is obviously lower than the numerical results this trend stems from the system error hydrodynamic estimation deficiency and coupling effect between the roll and the pitch the details about the system error and hydrodynamic estimation deficiency are discussed in subsection 5 5 2 however the experiment results provide strong evidence for the effectiveness and the capability of the proposed approach in practical applications pitch roll control efficiency can be further improved through optimizations on the actuator and controller implementation since the total capacity of the actuators is limited the balance between anti rolling and anti pitching need to be regulated appropriately depending on specific practical requirements and speed reduction due to the ocean waves at high sea states needs to be taken into account free run model testing can be further carried out to explored how speed reduction affects the control performance besides the proposed is not suitable for pitch roll reduction at zero speed as no lift will be produced by the active fins at zero speed limited by real time implementation of active pitch roll control the ship hydrodynamics were evaluated by using a linear method in the present work further research is warranted to develop nonlinear methods for

ground boundary layers on the aerodynamics of a compound wing of a wig craft computational simulations were conducted to evaluate various design parameters such as middle span size anhedral angle and

but suffered from some operational issues such as power requirements and longitudinal stability during take off the ability to improve its efficiency compared to other types of craft and having a higher speed than other vessels are some reasons to consider wig craft for marine transportation halloran and o meara 1999 besides it comes with a low cost does not require airports or runways and is operational over any surface such as water or land rozhdestvensky 2006 increasing the ram pressure under the wing and decreasing the wing tip vortex are two techniques to improve wig craft during service yun et al 2010 the pressure distribution around the wing is widely developed by the ground effect the stagnation point moves to the lower surface of the wing which leads to a larger amount of air diverting over the wing consequently the speed of air flow on the lower surface decreases and pressure increases creating a dynamic air cushion at very low ground clearance high pressure is created on the pressure side of the wing referred to as ram pressure and the lift achieves a noticeable improvement simultaneously the downwash velocity reduces and causes a fall in the induced drag ahmed 2004 the effective aspect ratio ar of the wing near the ground is greater than a geometric one yun et al 2010 ahmed and sharma 2004 demonstrated that the convergent divergent passage shape between the wing and the ground at certain angles of attack presented a suction effect that caused a reduction in lift one particular method to decrease this phenomenon is via a flat surface on the lower side of the wing luo and chen luo and chen 2012 empirically investigated the pressure distributions cross section of a naca0015 wing and found that the pressure depended on angles of attack and ground clearance however at a negative angle of attack the pressure had no ground clearance dependence jamei et al 2012 2013a numerically investigated the aerodynamic characteristics of a compound wig effect the compound wing was divided into two parts the middle part as the rectangular wing and the side parts were reverse taper wings with an anhedral angle they found that the compound wings significantly reduced the downwash velocity and modified the pressure distribution on the lower side which led to augmentation in lift force moreover the smaller distance between the wingtip of compound wings and the ground reduced the drag because of the weaker tip vortex jamei et al 2011 investigated the performance fuel consumption and environmental impact of the compound wing the lower drag of compound wings reduced the fuel consumption considerably relative to the rectangular wing the compound wing exhibited lesser co2 emissions some researchers numerically investigated different arrangements of the par system on wig craft yang and yang 2010 2011 the aerodynamics of flow around the wings with respect to the nozzle angle par engine in front of the wing was analyzed by yang and yang 2011 they found that at a certain nozzle angle the high speed jet flow from the par system on the upper surface of the wing caused an increment in the suction and the separation moved toward the trailing edge this is referred as to the coanda effect yang and yang 2012 also numerically investigated the aerodynamics of a wig effect with a tiltable endplate they found that a tiltable endplate could potentially increase the performance of wings in and out of ground effect researchers acknowledge that ground boundary layers have some effects on the aerodynamics of the wig effect yang yang and jia yang et al 2010a found a reduction of the effective height due to the rise of ground by using displacement thickness which caused an over estimation of ground effect a separation bubble was created on the ground when the ground was considered a fixed boundary this separation bubble rose with lower ground clearance and a higher angle of attack consequently the passageway of air flow was reduced which then reduced the ram effect leading to underestimation of the lift in addition the separation bubble caused the stagnation point to move towards the leading edge and then air flow on the upper surface of the wing gained higher energy with lower adverse pressure gradients as there was a delay in the separation at the trailing edge and stall angle yang et al 2010a in contrast yang lin and yang yang et al 2010b found that a separation bubble would be developed more by the ground level than by the angle of attack ying yang and yang ying et al 2010 demonstrated that the separation bubble disappears at a ground clearance value over 0 2 and the aerodynamic behaviour of the air flow on fixed ground was similar to moving ground yang and yang 2009 numerically investigated the effect of ground viscous effect in wig effect they found a negative lift coefficient and a rapid increase of drag coefficient with a small angle of attack aoa 4 at low ground clearance h c 0 1 at an angle of attack of 4 and different ground clearance values they reported a higher lift and lower drag for fixed ground compared to moving ground however this difference was reduced at higher ground clearance an experimental study was carried out on an airfoil section in a low turbulence wind tunnel with a moving ground model by ahmed takasaki and kohama ahmed et al 2007 they recorded the pressure distribution velocity and wake region of flow field over the airfoil surface lift and drag forces a fall of suction on the upper surface was shown when the airfoil moved towards the ground for all angles of attack the lift force dropped as the ground clearance decreased for a small angle of attack but improved for greater angles of attack by enhancing the pressure distribution on the pressure surface jamei et al 2014a 2014b numerically investigated the flow structure and aerodynamic coefficients of the compound wig effect for fixed and moving ground with respect to various ground clearances and reynolds numbers the lift and drag coefficients of the compound wing had some differences because the ground boundary layer was related to fixed ground as compared with moving ground at a small ground clearance consequently a lift to drag ratio of the compound wing varied considerably however there was a relatively small difference between the values of moving and fixed ground with the reynolds number the ground viscous effect remains to be a primary objective that researchers investigate for wig effect according to the related body of literature there is a lack of research on the effect of ground viscous on aerodynamic coefficients of compound wings for various design parameters in this study the ground boundary layers effect on aerodynamics of the compound wing jamei et al 2012 was numerically investigated with respect to design parameters including middle span size anhedral angle and taper ratio in the computational simulations two ground boundary conditions were employed namely fixed ground and moving ground the current results covered lift and drag coefficients lift to drag ratio moment coefficient and centre of pressure in different configurations which were found to be affected by the ground boundary layer 2 cfd numerical study in this study a compound wing with an naca6409 airfoil section was employed for computational simulations the compound wing was divided into three main parts namely one rectangular wing in the middle and two reverse taper wings with an anhedral angle on the sides jamei et al 2012 the principal dimensions of the compound wings fig 1 are shown in tables 1 3 these numerical simulations catered for different design parameters including middle span size anhedral angle and taper ratio at ground clearance of 0 15 angle of attack of 4 and aspect ratio of 1 25 fixed and moving grounds were defined as two different ground boundary conditions ground level h was defined by the distance between the trailing edge of wings centre and ground surface the flow structure in the physical domain around the compound wings was assumed in a steady state and incompressible flow using a realizable k ε turbulent model the ansys fluent software was used for cfd simulations the transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy k and turbulent dissipation energy ε are as follows 1 t ρ k x j ρ k u j x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k g b ρ ε y m s k 2 t ρ ε x j ρ ε u j x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j ρ c 1 s ε ρ c 2 ε 2 k ν ε c 1 ε ε k c 3 ε g b s ε 3 c 1 max 0 43 η η 5 η k ε s 2 s i j s i j where s k and s ε are user defined source terms while c1ε c2 c3ε σ k and σε are adaptable constants the aerodynamic coefficients and the centre of pressure in this numerical study were derived in the following way c l l 0 5 ρ u 2 a c d d 0 5 ρ u 2 a c m m 0 5 ρ u 2 a c and x c p 0 25 c m c l cos α c d sin α fig 2 shows the grid independency of the numerical simulation jamei et al 2014b a y value of less than 120 for the turbulent flow was applied around the wing surface which is a suitable value for the current simulation when standard wall functions are employed a symmetry plane was applied to reduce the time consumption and memory usage as shown in fig 3 the computational domain was far from the compound wing to prevent blockage effects a no slip solid wall without roughness was defined for the compound wing ground surface and side walls of the physical domain a velocity inlet and a pressure outlet were utilized at the upstream and downstream of the domain respectively a second order upwind method was used for discretization of all equations such as the momentum equations turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation energy a simple method was selected as a proper method for pressure velocity coupling 2 1 validation of cfd simulation the computational simulations were validated with experimental data gathered in a low speed wind tunnel at universiti teknologi malaysia the thickness of the boundary layer is around 4 cm in the test section of the wind tunnel furthermore the wind tunnel provides a maximum air speed of 80 m s within the test section the test section has a width of 2 0 m a height of 1 5 m and a length of 5 5 m the flow inside the wind tunnel is of good quality with a flow uniformity 0 15 temperature uniformity 0 2 flow angularity uniformity 0 15 and turbulence 0 06 moreover the wind tunnel has high quality facilities that allow for accuracy and repeatability of the experimental results alutm 2013 the drag coefficient and lift to drag ratio versus angle of attack of the compound wing are shown in fig 4 for fixed ground conditions at a ground clearance of 0 15 these figures depict computational and experimental simulations with a similar tendency the averages of errors for the drag coefficient and lift to drag ratio are 20 and 12 6 respectively nevertheless due to several uncertainties the numerical results reported minor alterations as compared to the experimental data jamei et al 2013b 2014c 2 2 boundary layers effects on pressure and velocity contours figs 5 8 illustrate the pressure and velocity distribution of the compound wing 8 for fixed and moving grounds at a ground clearance of 0 15 and an angle of attack of 4 fig 5 shows that the suction on the upper surface near the leading edge of compound wing 8 was higher for the moving ground as compared to the fixed ground the stagnation point shifted slightly to the lower surface of the compound wing for moving ground which caused a slightly higher pressure on the lower surface and higher suction on upper surface at the leading edge fig 6 there was high pressure in the flow passage between the lower side of the compound wing and the ground at the middle span for moving ground compared to fixed ground as shown in fig 6 due to the displacement thickness of the boundary layer which caused a vent effect the lower pressure area was progressively wider in the flow passage between the lower surface of the compound wing and fixed ground fig 7 shows a higher velocity in the flow passage under the compound wing for fixed ground which verifies that the ground viscous boundary layer increased the vent effect generally pressure leakage from the lower side to the upper side of the wingtip generates a tip vortex and spreads to the downstream flow field based on this tip vortex induced drag is produced the pressure distribution at the wingtip of compound wing 8 demonstrates that tip vortex is slightly stronger for moving ground condition compared to its fixed counterpart fig 8 as a consequence the induced drag was greater 2 3 parametric study on viscous ground effect the principal aerodynamic coefficients were determined with respect to different design parameters namely middle span size anhedral angle and taper ratio via fixed and moving ground as shown in figs 9 23 2 4 lift coefficient fig 9 illustrates the lift coefficient versus the middle span size bm of the compound wings table 1 at a ground clearance of 0 15 and an angle of attack of 4 for both fixed and moving ground for both ground conditions when the middle span size was increased the lift coefficient decreased accordingly the plot of the moving ground was higher compared to fixed ground but the difference between moving and fixed ground decreased by augmentation of the middle span size because at a smaller bm the side wing was greater and the wing tip was closer to the ground and thus faced a higher boundary layers effect for example for a bm of 75 mm and 125 mm the increments of the lift coefficient for moving ground related to fixed ground were 1 7 and 0 5 respectively the correlations of the anhedral angle a of the compound wings 4 8 tables 1and 2 and ground viscous effects are shown in fig 10 the lift coefficient plot for moving ground was lower than fixed ground at a smaller anhedral angle but it was greater for a higher anhedral angle the main reason is likely attributable to the venture effect between the compound wings and ground at different anheral angles the increments of the lift coefficient for moving ground related to fixed ground were 1 4 and 2 5 at anhedral angles of 0 and 15 respectively fig 11 illustrates that the ground viscous effect witnessed no change with respect to taper ratio λ of the compound wings 7 and 9 to 11 tables 2and3 the lift coefficient plot of moving ground was higher than that of fixed ground with a negligible variation in the gap between them 2 5 drag coefficient fig 12 shows a plot of drag coefficient versus the middle span size bm of the compound wings table 1 at a ground clearance of 0 15 and an angle of attack of 4 for fixed and moving ground for both ground conditions when the middle span size increased the drag coefficient slightly decreased the plot of moving ground was lower than that of fixed ground but the difference between moving and fixed ground gradually increased with the decrease of the middle span size this is because at a smaller bm the side wing is greater and the wing tip is closer to the ground thus the boundary layers affected the friction drag and induced drag for example for a bm of 75 mm and 125 mm the reductions of the drag coefficient for moving ground related to fixed ground were 4 9 and 3 5 respectively the relationships of the anhedral angle a of the compound wings 4 to 8 tables 1and2 and ground boundary layers are shown in fig 13 for both ground conditions the drag coefficient decreased when the anhedral angle increased moreover the drag coefficient plot for moving ground was lower than that of fixed ground for all anhedral angles but the gap increased when the anhedral angle increased according to pressure and velocity contours figs 6 and 7 these differences could be related to the enhancement of the pressure and viscous drag of the compound wing for the fixed ground condition as compared to its moving counterpart the reductions of the drag coefficient for moving ground related to fixed ground were 4 3 and 5 2 at anhedral angles of 0 and 15 respectively fig 14 clarifies that the effect of ground boundary layers reported a slight fluctuation with respect to taper ratio λ of the compound wings 7 and 9 to 11 tables 2and3 the drag coefficient plot of moving ground was lower than that of fixed ground but there was a small variation in the gap between them 2 6 lift to drag ratio fig 15 shows the plot of lift to drag ratio versus middle span size bm of the compound wings table 1 at a ground clearance of 0 15 and an angle of attack of 4 for both fixed and moving ground for both ground conditions when the middle span size is augmented the lift to drag ratio decreased the plot of fixed ground was lower than that of moving ground but the gap between moving and fixed ground diminished with an increase in the middle span size for example for a bm of 75 mm and 125 mm the increments of lift to drag ratio for moving ground related to fixed ground were 7 and 4 2 respectively fig 16 shows the plot of the influence of anhedral angle a of the compound wings 4 to 8 tables 1and2 on the ground viscous effect according to the figure the lift to drag ratio plot of moving ground was higher than that of fixed ground and the differences between them increased steadily when the anhedral angle increased the increments of lift to drag ratio for moving ground related to fixed ground were 3 and 8 1 at anhedral angles of 0 and 15 respectively fig 17 shows that the ground viscous effect had a slight variation with respect to taper ratio λ of the compound wings 7 and 9 to 11 tables 2and3 the lift to drag ratio plot of moving ground was higher than that of fixed ground with a small variation in the gap between them 2 7 moment coefficient fig 18 shows the plot of moment coefficient versus the middle span size bm of the compound wings table 1 at a ground clearance of 0 15 and an angle of attack of 4 for both fixed and moving ground here the nose down moment was defined as a positive moment for both ground conditions there was a fluctuation in the moment coefficient when the middle span size increased the plot of moving ground was higher than that of fixed ground but the differences between moving and fixed ground plots had a small variation with the enhancement of the middle span size for example for a bm of 75 mm and 112 5 mm the increments of moment coefficient for moving ground related to fixed ground were 1 6 and 1 4 respectively fig 19 shows the influence of the ground viscous effects on the moment coefficient of compound wings 4 to 8 tables 1and2 with respect to anhedral angle a according to the figure the moment coefficient of moving ground was almost similar to that of fixed ground at a small anhedral angle but greater for a higher anhedral angle in other words the nose down pitching moment was higher for moving ground the increments of the moment coefficient for moving ground related to fixed ground were 0 9 and 1 6 at anhedral angles of 9 5 and 15 respectively fig 20 shows that the moment coefficient of compound wings 7 and 9 to 11 tables 2and3 decreased when taper ratio λ increased for both ground conditions and the gap was nearly constant between the plots with respect to the taper ratio the lift coefficient plot of moving ground was higher than that of fixed ground in comparison with fixed ground the moment coefficient of moving ground increased by 1 2 8 centre of pressure figs 21 23 illustrate that there was a small difference in the position of the centre of pressure for fixed and moving ground though with similar design parameters the position of the centre of pressure was measured from the edge of the compound wings the highest gap existed between the plots of fixed and moving ground at a low anhedral angle fig 22 at an anhedral angle of 0 the increment of position of the centre of pressure with respect to moving ground was around 0 5 as compared to fixed ground the position of the centre of pressure was generally further from the edge of the compound wing for moving ground compared to all other design parameters 3 conclusion this study numerically investigated the principal aerodynamic coefficients of compound wings in ground effect for fixed and moving ground with respect to various design parameters including middle span size anhedral angle and taper ratio overall for moving ground the lift coefficient was greater while the drag coefficient was smaller as compared to fixed ground condition according to the results for both fixed and moving ground the middle span size and anhedral angle affect the ground boundary layers more than the taper ratio consequently the differences of lift and drag coefficients with and without ground boundary layers of the compound wings versus middle span size and anhedral angle are considerable additionally the corresponding variation in the lift to drag ratio of the compound wings is noticeable it was also found that the ground boundary layers have a slight effect on the moment coefficient and the centre of pressure with respect to all design parameters to conclude a correction factor is necessary to modify the experimental results for wind tunnels that have a fixed ground 
23184,the ground viscous effect is an objective that could be an essential parameter for the conceptual design of wing in ground effect wig crafts this study numerically investigates the effect of ground boundary layers on the aerodynamics of a compound wing of a wig craft computational simulations were conducted to evaluate various design parameters such as middle span size anhedral angle and taper ratio the flow structure in the physical domain around the wing surface was demonstrated with a realizable k ε turbulent model the numerical results of the compound wing for a fixed ground boundary condition were then further validated using experimental data from the wind tunnel the principal aerodynamic coefficients of compound wings were achieved for both fixed and moving ground conditions the numerical simulations demonstrated that the ground viscous effect of fixed ground has some effects on lift and drag coefficients and lift to drag ratio including a reduction in the lift coefficient and an increase in the drag coefficient compared with the moving ground however the design parameters had a different impact on the ground viscous effect nevertheless the results are

service yun et al 2010 the pressure distribution around the wing is widely developed by the ground effect the stagnation point moves to the lower surface of the wing which leads to a larger amount of air diverting over the wing consequently the speed of air flow on the lower surface decreases and pressure increases creating a dynamic air cushion at very low ground clearance high pressure is created on the pressure side of the wing referred to as ram pressure and the lift achieves a noticeable improvement simultaneously the downwash velocity reduces and causes a fall in the induced drag ahmed 2004 the effective aspect ratio ar of the wing near the ground is greater than a geometric one yun et al 2010 ahmed and sharma 2004 demonstrated that the convergent divergent passage shape between the wing and the ground at certain angles of attack presented a suction effect that caused a reduction in lift one particular method to decrease this phenomenon is via a flat surface on the lower side of the wing luo and chen luo and chen 2012 empirically investigated the pressure distributions cross section of a naca0015 wing and found that the pressure depended on angles of attack and ground clearance however at a negative angle of attack the pressure had no ground clearance dependence jamei et al 2012 2013a numerically investigated the aerodynamic characteristics of a compound wig effect the compound wing was divided into two parts the middle part as the rectangular wing and the side parts were reverse taper wings with an anhedral angle they found that the compound wings significantly reduced the downwash velocity and modified the pressure distribution on the lower side which led to augmentation in lift force moreover the smaller distance between the wingtip of compound wings and the ground reduced the drag because of the weaker tip vortex jamei et al 2011 investigated the performance fuel consumption and environmental impact of the compound wing the lower drag of compound wings reduced the fuel consumption considerably relative to the rectangular wing the compound wing exhibited lesser co2 emissions some researchers numerically investigated different arrangements of the par system on wig craft yang and yang 2010 2011 the aerodynamics of flow around the wings with respect to the nozzle angle par engine in front of the wing was analyzed by yang and yang 2011 they found that at a certain nozzle angle the high speed jet flow from the par system on the upper surface of the wing caused an increment in the suction and the separation moved toward the trailing edge this is referred as to the coanda effect yang and yang 2012 also numerically investigated the aerodynamics of a wig effect with a tiltable endplate they found that a tiltable endplate could potentially increase the performance of wings in and out of ground effect researchers acknowledge that ground boundary layers have some effects on the aerodynamics of the wig effect yang yang and jia yang et al 2010a found a reduction of the effective height due to the rise of ground by using displacement thickness which caused an over estimation of ground effect a separation bubble was created on the ground when the ground was considered a fixed boundary this separation bubble rose with lower ground clearance and a higher angle of attack consequently the passageway of air flow was reduced which then reduced the ram effect leading to underestimation of the lift in addition the separation bubble caused the stagnation point to move towards the leading edge and then air flow on the upper surface of the wing gained higher energy with lower adverse pressure gradients as there was a delay in the separation at the trailing edge and stall angle yang et al 2010a in contrast yang lin and yang yang et al 2010b found that a separation bubble would be developed more by the ground level than by the angle of attack ying yang and yang ying et al 2010 demonstrated that the separation bubble disappears at a ground clearance value over 0 2 and the aerodynamic behaviour of the air flow on fixed ground was similar to moving ground yang and yang 2009 numerically investigated the effect of ground viscous effect in wig effect they found a negative lift coefficient and a rapid increase of drag coefficient with a small angle of attack aoa 4 at low ground clearance h c 0 1 at an angle of attack of 4 and different ground clearance values they reported a higher lift and lower drag for fixed ground compared to moving ground however this difference was reduced at higher ground clearance an experimental study was carried out on an airfoil section in a low turbulence wind tunnel with a moving ground model by ahmed takasaki and kohama ahmed et al 2007 they recorded the pressure distribution velocity and wake region of flow field over the airfoil surface lift and drag forces a fall of suction on the upper surface was shown when the airfoil moved towards the ground for all angles of attack the lift force dropped as the ground clearance decreased for a small angle of attack but improved for greater angles of attack by enhancing the pressure distribution on the pressure surface jamei et al 2014a 2014b numerically investigated the flow structure and aerodynamic coefficients of the compound wig effect for fixed and moving ground with respect to various ground clearances and reynolds numbers the lift and drag coefficients of the compound wing had some differences because the ground boundary layer was related to fixed ground as compared with moving ground at

were found to be affected by the ground boundary layer 2 cfd numerical study in this study a compound wing with an naca6409 airfoil section was employed for computational simulations the compound wing was divided into three main parts namely one rectangular wing in the middle and two reverse taper wings with an anhedral angle on the sides jamei et al 2012 the principal dimensions of the compound wings fig 1 are shown in tables 1 3 these numerical simulations catered for different design parameters including middle span size anhedral angle and taper ratio at ground clearance of 0 15 angle of attack of 4 and aspect ratio of 1 25 fixed and moving grounds were defined as two different ground boundary conditions ground level h was defined by the distance between the trailing edge of wings centre and ground surface the flow structure in the physical domain around the compound wings was assumed in a steady state and incompressible flow using a realizable k ε turbulent model the ansys

shown in fig 3 the computational domain was far from the compound wing to prevent blockage effects a no slip solid wall without roughness was defined for the compound wing ground surface and side walls of the physical domain a velocity inlet and a pressure outlet were utilized at the upstream and downstream of the domain respectively a second order upwind method was used for discretization of

has high quality facilities that allow for accuracy and repeatability of the experimental results alutm 2013 the drag coefficient and lift to drag ratio versus angle of attack of the compound wing are shown in fig 4 for fixed ground conditions at a ground clearance of 0 15 these figures depict computational and experimental simulations with a similar tendency the averages of errors for the drag coefficient and lift to drag ratio are 20 and 12 6 respectively nevertheless due to several uncertainties the numerical results reported minor alterations as compared to the experimental data jamei et al 2013b 2014c 2 2 boundary layers effects on pressure and velocity contours figs 5 8 illustrate the pressure and velocity distribution of the compound wing 8 for fixed and moving grounds at a ground clearance of 0 15 and an angle of attack of 4 fig 5 shows that the suction on the upper surface near the leading edge of compound wing 8 was higher for the moving ground as compared to the fixed ground the stagnation point shifted slightly to the lower surface of the compound wing for moving ground which caused a slightly higher pressure on the lower surface and higher suction on upper surface at the leading edge fig 6 there was high pressure in the flow passage between the lower side of the compound wing and the ground at the middle span for moving ground compared to fixed ground as shown in fig 6 due to the displacement thickness of the boundary layer which caused a vent effect the lower pressure area was progressively wider in the flow passage between the lower surface of the compound wing and fixed ground fig 7 shows a higher velocity in the flow passage under the compound wing for fixed ground which verifies that the ground viscous boundary layer increased the vent effect generally pressure leakage from the lower side to the upper side of the wingtip generates a tip vortex and spreads to the downstream flow field based on this tip vortex induced drag is produced the pressure distribution at the wingtip of compound wing 8 demonstrates that tip vortex is slightly stronger for moving ground condition compared to its fixed counterpart fig 8 as a consequence the induced drag was greater 2 3 parametric study on viscous ground effect the principal aerodynamic coefficients were determined with respect to different design parameters namely middle span size anhedral angle and taper ratio via fixed and moving ground as shown in figs 9 23 2 4 lift coefficient fig 9 illustrates the lift coefficient versus the middle span size bm of the compound wings table 1 at a ground clearance of 0 15 and an angle of attack of 4 for both fixed and moving ground for both ground conditions when the middle span size was increased the lift coefficient decreased accordingly the plot of the moving ground was higher compared to fixed ground but the difference between moving and fixed ground decreased by augmentation of the middle span size because at a smaller bm the side wing was greater and the wing tip was closer to the ground and thus faced a higher boundary layers effect for example for a bm of 75 mm and 125 mm the increments of the lift coefficient for moving ground related to fixed ground were 1 7 and 0 5 respectively the correlations of the anhedral angle a of the compound wings 4 8 tables 1and 2 and ground viscous effects are shown in fig 10 the lift coefficient plot for moving ground was lower than fixed ground at a smaller anhedral angle but it was greater for a higher anhedral angle the main reason is likely attributable to the venture effect between the compound wings and ground at different anheral angles the increments of the lift coefficient for moving ground related to fixed ground were 1 4 and 2 5 at anhedral angles of 0 and 15 respectively fig 11 illustrates that the ground viscous effect witnessed no change with respect to taper ratio λ of the compound wings 7 and 9 to 11 tables 2and3 the lift coefficient plot of moving ground was higher than that of fixed ground with a negligible variation in the gap between them 2 5 drag coefficient fig 12 shows a plot of drag coefficient versus the middle span size bm of the compound wings table 1 at a ground clearance of 0 15 and an angle of attack of 4 for fixed and moving ground for both ground conditions when the middle span size increased the drag coefficient slightly decreased the plot of moving ground was lower than that of fixed ground but the difference between moving and fixed ground gradually increased with the decrease of the middle span size this is because at a smaller bm the side wing is greater and the wing tip is closer to the ground thus the boundary layers affected the friction drag and induced drag for example for a bm of 75 mm and 125 mm the reductions of the drag coefficient for moving ground related to fixed ground were 4 9 and 3 5 respectively the relationships of the anhedral angle a of the compound wings 4 to 8 tables 1and2 and ground boundary layers are shown in fig 13 for both ground conditions the drag coefficient decreased when the anhedral angle increased moreover the drag coefficient plot for moving ground was lower than that of fixed ground for all anhedral angles but the gap increased when the anhedral angle increased according to pressure and velocity contours figs 6 and 7 these differences could be related to the enhancement of the pressure and viscous drag of the compound wing for the fixed ground condition as compared to its moving counterpart the reductions of the drag coefficient for moving ground related to fixed ground were 4 3 and 5 2 at anhedral angles of 0 and 15 respectively fig 14 clarifies that the effect of ground boundary layers reported a slight fluctuation with respect to taper ratio λ of the compound wings 7 and 9 to 11 tables 2and3 the drag coefficient plot of moving ground was lower than that of fixed ground but there was a small variation in the gap between them 2 6 lift to drag ratio fig 15 shows the plot of lift to drag ratio versus middle span size bm of the compound wings table 1 at a ground clearance of 0 15 and an angle of attack of 4 for both fixed and moving ground for both ground conditions when the middle span size is augmented the lift to drag ratio decreased the plot of fixed ground was lower than that of moving ground but the gap between moving and fixed ground diminished with an increase in the middle span size for example for a bm of 75 mm and 125 mm the increments of lift to drag ratio for moving ground related to fixed ground were 7 and 4 2 respectively fig 16 shows the plot of the influence of anhedral angle a of the compound wings 4 to 8 tables 1and2 on the ground viscous effect according to the figure the lift to drag ratio plot of moving ground was higher than that of fixed ground and the differences between them increased steadily when the anhedral angle increased the increments of lift to drag ratio for moving ground related to fixed ground were 3 and 8 1 at anhedral angles of 0 and 15 respectively fig 17 shows that the ground viscous effect had a slight variation with respect to taper ratio λ of the compound wings 7 and 9 to 11 tables 2and3 the lift to drag ratio plot of moving ground was higher than that of fixed ground with a small variation in the gap between them 2 7 moment coefficient fig 18 shows the plot of moment coefficient versus the middle span size bm of the compound wings table 1 at a ground clearance of 0 15 and an angle of attack of 4 for both fixed and moving ground here the nose down moment was defined as a positive moment for both ground conditions there was a fluctuation in the moment coefficient when the middle span size increased the plot of moving ground was higher than that of fixed ground but the differences between moving and fixed ground plots had a small variation with the enhancement of the middle span size for example for a bm of 75 mm and 112 5 mm the increments of moment coefficient for moving ground related to fixed ground were 1 6 and 1 4 respectively fig 19 shows the influence of the ground viscous effects on the moment coefficient of compound wings 4 to 8 tables 1and2 with respect to anhedral angle a according to the figure the moment coefficient of moving ground was almost similar to that of fixed ground at a small anhedral angle but greater for a higher anhedral angle in other words the nose down pitching moment was higher for moving ground the increments of the moment coefficient for moving ground related to fixed ground were 0 9 and 1 6 at anhedral angles of 9 5 and 15 respectively fig 20 shows that the moment coefficient of compound wings 7 and 9 to 11 tables 2and3 decreased when taper ratio λ increased for both ground conditions and the gap was nearly constant between the plots with respect to the taper ratio the lift coefficient plot of moving ground was higher than that of fixed ground in comparison with fixed ground the moment coefficient of moving ground increased by 1 2 8 centre of pressure figs 21 23 illustrate that there was a small difference in the position of the centre of pressure for fixed and moving ground though with similar design parameters the position of the centre of pressure was measured from the edge of the compound wings the highest gap existed between the plots of fixed and moving ground at a low anhedral angle fig 22 at an anhedral angle of 0 the increment of position of the centre of pressure with respect to moving ground was around 0 5 as compared to fixed ground the position of the centre of pressure was generally further from the edge of the compound wing for moving ground compared to all other design parameters 3 conclusion this study numerically investigated the principal aerodynamic coefficients of compound wings in ground effect for fixed and moving ground with respect to various design parameters including middle span size anhedral angle and taper ratio overall for moving ground the lift coefficient was greater while the drag coefficient was smaller as compared to fixed ground condition according to the results for both fixed and moving ground the middle span size and anhedral angle affect the ground boundary layers more than the taper ratio consequently the differences of lift and drag coefficients with and without ground boundary layers of the compound wings versus middle span size and anhedral angle are considerable additionally the corresponding variation in the lift to drag ratio of the compound wings is noticeable it was also found that the ground boundary layers have a slight effect on the moment coefficient and the centre of pressure with respect to all design parameters to conclude a correction factor is necessary to modify the experimental results for wind tunnels that have a fixed ground
